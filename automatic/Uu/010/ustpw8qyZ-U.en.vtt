see at the top there are these squares

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.139 
see at the top there are these squares
all<00:01:41.100> across<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:42.240> now<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:44.280> marked<00:01:44.970> down

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
all across here now I have marked down

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.590 
all across here now I have marked down
the<00:01:46.140> parts<00:01:46.939> how<00:01:47.939> long<00:01:48.240> they<00:01:48.479> are<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:50.570> you<00:01:51.570> just

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the parts how long they are and you just

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.719 
the parts how long they are and you just
have<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> make<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> squares<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:53.009> exactly

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
have to make the squares all exactly

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.230 
have to make the squares all exactly
just<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.119> long<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.659> made<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.850> now<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.000> seems

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
just as long as I made it now it seems

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300 
just as long as I made it now it seems
complicated<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:58.409> all<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.740> are<00:01:58.799> doing<00:01:58.890> is

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
complicated but all you are doing is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.399 
complicated but all you are doing is
just<00:01:59.369> using<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.969> ruler<00:02:00.270> measuring<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.020> drawing

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
just using a ruler measuring and drawing

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.410 
just using a ruler measuring and drawing
a<00:02:01.469> line<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.700> stay<00:02:02.820> with<00:02:03.000> me<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.180> okay

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
a line so just stay with me here okay

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.660 
a line so just stay with me here okay
first<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:07.079> make<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.680> big<00:02:07.979> long<00:02:08.399> line

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
first you make just a big long line

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.590 
first you make just a big long line
across<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:11.280> then

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
across and then

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.630 
across and then
want<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.780> make<00:02:11.930> these<00:02:12.290> marks<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.430> want<00:02:13.580> to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
want to make these marks you want to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.490 
want to make these marks you want to
make<00:02:15.280> marked<00:02:16.280> here<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:17.720> mark<00:02:17.960> right<00:02:18.140> here<00:02:18.170> as

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
make marked here so mark right here as

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.590 
make marked here so mark right here as
you<00:02:18.650> can<00:02:18.710> see<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:20.660> will<00:02:20.810> be<00:02:20.960> 2<00:02:21.380> inches<00:02:22.600> 2

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
you can see and that will be 2 inches 2

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.550 
you can see and that will be 2 inches 2
and<00:02:24.020> 13<00:02:25.270> 13<00:02:26.270> over<00:02:26.600> 16<00:02:27.080> inches<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:30.080> measure

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
and 13 13 over 16 inches so you measure

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.630 
and 13 13 over 16 inches so you measure
that<00:02:30.770> right<00:02:30.980> there<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.510> then<00:02:32.510> right<00:02:32.810> here

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
that right there and then right here

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.430 
that right there and then right here
it's<00:02:34.640> 1<00:02:35.210> and<00:02:35.450> 13<00:02:36.350> 16<00:02:37.070> inch<00:02:37.840> from<00:02:38.840> right<00:02:39.020> here

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
it's 1 and 13 16 inch from right here

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.180 
it's 1 and 13 16 inch from right here
right<00:02:40.430> here<00:02:40.460> and<00:02:41.200> then<00:02:42.200> this<00:02:42.680> little<00:02:42.890> spot

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
right here and then this little spot

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.430 
right here and then this little spot
here<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.640> just<00:02:43.820> 1/2<00:02:44.060> an<00:02:44.210> inch<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.230> want<00:02:45.380> to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
here is just 1/2 an inch so you want to

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.270 
here is just 1/2 an inch so you want to
put<00:02:45.560> dots<00:02:45.860> all<00:02:46.760> along<00:02:47.240> these<00:02:47.420> spots<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:49.220> is

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
put dots all along these spots this is

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.330 
put dots all along these spots this is
half<00:02:49.550> an<00:02:49.670> inch<00:02:49.820> over<00:02:49.970> here<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.440> 30<00:02:51.950> 1

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
half an inch over here and this is 30 1

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.500 
half an inch over here and this is 30 1
to<00:02:52.460> 13<00:02:52.850> 16<00:02:53.410> inches<00:02:54.410> right<00:02:54.650> here<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:55.910> 2<00:02:56.270> and

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
to 13 16 inches right here this is 2 and

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.460 
to 13 16 inches right here this is 2 and
1360<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.500> then<00:02:58.400> from<00:02:58.760> those<00:02:59.230> you<00:03:00.230> want<00:03:00.350> to

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
1360 and then from those you want to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.030 
1360 and then from those you want to
make<00:03:00.740> lines<00:03:01.100> going<00:03:01.640> down<00:03:02.470> all<00:03:03.470> those<00:03:03.740> spots

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
make lines going down all those spots

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.860 
make lines going down all those spots
and<00:03:05.030> each<00:03:05.270> line<00:03:05.570> will<00:03:06.050> be<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:07.250> length<00:03:07.520> of<00:03:07.870> our

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
and each line will be the length of our

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.040 
and each line will be the length of our
cells<00:03:09.230> over<00:03:09.350> here<00:03:09.470> which<00:03:09.770> is<00:03:09.980> 3<00:03:11.590> 11<00:03:12.590> 16<00:03:13.460> inches

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
cells over here which is 3 11 16 inches

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.510 
cells over here which is 3 11 16 inches
so<00:03:15.050> 3<00:03:15.410> 11<00:03:16.100> over<00:03:16.280> 16<00:03:17.320> that's<00:03:18.320> how<00:03:18.530> long<00:03:18.860> this<00:03:19.460> is

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
so 3 11 over 16 that's how long this is

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.480 
so 3 11 over 16 that's how long this is
from<00:03:19.880> right<00:03:20.030> here<00:03:20.860> from<00:03:21.860> right<00:03:22.010> here<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.280> right

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
from right here from right here to right

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.670 
from right here from right here to right
here<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:24.260> 3<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:24.920> 11<00:03:25.250> 16<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:27.470> want<00:03:27.620> to

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
here so 3 and 11 16 and you want to

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.650 
here so 3 and 11 16 and you want to
measure<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:28.100> down<00:03:28.400> from<00:03:28.640> each<00:03:28.880> dot<00:03:29.270> that<00:03:29.540> you

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
measure that down from each dot that you

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.160 
measure that down from each dot that you
put<00:03:29.840> up<00:03:29.930> here<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:31.300> then<00:03:32.300> you<00:03:32.510> want<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.720> draw<00:03:32.900> a

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
put up here and then you want to draw a

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.940 
put up here and then you want to draw a
line<00:03:33.530> all<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:34.160> way<00:03:34.190> across<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:35.770> now<00:03:36.770> right

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
line all the way across and now right

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.040 
line all the way across and now right
here<00:03:37.250> you're<00:03:37.490> just<00:03:37.610> making<00:03:37.910> more<00:03:38.090> boxes<00:03:38.600> you

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
here you're just making more boxes you

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.690 
here you're just making more boxes you
got<00:03:39.520> right<00:03:40.520> from<00:03:41.000> right<00:03:41.150> here<00:03:42.160> this<00:03:43.160> corner<00:03:43.460> to

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
got right from right here this corner to

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.350 
got right from right here this corner to
right<00:03:43.880> here<00:03:44.500> it's<00:03:45.500> one<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.400> thirteen<00:03:46.850> sixteen

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
right here it's one and thirteen sixteen

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.250 
right here it's one and thirteen sixteen
inch<00:03:47.830> so<00:03:48.830> just<00:03:49.040> make<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.400> line<00:03:49.670> on<00:03:50.630> both

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
inch so just make that line on both

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.130 
inch so just make that line on both
sides<00:03:51.680> right<00:03:52.010> here<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:53.360> then<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.870> draw<00:03:54.110> a

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
sides right here and then you draw a

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.430 
sides right here and then you draw a
line<00:03:54.440> across<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:56.360> then<00:03:56.480> from<00:03:56.690> right<00:03:56.840> here<00:03:57.230> to

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
line across and then from right here to

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.990 
line across and then from right here to
right<00:03:58.010> here<00:03:58.880> is<00:03:59.590> 3<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.950> 11<00:04:01.700> 16<00:04:02.690> inches<00:04:04.000> 311

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
right here is 3 and 11 16 inches 311

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.390 
right here is 3 and 11 16 inches 311
over<00:04:05.210> 16<00:04:05.630> which<00:04:05.840> is<00:04:06.320> the<00:04:06.470> same<00:04:06.770> as<00:04:06.980> right<00:04:07.250> up

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
over 16 which is the same as right up

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.500 
over 16 which is the same as right up
here<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:08.420> right<00:04:08.660> here<00:04:09.700> this<00:04:10.700> right<00:04:10.940> over<00:04:11.150> here

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
here to right here this right over here

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.090 
here to right here this right over here
so<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:12.560> make<00:04:12.800> that<00:04:13.040> on<00:04:13.250> both<00:04:13.640> sides<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:15.100> then

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
so you make that on both sides and then

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.320 
so you make that on both sides and then
you<00:04:16.420> draw<00:04:17.420> a<00:04:17.450> 1<00:04:18.460> then<00:04:19.460> you<00:04:19.580> draw<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:19.970> line

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
you draw a 1 then you draw the line

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.000 
you draw a 1 then you draw the line
across<00:04:20.600> right<00:04:20.900> here

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
across right here

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.300 
across right here
and<00:04:22.100> then<00:04:22.810> this<00:04:23.810> is<00:04:23.990> kind<00:04:24.230> of<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.710> hard<00:04:25.010> part

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
and then this is kind of the hard part

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.710 
and then this is kind of the hard part
apart<00:04:25.850> now<00:04:27.190> from<00:04:28.190> right<00:04:28.370> here<00:04:29.200> you<00:04:30.200> go<00:04:30.380> down

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
apart now from right here you go down

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.320 
apart now from right here you go down
right<00:04:32.720> here<00:04:32.990> so<00:04:34.090> which<00:04:35.090> is<00:04:35.300> 1<00:04:36.170> +<00:04:36.530> 14<00:04:37.340> /<00:04:37.610> 16th<00:04:38.150> of

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
right here so which is 1 + 14 / 16th of

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.830 
right here so which is 1 + 14 / 16th of
an<00:04:38.540> inch<00:04:38.980> it's<00:04:39.980> really<00:04:40.610> really<00:04:41.090> precise<00:04:41.510> on

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
an inch it's really really precise on

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.780 
an inch it's really really precise on
drawing<00:04:42.410> these<00:04:42.560> lines<00:04:42.620> because<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:43.460> will<00:04:43.610> help

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
drawing these lines because it will help

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.940 
drawing these lines because it will help
your<00:04:44.150> deck<00:04:44.330> box<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.970> 1<00:04:46.970> +<00:04:47.240> 14<00:04:47.720> /<00:04:47.930> 16<00:04:48.410> right<00:04:48.680> here

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
your deck box so 1 + 14 / 16 right here

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.360 
your deck box so 1 + 14 / 16 right here
the<00:04:49.400> line<00:04:49.550> going<00:04:49.850> down<00:04:49.880> yet<00:04:50.720> 1<00:04:50.960> +<00:04:51.290> 14<00:04:52.100> or<00:04:52.220> 16

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
the line going down yet 1 + 14 or 16

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.730 
the line going down yet 1 + 14 or 16
right<00:04:52.760> over<00:04:52.970> here<00:04:53.120> -<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.540> then<00:04:54.260> you<00:04:54.350> draw<00:04:54.620> all

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
right over here - and then you draw all

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.530 
right over here - and then you draw all
the<00:04:54.890> line<00:04:55.040> across<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:56.000> it's<00:04:56.150> basically<00:04:56.450> just

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
the line across so it's basically just

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.360 
the line across so it's basically just
the<00:04:56.810> box<00:04:57.050> right<00:04:57.350> here<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:58.450> then<00:04:59.450> from<00:05:00.370> these

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
the box right here and then from these

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.150 
the box right here and then from these
two<00:05:01.760> spots<00:05:02.030> right<00:05:02.360> here<00:05:03.940> you'll<00:05:04.940> draw<00:05:05.240> down

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
two spots right here you'll draw down

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.770 
two spots right here you'll draw down
right<00:05:07.160> here<00:05:07.490> which<00:05:08.480> is<00:05:08.710> 1<00:05:09.710> +<00:05:09.890> 13<00:05:10.280> /<00:05:10.460> 16<00:05:11.000> of<00:05:11.630> an

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
right here which is 1 + 13 / 16 of an

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.180 
right here which is 1 + 13 / 16 of an
inch<00:05:11.960> so<00:05:12.290> one<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.950> 13<00:05:13.520> over<00:05:13.760> 16<00:05:14.240> so<00:05:15.190> right

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
inch so one of the 13 over 16 so right

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.340 
inch so one of the 13 over 16 so right
there<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.820> then<00:05:17.060> you<00:05:17.720> connect<00:05:18.050> them<00:05:18.170> right

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
there and then you connect them right

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.790 
there and then you connect them right
here<00:05:18.500> at<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:18.680> block<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.570> then<00:05:20.620> you're<00:05:21.620> going

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
here at the block and then you're going

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.300 
here at the block and then you're going
to<00:05:21.890> go<00:05:22.370> back<00:05:22.580> up<00:05:22.760> to<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:23.030> X<00:05:23.150> corners<00:05:23.540> and<00:05:24.310> draw

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
to go back up to the X corners and draw

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.700 
to go back up to the X corners and draw
going<00:05:25.730> out<00:05:25.940> lines<00:05:26.540> that's<00:05:27.110> 1<00:05:28.040> and<00:05:28.370> 14<00:05:28.790> /<00:05:29.030> 16

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
going out lines that's 1 and 14 / 16

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.970 
going out lines that's 1 and 14 / 16
inches<00:05:30.710> so<00:05:31.670> that's<00:05:31.880> one<00:05:32.270> 14<00:05:32.990> over<00:05:33.230> 16<00:05:33.680> from

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
inches so that's one 14 over 16 from

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.030 
inches so that's one 14 over 16 from
from<00:05:34.790> this<00:05:35.090> corner<00:05:35.150> right<00:05:35.540> here<00:05:35.600> -<00:05:36.500> right<00:05:36.710> this

over here 1 and 14 or 16 director draw

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.190 
over here 1 and 14 or 16 director draw
that<00:05:43.340> line<00:05:43.610> so<00:05:44.120> basically<00:05:44.600> drawn<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.050> line

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
that line so basically drawn the line

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.000 
that line so basically drawn the line
all<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:45.740> way<00:05:45.770> across<00:05:45.950> here<00:05:46.400> and<00:05:47.470> now<00:05:48.730> you<00:05:49.730> draw

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.620 
here right there and then you see you
have<00:06:49.170> lines<00:06:49.890> going<00:06:50.250> from<00:06:50.340> right<00:06:50.580> here<00:06:50.820> down

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
have lines going from right here down

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.590 
have lines going from right here down
right<00:06:51.660> there<00:06:52.260> all<00:06:52.770> it<00:06:53.070> is<00:06:53.160> is<00:06:53.490> from<00:06:53.790> these<00:06:54.060> two

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
right there all it is is from these two

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.360 
right there all it is is from these two
corners<00:06:55.050> right<00:06:55.260> here<00:06:55.580> you<00:06:56.580> measured<00:06:57.060> down<00:06:58.370> 7/8

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
corners right here you measured down 7/8

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.370 
corners right here you measured down 7/8
of<00:06:59.670> an<00:06:59.760> inch<00:06:59.910> both<00:07:00.780> sides

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
of an inch both sides

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.430 
of an inch both sides
so<00:07:02.070> from<00:07:02.340> these<00:07:02.550> two<00:07:02.610> quarters<00:07:03.200> right<00:07:04.200> here

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
so from these two quarters right here

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.520 
so from these two quarters right here
you're<00:07:05.130> down<00:07:06.680> 7/8<00:07:07.680> inch<00:07:08.130> mark<00:07:08.700> the<00:07:08.880> spot<00:07:09.180> and

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
you're down 7/8 inch mark the spot and

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.110 
you're down 7/8 inch mark the spot and
then<00:07:10.530> you<00:07:10.680> just<00:07:10.890> draw<00:07:11.100> a<00:07:11.130> line<00:07:11.430> from<00:07:11.670> those<00:07:11.910> two

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 
then you just draw a line from those two

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.630 
then you just draw a line from those two
marks<00:07:12.450> down<00:07:13.320> to<00:07:14.040> these<00:07:14.220> two<00:07:14.460> corners<00:07:14.730> record

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:16.640 
marks down to these two corners record

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:23.600 
marks down to these two corners record
and<00:07:17.640> that's<00:07:18.480> all<00:07:18.810> you<00:07:18.960> do<00:07:19.110> guys<00:07:20.900> so<00:07:22.220> it's<00:07:23.220> it's

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
and that's all you do guys so it's it's

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.190 
and that's all you do guys so it's it's
not<00:07:23.880> that<00:07:23.940> hard<00:07:24.390> you<00:07:24.510> just<00:07:24.600> got<00:07:24.870> to<00:07:24.960> draw<00:07:25.140> the

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
not that hard you just got to draw the

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.250 
not that hard you just got to draw the
lines<00:07:25.530> and<00:07:26.060> pause<00:07:27.060> the<00:07:27.300> video<00:07:27.570> if<00:07:27.750> you<00:07:27.870> have<00:07:27.990> to

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.260 
lines and pause the video if you have to

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.170 
lines and pause the video if you have to
and<00:07:28.560> rewind<00:07:29.460> and<00:07:29.730> listen<00:07:29.790> to<00:07:30.120> the

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
and rewind and listen to the

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.640 
and rewind and listen to the
measurements<00:07:32.720> kind<00:07:33.720> of<00:07:33.870> put<00:07:34.110> it<00:07:34.260> where<00:07:34.560> you

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:34.650 
measurements kind of put it where you

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:46.610 
measurements kind of put it where you
can<00:07:34.800> see<00:07:35.160> it'll<00:07:37.190> see<00:07:38.190> up<00:07:38.370> there<00:07:45.440> okay<00:07:46.440> I'm

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.620 
can see it'll see up there okay I'm
