00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:10.570
 well that's a DNA test x 600 of 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.719
 edenor using it as with the interface 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.560
 that has integrated 4x4 using it with 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:22.080
 Both vinyl of tractors class pro and 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.080
 let's see how we can see how 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.199
 we go to the preferences so that we 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.199
 we make sure 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:38.480
 we see we are using it the driver that already 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.480
 it has the gym included 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.480
 here is what we have it in as a method 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.480
 external 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.800
 we are entering love 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.140
 in these two in these two central 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.630
 where I have both the turntables with 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.200
 the time coach 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.200
 and said 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.449
 and there it is 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.500
 now I only have the channel ringing 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.140
 A.M 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.600
 and good for us to make sure we're going to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.650
 see him 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.650
 and here is the one of honor 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.380
 a scratch vector 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:28.500
 I have in absolute mode that responds 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.430
 pretty good 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.430
 i 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.270
 Y 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.270
 look at the start 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.600
 slower 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.010
 fights 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.680
 now I do not have I'm not using 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.580
 no other interface is but the plate 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.580
 audio that brings the no 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.950
 that is already integrated 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.530
 the alien effects 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.300
 and now also measures the bpm 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.900
 and now we have the bm of the song 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.900
 although it is sounding 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.100
 now important is that all these 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.430
 surfaces meade and we can also 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.710
 map and also brings in fact already then 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.810
 it does not include a mapping that 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.810
 fact is horrible but 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.810
 Y 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.990
 and then we are also seeing 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.890
 so we can see how it is 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.890
 running tight 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.100
 here 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.720
 do not 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.379
