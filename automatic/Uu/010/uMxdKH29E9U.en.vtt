 how to go to the two guys but there is already a 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.460
 acquisition for playstation 4 instead of 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.580
 phil 4 in which this patch goes to 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.200
 prevent that good cachero game that 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.240

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.070
 total not so that I'm fucking and 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.020
 they are also going to repair some bugs and 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.330
 things that have suddenly been 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.600
 happening in battlefield 4 for 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.430
 playstation 4 for xbox I do not think not up 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.739
 now there is nothing for xbox but this is going 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.080
 first for the playstation people like this 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.600

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.810
 playstation 4 draws and 4 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.660
 obviously not so I asked if to 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.520
 those of xbox when it will come out it seems that 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.370
 will have to wait but you have to 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.510
 remember that the people of xbox one go 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.390
 to now have the scoop of 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.490
 battlefield what does this mean 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.800
 in rendering three we had first fruits 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.870
 combat filtres now in the xbox one 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.170
 they will have the first fruits so I 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.750
 It suits me to buy me battlefield 4 in 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.819

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.720
