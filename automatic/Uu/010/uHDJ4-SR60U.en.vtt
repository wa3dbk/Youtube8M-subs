underneath and the flip cover hold it
down<00:00:59.670> that's<00:01:00.090> why<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.390> pried<00:01:00.660> from<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.020> top

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
down that's why we pried from the top

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.640 
down that's why we pried from the top
side<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:03.020> it's<00:01:04.020> a<00:01:04.080> light<00:01:06.080> that<00:01:07.080> covers
