00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.480
 Hello everyone, hello today I want 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.179
 talk to you about water quality 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.310
 which we drink which we buy from 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.890
 someone and opportunity as an alternative 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:25.580
 produced the purest water here 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.460
 recently bought sebek water here 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.730
 a can 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.110
 That turned out to suck in this 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.110
 water after this water 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.290
 terrible raid was it I erased here 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:50.690
 it turns out the water is picking up just stupidly from 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:54.680
 under the crane and sell for a lot of money 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:58.699
 so I decided to try to make 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.760
 small filter so to speak 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:08.990
 even earlier I spilled tap water 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:12.840
 through a simple watering can and a record filled 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.220
 cotton wool and there was a risk big result 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.150
 2 then through a few 3-liter parts 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.140
 became yellow and with a touch of garbage and 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.070
 dirt so i want to show you 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:34.560
 I bought a small filter coal 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:39.750
 activated by took four packs here 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:45.080
 try so first layer we then 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.080
 do vatu strongly do not hammer with cotton 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.100
 this pipe itself 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.170
 bonus because it will then have eaten flow 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:04.950
 you'll even dig here 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:07.260
 put it turns out cotton and we put a 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.630
 Coal tablets tried to lay out 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:17.300
 they are supposed to filter normally 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.300
 we can also have another layer of cotton 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.310
 simpletons and 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.940
 you can put there took 6 tables they 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.569

00:02:42.940 --> 00:03:35.500
 layer make level still lay down 16 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:03:42.519
 pills elephant is now like this 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:45.130
 This business can be put price packs 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.739

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.310
 hryvnia 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:55.780
 here are 10 pieces so maybe i read 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:04:01.540
 You can also make filters from coal by 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:03.569
 birches here therefore well yes here already 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.370
 more 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.840
 diameter so you have to report back 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.840
 a little more there is not 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:49.240
 what will be a two-layer coal 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.240
 filter 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:05:05.330
 I read the ancient seasons 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:10.180
 sand filtered with coal so now 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.180
 you can put another thin layer of cotton 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.280
 so but here vata now put could glad 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.280

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:12.479
 from that temple and here we try 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.479
 to filter 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:37.520
