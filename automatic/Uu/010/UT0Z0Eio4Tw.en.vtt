00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.050 
get through the woods but the only thing
about<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:28.860> is<00:03:29.100> how<00:03:29.460> I<00:03:29.490> said<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:29.940> have

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
about this is how I said you have

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.700 
about this is how I said you have
infinite<00:03:30.300> ammo<00:03:30.450> but<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.410> don't<00:03:31.590> have

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
infinite ammo but you don't have

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.560 
infinite ammo but you don't have
infinite<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.340> um<00:03:34.040> grenades<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.570> throwing

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
infinite like um grenades of throwing

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.790 
infinite like um grenades of throwing
knives<00:03:36.750> Smollett<00:03:37.410> hauls<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.160> bait<00:03:39.410> but<00:03:40.410> for

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
knives Smollett hauls and bait but for

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.290 
knives Smollett hauls and bait but for
like<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.100> mines<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.580> c4

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
like the mines and the c4

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.270 
like the mines and the c4
don't<00:03:42.690> throw<00:03:42.900> out<00:03:43.020> three<00:03:43.290> throw<00:03:43.500> out<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.920> max

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
don't throw out three throw out to max

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.530 
don't throw out three throw out to max
or<00:03:44.520> because<00:03:44.730> if<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:44.910> throw<00:03:45.000> out<00:03:45.060> three<00:03:45.390> they

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
or because if you throw out three they

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.600 
or because if you throw out three they
might<00:03:45.720> go<00:03:45.870> away<00:03:45.990> and<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:47.040> really<00:03:47.280> won't<00:03:47.460> be

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
might go away and it really won't be

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.000 
might go away and it really won't be
infinite<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.150> if<00:03:48.210> you<00:03:48.330> just<00:03:48.480> have<00:03:48.660> two<00:03:49.110> out<00:03:49.350> you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
infinite so if you just have two out you

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.560 
infinite so if you just have two out you
blow<00:03:50.250> up<00:03:50.460> you'll<00:03:50.610> still<00:03:50.850> have<00:03:50.970> infinite<00:03:51.390> just

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
blow up you'll still have infinite just

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.230 
blow up you'll still have infinite just
don't<00:03:51.750> do<00:03:51.900> three<00:03:52.460> unless<00:03:53.460> you<00:03:53.670> have<00:03:53.880> that

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
don't do three unless you have that

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.370 
don't do three unless you have that
upgrade<00:03:54.810> just<00:03:55.470> don't<00:03:55.740> go<00:03:55.860> over<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:57.540> limit

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
upgrade just don't go over the limit

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.500 
upgrade just don't go over the limit
that<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.770> can<00:03:58.980> actually<00:03:59.160> go<00:03:59.460> so<00:04:00.120> like<00:04:00.270> if<00:04:00.480> you

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
that you can actually go so like if you

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.900 
that you can actually go so like if you
have<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:01.170> next<00:04:01.380> upgrade<00:04:01.680> after<00:04:01.830> three<00:04:02.250> you

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
have the next upgrade after three you

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.160 
have the next upgrade after three you
can<00:04:03.090> put<00:04:03.270> down<00:04:03.390> three<00:04:03.630> doesn't<00:04:04.020> matter

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
can put down three doesn't matter

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.360 
can put down three doesn't matter
because<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:05.280> next<00:04:05.550> upgrade<00:04:05.700> is<00:04:06.030> five<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.720> think

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
because the next upgrade is five I think

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.270 
because the next upgrade is five I think
okay<00:04:08.370> as<00:04:08.550> you<00:04:09.510> can<00:04:09.540> see<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:12.180> mods<00:04:12.920> are<00:04:13.920> not
