 We're back and now you're going. 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.030
 know a property that is 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.099
 reference in milk production in the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.780
 extreme west of Santa Catarina 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.529
 our team went to the municipality of 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.950
 Tunápolis and visited the family will be the 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.710
 example of caprice and good results 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.529
 and see only in addition to producing milk they 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.570
 they achieve a boost in income with 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.700
 the creation of the third 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.000
 the project is played by the son of 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.640
 farmer 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.370
 The Bionic producer goes his son michael 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.250
 they form a strong double in the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.720
 dairy farms in the far west of 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.480
 Santa Catarina 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.850
 they live in the community line 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.010
 near the city of tunápolis 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.440
 on the border with the province of missions 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.079
 in Argentine 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.140
 after devoting himself for a long time 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.980
 pigs, the family will choose or 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.500
 working with milk production is 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.760
 satisfied with the changes the herd is 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.250
 formed by 40 cows of the breed jersey 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.390
 small but they guarantee good production 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.880
 are almost 20 thousand liters of milk per month 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.360
 all this is the fruit of the work of the 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.350
 caprice and technological advances 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.909
 applied in this beautiful property 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.190
 this is one of the best herds 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.380
 genetic quality in the municipality of 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.619
 tunápolis in the west end of santa 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.200
 catarina and every year the jersey cows go 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.840
 being improved which results in better 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.510
 production of milk in front of 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.820
 work on the property of the vais 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.590
 we found the maicon that will show us 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:54.340
 how is the creation of third parties here 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.590
 there are only ports where the cows stay in 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:03.939
 around 14 days before delivery until 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:09.220
 give the spokesman stay in here 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:12.069
 receive special feed silage sound place 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.570
 well where she was comfortable and with 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.840
 shadow 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:23.080
 it is enough there, from here to our heifer 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:28.150
 and taken to this little house where she has 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:31.310
 shade and a well-cleaned environment 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.780
 on the beaten floor they have no floor to walk 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.800
 humidity when it will earn is milk and 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.770
 All right. 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.160
 well there it adapts to the environment that it 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.620
 go live life there it's out in the sun or 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.960
 in the rain and also has an area here as 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.370
 if you can see is a small is more or 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.250
 less than 100 square meters with a 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.380
 perennial pasture where this tap from 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.390
 the first few days already have contact with the 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.700
 pasture that will then stimulate the entire 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.300
 flora ruminal digestive system it 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.130
 future 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.320
 this system is so 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.510
 by the beach of individual 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.280
 this area here is best suited for 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.040
 our region for our business 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.290
 here is in the production system based on 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.880
 perennial pasture and it reaches the 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.060
 receive some kind of milk in a 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.480
 milk bottle milk in the bottle of 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:26.000
 morning and evening of 2 liters and the 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:28.400
 night two liters logical encompasses so is 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.660
 very new in the most greedy action when 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.020
 are younger 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.700
 this milk needs to be the mother's milk 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.540
 especially the first five days is 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.720
 good mothering is not essential to oneself 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:47.510
 growth to her farm training 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:51.830
 without giving a little bit 1135 is so 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:55.820
 important in bonn which is the second phase 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:04:00.980
 of heifers where they enter 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:03.650
 with 70 75 days up to 16 days entities 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:08.150
 they stay here as needed 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.870
 that the feed of grain and hay 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:15.950
 and mineral they continue to grow 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:19.130
 As they come to Maicon, they have 24 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.430
 years old the young producer with 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.830
 entrepreneur the focus of his work on 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.050
 breeding of high standard calves 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.569
 genetic target 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.729
 is to replenish the squad and serve a market 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:35.770
 Of region 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:38.990
 here the third situation is in the 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.770
 third stage of creation where they 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:47.509
 they are 120 days old they stay around 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:52.009
 from US 180 200 up to approximately 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:55.129
 they weigh 200 kilos - they are 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:57.979
 here in these pt only has opening for 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.759
 and there is a region between the 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.889
 small 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.969
 what are the main care in this 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.370
 maicon stage 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:08.449
 in this stage the main care is 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.490
 and careful 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.490
 food is the one that has to be 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.699
 feed quality 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:21.319
 here are the doubts in the step on Wednesday 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:23.169
 that they are at a level of 15 to 16 17 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:25.940
 months old 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:31.669
 some are already taught students are 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:36.050
 being taught heifers who are 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:38.870
 being taught to walk on good stretchers 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.620
 Here the final step of the process 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.960
 young heifers almost ready for 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.449
 how long did it take to get to 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.620
 this phase of work michael these 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:55.340
 doubts are around 22 23 months of 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.479
 age and a princess and five six months 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.210
 from prince 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.830
 they are giving a little more than 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.949
 two years until I quit 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.740
 we used to say that there will be today 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:09.409
 and the cow is tomorrow so if she is well 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.259
 created well-conducted gave from the beginning 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:14.810
 She's going to give a cow with excellent 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:16.669
 productive potential right 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.159
 in the future it will be able to stay 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.060
 for many years within the 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.279
 activity 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:26.240
 the parents' property is small 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:28.819
 little more than 18 hectares but thanks to 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.319
 milk production creation of having socks 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:35.389
 the yield is very good you intend 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:38.820
 sell up to as many heifers as 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:41.970
 year you already have an idea 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.740
 but at least 10 per year 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.380
 how much is a heifer that you already 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.500
 comes disseminated or see beach between 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.820
 five and six months around 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.430
 four thousand to five thousand reais depending 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.290
 of genetics in the video 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.730
 this will already give you a more 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.580
 here in the championship as a young 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:04.140
 farmer this ends up being attractive 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:07.230
 Yes, they are certainly an extra attraction. 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:11.520
 that you have out of the milk gamenses class 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:14.460
 and the heifers you sell when she 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.710
 left over or when you need financial 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.660
 That's a good option, right? And the father is the mother. 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:22.560
 how are you feeling in relation 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:24.420
 the child to this project of his life 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.580
 Ah I really like it because he is 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.440
 staying with us here because it is giving 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.570
 continuity of ownership because with the 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.550
 future right because I also assume 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:35.850
 parent property is a property is 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.530
 already may be in this case is not the 

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.900
 I'm very happy because he 's 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.730
 getting away with giving this a spider 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.740
 with the creation of cores right 

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.450
 I'm very happy with her so I 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.690
 proud with my son who is 

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:50.880
 assuming that you are helping to make the 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:54.240
 things here today technology 

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:57.060
 It is already well advanced that we no longer 

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.130
 accompanies more like them the company nor 

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.290
 You need your new people to 

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:04.100
 help things do or do 

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.100
 to function
