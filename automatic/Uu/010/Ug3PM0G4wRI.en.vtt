00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.969
 good morning there are many myths about 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.860
 volume of what are made of pointe shoes alone 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.349
 believe that ballerinas wear big 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.750
 toes special caps others 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.789
 that in our socks pointe shoes is a cork from 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.680
 under the champagne and some at all 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.560
 think ballet shoes are 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.449
 a plaster cast of the dancer's legs 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.480
 in fact, everything is different 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.640
 much more interesting today we learn from 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.600
 what plan are you made after all we are 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.489
 at the factory by their production like 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.640
 many years ago almost everything is done 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.640
 manually 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.270
 The first step in the creation of shoes grinding 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.400
 skeleton pads on which to build 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.490
 turbine alexander ivanovich who 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.010
 produces 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.530
 pain blame comes to us in the enterprise with 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.580
 she takes her measurements are made measurements and 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.490
 with help 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.250
 taken measurements already done pad she 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.540
 either grinded or unstuck to 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.540
 skin legs care 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.290
 here is for example a ballerina's shoe 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.240
 zakharov 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.610
 this 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.380
 one of our most famous galibin 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.509
 work lives than 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.490
 beginner lina often just do 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.350
 shoes on the pads of some famous 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.350
 bluntly say happiness brings 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.869
 Well, we are going to the cutting 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:35.789
 workshop where the work goes on up 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.189
 Here on such a huge table is done 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.100
 fabric base plant ready flooring 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.640
 It consists of 20 layers of tissue to which the same 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.689
 so much this amount sure about 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.789
 depending on our equipment and about 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.569
 amount dropped that is calculated exactly 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.909
 for a loan 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.380
 any increase leads somehow 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.969
 production problems what kind of fabric 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.969
 used to produce a plan 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.420
 work 1 is a very big goal we 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.810
 we use portrait fabric 5 severe 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.810
 songs 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.420
 on the top layer of the flooring such to 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.420
 it is awkward for the order to cut into detail 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.290
 By the way the matrix is well-established opinion that 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.600
 all valery should be a little leg 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.050
 It is worth noting that today the most popular 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.690
 size about 39 are present 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.200
 there are really trends 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.200
 by force 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.500
 remember that then 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.180
 of science 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.990
 by the way recently received an order for 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.260
 making it 44 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.260
 can demonstrate 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.010
 with cooking 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.010
 so sung kass 32 size 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.420
 during the magician and the master call will be at 2 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.569
 lip from another workshop is working on 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.239
 the details are not in your circle 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.999
 these people we call scars barrier 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.879
 what is our job my job 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:21.980
 made up 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:25.629
 basic details of a visa for a plant a little longer 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.639
 and insoles used for this cheprak 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.989
 genuine leather specially 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.989
 cooked for abone 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.969
 graceful and fragile-looking thing is 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.430
 out of 54 of the parts they manufacture one 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.349
 couples an experienced master spends 40 45 minutes 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.270
 having done more than 100 operations 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.940
 By the way do you know that in ballet shoes 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.010
 builds concepts of right and left foot well well 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.270
 that's why it happened we will tell 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.270
 you only our next power up 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.790
 good morning in the first part of our story 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.370
 we made all the parts for the plant and 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.410
 asked the intriguing question why in 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.390
 ballet shoes and there is a concept 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.550
 right and left feet ballet slippers 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.130
 born a long time ago when 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.019
 few people know about this shoe 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.440
 on the left and right foot was done with 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.460
 absolutely this tradition has been preserved 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.030
 be sick to this day 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.660
 besides in this ride ballerina special 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.880
 convenience 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.100
 the fact is that either the left or the right 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.260
 his leg is jogging and on one of 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.450
 man impeller wear before so 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.210
 how can we change this salad with us two 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.320
 Curiously times what with this mind 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.390
 mass production 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.669
 making kuan is not a conveyor 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.840
 assembling each pair from the initial stage 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.010
 to the last stitch 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.780
 engaged one master hammer and eye 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.090
 waxed thread that's the whole tool 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:05:01.910
 and conjures over plan to me direct 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:04.910
 sense on the knee using needles and threads 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.910
 the details 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.309
 the main secret bulat box 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.529
 which by faith on can stand on 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:27.719
 fingers what strength should this be 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:29.849
 detail to withstand landing let 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.889
 and air but not at all weightless 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.699
 beauties 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.219
 the box represents 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.629
 layered like grodno celebrations layers 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:39.689
 different types yes not 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:42.319
 bonded special secrets of people 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:42.319
 come on 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:51.020
 yourself the only purchase to what's this 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:53.330
 We pass the laboratory checks for strength 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.030
 it is generally a serious scientific work 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.250
 besides this we also attracted scientists 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.500
 in order to make the pointe shoes noiseless 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.480
 u probably noticed when 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.260
 ballerina run out at the price is distributed 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.980
 the cup as if cavalry leaves 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.580
 squadron 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.590
 so we wanted to avoid it and attracted 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.050
 scientists from the institute in one of the ideas 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.850
 quantum saw almost ready but 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.490
 it's not right now the master is getting down 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:26.120
 the process of forming boxes and. 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:29.580
 And now I will show you the focus if you put 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:33.060
 ready charge per flank 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:36.689
 she will keep balance if 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:39.509
 Ponts pads are on the patch 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:40.139
 that means the ballerina is becoming 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.889
 piglet 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:46.080
 spends a minimum of physical effort 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:47.759
 combine league 7 litters waste it 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.129
 accounts for the performance and a lot 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:55.080
 if we can help her at least with this 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:57.150
 well, finally the last stage of production 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.490
 pointe shoes copes special camera 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.190
 where at 45 degrees they 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.810
 dried for 12 hours and only 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:09.180
 after that the shoes take 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:11.400
 final shape and size only 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.919
 one performance ballerina can change 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.379
 three pairs of shoes for the season actively 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:18.900
 serving right from our it about 200 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:19.379
 won't be a creative biography of Galina 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.990
 ulanova 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:24.210
 about 30 years old and my you 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.520
 mesh and bones can do yourself 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.349
 count and if this theater 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.689
 begins with a hanger that probably 

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:34.250
 it is fair to say that this 

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:34.250
 ballet begins with a plan
