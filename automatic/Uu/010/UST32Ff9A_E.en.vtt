as dr. Salter phrased it joints were
meant<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.540> move<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.080> when<00:00:04.470> you<00:00:04.560> are

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.110 
recovering from joint injury or surgery
it<00:00:07.259> has<00:00:07.740> been<00:00:07.919> clinically<00:00:08.280> demonstrated<00:00:09.030> that

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
it has been clinically demonstrated that

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.209 
it has been clinically demonstrated that
immobilization<00:00:10.019> inhibits<00:00:10.559> circulation

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
immobilization inhibits circulation

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.549 
immobilization inhibits circulation
which<00:00:11.910> slows<00:00:12.179> down<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.660> recovery<00:00:12.929> time<00:00:13.320> and

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
which slows down the recovery time and

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.359 
which slows down the recovery time and
healing<00:00:13.860> process<00:00:14.299> studies<00:00:15.299> also<00:00:15.719> reveal<00:00:16.109> that

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
immobilization promotes the development

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.750 
immobilization promotes the development
