strategy yeah well talk to us about the
saber<00:00:58.559> first<00:00:59.010> pick<00:00:59.250> because<00:00:59.430> that's<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.790> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
saber first pick because that's not a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.910 
saber first pick because that's not a
very<00:01:00.059> common<00:01:00.480> first<00:01:01.019> pick<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.379> LCS<00:01:01.739> but

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
very common first pick in the LCS but

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.049 
very common first pick in the LCS but
your<00:01:02.040> composition<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.640> probably<00:01:02.879> based

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
your composition was probably based

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.030 
your composition was probably based
around<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.390> yes<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.379> separate<00:01:04.620> right<00:01:04.769> now<00:01:04.860> is

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
around it yes so separate right now is

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.850 
around it yes so separate right now is
one<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> most<00:01:06.060> o<00:01:06.240> P<00:01:06.390> heroes<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.840> think<00:01:07.110> just

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
one of the most o P heroes I think just

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.740 
one of the most o P heroes I think just
because<00:01:07.950> our<00:01:08.100> altius<00:01:08.490> was<00:01:08.640> its<00:01:08.909> she<00:01:09.600> just

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
because our altius was its she just

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.149 
because our altius was its she just
makes<00:01:09.840> your<00:01:10.020> whole<00:01:10.200> team<00:01:10.350> run<00:01:10.530> super<00:01:10.680> fast<00:01:10.770> man

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

in bot Lane we just got the advantage
there<00:01:39.359> and<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:40.409> other<00:01:40.710> lanes<00:01:40.920> beside<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> bot

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
there and all other lanes beside the bot

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
Lane was like kind of even or better and

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.440 
Lane was like kind of even or better and
we<00:01:44.310> knew<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.430> if<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.939> go<00:01:45.060> into<00:01:45.359> the

tower there might be a chance that the

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.840 
tower there might be a chance that the

wrong target get focused by the tower or

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.880 
wrong target get focused by the tower or
we<00:04:21.940> lose<00:04:22.060> our<00:04:22.270> carries<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:22.870> could<00:04:23.590> like

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
we lose our carries and it could like

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.650 
we lose our carries and it could like
maybe<00:04:24.520> turn<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:24.910> game<00:04:25.060> around<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.450> that's

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
maybe turn the game around and that's

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.600 
maybe turn the game around and that's
why<00:04:25.990> we<00:04:26.290> just<00:04:26.560> decided<00:04:26.890> to<00:04:27.040> play<00:04:27.190> it<00:04:27.220> safe<00:04:27.280> this

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
why we just decided to play it safe this

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.400 
why we just decided to play it safe this
game<00:04:27.670> one<00:04:28.510> thing<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:28.720> have<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:28.960> touch<00:04:29.110> on<00:04:29.290> the

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
game one thing I have to touch on the

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.050 
game one thing I have to touch on the
link<00:04:29.620> your<00:04:29.830> two<00:04:30.160> games<00:04:30.370> back<00:04:30.550> in<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.760> mid<00:04:30.910> lane

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
link your two games back in the mid lane

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.030 
link your two games back in the mid lane
you've<00:04:31.240> absolutely<00:04:31.480> crushed<00:04:32.380> in<00:04:32.650> both<00:04:32.860> of

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
you've absolutely crushed in both of

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.160 
you've absolutely crushed in both of
them<00:04:33.190> do<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.000> feel<00:04:34.330> any<00:04:34.630> resentment<00:04:34.960> of

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
them do you feel any resentment of

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.840 
them do you feel any resentment of
playing<00:04:35.440> jungle<00:04:35.830> for<00:04:36.040> so<00:04:36.250> long<00:04:36.490> do<00:04:36.730> you<00:04:36.790> think

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
playing jungle for so long do you think

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.650 
playing jungle for so long do you think
you<00:04:37.000> should<00:04:37.090> have<00:04:37.180> been<00:04:37.240> a<00:04:37.300> mid<00:04:37.420> late<00:04:37.540> in<00:04:37.600> the

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
you should have been a mid late in the

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.870 
you should have been a mid late in the
entire<00:04:37.840> time<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.290> should<00:04:39.220> don't<00:04:39.370> mind<00:04:39.640> playing

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
entire time I should don't mind playing

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.940 
entire time I should don't mind playing
jungle<00:04:40.330> because<00:04:40.570> it<00:04:41.260> actually<00:04:41.440> helped<00:04:41.710> me<00:04:41.800> get

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
jungle because it actually helped me get

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.250 
jungle because it actually helped me get
better<00:04:42.130> okay<00:04:42.790> as<00:04:42.940> a<00:04:42.970> mid<00:04:43.180> laner<00:04:43.360> because<00:04:43.690> it

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
better okay as a mid laner because it

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.170 
better okay as a mid laner because it
allowed<00:04:44.770> me<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:45.040> realize<00:04:45.340> like<00:04:45.550> how<00:04:45.730> much<00:04:46.030> more

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
allowed me to realize like how much more

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.960 
allowed me to realize like how much more
you<00:04:46.210> have<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.360> communicate<00:04:46.600> as<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.020> jungler<00:04:47.320> I

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
you have to communicate as a jungler I

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.270 
you have to communicate as a jungler I
not<00:04:48.970> only<00:04:49.030> that<00:04:49.240> it's<00:04:49.450> like<00:04:49.660> it'sit's<00:04:50.500> how

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
not only that it's like it'sit's how

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.500 
not only that it's like it'sit's how
much<00:04:51.460> more<00:04:51.610> important<00:04:51.880> vision<00:04:52.090> control<00:04:52.240> is

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
much more important vision control is

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.570 
much more important vision control is
and<00:04:52.720> I<00:04:52.750> realize<00:04:53.200> like<00:04:53.410> how<00:04:53.530> as<00:04:53.979> a<00:04:54.010> mid<00:04:54.310> laner<00:04:54.460> I

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
and I realize like how as a mid laner I

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.700 
and I realize like how as a mid laner I
can<00:04:54.850> carry<00:04:55.120> that<00:04:55.300> over<00:04:55.360> into

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
can carry that over into

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.650 
can carry that over into
the<00:04:56.770> mid<00:04:56.920> game<00:04:57.040> with<00:04:57.250> vision<00:04:57.490> control<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:58.030> I'm

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
the mid game with vision control and I'm

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.150 
the mid game with vision control and I'm
trying<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.930> coordinate<00:04:59.170> with<00:04:59.230> Dexter<00:04:59.620> on<00:04:59.890> in

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
trying to coordinate with Dexter on in

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.410 
trying to coordinate with Dexter on in
terms<00:05:00.370> of<00:05:00.490> getting<00:05:00.670> vision<00:05:00.970> control<00:05:01.120> because

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
terms of getting vision control because

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.610 
terms of getting vision control because
vision<00:05:01.630> control<00:05:01.780> is<00:05:01.960> really<00:05:02.110> an<00:05:02.200> objective

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
vision control is really an objective

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.080 
vision control is really an objective
and<00:05:02.860> if<00:05:03.130> you<00:05:03.280> get<00:05:03.400> vision<00:05:03.640> control<00:05:03.790> you<00:05:03.970> can

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
and if you get vision control you can

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.210 
and if you get vision control you can
really<00:05:04.360> just<00:05:04.600> control<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.170> game<00:05:05.290> so<00:05:06.100> do<00:05:06.190> you

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
really just control the game so do you

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.620 
really just control the game so do you
think<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.460> sealed<00:05:06.670> you<00:05:06.820> should<00:05:07.000> convert<00:05:07.300> more

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
think a sealed you should convert more

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.720 
think a sealed you should convert more
people<00:05:08.200> to<00:05:08.410> other<00:05:08.620> lanes<00:05:08.980> constantly<00:05:09.550> to

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
people to other lanes constantly to

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.890 
people to other lanes constantly to
learn<00:05:09.850> more<00:05:10.060> is<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.360> when<00:05:10.480> the<00:05:10.510> track<00:05:10.750> of<00:05:10.840> the

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
learn more is that when the track of the

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.990 
learn more is that when the track of the
entire<00:05:11.140> time<00:05:11.380> for<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:11.620> guys<00:05:11.800> ah<00:05:12.000> honestly

like the more roles you learned the more
better<00:05:14.620> you'll<00:05:14.860> get<00:05:15.040> at<00:05:15.130> the<00:05:15.220> game<00:05:15.370> because<00:05:15.670> I

you guys are all playing in position
well<00:05:39.730> it<00:05:40.630> can<00:05:40.810> go<00:05:40.930> either<00:05:40.960> way<00:05:41.140> I<00:05:41.260> think<00:05:41.380> it<00:05:41.800> all

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
well it can go either way I think it all

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.710 
well it can go either way I think it all
depends<00:05:42.340> on<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.460> early<00:05:42.700> game<00:05:42.850> and<00:05:43.090> homemade

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
depends on the early game and homemade

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.060 
depends on the early game and homemade
lingos<00:05:44.020> I<00:05:44.140> think<00:05:44.320> mid<00:05:44.560> lane<00:05:44.680> has<00:05:44.830> like<00:05:44.980> the

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
lingos I think mid lane has like the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.640 
lingos I think mid lane has like the
biggest<00:05:45.220> focus<00:05:45.610> of<00:05:45.850> this<00:05:46.000> game<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.420> I<00:05:47.380> think

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
biggest focus of this game and I think

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.560 
biggest focus of this game and I think
link<00:05:48.220> can<00:05:48.490> take<00:05:48.700> on<00:05:48.850> V<00:05:48.970> oxen<00:05:49.240> pretty<00:05:49.420> easily

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
link can take on V oxen pretty easily

maybe like stay in Lane at least right

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.780 
maybe like stay in Lane at least right
when<00:05:52.330> I<00:05:52.360> want<00:05:52.600> him<00:05:52.750> and<00:05:52.900> I<00:05:53.710> think<00:05:54.040> if<00:05:54.250> we<00:05:54.640> get

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
when I want him and I think if we get

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.030 
when I want him and I think if we get
the<00:05:55.060> game<00:05:55.720> and<00:05:55.960> communication<00:05:56.620> communication

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
the game and communication communication

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.340 
the game and communication communication
going<00:05:57.490> like<00:05:57.820> in<00:05:57.940> this<00:05:58.060> game<00:05:58.240> I<00:05:58.420> think<00:05:58.900> we<00:05:59.050> might

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
going like in this game I think we might

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.290 
going like in this game I think we might
beat<00:05:59.590> them<00:05:59.770> but<00:05:59.890> it's<00:06:00.370> like<00:06:00.520> too<00:06:00.940> hard<00:06:01.090> to<00:06:01.180> tell

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
beat them but it's like too hard to tell

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.610 
beat them but it's like too hard to tell
because<00:06:01.420> we<00:06:01.690> didn't<00:06:01.900> really<00:06:01.990> scream<00:06:02.230> them<00:06:02.410> we

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
because we didn't really scream them we

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.100 
because we didn't really scream them we
don't<00:06:02.800> know<00:06:02.920> how<00:06:03.100> good<00:06:03.280> they<00:06:03.340> are<00:06:03.550> and<00:06:03.810> yeah<00:06:04.810> it

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
don't know how good they are and yeah it

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.780 
don't know how good they are and yeah it
just<00:06:05.170> depends<00:06:06.160> on<00:06:06.220> the<00:06:06.280> early<00:06:06.490> game<00:06:06.640> and

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
just depends on the early game and

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.520 
just depends on the early game and
