00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.850 
know find very easily I'm pretty sure I
know<00:00:51.090> where<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> other<00:00:51.660> two<00:00:51.899> are<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.410> they

are<00:00:53.129> collectors<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.120> even<00:00:54.510> crazier

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
are collectors that are even crazier

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.920 
are collectors that are even crazier
than<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.410> am<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:57.300> doubt<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.570> you're

original concept for foils it failed and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.090 
original concept for foils it failed and
I<00:01:08.100> think<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.880> know<00:01:09.000> why<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.990> now<00:01:10.170> most<00:01:10.680> people

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.649 
I think I know why so now most people
when<00:01:11.250> they<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.760> they<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.060> oh<00:01:12.360> wow

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
done foils like this and at first I

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.260 
done foils like this and at first I
truly<00:01:18.869> did<00:01:19.080> agree<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.530> them<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.369> now<00:01:21.000> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
truly did agree with them but now that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.060 
truly did agree with them but now that
I've<00:01:21.390> had<00:01:21.570> plenty<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.049> time<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.380> stare<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:22.950> this

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
I've had plenty of time to stare at this

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.690 
I've had plenty of time to stare at this
thing<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.330> disagree<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.049> here's<00:01:25.560> why

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
thing I have to disagree and here's why

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.940 
thing I have to disagree and here's why
depending<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.450> what<00:01:27.750> angle<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.409> look<00:01:28.619> at<00:01:28.770> this

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
depending on what angle you look at this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.130 
depending on what angle you look at this
hopefully<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.119> catch<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.720> know<00:01:30.810> that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
hopefully I can catch you know that

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.069 
hopefully I can catch you know that
wrong<00:01:31.530> angle<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:33.000> video<00:01:33.420> but

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
wrong angle here on on video but

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.710 
wrong angle here on on video but
depending<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.130> how<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.460> look<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.329> ends

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
depending on how you look at it it ends

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.280 
depending on how you look at it it ends
up<00:01:36.780> being<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.829> black<00:01:38.340> square<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
up being just a black square so the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.399 
up being just a black square so the
problem<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:42.329> know<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:43.020> one

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
problem with that is you know with one

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.020 
problem with that is you know with one
of<00:01:43.590> these<00:01:43.680> cards<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.310> you're<00:01:44.399> staring<00:01:44.880> at

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
of these cards that you're staring at

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.139 
of these cards that you're staring at
like<00:01:45.420> oh<00:01:45.600> wow<00:01:45.960> that's<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.500> neat<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.430> you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
like oh wow that's really neat but you

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.420

know a lot of people like to foil out

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.090 
know a lot of people like to foil out
their<00:01:50.640> deck<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.110> can<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.259> imagine<00:01:52.380> dealing

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
their deck and can you imagine dealing

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.149 
their deck and can you imagine dealing
with<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.640> say<00:01:54.170> 2530<00:01:55.170> permanence<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
with like say 2530 permanence on the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.060 
with like say 2530 permanence on the
table<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.700> all<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.409> looked<00:01:58.649> at<00:01:58.829> at

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
table and all have to be looked at at

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.700 
table and all have to be looked at at
the<00:01:59.159> proper<00:01:59.610> angle<00:02:00.110> you'd<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.259> playing<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
the proper angle you'd be playing the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.670 
the proper angle you'd be playing the

there's<00:02:04.010> your<00:02:04.220> islands<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.180> your<00:02:05.390> planes<00:02:05.840> I

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
there's your islands and your planes I

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.889 
there's your islands and your planes I
mean<00:02:06.920> you'd<00:02:07.310> be<00:02:07.340> doing<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.000> much<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.330> this<00:02:08.509> that

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
mean you'd be doing so much of this that

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.650 
mean you'd be doing so much of this that
it<00:02:09.050> really<00:02:09.380> wouldn't<00:02:09.679> be<00:02:09.770> very<00:02:10.100> fun<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.660> I'm

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
it really wouldn't be very fun and I'm

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.990 
it really wouldn't be very fun and I'm
hoping<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:12.620> was<00:02:13.040> their<00:02:13.250> sensibility

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
hoping that that was their sensibility

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.300 
hoping that that was their sensibility
and<00:02:14.270> why<00:02:14.450> they<00:02:14.690> did<00:02:14.930> not<00:02:14.960> do<00:02:15.350> this<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.800> the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
and why they did not do this and the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.010 
and why they did not do this and the
thing<00:02:16.520> is<00:02:16.790> I've<00:02:17.090> heard<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.540> there<00:02:17.720> are<00:02:17.810> other

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
two cards had changed hands so value is

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.570 
two cards had changed hands so value is
just<00:05:27.570> really<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.050> guess<00:05:28.410> and<00:05:28.680> when<00:05:29.100> people<00:05:29.400> say

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
it's worth what someone is willing to

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.770 
it's worth what someone is willing to
pay<00:05:31.770> for<00:05:32.039> it<00:05:32.160> that<00:05:32.340> truly<00:05:32.970> applies<00:05:33.450> in
