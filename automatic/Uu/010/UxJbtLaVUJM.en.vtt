00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.820
 hello everyone thanks for watching another video 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.710
 more than latin gamers today 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.170
 I bring a top 5 of celebrities who have 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.970
 appeared in a video game and is that the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.859
 video games have shown for 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.259
 much to be such an entertainment mode 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.849
 popular as cinema or television is 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.099
 that's why several celebrities have 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.499
 encouraged to lend his voice so much and in 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.230
 occasions its living image to animate a 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:31.380
 video game character 's start with 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.960
 we start as always with the fifth 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.250
 where we have sasha gray the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.769
 which has an appearance in the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.629
 video game saint row say lending his 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.850
 voice for the character viola the winter 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 it's kind of strange to see someone who gets 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.350
 made famous in the adult industry 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.879
 in a video game however the saga is 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.670
 introduces and has stood out for not following 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.300
 the rules and that did with sasha the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.120
 which occupies the fifth place of this this 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.890
 Fourth, we have Mike Tyson the 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.530
 which appears as the same in the game 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.629
 punch out this is the most classic game 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.430
 from the list and in it we have mike as 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.130
 the final opponent in a fight of 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.440
 boxing despite being a video game of the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.450
 third generation of nintendo consoles 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.610
 did a great job in adapting the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.040
 image of this boxer in a video game 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.040
 of 16 bits and that's why it occupies the 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.710
 fourth place in third place we have to 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.720
 samuel l.jackson the popular actor the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.910
 which lent his voice to interpret the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.580
 pawn officer in the gta san game 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.410
 andreas here we see a great and popular 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.660
 Hollywood actor playing a role in 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.479
 a video game something that is also 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.640
 strange, however, we all know 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.130
 that rockstar does not skimp on resources 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.560
 for their video games and this made it possible 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.429
 that we had such a good actor 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.300
 playing a villain of the 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.789
 video game 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.130
 samuel used part of his experience as 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.610
 actor to give voice to this character is 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.190
 that's why he stays in third place 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.170
 in second place we have ellen paige and 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.390
 their participation in the video game to 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.700
 ellen show may be the least 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.380
 famous among those who occupy this top without 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.180
 However, it managed to reach a high 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.700
 popularity for his interpretation of 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.190
 jodi holmes also achieved something that never 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.050
 had been seen in a video game and that is 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.480
 showed that you could not only act 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.060
 in the series or movies but also 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.300
 in video games and that's why it occupies the 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.370
 second place already to finish the first 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.230
 place is occupied by someone who for me has 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.270
 made the best performance that has been 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.430
 done in a video game I mean 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.800
 kevin spacey and his interpretation of 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.260
 jonathan irons in the video game call of 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.090
 duty advanced warfighter and is that the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.220
 actor used elements of his character 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.560
 frank on the boom to play his 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.510
 video game character something that 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.980
 it was pretty good and that was something 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.130
 essential in advertising the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.050
 videogame its great interpretation in addition 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.480
