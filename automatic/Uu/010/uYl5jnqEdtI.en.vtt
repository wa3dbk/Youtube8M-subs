00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.480
 hi how about 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:20.259
 I'm going to ask you to imagine something 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.840
 imagine that you hire a cruise of 15 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.279
 days to summer holidays in this 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.750
 cruise departs for example the port of 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.579
 Barcelona 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.560
 then the first day you arrive at the port 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.920
 you ride on the boat 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.730
 and after eight hours navigate turn away 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.660
 to port 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.690
 low and discover that you have returned to 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.059
 Port of departure to Barcelona and 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.710
 dissent to visit the city says 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.870
 good but this as it consists 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.930
 in which I will return to the city again 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.140
 starting 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.750
 and someone from the circulation tells you if 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.940
 that way it's going to be the 15 days we go out and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.140
 we return to the same story 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.549
 and then he says well I'm going to claim 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.610
 this is not what I bought 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.979
 then mind explains why noses 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.869
 are you doing the same with your life 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.630
 because you are living the same year 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.620
 repeated 30 or 40 times you know and come back 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.380
 to the same post 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.219
 I want you to be aware of it 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.590
 it's very important because what is it about 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.930
 then life repeated a day after 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.750
 another to support the same ratio of 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.200
 couple that does not work the boss that does not 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.470
 stand the job you do not like it 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.409
 again and again you come back again and again 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.250
 you go back to the same thing every day and then 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.429
 you do not put any complaint or claim 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.350
 we just let it go by thinking 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.720
 that things will change by themselves or 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.770
 thinking I do not know maybe there's another 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.799
 life after you will not only live once 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.049
 clear then in that process 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.840
 like that traveler who is going to do 15 days 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.250
 of the same route to have fun 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.730
 little and make it more fun since they are 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.520
 sad and depressing then add it 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.130
 with alcohol with drugs you can 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.060
 also dress with pay sex with 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.520
 game buying expensive cars clothes a 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.890
 a lot of things that the only thing he does is 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.800
 cover anesthetizer make you believe that 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.740
 I'm going through and I'm going through what 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.370
 luxury how good and how good 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.650
 I'm going but that's part of the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.990
 denial of unconsciousness because 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.810
 take action on the matter and maybe 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.770
 decide to change all those things costs 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.470
 the painful some will tell me that of course 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.620
 say it but it's not easy no it's not easy 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.980
 I do not know what is easier to lose 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.860
 lose life day after day that does not 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.650
 you will come back you know what happens to the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.680
 people the people who are in phase 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.520
 terminal certain diseases 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.740
 people who have taken care of their 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.630
 care tell 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.780
 that this person in the latter 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.520
 moments of life what they regret is 1 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.209
 not having taken enough 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.430
 well with his family and two have not 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.980
 daring enough to do the 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.709
 things of life in a moment that no longer 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.460
 there is a reversal at a time when 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.850
 you see 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.860
 and there is nothing left but the end 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.550
 the end that we're going to have everything because 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.340
 you and me and everything we 're going to die must 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.860
 Become aware of death that great taboo 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.070
 that nobody wants to touch that nobody wants 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.890
 see what nobody wants to talk about 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.320
 becoming aware of death 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.990
 you will have life consciousness because 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.900
 you will take advantage if this is a step here 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.970
 we only come in step then we go 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.400
 to take advantage of life to give love to 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.620
 I will not ask others to give you if you are 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.950
 what you say goodbye to the night 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.630
 tomorrow of your work but yes that you take 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.600
 aware of what situations 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.870
 find your life and decide to change the 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.760
 do something to be happy you do not like it if 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.340
 is with those activities that you 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.710
 talked before because it's about 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.140
 anesthetize me when we're going to stick 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.760
 that make anesthesia go to sleep like that 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.880
 you find out about the pain of the operation 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.370
 Well maybe you're looking for an anesthetic 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.360
 almonte before the pain of carrying a 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.449
 more spent life 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.930
 so the same thing you can do is 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.120
 become fully aware of it and what 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.969
 I recommend you many people have 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.219
 done some we are in it because 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:54.610
 here it's about navigating from a port to 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:57.039
 another port from one port to another port 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.259
 I have not arrived at the great final destination 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.199
 Of course we will not arrive as the 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:04.870
 inta cade kavafis that the journey is 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.870
 long because when I get to the old man and 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.580
 tired will only matter the way not the 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.060
 final destination 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.820
 so that 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:20.490
 think what I have said to you 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:23.300
 and do not waste your life or if it's yours 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.300
 Thank you
