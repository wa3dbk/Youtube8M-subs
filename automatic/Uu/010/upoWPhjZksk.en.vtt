00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
demonstrating television I guess the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090 
demonstrating television I guess the
television<00:01:51.450> here<00:01:51.960> has<00:01:52.200> changed<00:01:52.890> rather

hasn't<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.490> technology's<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> bit<00:01:54.240> different

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
hasn't it technology's a bit different

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.120 
hasn't it technology's a bit different
yeah<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.080> technology<00:01:55.500> he<00:01:55.619> was<00:01:55.740> using<00:01:56.009> was

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
yeah the technology he was using was

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.249 
yeah the technology he was using was
mechanical<00:01:56.700> television<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.630> here's<00:01:58.080> that

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
mechanical television and here's that

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.050 
mechanical television and here's that
model<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.920> type<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.399> system<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.789> isn't

model of this type of system that isn't

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.480 
model of this type of system that isn't
demonstrated<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.289> crank<00:02:01.590> things<00:02:01.890> that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
demonstrated if I crank things that

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.429 
demonstrated if I crank things that
won't<00:02:02.729> begin<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.119> scanning<00:02:03.390> process<00:02:03.509> then

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
won't begin the scanning process then

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.399 
won't begin the scanning process then
you<00:02:04.530> need<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> photocell<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.549> receiver<00:02:06.409> he's

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
you need a photocell and a receiver he's

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.830 
you need a photocell and a receiver he's
coming<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:11.489> us<00:02:11.519> here<00:02:12.060> with<00:02:12.239> all<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.630> amazing

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
coming to us here with all that amazing

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.140 
coming to us here with all that amazing
displays<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:13.769> things<00:02:13.980> very<00:02:14.610> simple<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.090> I

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
displays it's things very simple but I

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.520 
displays it's things very simple but I
guess<00:02:15.329> at<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.540> time<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:16.079> must<00:02:16.290> have<00:02:16.410> been

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
guess at the time it must have been

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.860 
guess at the time it must have been
really<00:02:17.430> mind-blowing<00:02:18.090> for<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.540> people<00:02:18.810> who

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
really mind-blowing for the people who

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.810 
really mind-blowing for the people who
saw<00:02:19.079> it<00:02:19.110> only<00:02:19.890> about<00:02:20.010> one<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.370> thousand<00:02:20.760> of

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
saw it only about one in a thousand of

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.550 
saw it only about one in a thousand of
them<00:02:20.940> would<00:02:21.120> have<00:02:21.150> had<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> radio<00:02:21.750> set<00:02:22.049> and<00:02:22.440> to

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
them would have had a radio set and to

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.170 
them would have had a radio set and to
the<00:02:22.650> idea<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.950> sending<00:02:23.100> images<00:02:23.310> across<00:02:23.820> space

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the idea of sending images across space

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.900 
the idea of sending images across space
using<00:02:24.540> Wireless<00:02:24.930> was<00:02:25.670> revolutionary<00:02:26.670> or

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
using Wireless was revolutionary or

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.090 
using Wireless was revolutionary or
something<00:02:27.209> magical<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.380> images<00:02:28.739> were<00:02:28.860> quite

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
something magical the images were quite

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.490 
something magical the images were quite
rudimentary<00:02:29.489> though<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.269> when<00:02:30.540> they<00:02:30.959> saw<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
rudimentary though and when they saw the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.500 
rudimentary though and when they saw the
system<00:02:31.920> he<00:02:32.340> knew<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.790> was<00:02:33.030> something

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
system he knew that this was something

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.539 
system he knew that this was something
that<00:02:33.690> was<00:02:33.989> good<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:34.500> he<00:02:34.709> saw<00:02:34.920> something<00:02:35.160> more

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
that was good but he saw something more

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.630 
that was good but he saw something more
in<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.850> future<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.680> original<00:02:38.100> system<00:02:38.430> could

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
in the future the original system could

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.819 
in the future the original system could
any<00:02:38.760> show<00:02:38.940> out<00:02:39.180> pulleys<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.019> shadows<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.739> you

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
any show out pulleys and shadows and you

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.830 
any show out pulleys and shadows and you
ended<00:02:41.070> up<00:02:41.130> with<00:02:41.310> an<00:02:41.609> image<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.970> bit<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.359> this

ended up with an image a bit like this
they'd<00:02:43.769> wanted<00:02:44.130> something<00:02:44.459> more<00:02:44.640> realistic

least the lighting bear data news was so

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.849 
least the lighting bear data news was so
bright<00:03:09.810> there<00:03:10.079> was<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.200> risk<00:03:10.439> of<00:03:10.590> actually

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
bright there was a risk of actually

bright there was a risk of actually
setting<00:03:11.370> fire<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.239> subjects<00:03:12.719> so<00:03:13.379> what<00:03:13.530> he

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
setting fire to the subjects so what he

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.229 
setting fire to the subjects so what he
used<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:13.859> use<00:03:14.099> was<00:03:14.639> a<00:03:14.670> dummy
