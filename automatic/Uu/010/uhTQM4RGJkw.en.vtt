thing that I recommend you check first

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.680 
thing that I recommend you check first
is<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.430> venting<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> unit<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.390> make<00:00:45.420> sure

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
is the venting of the unit to make sure

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.010 
is the venting of the unit to make sure
that<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:46.079> vent<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.980> not<00:00:47.160> blocked<00:00:47.629> clogged<00:00:48.629> or

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
that your vent is not blocked clogged or

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.160 
that your vent is not blocked clogged or
crimped<00:00:49.980> off<00:00:50.190> somehow<00:00:50.719> once<00:00:51.719> you've<00:00:51.930> checked

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
crimped off somehow once you've checked

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.700 
crimped off somehow once you've checked
that<00:00:52.579> if<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.059> fine<00:00:54.420> air<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.930> flowing<00:00:55.170> good

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that if that is fine air is flowing good

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.680 
that if that is fine air is flowing good
then<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.579> need<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.360> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
then what you need to do on this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.150 
then what you need to do on this
particular<00:00:57.899> model<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.829> you're<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.100> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
particular model is you're going to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.250 
particular model is you're going to
access<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> back<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> unit<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.050> can

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
access the back of the unit so you can

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.609 
access the back of the unit so you can
start<00:01:01.469> testing<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> different<00:01:02.219> components

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
start testing the different components

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.289 
start testing the different components
so<00:01:04.619> first<00:01:04.949> thing<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> looked<00:01:05.909> at<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> I've

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
so first thing that I looked at and I've

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.899 
so first thing that I looked at and I've
already<00:01:06.600> noticed<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.110> behind<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.680> unit<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.250> can

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
already noticed is behind the unit I can

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.330 
already noticed is behind the unit I can
see<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> power<00:01:09.510> cord<00:01:09.960> coming<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.189> can

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
see the power cord coming down and I can

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.670 
see the power cord coming down and I can
see<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> dryer<00:01:11.880> vent<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.510> from<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> dryer

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
see the dryer vent going from the dryer

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.190 
see the dryer vent going from the dryer
to<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> wall<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.570> see<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> is

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to the wall and I can see that it is

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.520 
to the wall and I can see that it is
completely<00:01:16.770> bent<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.000> crimped<00:01:18.720> together<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
completely bent and crimped together to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.200 
completely bent and crimped together to
where<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:20.009> letting<00:01:20.250> air<00:01:20.580> flow<00:01:20.850> through

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
where it is not letting air flow through

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.539 
where it is not letting air flow through
the<00:01:21.450> unit<00:01:21.810> which<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.680> probably<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.100> start<00:01:23.430> of

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the unit which is probably the start of

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.570 
the unit which is probably the start of
our<00:01:23.640> problem<00:01:24.180> which<00:01:24.750> has<00:01:25.619> led<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.310> something

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
our problem which has led to something

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.700 
our problem which has led to something
else<00:01:26.880> breaking<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:27.720> going<00:01:28.049> wrong<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.590> what

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
else breaking or going wrong so what

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.560 
else breaking or going wrong so what
we're<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.070> now<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.790> pull<00:01:30.119> unit<00:01:30.450> out

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
we're going to do now is pull unit out

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.090 
we're going to do now is pull unit out
so<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:30.990> access<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> back<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.829> unit

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
so we can access the back of the unit

the fuse is good

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.369 
the fuse is good
I'll<00:03:31.579> check<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.849> operating<00:03:32.329> thermostat<00:03:35.379> the

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
I'll check the operating thermostat the

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:43.780 
I'll check the operating thermostat the
operating<00:03:36.799> thermostat<00:03:37.280> is<00:03:37.400> good<00:03:42.430> high<00:03:43.430> limit

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
operating thermostat is good high limit

00:03:43.790 --> 00:04:01.259

the<00:04:02.269> high<00:04:02.450> limit<00:04:02.810> thermostat<00:04:03.109> both<00:04:03.709> are

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
the high limit thermostat both are

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.879 
the high limit thermostat both are
operating<00:04:04.459> fine

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
operating fine

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.209 
operating fine
now<00:04:06.889> we've<00:04:07.099> tested<00:04:07.370> those<00:04:07.700> things<00:04:08.889> this<00:04:09.889> very

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:10.219 
now we've tested those things this very

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.589 
now we've tested those things this very
well<00:04:10.459> could<00:04:10.489> have<00:04:10.760> been<00:04:10.879> as<00:04:11.750> simple<00:04:12.260> as<00:04:12.530> a

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
well could have been as simple as a

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.020 
well could have been as simple as a
block<00:04:14.599> vent<00:04:15.079> so<00:04:15.919> we're<00:04:16.130> going<00:04:16.220> to<00:04:16.280> do<00:04:16.430> is<00:04:16.699> we're

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
block vent so we're going to do is we're

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.150 
block vent so we're going to do is we're
going<00:04:17.180> to<00:04:17.299> put<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.349> back<00:04:18.500> cover<00:04:18.530> back<00:04:18.949> on

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
going to put the back cover back on

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.830 
going to put the back cover back on
because<00:04:19.310> everything<00:04:19.579> test-flying<00:04:20.239> back<00:04:20.479> here

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
because everything test-flying back here

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.439 
because everything test-flying back here
we're<00:04:21.590> going<00:04:21.709> to<00:04:21.769> plug<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.099> unit<00:04:22.370> back<00:04:22.490> in<00:04:22.789> and

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
we're going to plug the unit back in and

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:24.850 
we're going to plug the unit back in and
we're<00:04:23.599> going<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:23.750> let<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:23.900> vent<00:04:24.259> right<00:04:24.530> into

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
we're going to let it vent right into

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.409 
we're going to let it vent right into
the<00:04:24.949> room<00:04:25.160> for<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.370> minute<00:04:25.669> to<00:04:25.789> make<00:04:25.970> sure<00:04:26.270> that

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
the room for a minute to make sure that

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.450 
the room for a minute to make sure that
we<00:04:26.599> do<00:04:26.810> have<00:04:27.050> heat<00:04:27.320> generating<00:04:27.949> from<00:04:28.310> the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
we do have heat generating from the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.820 
we do have heat generating from the
units<00:04:28.960> okay<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.020> now<00:04:30.289> I've<00:04:30.440> got<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.680> back

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
units okay so now I've got the back

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.589 
units okay so now I've got the back
panel<00:04:31.190> put<00:04:31.340> back<00:04:31.490> on<00:04:31.699> you<00:04:32.000> have<00:04:32.180> plugged<00:04:32.419> back
