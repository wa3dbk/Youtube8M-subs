so now that you have killed everything

in the room except for calyx start

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.280 
in the room except for calyx start
hitting<00:01:51.850> him<00:01:52.030> with<00:01:52.060> your<00:01:52.330> snipers<00:01:52.960> if<00:01:53.110> he's<00:01:53.260> a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
hitting him with your snipers if he's a

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.890 
hitting him with your snipers if he's a

trained all of your scout rifle and if
he<00:01:56.050> is<00:01:56.350> closer<00:01:57.010> than<00:01:57.280> feel<00:01:57.670> free<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.030> use<00:01:58.090> or

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
he is closer than feel free to use or

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.630 
he is closer than feel free to use or
heavy<00:01:58.540> weapons<00:01:59.020> but<00:01:59.650> in<00:01:59.770> this<00:01:59.890> instance<00:02:00.130> here

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
heavy weapons but in this instance here

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.580 
heavy weapons but in this instance here
he's<00:02:01.000> still<00:02:01.330> at<00:02:01.420> range<00:02:01.630> so<00:02:01.900> we're<00:02:02.050> hitting<00:02:02.230> him

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
he's still at range so we're hitting him

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.010 
he's still at range so we're hitting him
and<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.340> objective<00:02:03.460> at<00:02:03.970> this<00:02:04.300> moment<00:02:04.600> is<00:02:04.870> to

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
and the objective at this moment is to

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.410 
and the objective at this moment is to
get<00:02:05.200> him<00:02:05.350> down<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.860> as<00:02:06.490> low<00:02:06.550> as<00:02:07.090> we<00:02:07.240> possibly

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
get him down to as low as we possibly

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.050 
get him down to as low as we possibly
can<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:08.229> get<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.619> target<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.280> spawn<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.970> you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
can to get that target to spawn and you

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.630 
can to get that target to spawn and you
can<00:02:10.360> do<00:02:10.540> this<00:02:10.750> with<00:02:11.020> your<00:02:11.500> sniper<00:02:11.860> rifles<00:02:12.430> or

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
can do this with your sniper rifles or

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.160 
can do this with your sniper rifles or
your<00:02:13.000> primaries<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:16.330> once<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.630> target<00:02:17.020> has

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
your primaries so once the target has

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.990 
your primaries so once the target has
spawned<00:02:17.470> out<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.920> came<00:02:18.100> into<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.760> arena

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
spawned out and came into the arena

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.730 
spawned out and came into the arena
you're<00:02:19.660> going<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.840> want<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.110> either<00:02:20.230> take<00:02:20.500> him

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
you're going to want to either take him

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.050 
you're going to want to either take him
out<00:02:20.800> with<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:20.950> shotgun<00:02:21.250> maybe<00:02:21.730> with<00:02:21.940> your

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
out with that shotgun maybe with your

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.090 
out with that shotgun maybe with your
rocket<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:23.080> if<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.230> cannot<00:02:23.530> get<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.950> him<00:02:24.040> you

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
rocket but if you cannot get to him you

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.610 
rocket but if you cannot get to him you
can<00:02:24.280> just<00:02:24.460> simply<00:02:24.820> wait<00:02:25.150> until<00:02:25.750> he<00:02:25.930> gets<00:02:25.959> to

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
can just simply wait until he gets to

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.290 
can just simply wait until he gets to
his<00:02:26.860> objective<00:02:27.340> where<00:02:27.490> he<00:02:27.610> is<00:02:27.730> trying<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.060> go

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
his objective where he is trying to go

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.540 
his objective where he is trying to go
to<00:02:28.360> as<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.780> can<00:02:28.930> see<00:02:29.080> we've<00:02:29.260> done<00:02:29.440> here<00:02:29.709> now

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
to as you can see we've done here now

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.640 
to as you can see we've done here now
once<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.150> actually<00:02:31.360> have<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.230> target

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
once you actually have the target

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.010 
once you actually have the target
defeated<00:02:33.310> calyx<00:02:34.120> will<00:02:34.300> have<00:02:34.480> all<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.900> his

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
defeated calyx will have all of his

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.230 
defeated calyx will have all of his
health<00:02:35.260> back<00:02:35.560> but<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.640> fine<00:02:36.880> this<00:02:36.910> is

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
health back but this is fine this is

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.030 
health back but this is fine this is
what<00:02:37.510> we<00:02:37.630> intend<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.140> have<00:02:38.260> happened<00:02:38.740> he<00:02:38.920> is

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
what we intend to have happened he is

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.199 
what we intend to have happened he is
gorged<00:02:39.459> on<00:02:39.610> his<00:02:40.650> servants<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.700> point<00:02:42.970> in

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
gorged on his servants and the point in

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.000 
gorged on his servants and the point in
this<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.810> he<00:02:43.959> can't<00:02:44.230> spawn<00:02:44.560> them<00:02:44.740> again

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
this is that he can't spawn them again

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.160 
this is that he can't spawn them again
we've<00:02:45.190> took<00:02:45.430> him<00:02:45.580> down<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:46.090> less<00:02:46.900> than<00:02:46.930> half

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
we've took him down to less than half

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.920 
we've took him down to less than half
health<00:02:47.740> he's<00:02:48.340> got<00:02:48.520> always<00:02:48.730> held<00:02:48.940> back<00:02:49.209> but<00:02:49.720> he

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
health he's got always held back but he

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.630 
health he's got always held back but he
cannot<00:02:50.230> regen<00:02:50.709> his<00:02:50.860> health<00:02:51.070> now<00:02:51.280> because<00:02:51.550> we

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
cannot regen his health now because we

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.390 
cannot regen his health now because we
took<00:02:51.820> him<00:02:52.000> solo<00:02:52.510> already<00:02:52.930> he<00:02:53.590> can<00:02:53.769> only<00:02:53.980> spawn

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
took him solo already he can only spawn

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.880 
took him solo already he can only spawn
each<00:02:54.730> wave<00:02:55.090> wouldn't<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.260> all<00:02:56.470> those<00:02:56.590> waves

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
each wave wouldn't so all those waves

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.770 
each wave wouldn't so all those waves
have<00:02:57.070> come<00:02:57.220> out<00:02:57.370> we've<00:02:57.910> now<00:02:58.060> cleared<00:02:58.450> up<00:02:58.600> those

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
have come out we've now cleared up those

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.960 
have come out we've now cleared up those
waves<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.380> we<00:02:59.500> can<00:02:59.680> now<00:02:59.860> start<00:03:00.280> killing<00:03:00.730> the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
waves and we can now start killing the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.320 
waves and we can now start killing the
bots<00:03:01.860> so<00:03:02.860> now<00:03:03.070> we<00:03:03.130> are<00:03:03.280> back<00:03:03.519> in<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:03.940> corner

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
bots so now we are back in the corner

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.120 
bots so now we are back in the corner
and<00:03:04.360> before<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:04.810> start<00:03:05.110> damaging<00:03:05.290> him<00:03:05.709> again

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
and before you start damaging him again

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.190 
and before you start damaging him again
make<00:03:06.459> sure<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.940> take<00:03:07.180> out<00:03:07.420> all<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.780> adds<00:03:07.959> up

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
make sure to take out all the adds up

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.690 
make sure to take out all the adds up
spawn<00:03:08.470> then<00:03:08.709> but<00:03:09.100> I'm<00:03:09.190> not<00:03:09.370> going<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.550> shoot

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
spawn then but I'm not going to shoot

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.210 
spawn then but I'm not going to shoot
here<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.150> just<00:03:10.300> look<00:03:10.510> at<00:03:10.720> my<00:03:10.959> mini<00:03:11.530> radar<00:03:12.070> the

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
here and just look at my mini radar the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.880 
here and just look at my mini radar the
only<00:03:12.550> thing<00:03:12.730> there<00:03:12.940> is<00:03:13.120> calyx<00:03:14.050> we<00:03:14.410> don't<00:03:14.680> have

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
only thing there is calyx we don't have

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.590 
only thing there is calyx we don't have
to<00:03:15.010> worry<00:03:15.160> about<00:03:15.220> him<00:03:15.430> spawning<00:03:15.700> anything<00:03:16.300> in

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
to worry about him spawning anything in

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.690 
to worry about him spawning anything in
so<00:03:17.110> you've<00:03:17.260> saw<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.190> strikes<00:03:18.550> us

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
so you've saw that and that strikes us

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.160 
so you've saw that and that strikes us
for<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.910> whole<00:03:19.120> lot<00:03:19.239> easier<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:19.630> now<00:03:19.840> can't

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
for a whole lot easier you now can't

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.410 
for a whole lot easier you now can't
regen<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:21.250> just<00:03:21.519> took<00:03:21.610> two<00:03:21.940> separate

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
regen and it just took two separate

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.449 
regen and it just took two separate
attacks<00:03:22.690> on<00:03:22.870> him<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.530> get<00:03:23.650> him<00:03:23.800> killed<00:03:24.100> and

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
attacks on him to get him killed and
