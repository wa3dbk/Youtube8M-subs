all of that figuring out what might be

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.770 
all of that figuring out what might be
most<00:02:04.770> interesting<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.670> put<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.119> needs<00:02:06.329> like

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
most interesting to put the needs like

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.139 
most interesting to put the needs like
was<00:02:07.560> very<00:02:08.039> much<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.369> first<00:02:08.490> challenge<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.090> I

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
was very much the first challenge that I

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.790 
was very much the first challenge that I
encountered<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.959> franchise<00:02:10.319> isn't<00:02:10.590> defined

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
encountered the franchise isn't defined

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.530 
encountered the franchise isn't defined
necessarily<00:02:11.520> by<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> single<00:02:11.970> character<00:02:12.360> it's

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
necessarily by a single character it's

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.960 
necessarily by a single character it's
defined<00:02:12.870> more<00:02:13.080> by<00:02:13.110> these<00:02:13.410> institutions<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.880> we

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
defined more by these institutions so we

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.300 
defined more by these institutions so we
have<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.180> option<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.870> moving<00:02:16.350> in<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.890> out<00:02:16.980> of

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
have the option of moving in and out of

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.190 
have the option of moving in and out of
different<00:02:17.880> historical<00:02:18.450> periods<00:02:18.510> different

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
different historical periods different

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.070 
different historical periods different
geographical<00:02:19.740> locations<00:02:19.880> different

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
geographical locations different

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.510 
geographical locations different
individual<00:02:22.080> important<00:02:22.770> events<00:02:23.100> throughout

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
individual important events throughout

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.340 
individual important events throughout
human<00:02:23.790> history<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.480> we<00:02:24.600> have<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> wide

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
human history and so we have a wide

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.750 
human history and so we have a wide
variety<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.800> options<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.400> lot<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.730> different

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
variety of options a lot of different

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.090 
variety of options a lot of different
material<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.690> we<00:02:27.780> can<00:02:27.959> mine<00:02:28.140> for<00:02:28.530> ideas<00:02:28.920> and

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
material that we can mine for ideas and

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.430 
material that we can mine for ideas and
stories<00:02:29.280> imagine<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.270> project<00:02:30.780> as<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.020> huge

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
stories imagine this project as a huge

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.990 
stories imagine this project as a huge
puzzle<00:02:31.739> with<00:02:32.069> thousands<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.850> different

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
puzzle with thousands of different

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.729 
puzzle with thousands of different
pieces<00:02:33.360> involving<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.350> lot<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.709> different

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
pieces involving a lot of different

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.550 
pieces involving a lot of different
people<00:02:35.400> we<00:02:35.700> have<00:02:35.850> tools<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.600> track<00:02:36.840> all<00:02:37.230> the

people we have tools to track all the
narrative<00:02:38.340> thread<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.940> we're<00:02:39.180> creating<00:02:39.300> so

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
narrative thread that we're creating so

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.110 
narrative thread that we're creating so
we<00:02:40.050> have<00:02:40.170> database<00:02:40.709> we<00:02:41.010> have<00:02:41.130> Bibles<00:02:41.670> we<00:02:41.970> have

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
we have database we have Bibles we have

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.140 
we have database we have Bibles we have
some<00:02:42.540> visual<00:02:43.440> guidelines<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.459> my<00:02:44.760> main<00:02:44.910> role

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
some visual guidelines so my main role

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.330 
some visual guidelines so my main role
is<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.390> make<00:02:45.630> sure<00:02:45.840> everything<00:02:46.709> fits<00:02:46.920> together

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
is to make sure everything fits together

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.759 
is to make sure everything fits together
so<00:02:48.090> what<00:02:48.239> we<00:02:48.330> did<00:02:48.480> was<00:02:48.540> we<00:02:48.840> tried<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.260> match<00:02:49.470> a

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
so what we did was we tried to match a

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.979 
so what we did was we tried to match a
specific<00:02:50.040> kinds<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.670> content<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.450> writers<00:02:51.780> who

specific kinds of content to writers who

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.240 
specific kinds of content to writers who
mean<00:02:52.140> we<00:02:52.350> knew<00:02:52.500> or<00:02:52.680> figure<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.010> would<00:02:53.100> be

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
mean we knew or figure it would be

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.770 
mean we knew or figure it would be
interested<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:53.850> writing<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.180> kind<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.540> stuff

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
interested in writing that kind of stuff

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.360 
interested in writing that kind of stuff
some<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.410> biggest<00:02:55.620> expressed<00:02:56.160> on

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370

Assassin's Creed actually within the
community<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.390> when<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> time<00:03:01.170> came<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.310> start

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
community so when the time came to start

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.630 
community so when the time came to start
writing<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.390> encyclopedia<00:03:04.170> we<00:03:04.860> realized<00:03:05.280> it

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
writing the encyclopedia we realized it

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.140 
writing the encyclopedia we realized it
would<00:03:05.910> be<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.090> very<00:03:06.810> good<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.140> try<00:03:07.319> to<00:03:07.380> seek<00:03:08.150> one

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
would be a very good to try to seek one

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.210 
would be a very good to try to seek one
writers<00:03:09.630> coming<00:03:10.050> from<00:03:10.380> from<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.829> community

so<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.519> hope<00:03:11.700> up<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.970> job<00:03:12.150> writing<00:03:13.049> further

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
so I hope up the job writing further

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.440 
so I hope up the job writing further
encyclopedia<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.549> UV<00:03:14.850> workshop<00:03:15.150> website
