okay we have a diplomat double oven

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.350 
okay we have a diplomat double oven
built<00:00:12.360> under<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.670> customers<00:00:14.670> saying<00:00:14.940> when

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
built under the customers saying when

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.300 
built under the customers saying when
you<00:00:15.510> turn<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.869> on<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.289> main<00:00:16.470> cooking<00:00:16.800> it

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
you turn it on for the main cooking it

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.700 
you turn it on for the main cooking it
trips<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.789> electricity<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.199> need<00:00:19.440> to<00:00:19.529> find

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
trips the electricity so we need to find

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:28.820 
trips the electricity so we need to find
out<00:00:19.920> why<00:00:20.100> stripping<00:00:20.699> electrics<00:00:27.650> okay<00:00:28.650> you

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
out why stripping electrics okay you

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.700 
out why stripping electrics okay you
obviously<00:00:29.090> on<00:00:30.090> trip<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.660> electrics<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
obviously on trip and electrics is the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.840 
obviously on trip and electrics is the
fan<00:00:32.430> element<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.300> causes<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.760> electrics<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
fan element that causes the electrics to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.000 
fan element that causes the electrics to
play<00:00:36.149> because<00:00:36.629> of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:36.989> short<00:00:37.260> circuit<00:00:37.680> inside

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
play because of the short circuit inside

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.890 
play because of the short circuit inside
the<00:00:38.190> end<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.670> like<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> kettle<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> lament<00:00:39.660> over

there's<00:00:42.150> any<00:00:42.739> regions<00:00:43.739> any<00:00:43.980> breakages<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.060> we

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
there's any regions any breakages so we

00:00:45.480 --> 00:01:09.110 
there's any regions any breakages so we
have<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.720> put<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.960> out<00:00:46.050> testaburger

okay<00:01:10.120> we<00:01:10.300> have<00:01:10.480> a<00:01:10.510> circuit<00:01:11.440> shorts<00:01:12.340> now<00:01:12.700> I<00:01:12.730> need

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
okay we have a circuit shorts now I need

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:24.340 
okay we have a circuit shorts now I need
to<00:01:13.030> find<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.390> short

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.590 

oK<00:01:25.350> we've<00:01:25.530> diagnosed<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.250> problem<00:01:26.420> which<00:01:27.420> is

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the green element and the base element

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.350 
the green element and the base element
of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.920> top<00:01:32.130> conventional<00:01:32.820> oven

of the top conventional oven
the<00:01:33.689> five<00:01:33.899> elements<00:01:34.080> need<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.710> replaced

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450
