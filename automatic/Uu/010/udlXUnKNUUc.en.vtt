00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.710
 hi there, where is the frost and blue 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.510
 it's obvious to him 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.300
 small device representing itself 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.570
 people candy however it candy 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.029
 working on wandering 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.890
 here and so it looks like the mechanism is not 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.259
 so big not so small 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:40.620
 but still, at least I’ll see some 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:42.870
 completely so now I will briefly tell 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.470
 to you what is on it firstly the display is not 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.120
 and window 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.400
 so become poor and boredom left 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:54.630
 wandered building here with us 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.100
 a coin acceptor is a regular button with 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.640
 by which we can get 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.180
 candy on but now not only almost 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.309
 there is no here with us 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.860
 project queen that is coming out of here 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.150
 coins that do not fit well what are you on 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.740
 the hole from which they served wandered 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.619
 config all done at the request of which 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.189
 I was released on the channel but it 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:25.460
 own and everywhere so let's get started 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.460
 its inspection will take for example 1 ruble 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:38.110
 throwing out 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:43.330
 and he poured out over the stream here he is and 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.810
 will ridgid thinks infinitely she will 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.080
 take off 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.070
 wandered but the number 2 will wait 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:59.050
 wandered for 2 rubles if my for example 5 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:02:00.580
 rubles then 5 rubles will not come here by the way 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.830
 forgot to say that when we click 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.450
 on the lever as in 4 sweets here behind 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.540
 comes out and here you can take and here 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.540
 so press down but here again cans and 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:22.330
 so let's say let's say 2 rubles 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:30.150
 we throw it holes we fall 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:30.150
 2 wandered for 2 rubles click again 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.330
 It does not work the same unfortunately only 1 2 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.510
 ruble therefore do not have all the time 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:54.070
 look into the bank here they are our 2 rubles 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:56.700
 they already lie here two more wandering still 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.700
 push 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:16.740
 not working here our so another 25 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.570
 but everything here can still work twice 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.490
 but I will not show these two times 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.600
 because you were convinced that the car was worth 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:28.580
 in fact it works so that 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.580
 recharge we have to open here 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:45.630
 here is the actual version in 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:50.160
 which you need to put rushed well 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:53.010
 actually such from candy they 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.270
 actually there are good features she 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.390
 thought to a minimum 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.150
 if in 5 candy dishes 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.120
 i have roger fabric stuck here now 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.270
 it works absolutely calmly 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.310
 actually didn’t talk about the mechanism 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.720
 here is actually all thank you very much for
