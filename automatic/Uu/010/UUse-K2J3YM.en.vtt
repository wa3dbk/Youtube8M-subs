00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
application that's what command q quits

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.870 
application that's what command q quits
an<00:01:34.590> application<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.369> works<00:01:35.549> right<00:01:35.700> there

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
an application and it works right there

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.360 
an application and it works right there
as<00:01:35.970> well<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.380> way<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.770> apple<00:01:38.310> would

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
as well so the way that apple would

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.310 
as well so the way that apple would
probably<00:01:38.640> prefer<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.480> a<00:01:40.140> new

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
probably prefer you to do it is a new

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.950 
probably prefer you to do it is a new
thing<00:01:40.350> called<00:01:40.560> Mission<00:01:40.980> Control<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.960> down

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
thing called Mission Control and down

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.920 
thing called Mission Control and down
the<00:01:43.110> bottom<00:01:43.440> of<00:01:43.590> your<00:01:44.060> bar<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> thing

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.390 
the bottom of your bar you have a thing
called<00:01:45.960> Mission<00:01:46.290> Control<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.159> probably

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
called Mission Control and you probably

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.160 
called Mission Control and you probably
have<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.730> your<00:01:47.820> keyboard<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.360> button<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:49.020> it
