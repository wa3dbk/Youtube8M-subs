00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 doctor, you will not talk about the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.670
 food at night yes yes and I have to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.870
 recognize that sometimes I do not eat healthy 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.730
 and I know that you can not do the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.320
 digestion all that but I want the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.599
 georg senior doctor who will help her 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.119
 Dr. fernanda good morning as 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.680
 I start by telling you that it is not bad 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.840
 eat at night that you have to follow 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.670
 some good morning recommendations 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.920
 all is that many things are said about 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 this last meal that fattens up that causes 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.390
 nightmares but the truth is that there is no 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.550
 a general rule about its effects that 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.070
 it depends on each person what does not 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.110
 we must do is eat and immediately 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.420
 lie down because that will do more 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.840
 difficult rest especially in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.820
 those who suffer from reflux 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.440
 for many a hearty meal and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.780
 close to bedtime is 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.060
 synonymous with a bad night not good no 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.970
 well it reveals all night and a 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.489
 tenacious in the stomach not remains and hoeness 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.680
 of stomach if I made a very 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.020
 heavy at night and then I 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.150
 laid down by serious issue because the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.550
 Gastroesophageal reflux will increase and 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.250
 for some it is literally a 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:14.310
 nightmare regrets nightmares more sleep 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.979
 finally the subject of nightmares of 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.180
 snoring and other associations that 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.270
 have done with food ingestion 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.270
 night they do not have any 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.369
 academic foundation but for 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.460
 common sense ingest a very meal 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.310
 heavy at night so it is not the most 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.530
 recommended for general health and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.570
 for a good sleep but in addition to a 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.610
 bad night you can earn a few kilitos 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.440
 of more the calories that we eat at 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.350
 breakfast we basically burn them in the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.750
 tomorrow the calories we eat at 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.000
 noon we spent them in the afternoon and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.170
 usually at night once we eat 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.710
 what follows next is 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.500
 to sleep in which case the burning of 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.990
 calories is not going to be significant and that 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.899
 because it can affect us aesthetically 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.549
 for nothing but a little chubby for 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.680
 that to not ruin your rest and 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.780
 control your weight keep in mind these 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.030
 recommendations is not desirable in the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.720
 night eat very fried foods very 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.650
 greasy 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.480
 very spicy with spicy liquid 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.280
 it has also been assumed that it has to 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.230
 increase reflux has been blamed 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.480
 that kind of thing that's why I try to make the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.000
 Last meal is at least two hours before 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.130
 of going to bed finally I want to 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.450
 recommend not to skip the food 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.580
 at night remember that our body 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.700
 you need three main meals 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.350
 that yes do it early and balance according to 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.350
 what you have eaten during the day
