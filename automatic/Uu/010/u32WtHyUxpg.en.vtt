00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.080 
hungry today so there's no way I'm going
to<00:01:39.530> eat<00:01:39.710> all<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:39.950> this<00:01:40.189> what<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.549> probably<00:01:40.790> will

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
to eat all of this what I probably will

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.850 
to eat all of this what I probably will
do<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.450> take<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.689> section<00:01:42.020> out<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.530> then<00:01:42.680> just

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
do is take a section out and then just

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.440 
do is take a section out and then just
trim<00:01:43.070> off<00:01:43.189> that<00:01:43.250> roughly<00:01:43.820> at<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:43.939> top<00:01:44.180> because

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
trim off that roughly at the top because

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.940 
trim off that roughly at the top because
you're<00:01:44.600> supposed<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:44.930> do<00:01:45.049> that<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:45.530> all<00:01:45.680> of<00:01:45.830> it

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
you're supposed to do that to all of it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.800 
you're supposed to do that to all of it
and<00:01:46.130> then<00:01:46.520> I've<00:01:46.700> got<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:46.909> little<00:01:47.210> idea<00:01:47.570> of

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
and then I've got a little idea of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.929 
and then I've got a little idea of
someone<00:01:48.110> or<00:01:48.530> maybe<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:48.890> should<00:01:48.979> say<00:01:49.100> something

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
someone or maybe I should say something

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.420 
someone or maybe I should say something
that<00:01:50.450> will<00:01:50.689> like<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.049> tongue<00:01:51.259> oh<00:01:51.500> yeah<00:01:52.009> that

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
sounds wrong yeah

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.690

rough bit

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.340 
rough bit
or<00:02:20.940> I've<00:02:21.420> just<00:02:21.570> taken<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.960> top<00:02:22.110> off<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
or I've just taken the top off the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.320 
or I've just taken the top off the
tongue<00:02:22.650> oh<00:02:22.860> let's<00:02:23.640> go<00:02:23.760> down<00:02:24.000> there<00:02:24.120> like<00:02:24.270> that

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
tongue oh let's go down there like that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.430 
tongue oh let's go down there like that
I<00:02:24.390> really<00:02:24.750> don't<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.050> fact<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.320> this

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
I really don't like the fact that this

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.750 
I really don't like the fact that this
is<00:02:25.620> turned<00:02:25.800> into<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.160> little<00:02:26.490> bit<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.670> an

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
is turned into like a little bit of an

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.700 
is turned into like a little bit of an
operation<00:02:27.210> right<00:02:27.330> now<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:28.260> would<00:02:28.440> probably

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
operation right now this would probably

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.830 
operation right now this would probably
make<00:02:28.800> jerky<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.700> doesn't<00:02:30.030> anyway<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.600> next

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
make jerky if it doesn't anyway so next

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.390 
make jerky if it doesn't anyway so next
time<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.080> eat<00:02:31.140> your<00:02:31.230> package<00:02:31.500> jerky<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.980> want

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
time you eat your package jerky I want

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.650 
time you eat your package jerky I want
you<00:02:32.490> think<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.240> top<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.480> a

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
you think is that the top of a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.360 
you think is that the top of a
department<00:02:34.130> critical

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
department critical

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.980 
department critical
I've<00:02:35.790> just<00:02:36.000> finished<00:02:36.120> tying<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.600> up<00:02:36.690> into

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
I've just finished tying it up into

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.230 
I've just finished tying it up into
little<00:02:37.260> bite-sized<00:02:38.160> portions<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:39.030> and

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
little bite-sized portions like this and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.640 
little bite-sized portions like this and
I've<00:02:39.300> got<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> saying<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.080> first<00:02:40.110> food

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
fear I've had to have a bit of water

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.450 
fear I've had to have a bit of water
before<00:02:43.140> even<00:02:43.350> trying<00:02:43.620> I'm<00:02:43.920> just<00:02:44.130> kind<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.370> like

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
before even trying I'm just kind of like

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.640 
before even trying I'm just kind of like
getting<00:02:44.670> really<00:02:44.850> ah<00:02:45.800> right<00:02:46.800> now<00:02:48.320> just<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.440> say

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
getting really ah right now just to say

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.530 
getting really ah right now just to say

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.120 
it is really really stretchy right now
it<00:02:51.690> could<00:02:51.810> probably<00:02:52.050> double<00:02:52.320> up<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.770> silly

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
it could probably double up a silly

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.410 
it could probably double up a silly
putty<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.640> could<00:02:53.760> give<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.090> kids<00:02:54.300> to

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
why I'm always go maybe they're actually
