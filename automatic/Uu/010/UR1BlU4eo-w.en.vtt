bonsai this it is the severe treatment
that<00:00:09.370> we<00:00:09.520> do<00:00:09.700> to<00:00:09.910> the<00:00:09.940> trees<00:00:10.299> and<00:00:10.600> the<00:00:10.660> one<00:00:10.809> who

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.020 
that we do to the trees and the one who

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.010 
that we do to the trees and the one who
is<00:00:11.410> the<00:00:11.680> tree<00:00:11.889> going<00:00:12.129> to<00:00:12.219> survive<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.690> I<00:00:13.779> keep

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.020 
is the tree going to survive and I keep

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.140 
is the tree going to survive and I keep
telling<00:00:14.350> them<00:00:14.469> yes<00:00:14.740> yes<00:00:15.100> because<00:00:15.760> the<00:00:15.879> trees

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
telling them yes yes because the trees

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.300 
telling them yes yes because the trees
are<00:00:16.180> pretty<00:00:16.660> resilient<00:00:16.869> and<00:00:17.619> there<00:00:17.740> they<00:00:18.279> just

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
are pretty resilient and there they just

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.749 
are pretty resilient and there they just
had<00:00:18.609> this<00:00:18.759> very<00:00:18.939> strong<00:00:19.330> will<00:00:19.599> to<00:00:19.630> survive<00:00:20.759> and

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
had this very strong will to survive and

year when I moved to a new place and I

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.600 
year when I moved to a new place and I
left<00:00:43.510> it<00:00:43.690> outside<00:00:43.870> for<00:00:44.620> just<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.280> couple<00:00:45.430> of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
days in winter and that was enough to

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.170 
days in winter and that was enough to
kill<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:50.350> tree<00:00:50.590> I<00:00:50.800> mean<00:00:51.280> after<00:00:51.550> that<00:00:51.670> I<00:00:51.760> moved

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
kill the tree I mean after that I moved

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.420 
kill the tree I mean after that I moved
to<00:00:52.360> tree<00:00:52.600> indoors<00:00:53.230> but<00:00:53.710> it<00:00:53.800> was<00:00:53.890> too<00:00:54.070> late<00:00:54.250> it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
to tree indoors but it was too late it

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.850 
to tree indoors but it was too late it
was<00:00:54.550> losing<00:00:54.760> all<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.240> leaves<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.680> leaves

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
was losing all the leaves the leaves

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.750

but<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.200> know<00:01:35.590> trees<00:01:36.039> are<00:01:36.249> pretty<00:01:36.429> strong<00:01:36.850> and

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
but I I know trees are pretty strong and

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.899 
but I I know trees are pretty strong and
especially<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:38.079> older<00:01:38.380> tree<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:39.460> older<00:01:39.789> the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
especially the older tree the older the

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.450 
especially the older tree the older the
tree<00:01:40.149> is<00:01:40.329> the<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.319> stronger<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:41.829> the<00:01:41.889> survival

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
tree is the the stronger is the survival

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.709 
tree is the the stronger is the survival
and<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:46.479> what<00:01:46.749> I<00:01:47.020> keep<00:01:47.829> watering<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:48.719> for

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
and that's what I keep watering it for

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
know how how I can make this into a

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.309 
know how how I can make this into a
bonsai<00:02:41.709> plant<00:02:42.250> but<00:02:42.579> I<00:02:42.819> will<00:02:43.540> try<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:44.019> mean

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
bonsai plant but I will try I mean

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.619 
bonsai plant but I will try I mean
probably<00:02:44.799> need<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.099> few<00:02:45.310> more<00:02:45.459> years<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.940> growth

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
probably need a few more years of growth

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.949 
probably need a few more years of growth
I<00:02:47.590> got<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.280> nice<00:02:48.670> big<00:02:48.730> trunk<00:02:49.480> here<00:02:49.750> but

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
I got this nice big trunk here but

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.110 
I got this nice big trunk here but
unfortunately<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:51.040> hope<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.489> would<00:02:51.819> have<00:02:51.940> hoped

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
unfortunately I hope I would have hoped

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.759 
unfortunately I hope I would have hoped
that<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.420> new<00:02:52.450> growth<00:02:52.840> would<00:02:53.019> be<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.349> little

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
that the new growth would be a little

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.000 
that the new growth would be a little
bit<00:02:53.829> taller<00:02:54.069> here<00:02:55.079> over<00:02:56.079> your<00:02:56.379> life<00:02:56.560> you'll<00:02:56.980> be

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
bit taller here over your life you'll be

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.449 
bit taller here over your life you'll be
a<00:02:57.129> nice<00:02:57.359> plant<00:02:58.359> but<00:02:58.690> as<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.769> can<00:02:59.859> see<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.250> top

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
a nice plant but as you can see the top

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.089 
a nice plant but as you can see the top
portion<00:03:00.879> here<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.150> all<00:03:01.299> dead<00:03:01.540> all<00:03:02.440> dead<00:03:02.829> wood

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
portion here this all dead all dead wood

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.520 
portion here this all dead all dead wood
here<00:03:04.109> so<00:03:05.109> and<00:03:05.849> I'm<00:03:06.849> hoping<00:03:07.299> that<00:03:07.359> once<00:03:08.079> I<00:03:08.260> start

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
here so and I'm hoping that once I start

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.190 
here so and I'm hoping that once I start
digging<00:03:08.650> maybe<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:09.160> can<00:03:09.370> see<00:03:09.720> maybe<00:03:10.720> until<00:03:11.170> a

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
digging maybe I can see maybe until a

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.170 
digging maybe I can see maybe until a
little<00:03:11.470> bit<00:03:11.739> more<00:03:11.980> than<00:03:12.340> this<00:03:12.519> like<00:03:12.819> that<00:03:13.030> this

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
little bit more than this like that this

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.440 
little bit more than this like that this
is<00:03:13.329> like<00:03:13.450> five<00:03:13.690> inch<00:03:13.959> tall<00:03:14.560> trunk

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
is like five inch tall trunk

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.479 
is like five inch tall trunk
maybe<00:03:17.319> I<00:03:17.349> can<00:03:17.500> get<00:03:17.620> more<00:03:19.380> height<00:03:20.380> if<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.069> dig<00:03:21.280> in

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
maybe I can get more height if I dig in

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.569 
maybe I can get more height if I dig in
and<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.389> somehow<00:03:22.989> try<00:03:23.859> to<00:03:23.919> make<00:03:24.130> this<00:03:24.280> into

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
and and somehow try to make this into

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.479 
and and somehow try to make this into
some<00:03:24.819> kind<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.150> bonsai

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
some kind of bonsai

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.750 
some kind of bonsai
so<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.519> still<00:03:27.910> have<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.209> tree<00:03:29.310> after<00:03:30.310> 10<00:03:30.579> out

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
so I still have this tree after 10 out

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.640 
so I still have this tree after 10 out
years<00:03:31.090> is<00:03:31.510> still<00:03:31.840> surviving<00:03:34.169> so<00:03:35.169> yeah<00:03:35.380> it

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650
