there's<00:00:32.509> had<00:00:32.630> a<00:00:32.660> little<00:00:32.870> piece<00:00:33.079> of<00:00:33.260> kit

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
there's had a little piece of kit

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.959 
there's had a little piece of kit
because<00:00:33.680> you<00:00:33.770> can<00:00:34.010> fit<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:34.280> really<00:00:34.820> easily

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
because you can fit it really easily

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.950 
because you can fit it really easily
into<00:00:35.540> your<00:00:35.690> backpack<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.760> it's<00:00:37.760> a<00:00:38.090> wealth<00:00:38.780> of

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
into your backpack and it's a wealth of

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.709 
into your backpack and it's a wealth of
surprising<00:00:39.680> insight<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:40.879> going<00:00:41.239> to<00:00:41.300> up<00:00:41.420> and

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
surprising insight so going to up and

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.100 
surprising insight so going to up and
have<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:41.960> look<00:00:42.110> at<00:00:42.890> first<00:00:43.129> things<00:00:43.280> first

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
have a look at first things first

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.410 
have a look at first things first
so<00:00:45.110> they<00:00:45.200> pop<00:00:45.379> open<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.129> as<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:46.309> can<00:00:46.430> see<00:00:46.489> nice

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
so they pop open so as you can see nice

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.389 
so they pop open so as you can see nice

on<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.870> other<00:00:57.019> and<00:00:57.890> you<00:00:58.010> use<00:00:58.280> reflectors<00:00:58.699> in

on the other and you use reflectors in
situations<00:00:59.480> where<00:00:59.690> you<00:01:00.260> really<00:01:00.289> want<00:01:00.649> to<00:01:00.769> ink

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
situations where you really want to ink

balance the lightness situation and

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.480 
balance the lightness situation and
maybe<00:01:03.829> add<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.070> little<00:01:04.159> bit<00:01:04.400> more<00:01:04.430> contrast

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
maybe add a little bit more contrast

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.740 
maybe add a little bit more contrast
generally<00:01:07.490> say<00:01:08.000> where<00:01:08.210> I<00:01:08.240> am<00:01:08.330> now<00:01:08.600> I'm

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
standing next to a window coming in and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.280 
standing next to a window coming in and
there's<00:01:11.210> also<00:01:11.330> a<00:01:11.450> light<00:01:11.720> up<00:01:11.900> here<00:01:12.050> that<00:01:12.229> you

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
there's also a light up here that you

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.170 
there's also a light up here that you
probably<00:01:12.380> can't<00:01:12.800> see<00:01:13.040> so<00:01:13.610> if<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:13.820> put<00:01:14.030> a<00:01:14.060> roof

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
probably can't see so if I put a roof

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.630 
probably can't see so if I put a roof
left<00:01:14.420> in<00:01:14.570> close<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.870> my<00:01:14.990> pose<00:01:15.260> you<00:01:16.250> can<00:01:16.400> see<00:01:16.520> you

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
left in close to my pose you can see you

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.270 
left in close to my pose you can see you
get<00:01:16.820> different<00:01:17.000> effects<00:01:17.920> with<00:01:18.920> different

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
get different effects with different

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.400 
get different effects with different
sort<00:01:19.520> of<00:01:19.550> colors<00:01:19.880> now<00:01:20.120> with<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.020> inter<00:01:21.230> fit

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
sort of colors now with the inter fit

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.220 
sort of colors now with the inter fit
system<00:01:21.620> though<00:01:21.980> what<00:01:22.970> you<00:01:23.060> can<00:01:23.180> do<00:01:23.360> is<00:01:23.810> also

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
system though what you can do is also

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.730 
system though what you can do is also
based<00:01:24.500> around<00:01:24.850> this<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.990> can<00:01:27.170> take<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:27.530> bit

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
based around this you can take that bit

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.190 
based around this you can take that bit
out

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.270 

and<00:01:31.560> then<00:01:31.970> I've<00:01:32.970> been<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:36.680> you're<00:01:37.680> out<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> bit

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and then I've been is you're out a bit

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.289 
and then I've been is you're out a bit
if<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.649> flip<00:01:40.649> around<00:01:40.909> and<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:42.090> go

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
if you can then flip around and then go

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:51.450 
if you can then flip around and then go
to<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> other<00:01:42.780> way

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:01.800 

and<00:01:52.539> put<00:01:53.539> the<00:01:53.689> inner<00:01:53.899> dish<00:01:54.110> back<00:01:54.469> in

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.320 

remember<00:02:02.590> real<00:02:02.680> expert<00:02:03.159> at<00:02:03.190> this<00:02:03.460> more

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
remember real expert at this more

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:18.360 
remember real expert at this more
practical<00:02:04.930> pride

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:38.559 

yeah

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.250 

I<00:02:39.159> wonder<00:02:40.159> if<00:02:40.189> all<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.610> way<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.329> let's<00:02:42.110> see

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
I wonder if all the way and let's see

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.330 
I wonder if all the way and let's see
now<00:02:42.439> we've<00:02:42.590> got<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.739> silver<00:02:43.069> reflector<00:02:44.170> and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
now we've got a silver reflector and

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.970 
now we've got a silver reflector and
then<00:02:46.340> we've<00:02:46.459> got<00:02:46.609> a<00:02:46.640> black<00:02:46.989> I'm<00:02:47.989> not<00:02:48.140> sure<00:02:48.260> what

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
then we've got a black I'm not sure what

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.080 
then we've got a black I'm not sure what
you<00:02:49.069> call<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.310> one<00:02:49.549> but<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.730> idea<00:02:49.939> is<00:02:49.969> you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
you call that one but the idea is you

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.360 
you call that one but the idea is you
can<00:02:50.150> use<00:02:50.359> that<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.689> subtract<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.859> light<00:02:52.069> as

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
can use that to subtract to light as

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.449 
can use that to subtract to light as
well<00:02:52.579> from<00:02:52.819> a<00:02:52.939> situation<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.250> silver

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
well from a situation and so the silver

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.770 
well from a situation and so the silver
would<00:02:55.609> dress<00:02:55.790> reflective<00:02:56.269> just<00:02:56.480> hep<00:02:56.599> they

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
would dress reflective just hep they

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.449 
would dress reflective just hep they
tend<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.170> be<00:02:57.319> they<00:02:57.680> can<00:02:57.829> be<00:02:57.920> sometimes<00:02:58.280> a

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
tend to be they can be sometimes a

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.759 
tend to be they can be sometimes a
little<00:02:58.519> bit<00:02:58.640> colder<00:02:59.329> little<00:02:59.599> bit<00:02:59.689> harsher<00:03:00.109> but

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
little bit colder little bit harsher but

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.319 
little bit colder little bit harsher but
useful<00:03:01.129> for<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.549> all<00:03:01.790> sorts<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.120> situations

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
useful for in all sorts of situations

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.770 
useful for in all sorts of situations
and<00:03:03.099> then<00:03:04.099> of<00:03:04.340> course<00:03:04.670> one<00:03:05.090> thing<00:03:05.120> we<00:03:05.629> haven't

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
and then of course one thing we haven't

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.330 
and then of course one thing we haven't
really<00:03:05.959> looked<00:03:06.079> at<00:03:06.549> is<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:10.569> diffuser<00:03:11.569> I<00:03:12.340> mean

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
really looked at is the diffuser I mean

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.740 
really looked at is the diffuser I mean
you<00:03:13.430> can't<00:03:13.639> I<00:03:13.760> guess<00:03:13.939> you<00:03:14.060> could<00:03:14.209> use<00:03:14.389> this<00:03:14.569> as

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
you can't I guess you could use this as

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.869 
you can't I guess you could use this as
a<00:03:14.780> reflector<00:03:15.290> as<00:03:15.409> well<00:03:15.590> if<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.799> wanted<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.250> but

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
a reflector as well if you wanted to but

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.670 
a reflector as well if you wanted to but
the<00:03:17.150> idea<00:03:17.480> really<00:03:17.629> with<00:03:17.870> this<00:03:18.049> is<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.560> you

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
the idea really with this is that you

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.940 
the idea really with this is that you
could<00:03:19.099> put<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.370> over<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:20.230> light<00:03:21.230> source<00:03:21.560> and

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
could put it over a light source and

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.309 
could put it over a light source and
then<00:03:22.579> it<00:03:22.700> would<00:03:22.819> diffuse<00:03:23.239> light<00:03:23.900> coming

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
then it would diffuse light coming

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.500 
then it would diffuse light coming
through<00:03:24.790> you'd<00:03:25.790> leave<00:03:26.000> them<00:03:26.120> kinda<00:03:26.389> I<00:03:26.419> guess

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
through you'd leave them kinda I guess

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.030 
through you'd leave them kinda I guess
hold<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:26.959> in<00:03:27.019> front<00:03:27.109> of<00:03:27.290> an<00:03:27.349> off-camera<00:03:27.709> flash

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
hold it in front of an off-camera flash

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.339 
hold it in front of an off-camera flash
it<00:03:28.609> would<00:03:28.730> turn<00:03:28.909> into<00:03:28.939> a<00:03:29.239> bit<00:03:29.419> of<00:03:29.510> a<00:03:29.540> big<00:03:29.720> soft

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
it would turn into a bit of a big soft

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.819 
it would turn into a bit of a big soft
book<00:03:30.590> type<00:03:30.980> thing<00:03:31.540> but<00:03:32.540> comes<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:33.019> useful<00:03:33.439> for

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
book type thing but comes in useful for

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.800 
book type thing but comes in useful for
nobody<00:03:34.370> say<00:03:34.519> you're<00:03:34.669> outside<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.269> on<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.540> sunny

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
nobody say you're outside in on a sunny

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.860 
nobody say you're outside in on a sunny
day<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:36.290> could<00:03:37.189> hold<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.489> above<00:03:38.480> your

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
day you could hold that above your

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.659 
day you could hold that above your
subject<00:03:39.290> just<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.650> get<00:03:39.769> them<00:03:39.919> into<00:03:40.129> shade<00:03:40.400> just

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
subject just to get them into shade just

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.659 
subject just to get them into shade just
to<00:03:41.000> have<00:03:41.359> your<00:03:41.510> balance<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.870> light<00:03:41.989> as<00:03:42.200> well

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
to have your balance the light as well

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.550 
to have your balance the light as well
and<00:03:43.669> the<00:03:44.599> thing<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.840> really<00:03:45.079> like<00:03:45.169> about<00:03:45.229> the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
and the thing I really like about the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.170 
and the thing I really like about the
interface<00:03:45.889> or<00:03:46.220> system<00:03:46.579> is<00:03:46.639> because<00:03:46.940> it's<00:03:47.060> all

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
interface or system is because it's all

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.809 
interface or system is because it's all
based<00:03:47.419> around<00:03:47.599> off<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.739> idea<00:03:49.069> that<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.669> all

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
based around off the idea that it all

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.020 
based around off the idea that it all
and<00:03:50.299> fold<00:03:50.599> up<00:03:50.979> really<00:03:51.979> really<00:03:52.250> small<00:03:52.519> it<00:03:52.970> fits

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030
