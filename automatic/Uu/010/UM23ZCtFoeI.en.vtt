first-generation st40 models I'm

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.440 
first-generation st40 models I'm
guessing<00:02:02.369> mystic<00:02:02.640> order<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.030> used<00:02:03.240> also

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
guessing mystic order can be used also

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.300 
guessing mystic order can be used also
to<00:02:03.600> be<00:02:03.960> surveyed<00:02:04.290> tattoos<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.009> stuff<00:02:05.070> like
