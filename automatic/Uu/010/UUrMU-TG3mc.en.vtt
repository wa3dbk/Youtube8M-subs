times so toe Blake probably i don't know

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:37.220 
times so toe Blake probably i don't know
if<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.390> game<00:00:36.539> that<00:00:36.570> i<00:00:36.719> look<00:00:36.899> forward<00:00:37.109> to

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
if it's a game that i look forward to

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.139 
if it's a game that i look forward to
most<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.800> definitely<00:00:37.949> the<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.609> is

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
most but it's definitely the one that is

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.149 
most but it's definitely the one that is
the<00:00:39.629> team<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.839> I<00:00:40.050> most<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.769> these<00:00:40.949> that<00:00:41.100> I

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
the team that I most like these that I

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.930 
the team that I most like these that I
hate<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.519> most<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:42.350> when<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:44.010> consider

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
hate the most is when you have consider

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.579 
hate the most is when you have consider
the<00:00:45.059> games<00:00:45.359> that<00:00:45.510> you've<00:00:45.719> had<00:00:45.989> against<00:00:46.350> them

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
the games that you've had against them

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.410 
the games that you've had against them
in<00:00:46.679> the<00:00:46.769> past<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.219> sometimes<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:48.059> what's<00:00:48.300> on

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
in the past and sometimes with what's on

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.389 
in the past and sometimes with what's on
the<00:00:48.569> line<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.260> lend<00:00:49.710> itself<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.280> that

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the line is that lend itself to that

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.779 
the line is that lend itself to that
kind<00:00:50.699> of<00:00:50.819> a<00:00:50.909> rivalry<00:00:51.390> uh<00:00:51.690> yes<00:00:52.499> but<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.399> it's

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
kind of a rivalry uh yes but for me it's

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.180 
kind of a rivalry uh yes but for me it's
that's<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.929> reason<00:00:55.109> why<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.589> just<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.039> just

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
that's not the reason why I just I just

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.629 
that's not the reason why I just I just
don't<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.729> them<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:58.190> want<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.219> go<00:00:59.339> and<00:00:59.519> good

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
year when they thought that they put a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.970 
year when they thought that they put a
pretty<00:01:39.840> brand<00:01:40.080> of<00:01:40.170> soccer<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.860> guys

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
pretty brand of soccer and you guys

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.700 
pretty brand of soccer and you guys
didn't<00:01:41.370> I<00:01:41.600> mean<00:01:42.600> yeah<00:01:42.750> that's<00:01:42.780> definitely<00:01:43.380> one

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
didn't I mean yeah that's definitely one

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.469 
didn't I mean yeah that's definitely one
of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.920> things

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
of the things

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.690 
of the things
shows<00:01:45.479> their<00:01:45.719> personality<00:01:47.060> I<00:01:48.289> just<00:01:49.289> think

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
shows their personality I just think

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.450 
shows their personality I just think
it's<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.780> true<00:01:52.109> what<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.219> know<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
it's not really true what you know the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.179 
it's not really true what you know the
things<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.789> they<00:01:53.909> say<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:55.049> they're<00:01:56.009> allowed

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
things that they say but they're allowed

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.109 
things that they say but they're allowed
to<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.399> their<00:01:56.429> opinions<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:56.969> we're

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
to have their opinions that we're

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.240 
to have their opinions that we're
allowed<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.450> bars<00:01:58.069> does<00:01:59.069> that<00:01:59.189> change

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
allowed to have bars does that change

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.910 
allowed to have bars does that change
with<00:01:59.640> Christ<00:02:00.179> living<00:02:00.509> or<00:02:00.659> still<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.289> same<00:02:01.469> um

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
with Christ living or still the same um

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.699 
with Christ living or still the same um
I<00:02:03.890> think<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:06.319> I'll<00:02:07.319> take<00:02:07.590> their

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
I think it's I'll take their

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:08.930 
I think it's I'll take their
personalities<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.280> changed<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.640> much<00:02:08.759> maybe

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
personalities have changed so much maybe

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.360 
personalities have changed so much maybe
they're<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.899> style<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.410> their<00:02:10.649> their<00:02:11.190> game

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
they're the style of their their game

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.940 
they're the style of their their game
has<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.230> still<00:02:13.230> think<00:02:13.470> they<00:02:13.590> think<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
has but I still think they think the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.289 
has but I still think they think the
same<00:02:14.160> way<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:16.739> see<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.950> used<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:18.060> year

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
same way you see I used to this year

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.079 
same way you see I used to this year
under<00:02:18.900> own
