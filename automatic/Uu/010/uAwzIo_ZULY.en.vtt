00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.160
 for when they want to root their 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.650
 device that we know in advance that 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.220
 this model is already semi surrounded and what 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.580
 only thing you need is the application 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.920
 that application is installed with one another 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.790
 application called the rotc program but 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.470
 that area 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.280
 on another occasion the video tutorial of 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.280
 how to root 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.409
 first here where it says download e 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.409
 install the drivers 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.110
 I will not do it anymore because I have them and 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.430
 they also download this called the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.430
 motionless and from there 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.840
 when you download this it's not going to 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.580
 disappear to no program but this 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.330
 If you have your program we are going to address 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.840
 to him it would be this that is the mobile his 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.840
 portal 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.510
 Well I'm not going to be open 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.690
 from here but you open it 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.570
 they connect their phone 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.890
 they wait for me to load the drivers because 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:15.620
 the first time they have installed it 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.760
 they wait a moment before opening the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.760
 the support 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.640
 after a while when you see it already 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.700
 appears here in the part of in your house 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.650
 will appear at the bottom because 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.970
 I have the status bar upside down 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.040
 or of tasks and you here already when 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.569
 tell your phone your device is 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.019
 ready to use is when then 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.629
 will know in this that it would be something like this 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.579
 if you open them different do not be scared 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.650
 because when I first thing what 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:52.459
 install also came out different but it 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.500
 updated and stayed that way when I installed it 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.189
 in the place that says a little like 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.890
 tutorial or specification as there is 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.890
 connect it connect the pc software 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.100
 if all drivers are ok 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.830
 installed that already installed them from 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.560
 then earlier where it says install 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.660
 controller would no longer be necessary just 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.459
 wait for the connection once it 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.299
 connect here this is going to light 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.760
 this that says initial update you 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.610
 give to is and your phone will be updated from 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.830
 factory once it is prescribed 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.650
 and to say that the update has 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.080
 finished they unplug it do not go to 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.120
 disconnect because I do not remember if it 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.030
 reset the phone two or three times 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.150
 it's only until it's over 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:46.199
 I hope the whole process has served you 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.379
 this tutorial I dismiss like and up 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.379
