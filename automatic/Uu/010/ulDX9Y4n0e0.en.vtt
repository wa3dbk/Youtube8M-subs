00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.760 

here's<00:01:56.600> an<00:01:56.720> example<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.289> number<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:57.649> is

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
here's an example of the number this is

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:06.520 
here's an example of the number this is
number<00:01:58.070> one<00:01:58.220> so<00:02:04.630> all<00:02:05.630> we<00:02:05.720> do<00:02:05.840> is<00:02:05.990> start<00:02:06.200> for<00:02:06.439> the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
number one so all we do is start for the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.830 
number one so all we do is start for the
specification<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.460> these<00:02:08.000> bolt<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.450> just<00:02:08.660> dip

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
specification so these bolt you just dip

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.300 
specification so these bolt you just dip
it<00:02:08.959> in<00:02:09.050> oil<00:02:09.229> stick<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:09.679> in<00:02:09.769> here<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:15.010> we<00:02:16.010> found

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
it in oil stick it in here and we found

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.400 
it in oil stick it in here and we found
for<00:02:16.519> this<00:02:16.640> engine<00:02:18.970> we<00:02:19.970> need<00:02:20.140> 65<00:02:21.140> foot-pounds

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
for this engine we need 65 foot-pounds

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.699 
for this engine we need 65 foot-pounds
on<00:02:21.980> these<00:02:22.280> bolts<00:02:23.049> how<00:02:24.049> do<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.319> know<00:02:24.470> if<00:02:24.590> it's

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
on these bolts how do you know if it's

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.259 
on these bolts how do you know if it's
65<00:02:25.280> foot-pounds<00:02:25.519> we<00:02:25.940> use<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:28.030> torque<00:02:29.030> wrench

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
65 foot-pounds we use this torque wrench

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.420 
65 foot-pounds we use this torque wrench
and<00:02:29.540> read<00:02:29.959> what<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.200> says<00:02:31.209> all<00:02:32.209> right<00:02:33.430> so

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
and read what it says all right so

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.660 
and read what it says all right so
here's<00:02:34.640> our<00:02:34.760> scale<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:37.040> can<00:02:37.190> see<00:02:37.340> as<00:02:37.459> we

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
here's our scale you can see as we

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.759 
here's our scale you can see as we
tighten<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:40.819> shows<00:02:41.500> larger<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.620> larger

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
tighten it it shows larger and larger

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.759 
tighten it it shows larger and larger
amounts<00:02:43.569> okay<00:02:44.569> so<00:02:44.630> we're<00:02:44.930> done<00:02:45.110> on<00:02:45.290> this<00:02:45.410> one

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
amounts okay so we're done on this one

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:53.860 
amounts okay so we're done on this one

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
to do now is you're going to rip off a

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.170 
to do now is you're going to rip off a
little<00:03:01.459> piece<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:02.829> have<00:03:03.829> millimeter<00:03:04.819> on<00:03:04.970> this

the little plastic gauge and more
squashed<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:26.180> tighter<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.660> clearance

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
squashed it is the tighter the clearance

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.539 
squashed it is the tighter the clearance
will<00:03:27.230> be<00:03:29.319> was<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.500> torque<00:03:30.799> measurement<00:03:31.010> you

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
will be was the torque measurement you

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:37.400 
will be was the torque measurement you
wanted<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:31.970> do<00:03:32.350> 65<00:03:33.350> foot<00:03:34.150> for<00:03:35.150> both<00:03:35.329> bolts<00:03:35.630> yeah

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
wanted to do 65 foot for both bolts yeah

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.280 
wanted to do 65 foot for both bolts yeah
and<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.670> same<00:03:38.910> for<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.270> other<00:03:39.450> three

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
and it's the same for the other three

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.510 
and it's the same for the other three
yes<00:03:41.630> however<00:03:42.630> these<00:03:42.780> are<00:03:42.840> smaller<00:03:43.340> for<00:03:44.340> later

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
yes however these are smaller for later

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.780 
yes however these are smaller for later

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
some engine scented only 45 okay now we

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.410 
some engine scented only 45 okay now we
take<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.820> off<00:04:01.100> see<00:04:02.100> what<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.250> looks<00:04:02.430> like<00:04:05.420> you

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
take it off see what it looks like you

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:14.510 
take it off see what it looks like you
can<00:04:06.570> see<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.750> mark<00:04:07.050> both<00:04:07.260> on<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.650> cap<00:04:08.550> and<00:04:13.520> the

can see a mark both on the cap and the
Lighting's<00:04:15.000> not<00:04:15.180> now<00:04:15.540> we<00:04:15.600> take<00:04:15.900> our<00:04:16.080> little

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
Lighting's not now we take our little

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:35.110 
Lighting's not now we take our little
piece<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.470> paper<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:21.350> stick<00:04:22.350> it<00:04:22.470> in<00:04:22.590> there

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.100 

see<00:04:35.690> what<00:04:35.930> number<00:04:36.230> does<00:04:36.320> that<00:04:36.500> appear<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.830> me

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
see what number does that appear to me

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:46.040 
see what number does that appear to me
the<00:04:39.110> smallest<00:04:39.440> one

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.460 

looks<00:04:46.590> like<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.889> smallest<00:04:47.280> one<00:04:51.080> so<00:04:52.080> let's<00:04:52.350> see

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
looks like the smallest one so let's see

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.510 
looks like the smallest one so let's see
what's<00:04:52.650> our<00:04:52.800> smallest<00:04:53.100> one<00:04:53.400> here<00:04:55.250> we've<00:04:56.250> got

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
what's our smallest one here we've got

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.820 
what's our smallest one here we've got
one<00:04:56.699> thousand<00:04:57.300> one<00:04:57.599> and<00:04:57.750> a<00:04:57.780> half<00:04:57.960> two<00:04:58.289> thousand

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
one thousand one and a half two thousand

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.040 
one thousand one and a half two thousand
three<00:04:59.039> thousand<00:04:59.610> so<00:05:00.569> this<00:05:00.690> one<00:05:00.810> is<00:05:00.930> about

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
three thousand so this one is about

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.409 
three thousand so this one is about
three<00:05:01.349> thousand<00:05:01.860> clearance<00:05:02.280> which<00:05:03.030> is<00:05:03.180> fun

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
three thousand clearance which is fun

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.170 
three thousand clearance which is fun
you<00:05:04.349> couldn't<00:05:04.680> see<00:05:04.889> cuz<00:05:05.190> of<00:05:05.340> your<00:05:05.610> finger<00:05:05.970> shed

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
you couldn't see cuz of your finger shed

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.939 
you couldn't see cuz of your finger shed
so<00:05:06.690> we've<00:05:06.840> we've<00:05:07.020> already<00:05:07.259> done<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.680> to<00:05:07.800> these

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
so we've we've already done it to these

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.170 
so we've we've already done it to these
other<00:05:08.160> two<00:05:08.250> so<00:05:08.729> we<00:05:08.819> can<00:05:08.970> take<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.150> look<00:05:09.360> at<00:05:09.449> these

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
other two so we can take a look at these

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.249 
other two so we can take a look at these
see<00:05:12.180> what's<00:05:12.389> clearance<00:05:12.780> we<00:05:12.870> have<00:05:12.930> on<00:05:13.139> the

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
see what's clearance we have on the

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:21.520 
see what's clearance we have on the
other<00:05:13.349> ones<00:05:15.410> hopefully<00:05:16.410> will<00:05:16.800> be<00:05:16.919> similar

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.930 

okay<00:05:22.530> this<00:05:22.740> one<00:05:22.949> let's<00:05:23.340> look<00:05:23.430> at<00:05:23.639> this<00:05:23.759> one

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
okay this one let's look at this one

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.600 
okay this one let's look at this one
first

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
first

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.870 
first
let's<00:05:26.610> see<00:05:29.599> set<00:05:30.599> with<00:05:30.810> look<00:05:31.050> about<00:05:31.259> the<00:05:31.440> same

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
let's see set with look about the same

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.180 
let's see set with look about the same
the<00:05:32.880> width<00:05:33.060> of<00:05:33.210> that<00:05:34.940> green<00:05:35.940> about<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.990> same

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
the width of that green about the same

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.790 
the width of that green about the same
yeah<00:05:38.190> white<00:05:38.430> one<00:05:38.639> okay<00:05:39.060> so<00:05:39.240> that<00:05:40.020> is<00:05:40.050> also<00:05:40.530> the

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
yeah white one okay so that is also the

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.740 
yeah white one okay so that is also the
3000th<00:05:41.400> marker<00:05:41.729> so<00:05:41.880> let's<00:05:42.060> come<00:05:42.240> over<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.539> see

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
3000th marker so let's come over to see
