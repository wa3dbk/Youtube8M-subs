00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
different thought process on some things

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.069 
different thought process on some things
and<00:00:44.040> one<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> things<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.809> way<00:00:46.020> too

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and one of the things that I see way too

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.369 
and one of the things that I see way too
often<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.680> people<00:00:48.140> misunderstanding<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
often is people misunderstanding the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.540 
often is people misunderstanding the
difference<00:00:49.890> between<00:00:50.180> failing<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.390> quitting

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
difference between failing and quitting

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.069 
difference between failing and quitting
people<00:00:53.550> often<00:00:53.910> say<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:54.690> fail

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
people often say that if they fail

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.900 
people often say that if they fail
that's<00:00:55.320> something<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.739> they<00:00:56.010> are<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> failure

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
that's something that they are a failure

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.160 
that's something that they are a failure
so<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.930> turn<00:00:58.350> they<00:00:58.980> quit<00:00:59.780> quitting<00:01:00.780> means<00:01:00.989> they

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
so in turn they quit quitting means they

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.840 
so in turn they quit quitting means they
stopped<00:01:01.710> doing<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:02.579> stopped<00:01:02.820> doing

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
stopped doing it they stopped doing

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.600 
stopped doing it they stopped doing
something<00:01:03.650> now<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> use<00:01:05.489> an

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
something now I'm going to use an

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.940 
something now I'm going to use an
example<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.600> road<00:01:06.840> test<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.409> because<00:01:07.740> it's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
example of a road test just because it's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.940 
example of a road test just because it's
the<00:01:08.040> easiest<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.909> explain<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.799> actually

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the easiest to explain and it actually

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.940 
the easiest to explain and it actually
makes<00:01:11.250> sense<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.409> your<00:01:13.409> 16<00:01:13.830> or

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
makes sense so here we have your 16 or

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.070 
makes sense so here we have your 16 or
17<00:01:14.369> years<00:01:14.400> old<00:01:14.729> you're<00:01:15.270> about<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.630> go<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.930> your

road test you've been practicing doing

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.630 
road test you've been practicing doing
everything<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.960> were<00:01:19.080> told<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.460> go

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
everything you were told to do you go

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.130 
everything you were told to do you go
ahead<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.880> take<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> road<00:01:21.360> test<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.840> you

failed that is a failed attempt at your
road<00:01:27.540> test<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.770> never<00:01:29.369> go<00:01:29.640> back<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.150> take

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
road test if you never go back and take

road test if you never go back and take
that<00:01:30.509> road<00:01:30.750> test<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.740> quit<00:01:32.250> you're<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> quitter

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
that road test you quit you're a quitter

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.679 
that road test you quit you're a quitter
that<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.890> thing<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.759> don't<00:01:36.150> want<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
that is one thing that we don't want and

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.569 
that is one thing that we don't want and
it<00:01:36.990> may<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.950> lack<00:01:38.250> confidence

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
it may be because you lack confidence

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.719 
it may be because you lack confidence
you<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.270> self-doubt<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> fear<00:01:41.700> of

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you have self-doubt you have a fear of

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.569 
you have self-doubt you have a fear of
failing<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.020> don't<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.710> again<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.399> is

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
failing so you don't do it again that is

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.270 
failing so you don't do it again that is
probably<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.119> weakest<00:01:45.869> most<00:01:46.530> unappealing

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
probably the weakest most unappealing

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.030 
probably the weakest most unappealing
characteristic<00:01:48.210> somebody<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:49.040> unless

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
characteristic somebody can have unless

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.350 
characteristic somebody can have unless
of<00:01:50.220> course<00:01:50.250> you're<00:01:50.549> quitting<00:01:50.939> an<00:01:51.030> unhealthy

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
of course you're quitting an unhealthy

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.350 
of course you're quitting an unhealthy
habit<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.110> that's<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> different<00:01:52.799> video

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
habit but that's for a different video

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.929 
habit but that's for a different video
so<00:01:54.360> what<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.430> ahead<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.820> we

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
so what do we do we go ahead and we

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.670 
so what do we do we go ahead and we
return<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.810> road<00:01:58.020> test<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.350> we

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
return to that road test and we

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.150 
return to that road test and we
get<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.890> second<00:01:59.250> time<00:01:59.370> and<00:01:59.610> we<00:02:00.540> fell<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.950> is

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
get a second time and we fell that is

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
the take-home message of this really is

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.730 
the take-home message of this really is
success<00:05:30.800> is<00:05:31.009> something<00:05:31.669> that<00:05:32.199> like<00:05:33.199> I<00:05:33.320> said<00:05:33.560> it

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
success is something that like I said it

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.790 
success is something that like I said it
is<00:05:33.770> a<00:05:34.159> temporary<00:05:34.699> if<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:36.050> believe<00:05:36.470> that<00:05:36.500> you

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
is a temporary if you believe that you

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.529 
is a temporary if you believe that you
reach<00:05:37.039> success<00:05:37.490> and<00:05:37.729> now<00:05:37.820> you<00:05:37.940> just<00:05:38.180> cruise

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
misunderstanding of what success really

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.600
