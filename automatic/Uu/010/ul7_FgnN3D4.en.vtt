00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.140 
come down to the last five six minutes
but<00:03:33.680> if<00:03:33.799> they<00:03:33.920> don't<00:03:34.100> shoot<00:03:34.430> well<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:34.700> think

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
but if they don't shoot well I think

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.390 
but if they don't shoot well I think
Kentucky<00:03:35.660> can<00:03:36.049> win<00:03:36.230> comfortable<00:03:36.920> yeah<00:03:37.370> I

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
Kentucky can win comfortable yeah I

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.310 
Kentucky can win comfortable yeah I
think<00:03:37.760> this<00:03:38.120> could<00:03:38.299> be<00:03:38.329> Kentucky's<00:03:38.780> hardest

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
think this could be Kentucky's hardest

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.660 
think this could be Kentucky's hardest
came<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.739> season<00:03:40.070> because<00:03:40.160> I<00:03:40.310> think<00:03:40.370> this

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
came to the season because I think this

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.120

with the way Notre Dame just carve a

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.130 
with the way Notre Dame just carve a

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
state in the second half and after the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.780

about<00:03:50.030> sort<00:03:50.209> of<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.420> blueprint<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.019> be

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
about sort of the blueprint to be

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.229 
about sort of the blueprint to be
Kentucky<00:03:51.709> you<00:03:52.160> can't<00:03:52.400> score<00:03:52.670> inside<00:03:52.820> you<00:03:53.120> got

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
Kentucky you can't score inside you got

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:53.809 
Kentucky you can't score inside you got
them<00:03:53.390> around

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
them around

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.550 
them around
and<00:03:53.999> like<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.299> mentioned<00:03:54.329> Notre<00:03:55.170> Dame<00:03:55.379> at

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
and like you mentioned Notre Dame at

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.989 
and like you mentioned Notre Dame at
least<00:03:55.709> has<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:55.920> potential<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.579> do<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.969> I

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:56.999 
least has the potential to do that I

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:58.459 
least has the potential to do that I
still<00:03:57.269> think<00:03:57.510> Kentucky<00:03:57.749> a<00:03:57.959> win<00:03:58.170> because<00:03:58.260> they

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:58.469 
still think Kentucky a win because they

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:00.259 
still think Kentucky a win because they
have<00:03:58.560> too<00:03:58.709> much<00:03:58.859> athleticism<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.849> think<00:04:00.209> this

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
have too much athleticism I think this

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.580 
have too much athleticism I think this
could<00:04:00.480> be<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.689> hardest<00:04:00.959> name<00:04:01.170> of<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.409> year

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
could be the hardest name of the year

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.679 
could be the hardest name of the year
