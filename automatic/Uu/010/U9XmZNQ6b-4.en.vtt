00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 hi partisans how are you today 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:16.340
 for the day I have prepared some 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:19.880
 recipes are very close and very fast 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.600
 for this Christmas with all our 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.600
 family 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.230
 for the first snack we are going to 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.230
 need a pre pizza they sell it in 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.240
 any supermarket we put it in a 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.210
 dish and we put sauce 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.690
 we spread it well and now we put the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.690
 palette 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.220
 now we cut cream cheese and if 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.220
 we put everywhere 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.100
 ah 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.950
 Now we take them to the microwave to 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.950
 that all the cheese melts 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.289
 ah 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.560
 we have to split all the cheese by 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.410
 the whole track now let's cut the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.660
 pizza but not in the traditional way the 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.260
 let's cut into more triangles 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.260
 little ones 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.720
 ah 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.479
 we're also going to need grids 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.820
 with a knife we are going to make you a 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.880
 small hole in the bottom 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.850
 of our pizza and we're going to put a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.579
 little gray and it will be like that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.930
 with this form of tree now we are going to 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.050
 cut tomatoes 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.120
 in little squares and olives and 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.509
 if you do not like olives too 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.660
 can replace it with green browns 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.580
 the idea that makes red and green if 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.650
 we put them in the portions and so 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.650
 there are some little trees of pizza 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.510
 no no no 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.480
 for this recipe we are going to need a 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.400
 apple we cut the top part and 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.360
 then with a spoon we are removing 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.210
 everything inside is not very difficult to 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.010
 do and it's not wasted so much 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.380
 because more than anything what we take away 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.380
 is the part of the seeds 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.770
 when you finish it will be of this 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.290
 way 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.290
 now we are going to cut the fruits that 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.370
 you like them I cut kiwis and 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.600
 bananas in very small pieces 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.930
 you can cut the fruits that you 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.930
 want 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.550
 now let's put a little juice 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.510
 inside our apple and all the 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.510
 fruits that we cut 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.600
 we put the capita a little slice of 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.180
 kiwi to decorate and in this way 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.920
 we have a very fruit salad 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.810
 The Argentine won for 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.970

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.650
 Now we're going to need a banana 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.650
 we are going to cut it into cubes 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.490
 and now with some skewers of skewers 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.160
 we are going to nail him 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.010
 let's nail it in one 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.100
 and we're going to put sweet chocolate 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.440
 milk what you want 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.440
 all over the banana 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.510
 and now we pass it by grana or by 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.269
 some rich things that you like 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.069

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.069

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.420
 ah 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.810
 Now we choose a nice jar or glass in 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.769
 where they want to put the bananas and what 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.900
