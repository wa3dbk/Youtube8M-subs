when<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.619> turned<00:00:32.009> off<00:00:32.420> so<00:00:33.420> as<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.780> see

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
when it is turned off so as you can see

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.729 
when it is turned off so as you can see
there's<00:00:34.850> there's<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.030> half<00:00:36.360> inch<00:00:36.600> bezel<00:00:37.170> here

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
there's there's a half inch bezel here

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.490 
there's there's a half inch bezel here
which<00:00:38.640> makes<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.969> very<00:00:39.030> sleek<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:40.200> there<00:00:40.350> is

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
which makes it very sleek but there is

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.850 
which makes it very sleek but there is
some<00:00:40.710> space<00:00:41.219> some<00:00:42.120> black<00:00:42.360> space<00:00:42.750> between<00:00:43.489> the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
some space some black space between the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.709 
some space some black space between the
the<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.100> actual<00:00:47.550> projection<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> screen

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the the actual projection of the screen

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.459 
the the actual projection of the screen
and<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.649> bezel<00:00:50.489> itself<00:00:51.120> well<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.110> maybe<00:00:52.289> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and the bezel itself well like maybe a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.430 
and the bezel itself well like maybe a
quarter<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.010> an<00:00:53.100> inch<00:00:53.780> but<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.110> every

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
quarter of an inch but that's in every

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.490 
quarter of an inch but that's in every
television<00:00:56.360> HDTV<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.690> notice<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.320> it's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
television HDTV if you notice so it's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.450 
television HDTV if you notice so it's
not<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.039> one

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
not just this one

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.990 
not just this one
so<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.809> bezel<00:01:01.140> alone<00:01:01.350> itself<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.100> pretty<00:01:02.640> thin

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
so the bezel alone itself is pretty thin

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.830 
so the bezel alone itself is pretty thin
but<00:01:03.210> there's<00:01:04.199> actually<00:01:04.739> also<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.840> quarter

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
but there's actually also like a quarter

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.160 
but there's actually also like a quarter
inch<00:01:07.020> gap<00:01:07.260> or<00:01:07.830> maybe<00:01:08.780> like<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:11.299> you<00:01:12.299> know<00:01:12.330> 3/16

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
inch gap or maybe like to you know 3/16

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.249 
inch gap or maybe like to you know 3/16
of<00:01:13.380> an<00:01:13.500> inch<00:01:13.619> gap<00:01:13.950> between<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.600> actual<00:01:15.960> image

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
of an inch gap between the actual image

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.120 
of an inch gap between the actual image
itself<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> bezel<00:01:17.630> yeah<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.770> silver

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
itself and the bezel yeah so this silver

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.420 
itself and the bezel yeah so this silver
part<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> bezel<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.509> an<00:01:21.689> inch<00:01:22.049> thick

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
part of the bezel is about an inch thick

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.690 
part of the bezel is about an inch thick
but<00:01:23.430> you'll<00:01:23.580> you'll<00:01:23.820> see<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.600> an<00:01:24.930> extra

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
but you'll you'll see there is an extra

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.749 
but you'll you'll see there is an extra
probably<00:01:26.700> half<00:01:26.909> an<00:01:27.150> inch<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.570> sticks<00:01:27.930> out

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
probably half an inch that sticks out

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.800 
probably half an inch that sticks out
for<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> other<00:01:30.090> stuff<00:01:30.530> from<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> back<00:01:32.810> so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
for the other stuff from the back so

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.960 
for the other stuff from the back so
you'll<00:01:33.990> notice<00:01:34.229> that's<00:01:34.619> how<00:01:34.799> thin<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.310> now

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and I've I've had two of these Vizio

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.740 
and I've I've had two of these Vizio
televisions<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.880> they<00:02:03.060> both<00:02:03.299> had<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.719> same

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
televisions and they both had the same

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.560 
televisions and they both had the same
issue<00:02:04.159> so<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.189> don't<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.790> if<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.180> regular

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
issue so I don't know if it's a regular

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.059 
issue so I don't know if it's a regular
thing<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.140> television<00:02:07.710> which<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.039> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
thing with this television which is a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.570 
thing with this television which is a
shame<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:10.099> there's<00:02:11.099> not<00:02:11.280> too<00:02:11.430> many

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
shame because there's not too many

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.430 
shame because there's not too many
televisions<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.510> are<00:02:12.569> designed<00:02:13.050> with<00:02:13.170> such

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
televisions that are designed with such

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.700 
televisions that are designed with such
as

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
as

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.420 
as
week<00:02:14.330> stand<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.780> design<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:18.710> is<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:20.340> know

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
week stand and design and is you know

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.630 
week stand and design and is you know
this<00:02:20.760> kind<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.780> disappeared

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.900 

to<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.000> back<00:02:27.650> let<00:02:28.650> me<00:02:28.770> shift<00:02:29.070> this<00:02:29.220> here<00:02:29.640> so

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
to the back let me shift this here so

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.360 
to the back let me shift this here so
there's<00:02:30.090> more<00:02:30.330> lighting<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:34.110> plug<00:02:34.470> itself<00:02:34.950> is

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
there's more lighting the plug itself is

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.900 
there's more lighting the plug itself is
actually<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:36.060> two<00:02:36.390> prong<00:02:36.750> plug<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.730> it's

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
actually a two prong plug so it's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.490 
actually a two prong plug so it's
actually<00:02:39.060> very<00:02:39.300> thin<00:02:39.780> cable<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.380> it's

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
actually very thin cable and it's

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.360 
actually very thin cable and it's
recessed<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.490> case<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.970> want<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.240> hang<00:02:42.480> it

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
recessed and in case you want to hang it

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.710 
recessed and in case you want to hang it
but<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:44.520> like<00:02:44.790> one<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.000> those<00:02:45.150> two<00:02:45.420> prong

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
but it's like one of those two prong

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.720 
but it's like one of those two prong
plugs<00:02:46.050> there's<00:02:46.560> no<00:02:46.830> ground<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:50.400> I

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
plugs there's no ground to it and if I

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.810 
plugs there's no ground to it and if I
go<00:02:50.940> across<00:02:51.650> also<00:02:52.650> you'll<00:02:52.980> see<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.610> how

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
go across also you'll see this is how

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.150 
go across also you'll see this is how
the<00:02:53.880> stand<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.870> basically<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.980> three

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
the stand is and basically the three

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.920 
the stand is and basically the three
screws<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.850> just<00:02:57.060> screw<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.720> back

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
screws you just screw in in the back

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.960 
screws you just screw in in the back
here<00:02:59.330> and<00:03:00.530> it's<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.980> assembly<00:03:02.400> itself<00:03:02.730> is

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
here and it's it the assembly itself is

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.670 
here and it's it the assembly itself is
the<00:03:03.090> simplest<00:03:03.540> assemblies<00:03:04.230> out<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.500> all<00:03:04.650> of

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
the simplest assemblies out of all of

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.280 
the simplest assemblies out of all of
the<00:03:05.040> HD<00:03:05.910> TVs<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.630> I've<00:03:06.750> had<00:03:08.990> just<00:03:09.990> want<00:03:10.200> to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
the HD TVs that I've had just want to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.550 
the HD TVs that I've had just want to
get<00:03:10.440> more<00:03:10.650> lighting<00:03:11.220> here<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.900> I'm<00:03:13.020> pushing<00:03:13.320> it

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
get more lighting here so I'm pushing it

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.940 
get more lighting here so I'm pushing it
across<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.990> don't<00:03:16.140> block<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.560> lighting

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
across and so I don't block the lighting

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.420 
across and so I don't block the lighting
you'll<00:03:17.550> see<00:03:17.850> that's<00:03:19.460> the<00:03:20.460> plug<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:22.950> this

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
you'll see that's the plug and that this

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.120 
you'll see that's the plug and that this
is<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.730> actual<00:03:24.030> model<00:03:24.600> number<00:03:24.960> here<00:03:26.990> so<00:03:28.130> in

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
is the actual model number here so in

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.410 
is the actual model number here so in
any<00:03:29.280> case<00:03:29.930> you'll<00:03:30.930> notice<00:03:33.800> there's<00:03:35.210> this<00:03:36.210> is

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
any case you'll notice there's this is

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.660 
any case you'll notice there's this is
the<00:03:37.700> plugs<00:03:39.710> so<00:03:40.710> you<00:03:40.800> see<00:03:40.980> there's<00:03:41.190> actually<00:03:41.610> an

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
the plugs so you see there's actually an

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.430 
the plugs so you see there's actually an
Ethernet<00:03:42.150> cable<00:03:43.190> then<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.430> normal<00:03:45.440> antenna

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
Ethernet cable then the normal antenna

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.800 
Ethernet cable then the normal antenna
in<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:48.260> then<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.620> digital<00:03:50.250> audio<00:03:51.120> cable<00:03:51.630> and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
in and then the digital audio cable and

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.750 
in and then the digital audio cable and
then<00:03:51.990> two<00:03:52.490> HDMI<00:03:53.490> cables<00:03:54.180> on<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.660> side<00:03:55.610> so<00:03:56.610> let

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
then two HDMI cables on that side so let

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.430 
then two HDMI cables on that side so let
me<00:03:56.850> just<00:03:57.000> go<00:03:57.150> underneath<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.960> you<00:03:58.080> can<00:03:58.260> take<00:03:58.410> a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
me just go underneath and you can take a

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:06.490 
me just go underneath and you can take a
look<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:03.480> if<00:04:03.720> you're<00:04:04.110> interested<00:04:04.410> kind<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.310> in

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
look and if you're interested kind of in

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.930 
look and if you're interested kind of in
hanging<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.920> just<00:04:08.130> remove<00:04:08.460> these<00:04:08.640> four

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
hanging it you just remove these four

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.460 
hanging it you just remove these four
screws<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:10.730> these<00:04:11.730> screws<00:04:12.540> here<00:04:12.570> are<00:04:12.960> exposed

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
screws and these screws here are exposed

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.030 
screws and these screws here are exposed
for<00:04:13.850> whatever<00:04:14.850> amount<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.420> have<00:04:15.799> wall<00:04:16.799> mount

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
for whatever amount you have wall mount

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.180 
for whatever amount you have wall mount
you<00:04:17.220> have<00:04:17.630> so<00:04:18.630> going<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.799> side<00:04:22.190> you'll

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
you have so going to the side you'll

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.590 
you have so going to the side you'll
notice

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
notice

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.550 
notice
there<00:04:25.600> are<00:04:25.840> four<00:04:26.470> these<00:04:27.419> there<00:04:28.419> is<00:04:28.449> an<00:04:28.690> HDMI<00:04:29.080> on

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
there are four these there is an HDMI on

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.260 
there are four these there is an HDMI on
the<00:04:29.680> side<00:04:29.889> so<00:04:30.160> in<00:04:30.400> total<00:04:30.760> there's<00:04:30.940> three<00:04:31.240> of

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
the side so in total there's three of

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.960 
the side so in total there's three of
them<00:04:32.040> but<00:04:33.040> you<00:04:33.160> could<00:04:33.310> probably<00:04:33.520> get<00:04:33.790> that

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
them but you could probably get that

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.850 
them but you could probably get that
from<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.270> specs<00:04:34.600> so<00:04:35.080> I'm<00:04:35.380> not<00:04:35.500> going<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.710> go

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
from the specs so I'm not going to go

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.090 
from the specs so I'm not going to go
too<00:04:36.310> much<00:04:36.340> into<00:04:36.699> that<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.740> just<00:04:38.740> want<00:04:38.919> to<00:04:38.979> go

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
too much into that I just want to go

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.730 
too much into that I just want to go
more<00:04:39.310> into<00:04:40.020> some<00:04:41.020> of<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.139> other<00:04:41.320> things<00:04:41.590> that

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
more into some of the other things that

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.530 
more into some of the other things that
are<00:04:41.889> uncovered<00:04:42.280> on<00:04:42.520> in<00:04:42.760> other<00:04:42.940> reviews<00:04:43.479> so<00:04:44.190> but

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
are uncovered on in other reviews so but

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.900 
are uncovered on in other reviews so but
mainly<00:04:46.540> I<00:04:46.720> wanted<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.320> cover<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:48.070> oscillating

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
mainly I wanted to cover the oscillating

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.990 
mainly I wanted to cover the oscillating
noise<00:04:49.150> in<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.479> top<00:04:49.690> so<00:04:50.490> just<00:04:51.490> be<00:04:51.610> aware<00:04:51.639> of

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
noise in the top so just be aware of

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.719 
noise in the top so just be aware of
that<00:04:52.120> when<00:04:52.389> you're<00:04:52.540> buying<00:04:52.750> this<00:04:53.729> television

most likely you'll have also have the
oscillating<00:04:57.220> noise<00:04:58.919> alright<00:04:59.919> there<00:05:00.160> you<00:05:00.280> go

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
oscillating noise alright there you go

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.360 
oscillating noise alright there you go
thank<00:05:01.030> you<00:05:01.090> for<00:05:01.180> watching
