most<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.430> my<00:00:32.460> life<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.840> guess<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.770> blame

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
most of my life and I guess I can blame

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.510 
most of my life and I guess I can blame
it<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.850> know<00:00:35.969> poor<00:00:36.420> genetics<00:00:37.370> poor<00:00:38.370> eating

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
it on you know poor genetics poor eating

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.490 
it on you know poor genetics poor eating
habits<00:00:38.700> or<00:00:39.239> whatever<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:39.870> I've<00:00:40.079> always<00:00:40.320> been

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
habits or whatever but I've always been

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.040 
habits or whatever but I've always been
probably<00:00:40.829> really<00:00:41.820> about<00:00:41.969> maybe<00:00:42.750> thirty

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
probably really about maybe thirty

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.910 
probably really about maybe thirty
pounds<00:00:43.440> overweight<00:00:43.680> ever<00:00:44.100> since<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.520> turned<00:00:44.579> 18

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
pounds overweight ever since I turned 18

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.080 
pounds overweight ever since I turned 18
and<00:00:46.920> I'm<00:00:47.010> guessing<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.340> anyone<00:00:47.730> watching

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
and I'm guessing that anyone watching

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090 
and I'm guessing that anyone watching
this<00:00:48.360> video<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.899> probably<00:00:49.230> having<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> same

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
this video is probably having the same

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.299 
this video is probably having the same
problem<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.969> was<00:00:51.180> having<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.320> yeah<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> had

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.480 
months ago I knew that if I didn't make
a<00:01:21.509> change<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.080> would<00:01:22.200> start<00:01:22.890> getting<00:01:22.979> some

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
a change I would start getting some

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.420

serious<00:01:24.420> self-confidence<00:01:25.380> issues<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.100> I

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
serious self-confidence issues and I

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.819 
serious self-confidence issues and I
really<00:01:26.759> didn't<00:01:27.000> want<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> happen<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.930> knew

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
really didn't want that to happen I knew

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.620 
really didn't want that to happen I knew
that<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.040> wanted<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.549> achieve<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:30.090> maximum

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.060 
potential and changed my life for the
better<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.780> decided<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.290> take<00:01:34.530> action

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
better so I just decided to take action

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.460 
better so I just decided to take action
so<00:01:35.729> basically<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.150> found<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.600> online<00:01:36.840> weight

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so basically I found this online weight

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.800 
so basically I found this online weight
loss<00:01:37.680> program<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> absolutely<00:01:39.060> love<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
loss program that I absolutely love and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.929 
loss program that I absolutely love and
it's<00:01:40.170> called<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> fat<00:01:40.890> loss<00:01:41.070> factor<00:01:41.130> and
