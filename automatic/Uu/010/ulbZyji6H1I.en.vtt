00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.860 
from from YouTube when you do this it
only<00:04:03.099> streams<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:03.730> video<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.540> television

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
only streams the video to the television

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.809 
only streams the video to the television
it<00:04:05.109> doesn't<00:04:05.410> stream<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:06.280> your<00:04:06.430> phone<00:04:06.579> at<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
it doesn't stream to your phone at the

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.430 
it doesn't stream to your phone at the
same<00:04:06.940> time<00:04:07.209> so<00:04:07.389> you<00:04:07.480> get<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.989> video<00:04:08.200> and

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
same time so you get the the video and

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.270 
same time so you get the the video and
the<00:04:08.530> audio<00:04:08.560> are<00:04:09.069> over<00:04:10.060> on<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.389> screen<00:04:10.720> and

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
the audio are over on the screen and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.059 
the audio are over on the screen and
then<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.970> know<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.150> can<00:04:13.510> you<00:04:14.200> can<00:04:14.380> share<00:04:14.650> any

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
then you know you can you can share any

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.560 
then you know you can you can share any
part<00:04:15.609> of<00:04:15.669> the<00:04:15.760> experience<00:04:16.269> so<00:04:16.359> it's<00:04:16.479> very

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
part of the experience so it's very

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.360 
part of the experience so it's very
similar<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:17.079> airplay<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.099> you<00:04:18.190> can

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
similar to airplay and that you can

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.580 
similar to airplay and that you can
mirror<00:04:18.609> everything<00:04:18.820> but<00:04:19.539> the<00:04:19.630> interface<00:04:20.019> is<00:04:20.260> a

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
mirror everything but the interface is a

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.740 
mirror everything but the interface is a
little<00:04:21.220> closer<00:04:21.700> designed<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.270> be<00:04:22.390> kind<00:04:22.690> of

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
little closer designed to be kind of

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.240 
little closer designed to be kind of
simple<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.409> and<00:04:23.680> just<00:04:24.250> really<00:04:24.669> focused<00:04:25.450> on

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
simple and and just really focused on

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.770 
simple and and just really focused on
mirroring<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.969> the<00:04:28.270> parts<00:04:28.509> that<00:04:28.599> are

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
mirroring the the parts that are

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.770 
mirroring the the parts that are
relevant<00:04:29.379> which<00:04:29.919> is<00:04:30.099> interesting<00:04:30.699> and<00:04:30.849> that's

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
relevant which is interesting and that's

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.300 
relevant which is interesting and that's
just<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.650> quick<00:04:32.800> look<00:04:32.979> at<00:04:33.129> the<00:04:33.280> media<00:04:33.610> link<00:04:33.849> HD
