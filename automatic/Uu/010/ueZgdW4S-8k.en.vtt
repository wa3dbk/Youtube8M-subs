00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.940
 Today is Sato, the current leader school 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:11.100
 Today's nurse leader course 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.930
 Today 's problem I want to think about the leadership style in various ways 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.620
 Ne 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.410
 new 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.280
 The mayor has been doing 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.960
 In fire extinguishers home ward 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:30.260
 We do a thing called new claims came, but what is happening is many problems in so 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:34.210
 When a new leader comes in , there are various problems that arise 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:38.850
 It is a common thing, in this case 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:43.870
 However , it seems that the mayor was a skinny person for my sister Ohana 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:49.030
 However, the previous mayor is talk 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:55.180
 I heard it or would you say that the so-called bottom-up and our everyone's opinion 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:58.620
 I'm was the one who had taken the style that will determine the tears to the original say so 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:03.160
 However, the new mayor 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.900
 It is a type that I would like to partition myself with my sister's skin 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.900
 I do not hear the opinion of the staff easily 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:18.420
 It will go to decide as judged by in anything to say intends this a Yokaro terms of their own 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.420
 But would it go up the speed of certain decision-making 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.640
 The people who work are not convinced 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.020
 I went came out various fumarate 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.800
 Oh finally 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:36.150
 That also came out people like coming to consult at the front of the claim 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.840
 Well what kind of things do these new leaders have to be aware of? 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.830
 Though 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.190
 Generally speaking 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.360
 In a new department 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.130
 What kind of work does the staff do 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.690
 Look a little bit 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.280
 Understand the characteristics well 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:57.450
 It will be necessary for a while 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.310
 They try to do it in the rules of up to or rather to do it as you like now 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.610
 In it 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.100
 Sound 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.660
 It would be also important to say and learn Well 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.860
 Whether or not my leadership style matches depends on various factors 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.260
 You decided 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.569
 At first it is the environmental situation 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.980
 The situation where it is put 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.180
 Companies in the bar its market environment 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.290
 A test drive for growth 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.290
 I'm there is documentation that sluggish 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.770
 That 's just a newcomer with a different working environment 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.620
 When there are many veterans 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.050
 Such environmental situation 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.670
 you 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.380
 You have to think about leadership styles in various ways 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.630
 Absent 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.940
 Also the character of the leader himself 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.300
 Impact on leadership style 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.300
 I see you 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.830
 For example, to people like Nobunaga Oda 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.650
 It is said that it takes a so-called bottom-up tactic to pile up from below 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.330
 It is impossible for a short person of q 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.790
 If you were a person, such as healing of virtue 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.299
 Sound is up 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.080
 But you may be able to do it because it is an old person 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:16.390
 A 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.320
 Well divided barge with an impressive thing I actually two stars also wish to Well I do not know if 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.780
 Being said 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.680
 From the image of the leader 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.260
 Trial may condition and can be bottom-up if you were Ieyasu and 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.800
 Button elder 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.730
 I can not think about such things 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.810
 It is a type that you want to take the initiative yourself 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:39.650
 So I like that kind of leader's own character 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:44.170
 The third is more influential 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.300
 It is characteristic of the staff, not the leader, but this time the staff 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.630
 Although also called a quick glance while ago 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:54.400
 A team with many veterans and a team with many newcomers 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.510
 It is natural that the leadership style which is suitable also by such a thing 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.510
 Ne 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.520
 Some people who are only veterans 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:08.150
 If there are many staff 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:10.830
 Come out and pop when another leave in advance so important best it is no problem something good child be 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.950
 It may be good to be consulted 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:19.260
 That's not true for newcomers only 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:25.610
 It may be necessary to give two people to some extent and then 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.610
 Whether you have a knowledgeable job or not 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.700
 I think that there may be everyone if it is regular work 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.020
 And I have experienced all the way down 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:42.080
 If it is something that has never happened 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.660
 After all there is no idea of the style of leadership 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:49.220
 Thinking about things like this 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:53.620
 Mr. Kada's bottom up is good or top down because what kind of thing is good 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.620
 I think the system not a fact or that there is good
