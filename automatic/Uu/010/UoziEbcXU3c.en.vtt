00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.970
 Hi, it's a rich morning and I'm with Diego 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.860
 Dominguez who is going to tell us his 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.810
 experience in violet now let's say by 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.810
 hello hello everyone 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.619
 well your character diego loved 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.770
 that everything like Greg the public is going to 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.439
 accept it for the truth that I hope that 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.970
 very good and what good I think that comes 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.070
 very strongly this character is going to give 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.300
 a lot to talk about 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.789
 I am diego delighted his good future 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.599
 I believe that he will conquer all and in 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.599
 special to violet 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.449
 I do not want to talk to you but not 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.559
 you want to talk to me I know that you 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:47.900
 taste is costing vouchers and the rest the 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.820
 guys more is not costing me but for 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.040
 the following reason I have already taken time 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.159
 studying this profile not of characters 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.809
 let's say we are beating other papers like 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.519
 from very good you believe a lot you have it 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.739
 fact they are saying it a lot 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.339
 lately maybe it's true good and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.860
 diego character that is that he wants to 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.189
 Where are you from coming to look good 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.770
 way I came to Argentina for one thing 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.110
 I can not anticipate, I tell you, you're 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.300
 happening with your little game already but it's 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.180
 I do not know playing otherwise get it 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.120
 Argentina and enter the study 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.690
 we have that diego is a person in the 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.240
 that on the one hand you can not 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.460
 trust a lot but let's see a 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.860
 character as very human too and that 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.659
 it has to do those things that 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.820
 understand me that I'm not going to stay 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.320
 arms crossed I will not give up can 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.120
 to be like a freaking and not to 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.200
 matter nothing but I'm not like that 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.200
 I promise it's just a facade 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.280
 and see you in the new chapters of 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.470
 goals with new characters like diego 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.140
 new stories not romances and 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.650
 many surprises do not miss a 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.650
 huge kiss 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.910
 always the dwelling
