00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.270
 So this subsidiary globus 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.189
 personal service gmbh 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.260
 they have been around for several years 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.870
 employs temporary workers and the 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.090
 then work in in-house markets 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.370
 it then apply to this second 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.210
 Employees of course other rates than 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.220
 in the trade 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.770
 and they will get about a third 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.450
 less than their own employees 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.400
 says the union verdi 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.710
 that it is a subsidiary of 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.360
 Even this temporary work agency is the globe 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.130
 have been around for some years now 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.480
 why is that only now that on 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.550
 who are paid less 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.960
 the field was not only now on it 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.390
 just not so right 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.129
 talked about my experience 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.899
 it was not desired even the 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.909
 union has a bit until now 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.190
 braked north said I do not want to 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.469
 are not really that far yet 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.889
 I could not understand that either 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.109
 The fact is that it has been known for a long time 

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:54.589
 now globus year is considered 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.510
 family business and yes has 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.100
 a pretty good reputation in the saarland and 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.600
 even beyond the borders of the Saarland 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.280
 away has become the sprint 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.899
 they signed off that for example now 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.579
 also get out of the tariff binding 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.619
 want for me already 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.000
 you can see that at the globe 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.430
 DIY stores have been out of the market for some time 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.799
 then left 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.630
 the trouble for every globe has 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.479
 hela BaumÃ¤rkte has also taken over there 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.909
 the collective agreement terminates and there is 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.170
 even individual warehouses where the 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.520
 Employees no longer according to tariff 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.740
 are busy 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.960
 next week could be about it 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.030
 the globe is completely decided 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.619
 the tariff binding gets out is that 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.969
 now a common practice and 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.520
 company or can you say that is 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.619
 already a mess then globe is behind 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.350
 details of the union verdi pioneer 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.689
 in the employment of temporary work in the trade 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.189
 whoever says that is also a clearer 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.979
 note that collective agreements 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.469
 should be avoided because just the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.619
 own temporary employment agency for your own 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.600
 warehouses the employees are hiring 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.850
 was the staff says so too 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.759
 Price war with the globe is now 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.259
 just about the salaries of the employees 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.479
 funded but of course you have to 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.340
 say one such regal rheumatic gives 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.140
 it is synonymous with others 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.850
 only then are trading companies 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.850
 mostly contractors in action
