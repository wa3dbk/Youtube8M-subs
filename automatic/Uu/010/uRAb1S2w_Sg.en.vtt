00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.000
 we are there 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.150
 and it is already in its normal is making a 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.430
 video with a camera I do not know what 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.860
 happens but I do not know is that I do not know 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.900
 He hits a headache a pain that seems 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.789
 silly fool is telling me with a 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.019
 so much different lighting and also a 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.310
 different relationship and that is that it is 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.019
 recording my mother with a camera a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.140
 little better than normal more and 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.120
 throw it to people 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:38.730
 and well now that we have it here 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.989
 box and I did not want to read much better 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.550
 graphic channel quality of this 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.350
 controller that hope it works to 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.530
 lose and that the specifications that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.790
 you need to suspend a bit but if 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.280
 you who validated a lot but I 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.839
 I remember the fan that I tried to open 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.150
 I had to ride my father 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.690
 because it's a little more to see how 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.690
 I open it 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.039
 all my life it costs me my life to open the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.240
 damn bag and here you have the 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:13.649
 capturing is the only one in streaming is 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.289
 the best capture of a veneer 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.390
 currently in the market records 60 gps and 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.860
 to 1080 thing that the truth is that it is 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.869
 incredible apart you can also do 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.220
 streaming and now shortly between 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.580
 specifications but good we're going to 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.710
 open it while webber 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.780
 how it opens and with the anti scissors 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:36.620
 suicide let's open it here you have a 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:38.120
 your little window slowly which then is the 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.740
 first time you record and sincerely 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.740
 I quite embarrassed but 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.880
 here all the cables that I will talk about 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.440
 the cables but the important thing and the most 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.560
 nice is to see the captor that is 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.560
 weather 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.850
 My mother certainly they can 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.950
 customize with a lace and plan 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.270
 of your cat that sings to me was for 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.920
 there before I think that you will 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.660
 seen but well let's see it a bit 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.220
 over here to see what it is like here I had 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.720
 capturing from another perspective that 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.590
 my image has blocked the audio output 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.459
 and he had not heard absolutely 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.050
 nothing 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.790
 as I say right, because I was personalized 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.590
 the capturer to your liking here 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.450
 can for example pe zapotillo of the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.430
 brand you can put a football picture of 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.410
 an example nothing quite tiny 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.150
 honestly around here has an entrance 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.030
 I would be a microphone assistant 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.060
 you want to always record let's say and talk 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.830
 at the same time so as not to have to remove everything 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.900
 has the account of life 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.790
 per component by itself what for 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.990
 if you want for example to record the psp that 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.450
 presents it that can be connected by 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.180
 components or even for gnu that text 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.950
 they obviously do not have usb 3.0 which is 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.390
 quite is quite simple and better 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.610
 when I knew you already know what I'm saying 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.200
 it's absolutely nothing we already knew that 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.820
 the cables and everything fine and what the cable 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.410
 cited as well said is the component 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.990
 that to connect the psp or maybe the 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.720
 playstation 2 the hdmi to connect it 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.520
 pri 4 web time this for playstation 3 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.780
 iermini since it is an auxiliary entrance 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.040
 let's say audio 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.660
 is quite complete and the truth is that 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.860
 I really liked the capture and I have 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.960
 I want to try it to see how it works 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.520
 I think white is looking 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.470
 also of employment does not look what 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.510
 illusion this capturing mother of mine that 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.580
 it smells already I know that surely it is wanted 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.400
 put the box 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.709
 the water wii goes 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.980
 a video appears above because I wanted 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.980
 look 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.800
 papers and that's how my cat gets 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.800
 a new home 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.830

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.700
 guys new videos but that you 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.099
 hit a good punch and fist punch 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.420
 my mother if you want me to record videos 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.069
 with this super ultra capture of now to 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.629
 see how it is really focusing on 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.280
 focus a little here is the test 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.660
 use this camera for this and nothing 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.280
