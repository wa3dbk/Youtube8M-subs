00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.940 
opinion when it pertains to me
disagreeing<00:02:11.400> with<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.640> casual<00:02:12.150> fan

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
disagreeing with the casual fan

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.140 
disagreeing with the casual fan
because<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.100> just<00:02:14.220> based<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:14.700> what<00:02:14.760> someone

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
because it's just based on what someone

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150 
because it's just based on what someone
can<00:02:15.360> do<00:02:15.660> if<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.500> sit<00:02:16.890> there<00:02:16.920> and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
can do if you just sit there and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.640 
can do if you just sit there and
cherry-pick<00:02:17.760> what<00:02:17.940> someone<00:02:18.330> can<00:02:18.540> do<00:02:18.840> well

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
cherry-pick what someone can do well

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.290 
cherry-pick what someone can do well

then Kobe Bryant's the best scorer in
the<00:02:21.420> NBA<00:02:21.450> if<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.860> actually<00:02:23.070> look<00:02:23.310> at<00:02:23.700> what

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
the NBA if you actually look at what

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.440 
the NBA if you actually look at what
someone<00:02:24.180> consistently<00:02:25.020> does<00:02:25.370> this<00:02:26.370> year<00:02:26.910> even

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
someone consistently does this year even

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.840 
someone consistently does this year even
though<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.750> think<00:02:28.110> Kevin<00:02:28.410> Durant<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.520> most

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
though I think Kevin Durant is the most

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.120 
though I think Kevin Durant is the most
dangerous<00:02:30.330> score<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.200> year<00:02:31.470> LeBron<00:02:31.620> James

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
dangerous score this year LeBron James

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.700 
dangerous score this year LeBron James
has<00:02:32.340> been<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.610> best<00:02:32.730> scorer<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.270> NBA

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
has been the best scorer in the NBA

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.920 
has been the best scorer in the NBA
because<00:02:34.710> he's<00:02:35.280> doing<00:02:35.520> what<00:02:35.850> he's<00:02:35.970> doing<00:02:36.000> with

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
because he's doing what he's doing with

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.040 
because he's doing what he's doing with
consistency<00:02:37.970> while<00:02:38.970> not<00:02:39.330> wasting

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
consistency while not wasting

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.650 
consistency while not wasting
possessions<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:42.290> he's<00:02:43.550> more<00:02:44.550> efficient<00:02:45.240> with

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
possessions and he's more efficient with

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.260 
possessions and he's more efficient with
what<00:02:45.930> he<00:02:46.020> does<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:47.160> even<00:02:47.430> though<00:02:47.460> i<00:02:47.670> would<00:02:48.060> take

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
what he does so even though i would take

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.830 
what he does so even though i would take
Durant<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:48.960> I<00:02:49.560> wanted<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.950> guy<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.100> score<00:02:50.840> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
Durant if I wanted a guy to score the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.750 
Durant if I wanted a guy to score the
fact<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.380> matter<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.710> LeBron's<00:02:53.430> been<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
fact of the matter is LeBron's been the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.330 
fact of the matter is LeBron's been the
most<00:02:53.910> consistent<00:02:54.770> consistently<00:02:55.770> efficient

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
