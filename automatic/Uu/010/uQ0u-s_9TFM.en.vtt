00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.780
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.150
 channel and today I will show you my 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.340
 evening skin care 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.080
 my skin was pretty 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.540
 sore at that moment and 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.570
 and I decided that I needed just the same 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.000
 clean it first i use 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.240
 Almond oil I love him very well 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.730
 bibi cream removes any concealer and 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.040
 At the same time, you see that I had 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.410
 eye makeup is pretty intense and 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.840
 You will now see that it is terrible 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.390
 the picture is not for rumors to the nerves yes 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.170
 It looks like this all when you delete 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.810
 oils and then of course i take the foam for 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.120
 washing from etude house which is just 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.610
 okay right now will remove first 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.370
 wash itself oil secondly residues 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.710
 make up but then if you retire 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.990
 eye oil you do not damage the skin 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.130
 absolutely it is very soft and delicate and 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.439
 such a cleansing of the skin while washing well 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.810
 then I take the sponge to wash it all off 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.270
 I decided to take the micelle also 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.700
 but for some reason it seemed to me that here I 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.530
 you need to make such a lethal dose of everything in 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.999
 this evening but by the way you are on my departure 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.299
 from the blocks you know that I really 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:24.670
 so often I do this with a lot of masks 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.619
 Mongolian some cleansing agents and 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.200
 sometimes it seems to me the most provoke even 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.780
 rashes and so i'm showing now how 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.759
 correctly remove eye makeup that we 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.130
 doing it clockwise and not 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.039
 stretch the skin well, of course I do not forget 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.429
 about a neck about all a face all sites 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.530
 Next I took the gel from Loreal and you know 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.350
 I like this one here myself 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.259
 Sponge for washing it is such a rubber 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.259
 soft enough but gel 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.639
 but there is absolutely nothing in it 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.069
 I can not say that he gets rid of 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:59.530
 black dots it smells neutral 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.020
 pretty no smell 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.560
 such alcohol decently or something 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.289
 such a 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.420
 but at the same time I can not say that to me 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.240
 I really liked him very much 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.580
 sponge remove remnants of this gel from face 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.040
 u just really at that moment i 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.080
 so struggled to shoot this video for a long time 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.960
 honestly 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.540
 how to deal with these rashes further 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.950
 i take tonic tonic i had that wine i 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.860
 I will not say that he did not like 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.760
 nothing too in it absolutely especially in 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.850
 ordinary tonic 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.220
 if you also cleanse the skin with tonic 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.240
 notice how well you wash 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.310
 anyway traces will remain on the fleece 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.050
 a little bit of such pollution because 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.300
 which is impossible sometimes perfect me 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.940
 it seems to clean your skin still tonic 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.620
 need to prepare it 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.440
 cream or mass to what you will be next 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.020
 apply under the eyes I put the cream on 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.450
 shiseyd may on the wreath and to be honest 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.180
 while you are my only enthusiastic 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.970
 reviews and impressions of this cream on 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.570
 our clapping movements under 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.700
 eyes where we may have wrinkles and 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.190
 also a little bit on top me very 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.470
 like how it nourishes moisturizes but the main thing 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.780
 to go too far with them otherwise morning swelling 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.870
 and gum just love about doing so myself 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.240
 a small massage next I take the oil 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.790
 clarence and you know at that moment exactly 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.340
 she told me in my opinion, but I called these ones 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.450
 all the same and again the rash and my skin 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.860
 sometimes they are just as if they were not clogged 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.350
 I know now I will try again 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.360
 use to make gum already 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.730
 does it suit me or not or was it 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.920
 something different and put by the way here's how 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.900
 see too with such movements first 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.940
 I warm up in my hands and then like this 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.300
 Here as if presses the oil and 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.820
 I take zinc ointment constantly by the way 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.519
 use either salicylic or zinc 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.930
 any streptocidal I apply locally on 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:57.360
 pimples and by the way well it dries 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.670
 not forgetting also about applying my lips 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.950
 girls do not judge hygienic lipstick 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.630
 strictly skin of course I have up to this 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.940
 the video is not perfect and 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.220
 all my problems are visible but I tell you 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.140
 I show how I struggle with something 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.660
 I do periodically come to all of us 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.670
 so thank you for watching you 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.870
 I liked the symbol so put a chick 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.870
 finger up while in yet
