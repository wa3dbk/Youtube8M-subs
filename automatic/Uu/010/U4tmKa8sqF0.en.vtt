00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
battery the box actually slides out but

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.260 
battery the box actually slides out but
it<00:00:42.629> does<00:00:43.129> it<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.280> sealed<00:00:44.520> from<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> trunk<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
it does it is sealed from the trunk and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.180 
it does it is sealed from the trunk and
goes<00:00:45.390> forward<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.469> convertible<00:00:46.950> so

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.410 
goes forward this is a convertible so
the<00:00:47.309> black<00:00:47.489> box<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.879> top<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.180> where<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the black box at the top is where the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.330 
the black box at the top is where the
top<00:00:48.600> sitting<00:00:48.989> as<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
top sitting as you can see it's a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.270 
top sitting as you can see it's a
convertible<00:00:50.960> what<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.110> did<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:53.010> took<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
convertible what we did we took the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.610 
convertible what we did we took the
center<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> seat<00:00:54.120> out<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:55.410> created<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
center of the seat out and we created a

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.100 
center of the seat out and we created a
mesh<00:00:58.730> grill<00:00:59.730> cloth<00:01:01.910> and<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.420> backlit<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> in

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
mesh grill cloth and we backlit it in

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.460 
mesh grill cloth and we backlit it in
there<00:01:04.350> also<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.309> when<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.610> trunks<00:01:05.909> open<00:01:06.470> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
there also so when the trunks open it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.050 
there also so when the trunks open it
lights<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.920> when<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.250> closed<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.820> just

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
lights up when it's closed it's just

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.380 
lights up when it's closed it's just
black<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> view<00:01:10.619> there<00:01:11.390> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
black so that's the view there the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.469 
black so that's the view there the
amplifier<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:13.500> located<00:01:14.479> inside

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
amplifier is actually located inside

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.630 
amplifier is actually located inside
then<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.220> but

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
then if you can see it or not but

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.210 
then if you can see it or not but
basically<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.630> employers<00:01:19.020> inside<00:01:19.619> there<00:01:19.890> and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
basically the employers inside there and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.899 
basically the employers inside there and
in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> subwoofers<00:01:21.450> fire<00:01:22.670> forward<00:01:23.670> through

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
in the subwoofers fire forward through

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.149 
in the subwoofers fire forward through
there<00:01:25.759> we<00:01:26.759> did<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> pioneer<00:01:27.810> 24-bit<00:01:28.590> processor

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
there we did a pioneer 24-bit processor

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:38.090 
there we did a pioneer 24-bit processor
PRS<00:01:30.030> head<00:01:30.240> unit<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:33.180> thing<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:37.100> about

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
PRS head unit this thing was about

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.870 
PRS head unit this thing was about
because<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.970> opens<00:01:40.189> it<00:01:41.189> flips<00:01:41.490> down<00:01:41.670> with

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
because when it opens it flips down with

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.280 
because when it opens it flips down with
these<00:01:42.000> BMWs<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:42.720> don't<00:01:42.899> give<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.140> whole

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
these BMWs they don't give you a whole

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.020 
these BMWs they don't give you a whole
lot<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> room<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.860> button<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.909> we

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
lot of room so this button so we

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.819 
lot of room so this button so we
actually<00:01:45.240> had<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.070> create<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> custom<00:01:47.520> dash

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
actually had to create a custom dash

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.560 
actually had to create a custom dash
rather<00:01:49.829> than<00:01:50.070> use<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.780> pre-made<00:01:52.490> piece<00:01:53.570> so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
rather than use the pre-made piece so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
rather than use the pre-made piece so
that<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.840> would<00:01:54.960> open<00:01:55.110> up<00:01:55.350> would<00:01:56.310> put<00:01:56.490> CD

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
that it would open up would put CD

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.060 
that it would open up would put CD
behind<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.420> stuff<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.560> added<00:01:58.740> red

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
behind and stuff like that we added red

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.550 
behind and stuff like that we added red
LED<00:01:59.549> lights<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.689> doors<00:02:00.930> we<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
the tweeters are located behind the

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.870 
the tweeters are located behind the
factory<00:02:09.569> mounts<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:11.100> we<00:02:12.100> did<00:02:12.459> custom

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
factory mounts and the we did custom

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.230 
factory mounts and the we did custom
mounts<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:14.380> mounted<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.069> speakers<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.970> six

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240

panel<00:02:19.690> at<00:02:20.080> first<00:02:20.350> me<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.530> think<00:02:20.770> they<00:02:20.860> would

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
panel at first me and think they would

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.030 
panel at first me and think they would
fit<00:02:21.190> but<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:22.290> would<00:02:23.290> manage<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.560> make<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:23.890> work

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
fit but I would manage to make it work

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.809 
fit but I would manage to make it work
in<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.760> rear<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:25.300> have<00:02:26.550> five<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> quarter

sounds<00:02:35.560> amazing

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
sounds amazing

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.130 
sounds amazing
can't<00:02:36.940> believe<00:02:37.060> actually<00:02:37.450> how<00:02:37.720> much<00:02:37.870> pressure

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
can't believe actually how much pressure

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.840 
can't believe actually how much pressure
with<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> top<00:02:38.739> down<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:38.980> get<00:02:39.370> from<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.670> bass

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
with the top down you get from the bass
