00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.519
 we went together like that here 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.870
 in the framework of the ifa around us the galaxy 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.789
 to look at camera having me on the 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.260
 aspect event seen and the exciting 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.750
 was you remember that is in the 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.400
 principle a compact camera with a 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.869
 glued smartphone towards it 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.359
 already running with jelly bean 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.170
 has an exynos quad-core cpu in it and 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.820
 Of course we have the question 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.050
 how fast is the thing 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.240
 actually and that's why we both have 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.290
 to tutu and the wearer on it 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.210
 Now let's have a look 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.950
 I have the antut grad run through 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.580
 If you get closer then I'll show you 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.900
 the results now you have to 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.960
 look very briefly now I'm in the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:49.490
 system settings where are you now 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.980
 the scores 10,000 191 that's not quite 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.020
 as much as a galaxy s3 or like one 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.880
 note 2 can handle my own 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.410
 Of course, that's 12,000 but 10,000 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.800
 of course a decent one 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.530
 worth yesterday that was mediapad 10 fh.de 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.909
 that also had 10,000 so 10,000 makes 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.689
 after all, to do the camera that is 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.710
 of course very nice 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.820
 impressive what we at the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.310
 opportunity to look again 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.869
 is like that here with the ones with 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.179
 the cpu apart like a quad core 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.820
 i7 processor with mali 400 i am 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:20.190
 pretty sure that 's the 644 12 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.440
 he also in s 3 and im 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.060
 note 2 tinkers why so now 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.460
 slower here is possible 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.480
 hard to say 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.090
 maybe here i see it 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.830
 right now not on the ramge player of 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.070
 Of course, the am is a bit smaller 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.530
 as the fcs 3 and the galaxy note two 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.580
 years - 716 are displayed so that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.780
 is not that much because of that 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.740
 Chamber is a bit slower, yes 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.670
 not bad that does not have to 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.860
 be so fast though tens of thousands 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.210
 is worth neat and if so 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.310
 fast is there we are watching 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.960
 times like here a current high 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.700
 end shooter like dead trigger on it 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.690
 act I installed a good mood 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.430
 I do not know what the colleagues are now 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.510
 from samsung of it old maybe 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.020
 look forward to see you later 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.180
 a round 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.030
 We can watch zombies shoot now 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.170
 Just go in and yes you can 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.100
 Now argue about how useful that 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.220
 is with a compact camera 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.720
 in between play the trigger too 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.100
 want or to be able to do it 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.960
 If you can make a phone call here with the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.340
 but not otherwise that can actually 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.400
 everything a smartphone can do, too 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.170
 yes even 4g so connectivity 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.610
 enabled 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.110
 and we still find that 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.810
 a very cool idea actually their 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.370
 You see, I'm on the artwork now 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.599
 set this is super fluid 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.160
 Of course we do not all have tegra 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.840
 effects that is the water effects 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.150
 not there but a few 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.430
 Particle effects the steam up here so 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.080
 it all looks pretty cool 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.819
 and works great 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.020
 So who's taking pictures between them 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.610
 Just want to play a round 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.020
 Do that with the galaxy camera 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.760
 we still find that one 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.720
 very cool idea of ​​samsung is us 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.550
 Of course, no one knows now 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.080
 Photo experts can not judge how 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.819
 well this camera quality i just got 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.410
 I did a few tests 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.100
 me or zombie by e mail 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.019
 sent 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.250
 Of course, I will also give you that 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.780
 present and then you can 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.730
 make a picture of it yourself as well 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.340
 this nominally 16 megapixel her 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.510
 Actually we look forward to looking real 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.769
 we are on the fixed device then 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.390
 but take a closer look 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.680
 first collection all camera just not 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.180
 only to take pictures but also to 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.980
 the carrier gamble that was me of 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.670
 android next at samsung on the ifa until 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.670
 next time bye 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.700
