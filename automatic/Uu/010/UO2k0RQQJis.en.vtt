for $67 some of you may know but I went

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.810 
for $67 some of you may know but I went
to<00:00:26.099> California<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.529> came<00:00:28.529> back<00:00:28.769> today<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
to California and came back today and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.519 
to California and came back today and
this<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> filter<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.900> got<00:00:31.170> when<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> was

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
this is the filter I got when I was

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.060 
this is the filter I got when I was
there<00:00:32.030> there<00:00:33.030> was<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.180> cheaper<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.110> 27<00:00:34.800> but

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
there there was a cheaper one for 27 but

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.130 
there there was a cheaper one for 27 but
it<00:00:35.309> wasn't<00:00:35.820> as<00:00:35.910> good<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.660> only<00:00:36.840> single

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
it wasn't as good it's only single

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.639 
it wasn't as good it's only single
coating<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.399> two<00:00:39.000> layers<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.079> coating

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
coating this is two layers of coating

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.729 
coating this is two layers of coating
people<00:00:41.250> right<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:41.610> made<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.510> Japan<00:00:43.050> two

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
people right here made in Japan two

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.889 
people right here made in Japan two
layers<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.070> coating<00:00:44.399> which<00:00:44.760> means<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.329> it's

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
layers of coating which means that it's

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.470 
layers of coating which means that it's
the<00:00:46.530> same<00:00:46.829> quality<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.879> lens<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> camera

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the same quality of lens of the camera

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.830 
the same quality of lens of the camera
hands<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.770> as<00:00:50.100> many<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.910> may<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.449> know

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
hands so as many of you may not know

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.200 
hands so as many of you may not know
that<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.649> other<00:00:52.860> lens<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.550> single<00:00:54.059> layer

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
that the other lens is the single layer

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.380 
that the other lens is the single layer
of<00:00:54.360> coating<00:00:54.770> degrade<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.010> lens<00:00:56.219> quality<00:00:56.910> of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
of coating degrade the lens quality of

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.010 
of coating degrade the lens quality of
the<00:00:57.510> image<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:59.100> lens<00:00:59.910> itself<00:01:00.359> has<00:01:00.780> two

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the image so the lens itself has two

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.979 
the image so the lens itself has two
layers<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.410> coating<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:02.039> each<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> lens

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
layers of coating on each of the lens

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.960 
layers of coating on each of the lens
facets<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.010> when<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.280> put<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.610> lens<00:01:05.850> on

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
facets so that when you put this lens on

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.609 
facets so that when you put this lens on
it<00:01:06.030> doesn't<00:01:06.360> degrade<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.750> image<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.290> makes<00:01:07.470> it

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it doesn't degrade the image it makes it

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.530 
it doesn't degrade the image it makes it
better<00:01:07.830> with<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.040> UV<00:01:08.400> coating<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
better with the UV coating but what the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.539 
better with the UV coating but what the
other<00:01:09.659> filters<00:01:09.930> do<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.500> are<00:01:10.619> cheaper<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
other filters do that are cheaper that

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.940 
other filters do that are cheaper that
only<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.420> layer<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.990> coating<00:01:13.290> they

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
only have one layer of coating they

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.969 
only have one layer of coating they
grade<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.420> quality<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.960> images<00:01:16.380> making

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
grade the quality of the images making

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.179 
grade the quality of the images making
the<00:01:17.400> UV<00:01:18.060> filter<00:01:18.479> obsolete<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.830> won't<00:01:20.040> even

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the UV filter obsolete and it won't even

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.080 
the UV filter obsolete and it won't even
help<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.790> image<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> I've<00:01:23.460> taken<00:01:23.759> multiple

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
help the image so I've taken multiple

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.969 
help the image so I've taken multiple
photos<00:01:25.009> like<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.189> ones<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.619> I've<00:01:28.619> used

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
photos like the ones here and I've used

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.149 
photos like the ones here and I've used
this<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.880> went<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.450> California<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.650> few

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
this one I went to California it's a few

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:43.319 
this one I went to California it's a few
photos<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.700> dad

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.749 

so<00:01:44.329> this<00:01:44.630> is<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:44.840> really<00:01:45.500> great<00:01:45.649> filter<00:01:46.189> again<00:01:46.670> I

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
so this is a really great filter again I

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.920 
so this is a really great filter again I
got<00:01:46.939> it<00:01:47.030> for<00:01:47.229> $67<00:01:48.229> at<00:01:49.180> Philly's<00:01:50.180> camera<00:01:50.570> supply

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
got it for $67 at Philly's camera supply

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.670 
got it for $67 at Philly's camera supply
in<00:01:52.659> California<00:01:54.789> so<00:01:55.789> I'd<00:01:56.720> say<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:57.170> is<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.380> great

in California so I'd say this is a great
product<00:01:58.009> you<00:01:58.399> should<00:01:58.430> definitely<00:01:59.270> get<00:01:59.450> it

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
product you should definitely get it

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.410 
product you should definitely get it
this<00:02:00.289> is<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.770> 67<00:02:01.460> millimeter<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:02.000> can<00:02:02.210> get<00:02:02.299> it

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
this is the 67 millimeter you can get it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.510 
this is the 67 millimeter you can get it
in<00:02:02.509> any<00:02:02.720> size<00:02:03.110> you<00:02:03.140> want<00:02:03.350> about<00:02:04.310> most<00:02:04.820> sizes<00:02:05.119> so

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
in any size you want about most sizes so

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.089 
in any size you want about most sizes so

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
28 absorbs ultraviolet rays which often

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.160 
28 absorbs ultraviolet rays which often
makes<00:02:10.310> outdoor<00:02:10.970> photographs<00:02:11.480> hazy<00:02:11.780> and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170

protects<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.370> lens<00:02:22.610> rather<00:02:23.090> than<00:02:23.299> having<00:02:23.480> to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
protects the lens rather than having to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.840 
protects the lens rather than having to
buy<00:02:23.870> new<00:02:23.900> like<00:02:24.470> Fonda<00:02:24.799> dollar<00:02:24.950> lens<00:02:25.250> all<00:02:25.580> you
