so<00:01:08.760> let's<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.450> wad<00:01:09.750> works

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.969 

and<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.159> looks<00:01:24.369> like<00:01:24.460> it<00:01:24.729> does<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:25.469> do<00:01:26.469> not<00:01:26.679> buy

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
and it looks like it does and do not buy

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.830 
and it looks like it does and do not buy
the<00:01:27.369> GameCube<00:01:27.969> version<00:01:27.999> of<00:01:28.479> this<00:01:28.569> game

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
the GameCube version of this game

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.230 
the GameCube version of this game
because<00:01:29.200> of<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:29.499> freezes<00:01:30.009> randomly<00:01:30.240> that's

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
because of it freezes randomly that's

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.300 
because of it freezes randomly that's
why<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.450> waited<00:01:31.719> for<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.319> be<00:01:32.409> released<00:01:32.679> on<00:01:32.920> VC

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
why I waited for it to be released on VC

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.520 
why I waited for it to be released on VC
but<00:01:34.149> instead<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.659> just<00:01:34.869> got<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.289> through<00:01:35.439> the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
but instead I just got it through the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.590 
but instead I just got it through the
homebrew<00:01:35.890> channel<00:01:36.340> because<00:01:36.579> of<00:01:36.789> knowing

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
homebrew channel because of knowing

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.270 
homebrew channel because of knowing
Nintendo<00:01:38.259> they<00:01:38.499> probably<00:01:38.740> won't<00:01:38.950> release

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
Nintendo they probably won't release
