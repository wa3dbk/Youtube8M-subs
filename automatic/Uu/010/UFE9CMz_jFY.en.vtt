00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.000 
icons and don't expect it to it probably
won't<00:02:50.250> do<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:50.430> quite<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.180> long<00:02:51.330> time<00:02:51.480> as<00:02:52.470> it's

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
won't do for quite a long time as it's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.180 
won't do for quite a long time as it's
just<00:02:53.640> not<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.269> easy<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.380> implement<00:02:55.650> into<00:02:56.070> the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
just not that easy to implement into the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.770 
just not that easy to implement into the
new<00:02:56.340> operating<00:02:56.700> system<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:57.269> could<00:02:57.480> be<00:02:57.600> wrong

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
new operating system I could be wrong

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.300 
new operating system I could be wrong
and<00:02:58.050> then<00:02:58.380> we<00:02:58.500> have<00:02:58.620> dream<00:02:58.890> board<00:02:59.130> which

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
and then we have dream board which

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.040 
and then we have dream board which
doesn't<00:02:59.670> even<00:02:59.819> open<00:03:00.000> at<00:03:00.239> all<00:03:00.390> but<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.870> just

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
doesn't even open at all but I just

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.630 
doesn't even open at all but I just
recommend<00:03:01.410> staying<00:03:01.680> clear<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.040> these<00:03:02.280> as<00:03:02.459> they

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
recommend staying clear of these as they

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.979 
recommend staying clear of these as they
don't<00:03:02.819> work<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.209> they<00:03:03.360> could<00:03:03.600> cause<00:03:03.810> a

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
don't work and they could cause a

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.140 
don't work and they could cause a
problem<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.470> your<00:03:04.620> device<00:03:04.970> anyway<00:03:05.970> these<00:03:06.090> have

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
problem to your device anyway these have

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.090 
problem to your device anyway these have
been<00:03:06.269> my<00:03:06.480> top<00:03:06.780> compatible<00:03:07.319> tweaks<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.769> the
