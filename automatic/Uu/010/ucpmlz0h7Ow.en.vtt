00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.550
 glad to welcome you to part 2 of the course 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.470
 which will allow you thanks 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.960
 practical work in the program 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.960
 consolidate knowledge obtained in the first part 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.300
 as well as learn a huge amount 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 different techniques and techniques which 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.770
 will certainly expand your area of â€‹â€‹expertise 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.260
 on working in photoshop and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.230
 let's start our first 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.960
 practical lesson he's the first lesson from 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.410
 section on retouching where I 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.980
 I will tell you about how to improve the skin and 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.390
 exactly make it clean and smooth and so 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.239
 before proceeding to leveling 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.220
 skin and and first need to be cleaned 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.370
 that is, get rid of a different kind 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.800
 defects form of acne and the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.930
 similar for this as you remember 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.350
 need to use tools for 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.700
 retouching i will use 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.930
 puncture repair tool 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.060
 brush in content mode and in and delete 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.060
 this tool all defects 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.760
 now after the skin defects have 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.110
 length, you can safely proceed to her 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.870
 smoothing it can be done 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.720
 in various ways but in this lesson I 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.760
 I will lead only about two principle of which 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.190
 skin blur based 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.430
 so the first way is 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.530
 skin blur with a tool 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.140
 blur let's select this 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.600
 tool 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.000
 create a duplicate of the original layer as 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.180
 all the work on the blur will carry 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.160
 on it and holding the left mouse button 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.560
 wash and skin patches 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.560
 which requires alignment 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.250
 from just less than half a minute leather 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.430
 became absolutely smooth let's compare 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.160
 result before and after applying this 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.170
 tooling second alignment method 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.050
 is to apply filters 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.040
 blur on the surface let's apply 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.280
 this filter 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.970
 but for this, we first remove the duplicate 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.280
 the original layer will create a new one and 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.530
 the main menu will go through the filter and from 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.040
 blur categories select filter 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.230
 blur on the surface in this 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.060
 the dialog box must be set 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.900
 settings for two parameters 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.000
 this is the radius parameter and the threshold parameters 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.830
 those settings that are now 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.790
 installed are the most 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.440
 suitable for skin smoothing 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.590
 let's click dime to 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.630
 apply this filter due to the fact 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.850
 what is our main goal for this 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.610
 moment is skin leveling 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.640
 they blur the whole image then 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.910
 you need the whole area except 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.260
 skin hide by excuse as you remember 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.510
 for this you need to create a layer mask 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.269
 select as primary color 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.130
 black and choose a tool for 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:58.680
 drawing i will choose a brush tool and 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.170
 then this black tool 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.940
 need for miss bed all plots 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.940
 which do not require blurring 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.060
 in order to reduce the impact 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.880
 filter on the skin must be reduced 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.550
 the opacity of the brush tool and 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.340
 hold this tool on 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.680
 areas that need 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.880
 reduce exposure from earlier 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.880
 applied filter 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.690
 in this way it works and 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.620
 let's compare the result before and after 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:05.560
 applying a filter on this to me 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.470
 skin improvement all hope that the lesson has become 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.500
 useful for you but in the next lesson I 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:15.210
 tell you how to eliminate 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.210
 reddish skin
