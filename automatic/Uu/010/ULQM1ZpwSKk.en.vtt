and<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.030> are<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:13.440> fire

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
and here we are the fire

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.310 
and here we are the fire
fight<00:02:14.610> her<00:02:14.960> dragon<00:02:16.490> now<00:02:17.600> it's<00:02:18.600> burning<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
fight her dragon now it's burning and

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
then all the hoses the tail very very

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.620 
then all the hoses the tail very very
unique<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> hose<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:29.340> tail<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:30.000> he's

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
unique so the hose is the tail and he's

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.500 
unique so the hose is the tail and he's
squirting<00:02:31.050> out<00:02:31.320> water<00:02:32.100> which<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.060> can<00:02:33.300> is
