00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
going to be looking at another

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.960 
going to be looking at another
quintessential<00:00:07.919> belly<00:00:08.250> dance<00:00:08.490> movement

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
quintessential belly dance movement

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.419 
quintessential belly dance movement
called<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.809> column<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.740> comments<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.250> hip

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
called the column the comments a hip

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.860 
called the column the comments a hip
drop<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.820> creates<00:00:12.210> kind<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.660> rainbow

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
drop that creates kind of a rainbow

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.509 
drop that creates kind of a rainbow
shape<00:00:13.290> perhaps<00:00:13.769> that's<00:00:13.950> why<00:00:14.040> they<00:00:14.190> call<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.460> a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
shape perhaps that's why they call it a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.670 
shape perhaps that's why they call it a
comma<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:15.030> little<00:00:15.570> curved<00:00:15.809> shape<00:00:16.199> on<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.470> side

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
comma a little curved shape on the side

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.590 
comma a little curved shape on the side
so<00:00:17.190> we're<00:00:17.310> going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.460> begin<00:00:17.640> by<00:00:17.820> building<00:00:18.480> it

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
so we're going to begin by building it

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.810 
so we're going to begin by building it
from<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.260> different<00:00:19.740> isolations<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.640> need

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
from the different isolations you need

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.390 
from the different isolations you need
to<00:00:21.060> create<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.630> movement<00:00:22.100> so<00:00:23.100> we're<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.340> to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
to create the movement so we're going to

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.130 
to create the movement so we're going to
be<00:00:23.490> using<00:00:23.820> two<00:00:24.029> different<00:00:24.060> isolations<00:00:24.869> today

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
be using two different isolations today

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.080 
be using two different isolations today
to<00:00:25.199> create<00:00:25.590> our<00:00:25.920> kama<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.580> first<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
to create our kama the first is the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.880 
to create our kama the first is the
unweighted<00:00:27.570> hip<00:00:27.900> lift<00:00:28.260> which<00:00:28.470> we've<00:00:28.650> looked

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
unweighted hip lift which we've looked

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.320 
unweighted hip lift which we've looked
at<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.220> other<00:00:29.279> videos<00:00:29.730> well<00:00:29.939> let's<00:00:30.090> go<00:00:30.210> ahead

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
at in other videos well let's go ahead

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.540 
at in other videos well let's go ahead
and<00:00:30.510> review<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.929> here<00:00:31.199> an<00:00:31.380> unrated<00:00:32.040> hip<00:00:32.309> lift

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
and review it here an unrated hip lift

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.729 
and review it here an unrated hip lift
is<00:00:32.669> done<00:00:32.850> all<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:33.480> side<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.350> cut<00:00:34.559> has

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
is done all on one side and that cut has

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.260 
is done all on one side and that cut has
no<00:00:35.040> weight<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.000> why<00:00:36.090> we're

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
no weight on it which is why we're

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.180 
no weight on it which is why we're
calling<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.570> unweighted<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.500> let's<00:00:37.950> start

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
calling it unweighted so let's start

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.889 
calling it unweighted so let's start
with<00:00:38.309> an<00:00:38.460> unweighted<00:00:38.940> right<00:00:39.270> all<00:00:39.480> our<00:00:39.719> weight

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
with an unweighted right all our weight

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:40.729 
with an unweighted right all our weight
is<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.170> our<00:00:40.290> left

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
is on our left

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.069

has to remain soft you want to think

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.430 
has to remain soft you want to think
about<00:00:47.610> not<00:00:47.910> bouncing<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.629> head<00:00:48.930> I'm

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and drop let's try a couple more

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.260 
and drop let's try a couple more
last<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:08.010> here<00:01:08.430> great<00:01:08.640> let's<00:01:08.850> try<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
last one here great let's try it on the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.060 
last one here great let's try it on the
other<00:01:09.299> side<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.110> weight<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.530> now<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.890> right

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
other side so weight is now on the right

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.950 
other side so weight is now on the right
left<00:01:11.790> foot<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.780> balance

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
left foot is there just for balance

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.539 
left foot is there just for balance
you're<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.799> really<00:01:14.010> putting<00:01:14.250> any<00:01:14.490> weight

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
you're not really putting any weight

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.490 
you're not really putting any weight
into<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.119> toe<00:01:15.330> you're<00:01:15.540> creating<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
into that toe you're creating all the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
into that toe you're creating all the
movement<00:01:16.860> from<00:01:17.250> your<00:01:17.549> obliques<00:01:18.030> same<00:01:18.210> thing

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
movement from your obliques same thing

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.480 
movement from your obliques same thing
here<00:01:18.630> we're<00:01:18.869> squeezing<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.380> lift<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.890> drop

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
here we're squeezing to lift and drop

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.640 
here we're squeezing to lift and drop
squeeze<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.210> lift<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.020> release<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
squeeze to lift then just release to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.920 
squeeze to lift then just release to
drop<00:01:22.860> dropping<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.580> neutral<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.630> want<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.840> be

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
drop dropping to neutral you want to be

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.170 
drop dropping to neutral you want to be
sure<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.350> upper<00:01:25.619> body<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.180> released

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
sure that the upper body is released

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.420 
sure that the upper body is released
from<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.840> nice<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.290> lifted<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.009> you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
from this it's nice and lifted and you

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.039 
from this it's nice and lifted and you
want<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.729> think<00:01:29.850> about<00:01:30.090> keeping<00:01:30.270> adding<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
want to think about keeping adding that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.469 
want to think about keeping adding that
engagement<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.070> oblique<00:01:32.430> low<00:01:33.060> enough<00:01:33.420> so

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
engagement in the oblique low enough so

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.870 
engagement in the oblique low enough so
that<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.930> don't<00:01:34.110> find<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:34.409> upper<00:01:34.590> body

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
that you don't find your upper body

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.490 
that you don't find your upper body
contracting<00:01:35.880> towards<00:01:36.420> your<00:01:36.630> side<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.350> want

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
contracting towards your side you want

twist and twist excellent so let's put

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.370

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
those two together to look at our comma

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.490 
those two together to look at our comma
a<00:02:24.680> comma<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.460> form<00:02:25.880> of<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.180> drop<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.230> drop

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
a comma is a form of a drop so the drop

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.260 
a comma is a form of a drop so the drop
is<00:02:27.740> going<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.100> be<00:02:28.220> our<00:02:28.310> accent<00:02:28.790> we're<00:02:29.060> going<00:02:29.210> to

is going to be our accent we're going to
get<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.420> dry<00:02:29.660> front<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.950> drop<00:02:31.190> back<00:02:31.700> we're

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
get a dry front and a drop back we're

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.670 
get a dry front and a drop back we're
going<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.390> look<00:02:32.510> at<00:02:32.630> this<00:02:32.780> from<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.140> side<00:02:33.350> here

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
going to look at this from the side here

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.900 
going to look at this from the side here
so<00:02:33.710> first<00:02:34.010> we're<00:02:34.190> going<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.340> do<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.520> comma<00:02:34.700> on

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
so first we're going to do the comma on

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.580 
so first we're going to do the comma on
the<00:02:35.030> right<00:02:35.210> kick<00:02:35.450> all<00:02:35.840> our<00:02:36.080> weight<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.380> on<00:02:36.470> the

the right kick all our weight is on the
left<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:37.010> comments<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.640> unweighted

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
left the comments and unweighted

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.610 
left the comments and unweighted
movement<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:38.780> there's<00:02:38.960> no<00:02:39.080> way<00:02:39.230> here<00:02:39.440> on<00:02:39.530> the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
pointing basically forward though it is

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.390 
pointing basically forward though it is
going<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.560> get<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> little<00:03:21.920> bit<00:03:22.070> of<00:03:22.130> an<00:03:22.220> angle

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
going to get a little bit of an angle

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.860 
going to get a little bit of an angle
change<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:23.239> which<00:03:23.360> is<00:03:23.480> totally<00:03:23.840> fine

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
change to it which is totally fine

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.810 
change to it which is totally fine
because<00:03:24.770> there's<00:03:24.950> no<00:03:25.070> weight<00:03:25.280> on<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.640> and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
because there's no weight on it and

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.370 
because there's no weight on it and
you'll<00:03:25.910> notice<00:03:26.120> my<00:03:26.270> toe<00:03:26.330> is<00:03:26.690> also<00:03:26.930> twisting

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
you'll notice my toe is also twisting

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.830 
you'll notice my toe is also twisting
ever<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:27.860> slightly<00:03:28.100> on<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.400> ground<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.480> don't

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
ever so slightly on the ground so don't

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.190 
ever so slightly on the ground so don't
focus<00:03:30.110> on<00:03:30.640> letting<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.790> knee<00:03:32.090> move<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.780> lot<00:03:33.020> to

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
focus on letting the knee move a lot to

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.660 
focus on letting the knee move a lot to
create<00:03:33.470> this<00:03:33.590> movement<00:03:33.770> think<00:03:34.250> about<00:03:34.489> them

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
create this movement think about them

few<00:04:23.150> more<00:04:23.419> right<00:04:23.690> here<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.910> last<00:04:25.910> one<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:28.070> this

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
few more right here and last one so this

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.159 
few more right here and last one so this
movement<00:04:28.430> is<00:04:28.639> actually<00:04:28.729> a<00:04:29.000> lot<00:04:29.419> faster<00:04:30.020> when

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
movement is actually a lot faster when

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.870 
movement is actually a lot faster when
we<00:04:30.290> do<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.530> with<00:04:30.650> music<00:04:30.800> so<00:04:31.370> let's<00:04:31.550> look<00:04:31.639> at<00:04:31.790> the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
we do it with music so let's look at the

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.310 
we do it with music so let's look at the
right<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.180> left<00:04:32.300> really<00:04:32.570> quickly<00:04:32.870> up<00:04:33.050> to

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
right and left really quickly up to

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.439 
right and left really quickly up to
tempo<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:34.130> downbeat<00:04:34.580> is<00:04:34.669> always<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.180> front

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
tempo the downbeat is always the front

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.360 
tempo the downbeat is always the front
and<00:04:35.780> then<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.110> back<00:04:36.139> is<00:04:36.500> always<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:37.010> other

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
and then the back is always the other

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.340 
and then the back is always the other
reach<00:04:37.639> so<00:04:38.360> if<00:04:38.449> we're<00:04:38.600> doing<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.960> here<00:04:39.020> on<00:04:39.260> the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
reach so if we're doing it here on the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.540 
reach so if we're doing it here on the
right<00:04:39.500> let's<00:04:39.680> go<00:04:39.770> ahead<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.040> bring<00:04:40.130> our<00:04:40.250> arms
