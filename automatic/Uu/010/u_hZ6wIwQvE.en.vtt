00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960

which<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.230> 1440p<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:33.270> brightness<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.260> think

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
which is 1440p the brightness I think

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.700 
which is 1440p the brightness I think
that's<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.100> brightness<00:00:36.350> no<00:00:37.350> that's<00:00:37.590> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that's the brightness no that's a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.479 
that's the brightness no that's a
contrast<00:00:38.190> ratio<00:00:38.610> 1001<00:00:39.469> brightness<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> 300

six<00:00:50.820> mil<00:00:51.210> milliseconds<00:00:52.050> great<00:00:52.260> agree<00:00:52.469> which<00:00:52.739> I

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
six mil milliseconds great agree which I

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.650 
six mil milliseconds great agree which I
think<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.579> trust<00:00:53.879> more<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.390> six

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
think I trust more because six

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.950 
think I trust more because six

with<00:00:58.140> tilt<00:00:58.530> feature<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:59.670> eco-friendly<00:01:00.149> it

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
with tilt feature it's eco-friendly it

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.290 
with tilt feature it's eco-friendly it
only<00:01:01.170> contains<00:01:01.649> about<00:01:01.800> 31<00:01:02.250> watts<00:01:02.850> which<00:01:03.149> is

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
only contains about 31 watts which is

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.780 
only contains about 31 watts which is
really<00:01:03.570> good<00:01:03.719> considering<00:01:04.170> other<00:01:04.790> monitors

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
really good considering other monitors

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.469 
really good considering other monitors
consuming<00:01:06.360> me<00:01:06.479> about<00:01:06.780> 60<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.909> LED<00:01:08.909> backlit<00:01:09.270> so

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
consuming me about 60 and LED backlit so

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.380 
consuming me about 60 and LED backlit so
let's<00:01:09.689> get<00:01:10.350> right<00:01:10.530> into<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:11.600> tab<00:01:14.119> okay<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
let's get right into this tab okay the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:25.520 
let's get right into this tab okay the
second<00:01:15.780> tab<00:01:16.020> open<00:01:16.430> all<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:21.799> okay<00:01:24.110> what<00:01:25.110> do

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
second tab open all right okay what do

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:35.580 
second tab open all right okay what do
we<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.830> here<00:01:26.900> okay<00:01:27.900> so

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.780 

alright<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:37.300> there's<00:01:38.300> a<00:01:39.400> table<00:01:40.400> for<00:01:40.760> the

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
alright so there's a table for the

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:52.150 
alright so there's a table for the
speakers<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:49.520> power<00:01:49.850> cable<00:01:50.740> looks<00:01:51.740> kind<00:01:52.100> of

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
speakers the power cable looks kind of

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.160 
speakers the power cable looks kind of
like<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.670> Korean<00:01:53.060> cut<00:01:53.300> power<00:01:53.480> cable<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:53.960> think

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
like the Korean cut power cable I think

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.100 
like the Korean cut power cable I think
I'll<00:01:54.260> just<00:01:54.290> use<00:01:54.620> my<00:01:54.650> own<00:01:54.950> cable<00:01:55.930> that's<00:01:56.930> what

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
I'll just use my own cable that's what

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.710 
I'll just use my own cable that's what
others<00:01:57.470> have<00:01:57.950> been<00:01:57.980> doing<00:01:58.370> the<00:01:59.300> power<00:01:59.570> adapter

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
others have been doing the power adapter

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.070 
others have been doing the power adapter
it's<00:02:00.260> a<00:02:00.500> little<00:02:00.740> bit<00:02:00.830> small<00:02:01.280> but<00:02:01.960> it's<00:02:02.960> all
