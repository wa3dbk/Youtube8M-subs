00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
I'm Nicholas Charlton at the University

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.730 
I'm Nicholas Charlton at the University
of<00:00:08.130> Bristol<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.760> i'm<00:00:09.389> studying<00:00:09.750> bumblebees

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
of Bristol and i'm studying bumblebees

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.879 
of Bristol and i'm studying bumblebees
and<00:00:11.990> what<00:00:12.990> i've<00:00:13.080> got<00:00:13.230> here<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.500> some

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
and what i've got here is some

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.870 
and what i've got here is some
bumblebees<00:00:14.700> we've<00:00:15.509> got<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> live<00:00:15.990> colony<00:00:16.590> and

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
bumblebees we've got a live colony and

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.150 
bumblebees we've got a live colony and
that<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.119> box<00:00:18.359> with<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.170> queen<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.710> workers

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
that in a box with a queen and workers

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.609 
that in a box with a queen and workers
and<00:00:21.380> they<00:00:22.380> come<00:00:23.250> for<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.519> tube<00:00:23.820> into<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.619> box

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and they come for a tube into this box

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.939 
and they come for a tube into this box
here<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.660> call<00:00:27.869> at<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.410> flight

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
here and this we call at the flight

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.970 
here and this we call at the flight
arena<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.570> they<00:00:30.990> fly<00:00:31.260> out<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.619> colony

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
arena and so they fly out of the colony

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.889 
arena and so they fly out of the colony
and<00:00:32.009> they<00:00:32.250> come<00:00:32.550> into<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.120> actually<00:00:33.480> feed

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
and they come into here to actually feed

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.990 
and they come into here to actually feed
and<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> moment<00:00:35.190> they're<00:00:35.489> feeding<00:00:35.700> from

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and at the moment they're feeding from

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.750 
and at the moment they're feeding from
artificial<00:00:36.600> flowers<00:00:37.200> which<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.399> made<00:00:38.610> of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
artificial flowers which is just made of

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.229 
artificial flowers which is just made of
colored<00:00:39.450> plastic<00:00:39.690> discs<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.250> small<00:00:42.000> well

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
colored plastic discs with a small well

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.229 
colored plastic discs with a small well
in<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> middle<00:00:42.840> filled<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.320> sugar<00:00:43.920> solution

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
in the middle filled with sugar solution

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.459 
in the middle filled with sugar solution
so<00:00:45.239> they<00:00:45.360> come<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:45.840> feed<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.289> then<00:00:46.379> they

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
so they come in they feed and then they

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.830 
so they come in they feed and then they
go<00:00:46.590> back<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> colony<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> flight

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
go back to the colony so in the flight

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.010 
go back to the colony so in the flight
arena<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> bumblebees<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.539> get

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
arena with the bumblebees we can get

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.049 
arena with the bumblebees we can get
them<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.199> feed<00:00:52.590> from<00:00:53.010> different<00:00:53.579> things<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
them to feed from different things and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.069 
them to feed from different things and
we<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.920> feed<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.250> sugar<00:00:56.879> solution<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.570> we

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
we get to feed on sugar solution and we

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.049 
we get to feed on sugar solution and we
can<00:00:58.199> put<00:00:58.350> them<00:00:58.530> into<00:00:58.680> these<00:00:58.890> these<00:00:59.520> artificial

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
can put them into these these artificial

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.119 
can put them into these these artificial
flowers<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.320> doesn't<00:01:01.469> look<00:01:01.590> much<00:01:01.890> like

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
flowers I know it doesn't look much like

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.750 
flowers I know it doesn't look much like
a<00:01:02.370> flower<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> colored<00:01:03.719> discs<00:01:04.760> represent

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
a flower but the colored discs represent

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.539 
a flower but the colored discs represent
the<00:01:05.939> petals<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.600> flower<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.310> center

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the petals of a flower and in the center

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.760 
the petals of a flower and in the center
is<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.820> small<00:01:09.180> well<00:01:09.450> where<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.290> put<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
is a small well where we can put the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
is a small well where we can put the
sugar<00:01:10.950> solution<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.670> which<00:01:12.390> they<00:01:12.570> learn<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
sugar solution and which they learn to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.990 
sugar solution and which they learn to
feed<00:01:13.110> from<00:01:13.320> quite<00:01:13.799> quickly<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.369> there<00:01:14.939> are

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
feed from quite quickly and there are

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.179 
feed from quite quickly and there are
also<00:01:15.090> other<00:01:15.360> ways<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.990> represent<00:01:16.320> artificial

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
also other ways to represent artificial

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.850 
also other ways to represent artificial
flowers<00:01:17.549> different<00:01:17.880> flower<00:01:18.299> shapes<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.990> even

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
flowers different flower shapes and even

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.450 
flowers different flower shapes and even
paper<00:01:20.070> flowers<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.170> we<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.350> use<00:01:22.560> these<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
paper flowers and we can use these to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.109 
paper flowers and we can use these to
ask<00:01:23.580> questions<00:01:24.060> about<00:01:24.320> how<00:01:25.320> bees<00:01:26.119> choose

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
ask questions about how bees choose

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.660 
ask questions about how bees choose
which<00:01:27.420> flowers<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.900> visit<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.460> what<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
which flowers to visit and what the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.390 
which flowers to visit and what the
triggers<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.380> motivate<00:01:31.380> them<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> visit

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
triggers that motivate them to visit

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.090 
triggers that motivate them to visit
pets<00:01:33.030> may<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.509> asking<00:01:34.200> questions<00:01:34.560> about<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
pets may be asking questions about the

colors of the petals or or even the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.510 
colors of the petals or or even the
textures<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.820> are<00:01:39.890> there<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.159> petals

one<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.850> things<00:01:47.909> I've<00:01:48.240> been<00:01:48.360> trying<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.869> do

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
one of the things I've been trying to do

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.950 
one of the things I've been trying to do
is<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.829> set<00:01:50.009> up<00:01:50.159> experiments<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.030> lab<00:01:51.270> with

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
is to set up experiments in the lab with

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.160 
is to set up experiments in the lab with
fees<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.280> artificial<00:01:53.670> flowers<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.780> look<00:01:54.990> at

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
fees and artificial flowers to look at

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.850 
fees and artificial flowers to look at
what<00:01:55.649> drives<00:01:56.549> their<00:01:56.880> decisions<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.930> which

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
what drives their decisions on which

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.219 
what drives their decisions on which
flowers<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.430> visit<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:01.049> natural

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
flowers to visit so in a natural

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.859 
flowers to visit so in a natural
environment<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.329> you<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.479> different

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
environment and you have different

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.350 
environment and you have different
flower<00:02:04.049> species<00:02:04.729> different<00:02:05.729> species<00:02:05.939> will

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
flower species different species will

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.240 
flower species different species will
have<00:02:06.600> different<00:02:06.869> amounts<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.320> nectar<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.429> them

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
have different amounts of nectar in them

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.620 
have different amounts of nectar in them
and<00:02:09.340> then<00:02:09.550> it's<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.880> nectar<00:02:10.240> that<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.479> bees

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
and then it's the nectar that the bees

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.700 
and then it's the nectar that the bees
one<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:12.190> more<00:02:12.400> nectar<00:02:12.730> they<00:02:13.290> get<00:02:14.290> more

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
one and the more nectar they get more

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.770 
one and the more nectar they get more
energy<00:02:14.860> they<00:02:15.190> get<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:16.210> greater<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
energy they get and the greater the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.490 
energy they get and the greater the
success<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.920> colony<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:19.500> greater

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
success of the colony and greater

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.020 
success of the colony and greater
success<00:02:20.980> means<00:02:21.220> more<00:02:21.460> bees<00:02:21.700> and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
success means more bees and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.060 
success means more bees and
interestingly<00:02:22.770> these<00:02:23.770> bees<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:25.360> show

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
interestingly these bees can show

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.010 
interestingly these bees can show
behavior<00:02:27.070> where<00:02:27.250> they<00:02:27.400> bite<00:02:28.120> into<00:02:28.570> flowers

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
behavior where they bite into flowers

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.050 
behavior where they bite into flowers
that<00:02:29.890> they<00:02:30.010> wouldn't<00:02:30.280> normally<00:02:30.340> how<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.760> reach

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
that they wouldn't normally how to reach

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.870 
that they wouldn't normally how to reach
the<00:02:31.780> nectar<00:02:32.170> from<00:02:32.590> because<00:02:33.490> their<00:02:33.640> tongues

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
the nectar from because their tongues

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.520 
the nectar from because their tongues
are<00:02:34.030> too<00:02:34.150> short<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.990> flowers<00:02:35.230> are<00:02:35.410> too

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
are too short and the flowers are too

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.370 
are too short and the flowers are too
deep<00:02:35.740> so<00:02:36.610> I'm<00:02:37.390> going<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.720> try<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:37.930> set<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.200> an

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
deep so I'm going to try and set up an

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.340 
deep so I'm going to try and set up an
experiment<00:02:38.709> where<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:40.030> put<00:02:40.330> in<00:02:40.510> paper<00:02:40.930> tubes

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
experiment where I put in paper tubes

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.060 
experiment where I put in paper tubes
that<00:02:41.650> represent<00:02:42.220> deep<00:02:43.120> flowers<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.050> see<00:02:44.890> if<00:02:44.980> I

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
that represent deep flowers and see if I

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.920 
that represent deep flowers and see if I
can<00:02:45.250> get<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.520> bees<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:46.120> chew<00:02:46.360> holes<00:02:46.630> in<00:02:46.810> them

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
can get the bees to chew holes in them

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.190 
can get the bees to chew holes in them
to<00:02:47.170> get<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.500> nectar<00:02:47.680> out<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.450> then<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.690> can<00:02:49.989> ask

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
to get the nectar out and then I can ask

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.130 
to get the nectar out and then I can ask
questions<00:02:50.230> about<00:02:51.360> how<00:02:52.360> many<00:02:52.570> flowers<00:02:52.959> do<00:02:53.110> I

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
questions about how many flowers do I

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.490 
questions about how many flowers do I
need<00:02:53.440> in<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:55.300> flight<00:02:55.570> arena<00:02:55.870> like<00:02:56.050> this<00:02:56.200> for

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
need in a flight arena like this for

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.850 
need in a flight arena like this for
them<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.620> switch<00:02:57.580> between<00:02:58.320> sort<00:02:59.320> of<00:02:59.380> normal

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860

behavior where they two holes in the
flowers<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:05.110> study<00:03:05.980> bees<00:03:06.220> because<00:03:06.610> they're<00:03:07.300> so

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
flowers I study bees because they're so

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.479 
flowers I study bees because they're so
important<00:03:08.560> as<00:03:08.670> effective<00:03:09.670> pollinator<00:03:10.300> of

and<00:03:15.209> bumblebees<00:03:16.209> are<00:03:16.390> in<00:03:16.480> decline<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.080> if<00:03:18.070> we

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
and bumblebees are in decline and if we

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.520 
and bumblebees are in decline and if we
don't<00:03:18.760> hold<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.540> decline<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:19.930> bumblebees

don't hold the decline of bumblebees

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.340 
don't hold the decline of bumblebees
eventually<00:03:21.160> we<00:03:21.310> could<00:03:21.519> have<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:22.350> catastrophe

eventually we could have a catastrophe
where<00:03:23.620> we<00:03:23.860> can't<00:03:24.130> produce<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.610> crops<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:25.000> we

that people can't afford to buy them and
we<00:03:30.489> also<00:03:30.640> may<00:03:30.940> lose<00:03:31.209> important<00:03:32.080> plant
