training cycle that i am trying to come
up<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.550> will<00:00:35.700> release<00:00:36.149> once<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.170> finished

up with and will release once I finished
the<00:00:37.560> next<00:00:37.980> 12-week<00:00:38.370> training<00:00:38.399> block<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.850> know<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the next 12-week training block I know I

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.310 
the next 12-week training block I know I
get<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.270> question<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.660> lot<00:00:39.750> I'm<00:00:39.899> trying<00:00:40.200> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
get that question a lot I'm trying to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.840 
get that question a lot I'm trying to
really<00:00:40.530> work<00:00:40.710> some<00:00:40.950> tweaks<00:00:41.220> out<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
really work some tweaks out of this and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
really work some tweaks out of this and
I'm<00:00:42.270> also<00:00:42.390> running<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.870> by<00:00:42.990> a<00:00:43.020> few<00:00:43.260> friends

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
I'm also running it by a few friends

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.290 
I'm also running it by a few friends
just<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> get<00:00:44.070> their<00:00:44.250> input<00:00:44.430> about<00:00:44.700> what<00:00:45.060> they

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
just to get their input about what they

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.330 
just to get their input about what they
think<00:00:45.360> could<00:00:46.320> potentially<00:00:47.010> make<00:00:47.160> this

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
think could potentially make this

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.220 
think could potentially make this
program<00:00:47.820> better<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.300> will<00:00:48.720> be<00:00:48.840> coming<00:00:49.110> out

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
program better so I will be coming out

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.990 
program better so I will be coming out
with<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.470> program<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.160> nothing<00:00:50.550> special

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
with this program it's nothing special

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700 
with this program it's nothing special
necessarily<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:51.900> just<00:00:52.260> something<00:00:52.560> that<00:00:52.680> I

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
necessarily it's just something that I

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.410 
necessarily it's just something that I
found<00:00:53.070> has<00:00:53.340> worked<00:00:53.580> well<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.820> me<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.390> can

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
found has worked well for me as you can

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.080 
found has worked well for me as you can

not to mention my issues of strength
have<00:01:20.460> really<00:01:20.789> been<00:01:20.939> stemming<00:01:21.450> from<00:01:21.479> my<00:01:21.929> hip<00:01:22.200> in

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
have really been stemming from my hip in

have really been stemming from my hip in
my<00:01:22.560> groin<00:01:22.770> area<00:01:23.189> some<00:01:23.460> might<00:01:23.609> say<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:23.880> from

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:23.999 
my groin area some might say it's from

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:25.219 
my groin area some might say it's from
overuse<00:01:24.329> I<00:01:24.479> mean<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.719> don't<00:01:24.810> know<00:01:25.079> I'm<00:01:25.200> just

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
overuse I mean I don't know I'm just

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.620 
overuse I mean I don't know I'm just
putting<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.619> out<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:26.149> after<00:01:27.149> skin

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
putting that out there after skin

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.539 
putting that out there after skin
fitness<00:01:27.960> maybe<00:01:28.109> maybe<00:01:28.679> not<00:01:28.859> I<00:01:29.009> don't<00:01:29.130> know<00:01:29.310> do

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
fitness maybe maybe not I don't know do

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.099 
fitness maybe maybe not I don't know do
what<00:01:29.639> you<00:01:29.700> got<00:01:29.819> to<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:29.999> but<00:01:30.479> as<00:01:30.600> part<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.899> that

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
what you got to do but as part of that

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.499 
what you got to do but as part of that
why<00:01:32.069> I<00:01:32.100> took<00:01:32.249> so<00:01:32.520> much<00:01:32.639> time<00:01:32.909> off<00:01:33.119> which<00:01:33.359> was

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
why I took so much time off which was

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.179 
why I took so much time off which was
roughly<00:01:34.020> about<00:01:34.109> three<00:01:34.499> weeks<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.069> then

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
roughly about three weeks and then

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.830 
roughly about three weeks and then
really<00:01:35.520> kind<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.819> slowly<00:01:36.179> reintroducing

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
really kind of slowly reintroducing

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.959 
really kind of slowly reintroducing
myself<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.409> lifting<00:01:37.770> was<00:01:38.280> because<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> was

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
myself to lifting was because I was

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:40.879 
myself to lifting was because I was
dealing<00:01:39.179> with<00:01:39.479> some<00:01:39.719> groin<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.200> hip<00:01:40.409> issues

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:40.889 
dealing with some groin and hip issues

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:43.160 
dealing with some groin and hip issues
mainly<00:01:41.219> because<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:42.420> was<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:42.810> kinds<00:01:43.109> of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
mainly because it was just all kinds of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.550 
mainly because it was just all kinds of
 up<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.889> as<00:01:44.340> part<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.819> this<00:01:45.079> 525<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.409> me

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
 up so as part of this 525 for me

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.440 
 up so as part of this 525 for me
would<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:46.889> been<00:01:47.069> a<00:01:47.100> win<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.639> you<00:01:48.030> guys<00:01:48.179> know

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
would have been a win and you guys know

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.699 
would have been a win and you guys know
from<00:01:48.749> the<00:01:48.869> programming<00:01:49.319> that<00:01:49.469> I've<00:01:49.619> been

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
from the programming that I've been

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.379 
from the programming that I've been
doing<00:01:49.889> the<00:01:49.950> last<00:01:49.979> 12<00:01:50.369> weeks<00:01:50.429> I<00:01:50.789> started<00:01:50.850> with

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:51.389 
doing the last 12 weeks I started with

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:53.359 
doing the last 12 weeks I started with
my<00:01:51.420> max<00:01:51.810> kind<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.259> set<00:01:52.499> for<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:52.979> most<00:01:53.159> part

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
my max kind of set for the most part

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.800 
my max kind of set for the most part
about<00:01:53.429> a<00:01:53.549> hundred<00:01:53.909> pounds<00:01:54.179> less<00:01:54.420> than<00:01:54.450> what

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
about a hundred pounds less than what

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.870 
about a hundred pounds less than what
they<00:01:54.959> were<00:01:55.020> before<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.529> really<00:01:56.100> slow<00:01:56.340> trying

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
they were before so really slow trying

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.419 
they were before so really slow trying
to<00:01:56.999> rebuild<00:01:57.389> and<00:01:57.749> not<00:01:58.229> necessarily<00:01:58.679> jump<00:01:59.039> too

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
to rebuild and not necessarily jump too

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.370 
to rebuild and not necessarily jump too
fast<00:01:59.819> into<00:02:00.090> things<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:00.869> go<00:02:01.020> ahead<00:02:01.139> and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
fast into things to just go ahead and

fast into things to just go ahead and
 myself<00:02:01.799> up<00:02:02.249> so<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.090> particular<00:02:03.299> day

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
 myself up so on this particular day

 myself up so on this particular day
wearing<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.289> hoodie<00:02:04.529> throughout<00:02:05.279> the<00:02:05.429> whole

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
wearing a hoodie throughout the whole

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.429 
wearing a hoodie throughout the whole
session<00:02:05.819> just<00:02:06.149> felt<00:02:06.450> more<00:02:06.749> comfortable<00:02:06.959> doing

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
session just felt more comfortable doing

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.230 
session just felt more comfortable doing
it<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.740> way<00:02:07.979> throwing<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> hood<00:02:08.880> over<00:02:09.209> my

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
it this way throwing the hood over my

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.910 
it this way throwing the hood over my
head<00:02:09.360> really<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:09.990> kind<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.200> let<00:02:10.349> me<00:02:10.470> block

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
head really just kind of let me block

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.890 
head really just kind of let me block
out<00:02:11.130> everything<00:02:11.370> else<00:02:11.790> that's<00:02:11.940> going<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.569> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
out everything else that's going on and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.330 
out everything else that's going on and
things<00:02:13.170> were<00:02:13.290> feeling<00:02:13.680> pretty<00:02:13.860> good<00:02:14.099> for<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
things were feeling pretty good for the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.850 
things were feeling pretty good for the
most<00:02:14.459> part<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.330> say<00:02:15.599> that<00:02:15.840> only<00:02:16.290> because

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
most part and I say that only because

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.010 
most part and I say that only because
the<00:02:17.610> walkouts<00:02:18.060> for<00:02:18.270> me<00:02:18.360> recently<00:02:18.600> have<00:02:18.900> been

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
the walkouts for me recently have been

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.120 
the walkouts for me recently have been
very<00:02:19.230> tough<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.620> think<00:02:19.830> that's<00:02:19.980> just

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
very tough and I think that's just

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.610 
very tough and I think that's just
because<00:02:20.280> I'm<00:02:20.490> not<00:02:20.610> used<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.910> handling<00:02:21.120> heavy

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
because I'm not used to handling heavy

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.059 
because I'm not used to handling heavy
wait<00:02:21.739> so<00:02:22.010> here<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.519> see<00:02:22.549> my<00:02:23.290> 525<00:02:24.290> pound<00:02:24.620> set<00:02:24.890> so

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
wait so here you see my 525 pound set so

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.309 
wait so here you see my 525 pound set so
this<00:02:25.280> was<00:02:25.519> my<00:02:26.150> goal<00:02:26.360> for<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.629> day<00:02:26.750> this<00:02:26.900> was<00:02:27.080> a

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
this was my goal for the day this was a

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.330 
this was my goal for the day this was a
hundred<00:02:27.890> percent<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:28.569> my<00:02:29.709> predicted<00:02:30.709> max<00:02:30.950> just

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
hundred percent of my predicted max just

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.009 
hundred percent of my predicted max just
based<00:02:31.549> on<00:02:31.670> how<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.909> train<00:02:32.209> was<00:02:32.390> going<00:02:32.659> I<00:02:32.810> felt

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
based on how the train was going I felt

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.330 
based on how the train was going I felt
this<00:02:33.140> would<00:02:33.319> be<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.470> good<00:02:33.680> number<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.129> go<00:02:34.250> ahead

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
this would be a good number to go ahead

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.539 
this would be a good number to go ahead
and<00:02:34.549> aim<00:02:34.700> for<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:36.590> goes<00:02:36.769> slow<00:02:37.069> but<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.370> goes

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
and aim for and it goes slow but it goes

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.550 
and aim for and it goes slow but it goes
up<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.030> as<00:02:38.239> part<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:38.840> program<00:02:39.110> of<00:02:39.379> the<00:02:39.440> way

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
up so as part of this program of the way

up so as part of this program of the way
I'm<00:02:39.680> doing<00:02:39.799> my<00:02:40.040> maxes<00:02:40.459> is<00:02:40.640> if<00:02:40.849> I<00:02:41.000> hit<00:02:41.329> my<00:02:41.810> main

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
depending on how I felt so in this case

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.500 
depending on how I felt so in this case
I<00:02:49.010> took<00:02:49.069> a<00:02:49.250> little<00:02:49.370> bit<00:02:49.549> of<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.790> bigger<00:02:50.000> jump<00:02:50.269> and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
I took a little bit of a bigger jump and

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.910 
I took a little bit of a bigger jump and
jumped<00:02:50.780> up<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:51.019> five<00:02:51.260> hundred<00:02:51.290> forty<00:02:51.709> five

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
jumped up to five hundred forty five

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.069 
jumped up to five hundred forty five
pounds<00:02:52.220> for<00:02:53.030> me<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.299> might<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:53.629> be<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.780> mental

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
pounds for me it might just be a mental

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.479 
pounds for me it might just be a mental
thing<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.470> feel<00:02:54.560> more<00:02:54.920> comfortable<00:02:55.250> when

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
thing but I feel more comfortable when

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.190 
thing but I feel more comfortable when
there's<00:02:55.670> less<00:02:55.940> actual<00:02:56.450> plates<00:02:56.720> on<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.989> bar

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
just half the problem and I had to reset

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.599 
just half the problem and I had to reset
and<00:03:06.379> normally<00:03:06.739> in<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:06.890> past<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:07.190> probably<00:03:07.370> have

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
and normally in the past I probably have

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:08.589 
and normally in the past I probably have
given<00:03:07.700> up<00:03:07.909> right<00:03:08.060> there<00:03:08.209> because<00:03:08.359> this<00:03:08.450> would

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
given up right there because this would

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.119 
given up right there because this would
have<00:03:08.629> thrown<00:03:08.930> off<00:03:09.049> my<00:03:09.079> whole<00:03:09.379> mental<00:03:09.709> aspect

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
have thrown off my whole mental aspect

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.470 
have thrown off my whole mental aspect
that<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.280> had<00:03:10.430> going<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.819> was<00:03:10.909> really<00:03:11.090> focused<00:03:11.420> at

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
that I had going I was really focused at

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.839 
that I had going I was really focused at
this<00:03:11.599> point<00:03:11.950> step<00:03:12.950> aside<00:03:13.069> stop<00:03:13.430> being<00:03:13.609> a<00:03:13.700> bitch

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
this point step aside stop being a bitch

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.520 
this point step aside stop being a bitch
put<00:03:14.120> my<00:03:14.269> hoodie<00:03:14.450> up<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:14.900> just<00:03:14.989> decided<00:03:15.409> to

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
put my hoodie up and just decided to

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.750 
put my hoodie up and just decided to
squat<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:18.230> goes<00:03:18.349> slow<00:03:18.680> but<00:03:18.980> not<00:03:19.220> too<00:03:19.430> bad<00:03:19.609> I

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
squat and it goes slow but not too bad I

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.860 
squat and it goes slow but not too bad I
might<00:03:19.940> have<00:03:20.090> been<00:03:20.180> able<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.420> jump<00:03:20.569> up<00:03:20.629> a<00:03:20.720> little

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
might have been able to jump up a little

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.720 
might have been able to jump up a little
bit<00:03:21.019> more<00:03:21.140> but<00:03:21.349> again<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.799> only<00:03:22.099> do<00:03:22.280> one<00:03:22.459> jump

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
bit more but again I only do one jump

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.369 
bit more but again I only do one jump
past<00:03:22.940> my<00:03:23.090> max<00:03:23.329> on<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.629> particular<00:03:23.870> set<00:03:24.230> so
