change they do that a couple of places

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.680 
change they do that a couple of places
in<00:06:26.430> the<00:06:26.490> Bible<00:06:26.760> where<00:06:26.790> it<00:06:26.910> says<00:06:26.970> if<00:06:27.270> you<00:06:27.510> say

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
in the Bible where it says if you say

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.880 
in the Bible where it says if you say
this<00:06:27.840> you're<00:06:28.050> okay<00:06:28.230> but<00:06:28.530> when<00:06:28.620> they<00:06:28.710> get<00:06:28.830> to

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890

this you're okay but when they get to
the<00:06:28.980> not<00:06:29.160> part<00:06:29.520> they<00:06:30.360> change<00:06:30.660> it<00:06:30.780> there

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
the not part they change it there

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.080
