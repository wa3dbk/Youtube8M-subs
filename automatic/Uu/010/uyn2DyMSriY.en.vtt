00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Christmas is coming and I'm going today. 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.350
 show how to make snowflakes from 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.350
 paper decorated with 1 to 5 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.199
 this is another experiment from our 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.609
 dear book of the world's manual if you 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.010
 would you like to know more about it? 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.050
 I'm leaving nobody down here for 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.180
 make this experience decorative and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.010
 need only four things that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.230
 will probably have it at home 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.000
 the first is coffee filter as 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.949
 bigger the better and this is the biggest that I 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.380
 I found you will also need 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.969
 purple cabbage that cabbage here 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.770
 in supermarkets and do not need 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.660
 use the full support of half of eating 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.850
 the rest you will also need 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.710
 baking soda you find 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.059
 on the side of the spices in the supermarket 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 It is very cheap, it cost a real 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.680
 sixty-nine here and as acid to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.809
 You'll use a little bit of the end 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.920
 first step is to make a tea 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.469
 concentrate of our friend here I 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.410
 I'll look good, the cabbage put in. 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.149
 the blender and beat with water and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.040
 then I'll put a pot and carry it on 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.590
 fire until boiling 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.659
 Then I hope it cools down a bit. 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.210
 mix and bring to the fire again 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.189
 letting the water go down well it needs 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.280
 evaporate to make a good broth 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.610
 focused 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.470
 now we have an ultra mega liquid 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.770
 concentrate of purple cabbage and we will 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.869
 use this to reach the filter paper 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.420
 to be very strong and can 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.909
 paper let it dry and wet again 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.840
 let the look dry again until you 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.840
 very purple 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.250
 It took a little while to dry so I 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.350
 I left from one day to the next and here 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.870
 people have a very special role 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.720
 it's a paper that changes color if it comes in 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.400
 in contact with the acid a peace 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.020
 So you can see straight as 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.060
 It works, I'm going to put a 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.920
 little vinegar in the other a little bit of 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.540
 baking soda with water 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.350
 Look what happens when the 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.350
 local boat 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.040
 haha ha 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.870
 purple cabbage that is purple when it 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.880
 came in contact with the acid it goes 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.740
 going red or pink and when 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.050
 comes in contact with a base it goes 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.150
 going deeper into green and yellow. 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.900
 chemistry we call this kind of paper 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.630
 paper indy singer and the coolest is that 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.270
 the base is more or less than an antacid 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.760
 it undoes the acid does then 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.600
 people put this paper is pink on 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.430
 base 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.580
 Look, it's the opposite, too. 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.580
 happens 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.220
 and you may have wondered if you 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.560
 have paper at home you can go out for 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.200
 then doing tests can put the project 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.330
 in its southern refrigerant in the product of 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:10.110
 cleaning up on chi chi chi mihn and see if 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.540
 these are acids or bases are but 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.799
 from chemistry we have already understood 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.840
 Let's leave now for the part 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.040
 and transform this into a 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.810
 Snowflake 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.880
 first you cut a square well 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.160
 right after it is folded square in the 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.290
 half forming a rectangle is you fold 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.170
 this rectangle again just to crease 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.000
 right here in the middle and then you fold one side 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.489
 to the top fold the other forming a 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.840
 kind of heart and then you fold in the 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.480
 half again will appear that 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.880
 ice cream cone and then you cut the 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.670
 from above and then it's just and doing 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.000
 some bowels some neighbors cuts 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.760
 some decorations with the scissors 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.250
 origami and put the tips 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.740
 a little bit on the base a little acid 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.370
 Any way you want it to go 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.910
 color and the end result is this 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.910
 accumulation 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:34.069
 but easy to do experiments at home 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.379
 like this one you find on the website and 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:38.379
 in the book the world manual 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.480
 and if you feel like doing and if 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.180
 allow at home do not forget to give a 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.340
 young woman came down here as a video 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.140
 suggestion I'll leave first as 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.500
 make a juice to collect purple after 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.390
 to change color with acid bases was 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.160
 the first video of the series of 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.350
 experiences of the world manual and is 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.910
 On this side, here I will also leave a 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.470
 another video that we have already used 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.380
 here but we did not teach the 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.750
 do what we tested the acid that 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.050
 the ants then release a video about 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.790
 the jets of acids from the ants inside 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.830
 He's here on the side and I wanted to 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.290
 Enjoy this video here 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.570
 end to talk about a really cool site 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.060
 to learn how to program is a site that 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.740
 You learn the program from scratch. 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.140
 totally free is called time 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.660
 code is a global non-profit 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.790
 and I entered this site that 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.620
 benefited because almost one hour there 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.060
 playing the games you play on 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.960
 Start to learn how the 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.570
 programming 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.490
 so if you do not know absolutely 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.240
 no programming and want to start 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.060
 learn 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.540
 this is a very cool thing to you I 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.250
 I'll leave the site down here and the 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.770
 Youtube people are helping 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.590
 disseminate this initiative that is worldwide 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.840
 So for this evil that you come to me 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.030
 I'm going to leave a video there that you have to 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.500
 access with a code in this video will 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.950
 to tell a secret here in the 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.470
 world 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.570
 you will only be able to get this video if 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.000
 You use the code I'm giving now 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.190
 The code is the one that belongs to mine. 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.590
 side is star ninja so if you 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.930
 enter the code there you will break the 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.970
 The key will gain access to life. 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.910
 you will not have the key to access the 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.160
 video I 'll tell you a little secret that 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.850
 You did not know about some videos from 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.850
 world manual
