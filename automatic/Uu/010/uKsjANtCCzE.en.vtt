male and female colors let's take a

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.540 
male and female colors let's take a
closer<00:00:15.190> look<00:00:16.890> okay<00:00:17.890> so<00:00:17.920> starting<00:00:18.340> at<00:00:18.520> the

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
closer look okay so starting at the

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.630 
closer look okay so starting at the
first<00:00:18.760> page<00:00:19.290> this<00:00:20.290> is<00:00:20.350> a<00:00:20.530> balanced<00:00:20.860> system<00:00:21.070> was

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
first page this is a balanced system was

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.280 
first page this is a balanced system was
it<00:00:21.760> this<00:00:21.940> ones<00:00:22.120> as<00:00:22.240> the<00:00:22.330> a<00:00:22.360> clamp<00:00:22.720> is<00:00:22.870> also<00:00:23.170> to

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
it this ones as the a clamp is also to

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.880 
it this ones as the a clamp is also to
say<00:00:23.470> it's<00:00:23.620> very<00:00:23.830> wooden<00:00:24.190> din<00:00:24.400> 300<00:00:24.940> bar<00:00:25.890> balance

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
say it's very wooden din 300 bar balance

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.920 
say it's very wooden din 300 bar balance
first<00:00:27.130> stage<00:00:27.370> uses<00:00:27.910> a<00:00:27.940> trimer

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
first stage uses a trimer

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.400 
first stage uses a trimer
material<00:00:30.090> diaphragm<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.930> that<00:00:32.050> just<00:00:32.200> adds

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
material diaphragm and that just adds

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.439 
material diaphragm and that just adds
extra<00:00:33.070> flexibility<00:00:33.760> and<00:00:34.030> just<00:00:34.210> helps

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
extra flexibility and just helps

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.810 
extra flexibility and just helps
response<00:00:34.840> time<00:00:35.140> when<00:00:36.100> breathing<00:00:36.340> on<00:00:36.700> the

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
response time when breathing on the

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.350 
response time when breathing on the
regulator<00:00:37.470> it<00:00:38.470> has<00:00:38.650> four<00:00:39.280> low-pressure<00:00:39.880> ports

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
regulator it has four low-pressure ports

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.600 
regulator it has four low-pressure ports
and<00:00:40.510> two<00:00:40.900> high-pressure<00:00:41.290> ports<00:00:41.710> these<00:00:42.370> are

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
and two high-pressure ports these are

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.389 
and two high-pressure ports these are
pre<00:00:42.880> orientated<00:00:43.600> just<00:00:43.899> to<00:00:44.020> help<00:00:44.399> orientation

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
pre orientated just to help orientation

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.299 
pre orientated just to help orientation
of<00:00:45.430> your<00:00:45.520> hoses<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:46.899> best<00:00:47.110> positioning<00:00:47.829> when

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
of your hoses for best positioning when

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.799 
of your hoses for best positioning when
in<00:00:48.399> use<00:00:49.649> moving<00:00:50.649> on<00:00:50.770> to<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:50.980> second<00:00:51.250> stage

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
in use moving on to the second stage

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.990 
in use moving on to the second stage
again<00:00:52.809> this<00:00:52.899> is<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.079> balanced<00:00:53.590> system<00:00:53.880> so<00:00:54.880> it

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
again this is a balanced system so it

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.770 
again this is a balanced system so it
gives<00:00:55.180> you<00:00:55.239> extra<00:00:55.840> intonation<00:00:56.579> performance

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
gives you extra intonation performance

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.910 
gives you extra intonation performance
the<00:00:58.780> design<00:00:59.110> of<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.350> regulator<00:00:59.710> itself

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
the design of the regulator itself

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.829 
the design of the regulator itself
actually<00:01:01.050> aids<00:01:02.460> inhalation<00:01:03.460> as<00:01:03.670> well<00:01:03.969> when

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
actually aids inhalation as well when

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.840 
actually aids inhalation as well when
it's<00:01:04.989> when<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.439> breathe<00:01:05.619> in<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:06.369> just<00:01:06.549> creates

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
it's when you breathe in it just creates

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.419 
it's when you breathe in it just creates
a<00:01:06.939> vortex<00:01:07.090> in<00:01:07.569> size<00:01:07.840> which<00:01:08.590> helps<00:01:08.889> pull<00:01:09.280> the

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
a vortex in size which helps pull the

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:12.389 
a vortex in size which helps pull the
diaphragm<00:01:09.850> down<00:01:10.149> and<00:01:10.450> just<00:01:11.109> again<00:01:11.950> provides

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
diaphragm down and just again provides

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.730 
diaphragm down and just again provides
more<00:01:12.700> air<00:01:12.999> when<00:01:13.329> you<00:01:13.450> breathe<00:01:13.689> in<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:14.590> the

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
more air when you breathe in and the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.010 
more air when you breathe in and the
actual<00:01:14.859> design<00:01:15.369> has<00:01:15.999> got<00:01:16.179> a<00:01:16.209> vent<00:01:16.450> from<00:01:16.749> here

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
actual design has got a vent from here

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.660 
actual design has got a vent from here
which<00:01:17.649> just<00:01:17.679> comes<00:01:18.069> through<00:01:18.249> to<00:01:18.579> the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
which just comes through to the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.719 
which just comes through to the
mouthpiece<00:01:19.119> which<00:01:19.509> gives<00:01:19.959> you<00:01:20.049> direct<00:01:20.709> air<00:01:21.310> to

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
mouthpiece which gives you direct air to

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.580 
mouthpiece which gives you direct air to
your<00:01:21.880> mouth<00:01:22.060> this<00:01:22.810> gives<00:01:23.049> it<00:01:23.170> that<00:01:23.259> extra<00:01:23.350> bit

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
your mouth this gives it that extra bit

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.330 
your mouth this gives it that extra bit
of<00:01:23.709> comfort<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.429> a<00:01:24.729> bit<00:01:24.880> more<00:01:25.029> natural<00:01:25.149> brief

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
of comfort and a bit more natural brief

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.499 
of comfort and a bit more natural brief
let's<00:01:27.340> just<00:01:27.520> take<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.700> closer<00:01:27.939> look<00:01:28.060> at<00:01:28.420> the

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
let's just take a closer look at the

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.429 
let's just take a closer look at the
female<00:01:28.719> version<00:01:30.840> okay<00:01:31.840> so<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.109> female

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
female version okay so the female

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.649 
female version okay so the female
version<00:01:32.619> she<00:01:33.099> dives<00:01:33.369> as<00:01:33.609> Moroz<00:01:34.119> refer<00:01:34.389> to<00:01:34.569> it

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
version she dives as Moroz refer to it

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.449 
version she dives as Moroz refer to it
you<00:01:34.990> can<00:01:35.109> just<00:01:35.289> see<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.560> color<00:01:35.770> variation

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459 
you can just see the color variation

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:40.260 
you can just see the color variation
compared<00:01:37.389> to<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.630> male<00:01:38.319> version<00:01:38.590> it's<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.609> nice

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
compared to the male version it's a nice
