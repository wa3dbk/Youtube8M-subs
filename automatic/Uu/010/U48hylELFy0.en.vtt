 we look for in the real madrid of those that 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.649

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.120
 human resources in other companies in 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.410

 when they look for professionals that 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.730

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.500
 professionals of that organization in the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.330

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.780
 identifies or makes us different there 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.060
 other sports clubs that 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.880
 identify they recognize themselves in 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.459
 around a game style around a 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.220
 type of player or around a 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.310
 territorial ascription in our case 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.260
