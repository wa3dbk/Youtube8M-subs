00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
think what I've done is I've gone ahead

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.439 
think what I've done is I've gone ahead
and<00:00:24.269> purchased<00:00:25.260> myself<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:26.010> new<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.849> new<00:00:27.029> home

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
and purchased myself a new a new home

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.890 
and purchased myself a new a new home
defense<00:00:28.050> system<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.580> called<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.510> fully

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
defense system it is called the fully

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.430 
defense system it is called the fully
automatic<00:00:31.520> ion<00:00:32.520> laser<00:00:33.270> defense<00:00:34.170> system<00:00:36.440> all

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
automatic ion laser defense system all

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.580 
automatic ion laser defense system all
right<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.280> thing<00:00:38.550> has<00:00:38.820> got<00:00:39.030> three

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
right so this thing has got three

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.139 
right so this thing has got three
independent<00:00:40.590> security<00:00:41.190> levels<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.969> can

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
independent security levels that you can

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.569 
independent security levels that you can
individually<00:00:42.559> activate<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:44.309> gonna<00:00:44.430> go

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
individually activate so I'm gonna go

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.799 
individually activate so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.789> give<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> little<00:00:45.210> demo<00:00:45.660> here

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
ahead and give you a little demo here

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.830 
ahead and give you a little demo here
and<00:00:46.350> first<00:00:46.980> we're<00:00:47.129> gonna<00:00:47.219> call<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.730> some<00:00:48.059> test

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
and first we're gonna call in some test

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.840 
and first we're gonna call in some test
subjects<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.800> guess<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.070> could<00:00:50.219> call<00:00:50.430> them<00:00:50.670> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
subjects I guess you could call them and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.970 
subjects I guess you could call them and
I'm<00:00:51.600> gonna<00:00:51.690> go<00:00:51.870> ahead<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.079> activate<00:00:52.530> yes

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
I'm gonna go ahead and activate yes

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.979 
I'm gonna go ahead and activate yes
security<00:00:53.430> level<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.420> give<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> taste

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
security level one just give you a taste

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:03.850 
security level one just give you a taste
of<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.559> thing<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:58.760> we<00:00:59.760> go

happen so let's just cut and crank this
thing<00:01:16.110> straight<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.979> security<00:01:17.490> level<00:01:18.180> -

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
thing straight up to a security level -

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.429 
thing straight up to a security level -
let's<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.439> what<00:01:19.619> she's<00:01:19.799> got<00:01:22.189> huh<00:01:23.250> no<00:01:24.090> no<00:01:25.080> no

to<00:01:37.119> security<00:01:37.840> level<00:01:38.229> 3<00:01:38.530> this<00:01:39.039> should<00:01:39.310> lead<00:01:39.520> to

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
to security level 3 this should lead to

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.130 
to security level 3 this should lead to
complete<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.630> utter<00:01:41.280> eradication<00:01:42.280> of

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
bring in some test subjects and let's

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.340 
bring in some test subjects and let's
light<00:01:48.100> up<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.429> world<00:01:48.960> yeah<00:01:50.429> huh<00:01:51.429> what<00:01:52.350> I'm

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
light up the world yeah huh what I'm

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.450 
light up the world yeah huh what I'm
starting<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.770> think<00:01:53.860> this<00:01:54.069> was<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.250> bad

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
starting to think this was a bad

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:22.660 
starting to think this was a bad
purchase

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.160 

all<00:02:23.670> right<00:02:24.090> right<00:02:24.299> so<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.569> may<00:02:24.719> have<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> few

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
all right right so it may have a few

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.250 
all right right so it may have a few
failed<00:02:25.439> points<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.129> it<00:02:26.249> may<00:02:26.519> have<00:02:26.849> actually

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
failed points and it may have actually

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.539 
failed points and it may have actually
disintegrated<00:02:28.260> me<00:02:28.409> in<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> process<00:02:29.069> but<00:02:29.519> I

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
disintegrated me in the process but I

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.589 
disintegrated me in the process but I
think<00:02:29.790> we're<00:02:29.909> onto<00:02:30.060> something<00:02:30.150> here<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.540> think

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
think we're onto something here I think

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.179 
think we're onto something here I think
we<00:02:30.780> got<00:02:30.930> potential<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.469> just<00:02:31.650> need<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:31.889> tweak<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
we got potential I just need to tweak a

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.119 
we got potential I just need to tweak a
few<00:02:32.219> settings<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.909> we'll<00:02:32.999> be<00:02:33.120> good<00:02:34.010> all<00:02:35.010> right

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
few settings and we'll be good all right

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.140
