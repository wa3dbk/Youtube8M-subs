should<00:01:49.950> sound<00:01:50.930> clearer<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:53.579> let<00:01:53.729> me<00:01:53.759> know

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
should sound clearer but do let me know

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.940 
should sound clearer but do let me know
in<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.000> comment<00:01:54.329> section<00:01:54.689> how<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.590> sounds<00:01:55.920> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
in the comment section how it sounds to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.910 
in the comment section how it sounds to
yourself<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.579> will<00:01:56.930> watch<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.259> hear<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.740> back

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
yourself I will watch and hear it back

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.840 
yourself I will watch and hear it back
on<00:01:59.159> the<00:02:00.079> computer<00:02:01.219> see<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.369> sounds<00:02:02.700> any

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
on the computer see if it sounds any

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.490 
on the computer see if it sounds any
better

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
better

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.470

I'll<00:02:04.770> turn<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.190> microphone<00:02:05.370> completely<00:02:06.270> away

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
I'll turn the microphone completely away

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.570 
I'll turn the microphone completely away
from<00:02:06.510> ourself<00:02:07.080> so<00:02:07.830> it's<00:02:07.980> pointing<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.490> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
from ourself so it's pointing in the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.630 
from ourself so it's pointing in the
same<00:02:08.610> direction<00:02:08.820> as<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> camera<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.979> again<00:02:11.280> you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
same direction as a camera and again you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.600 
same direction as a camera and again you
may<00:02:11.820> notice<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.360> slight<00:02:12.690> difference<00:02:13.520> in<00:02:14.520> the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
may notice a slight difference in the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.050 
may notice a slight difference in the
sound<00:02:14.790> being<00:02:15.030> recorded<00:02:16.400> I'll<00:02:17.400> just<00:02:17.730> turn<00:02:17.910> it

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
sound being recorded I'll just turn it

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.170 
sound being recorded I'll just turn it
in<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.180> back<00:02:18.360> towards<00:02:19.290> myself<00:02:19.440> again<00:02:20.180> indoors

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.980 
behind my monitor here I've also got the
window<00:02:41.490> open<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.060> may<00:02:42.300> still<00:02:42.630> be<00:02:42.750> able<00:02:42.840> to

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
window open so you may still be able to

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.280 
window open so you may still be able to
hear<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:44.130> rain<00:02:44.600> from<00:02:45.600> British<00:02:45.990> summer<00:02:46.200> time

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
hear the rain from British summer time

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.910 
hear the rain from British summer time
outside<00:02:46.970> I've<00:02:47.970> also<00:02:48.180> got<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.750> speaker's<00:02:49.500> si

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920

speakers<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.580> fans<00:02:50.850> on<00:02:51.090> my<00:02:51.210> computer<00:02:51.660> tend<00:02:51.870> to

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
speakers the fans on my computer tend to

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.050 
speakers the fans on my computer tend to
maximum<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:53.100> there's<00:02:53.310> plenty<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.610> noises

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
maximum so there's plenty of noises

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.720 
maximum so there's plenty of noises
going<00:02:54.210> on<00:02:54.390> in<00:02:54.570> doors<00:02:54.810> here<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.320> we'll<00:02:55.800> see<00:02:56.010> how

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
going on in doors here and we'll see how

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.320 
going on in doors here and we'll see how
much<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.090> microphone<00:02:57.600> effects<00:02:59.330> right

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
much the microphone effects right

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.320 
much the microphone effects right
plugging<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.080> microphone<00:03:01.730> into<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.820> z2

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
plugging in the microphone into the z2

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.930 
plugging in the microphone into the z2
and<00:03:04.610> positioning<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.790> towards<00:03:06.600> myself<00:03:07.940> it

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
and positioning it towards myself it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.229 
and positioning it towards myself it
should<00:03:09.410> reduce<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:11.340> noise<00:03:11.580> levels<00:03:11.970> from<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
should reduce the noise levels from the

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.270 
should reduce the noise levels from the
radio<00:03:12.600> certainly<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.890> should<00:03:14.100> be

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
radio certainly and that should be

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.870 
radio certainly and that should be
noticeable<00:03:16.010> but<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.130> should<00:03:17.340> still<00:03:17.640> be<00:03:17.670> able

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
noticeable but you should still be able

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.479 
noticeable but you should still be able
to<00:03:18.000> hear<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.300> nonetheless<00:03:18.480> or<00:03:18.959> be<00:03:19.489> slightly

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
to hear it nonetheless or be slightly

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.080 
to hear it nonetheless or be slightly
lower<00:03:21.830> and<00:03:22.830> what<00:03:23.010> we'll<00:03:23.160> do<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.430> just<00:03:23.459> position

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
lower and what we'll do is just position

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.320 
lower and what we'll do is just position
the<00:03:24.600> microphone<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.580> same<00:03:26.760> direction<00:03:26.970> as

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
the microphone in the same direction as

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.630 
the microphone in the same direction as
the<00:03:27.480> camera<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.020> away<00:03:28.350> from<00:03:28.380> myself<00:03:28.709> and

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
the camera so away from myself and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.860 
the camera so away from myself and
towards<00:03:30.420> my<00:03:30.900> monitor<00:03:32.120> making<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.209> radio<00:03:33.420> a

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
towards my monitor making the radio a

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.870 
towards my monitor making the radio a
little<00:03:34.320> bit<00:03:34.560> more<00:03:34.800> louder

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.520 

just<00:03:40.880> moving<00:03:41.240> the<00:03:41.330> microphone<00:03:41.450> background<00:03:42.380> to

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
just moving the microphone background to

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.700 
just moving the microphone background to
myself<00:03:42.740> and<00:03:43.660> again<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.690> should<00:03:45.020> be<00:03:45.110> appearing<00:03:45.380> a

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
myself and again I should be appearing a

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.980 
myself and again I should be appearing a
little<00:03:46.070> bit<00:03:46.160> more<00:03:46.310> clearer<00:03:46.640> with<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.600> radio

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
little bit more clearer with the radio

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.500 
little bit more clearer with the radio
being<00:03:48.470> slightly<00:03:48.830> canceled<00:03:49.520> out<00:03:49.700> I'm<00:03:49.940> not

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
being slightly canceled out I'm not

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.700 
being slightly canceled out I'm not
quite<00:03:50.750> sure<00:03:50.780> if<00:03:50.990> it's<00:03:51.200> going<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.410> completely

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
quite sure if it's going to completely

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.400 
quite sure if it's going to completely
cancel<00:03:52.130> it<00:03:52.490> out<00:03:52.610> I<00:03:52.880> highly<00:03:53.600> doubt<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.840> would<00:03:54.200> to

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
cancel it out I highly doubt it would to

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.910 
cancel it out I highly doubt it would to
be<00:03:54.560> fair<00:03:54.830> but<00:03:55.150> again<00:03:56.150> I've<00:03:56.330> yet<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.810> watch<00:03:57.590> or

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
be fair but again I've yet to watch or

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.850 
be fair but again I've yet to watch or
hear<00:03:58.160> this<00:03:58.310> back<00:03:58.580> on<00:03:59.050> my<00:04:00.050> computer<00:04:00.530> so<00:04:00.710> we'll

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
hear this back on my computer so we'll

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.270 
hear this back on my computer so we'll
see<00:04:01.040> how<00:04:01.220> much<00:04:01.400> or<00:04:02.300> how<00:04:02.360> little<00:04:02.900> this<00:04:03.890> external

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
see how much or how little this external

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.730 
see how much or how little this external
microphone<00:04:04.940> effects<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:06.080> sound<00:04:06.380> levels

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
microphone effects the sound levels

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.280 
microphone effects the sound levels
being<00:04:06.920> recorded<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.670> certainly<00:04:08.090> should<00:04:08.420> be

you look at the STM 10 here it's got
five<00:05:14.090> poles<00:05:14.630> for<00:05:15.410> bands<00:05:16.010> that<00:05:16.220> you<00:05:16.340> can<00:05:16.490> see

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
five poles for bands that you can see

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.180 
five poles for bands that you can see
which<00:05:17.180> are<00:05:17.300> conductors<00:05:17.870> and<00:05:18.080> one<00:05:18.560> being<00:05:18.950> the

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
which are conductors and one being the

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.730 
which are conductors and one being the
earth<00:05:19.460> so<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.270> other<00:05:20.600> two<00:05:20.840> that<00:05:21.050> you<00:05:21.140> see<00:05:21.470> here

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
earth so the other two that you see here

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.150 
earth so the other two that you see here
which<00:05:22.010> are<00:05:22.220> for<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:23.000> Galaxy<00:05:23.570> s5<00:05:24.140> and<00:05:24.410> the

iPhone<00:05:25.730> 5s<00:05:26.110> have<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.350> four<00:05:27.800> poles<00:05:28.250> which<00:05:28.850> means

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
iPhone 5s have a four poles which means

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.200 
iPhone 5s have a four poles which means
three<00:05:29.570> conductors<00:05:30.169> and<00:05:30.380> one<00:05:31.040> earth<00:05:31.340> so<00:05:31.970> this

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
three conductors and one earth so this

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.510 
three conductors and one earth so this
device<00:05:32.540> I<00:05:32.840> have<00:05:33.110> actually<00:05:33.530> tested<00:05:33.740> with<00:05:34.400> the
