from in the right position then I'm in
the<00:04:25.760> right<00:04:25.880> position<00:04:26.360> yeah<00:04:26.540> so<00:04:27.320> I'm<00:04:27.440> gonna<00:04:27.530> do

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
the right position yeah so I'm gonna do

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.480 
the right position yeah so I'm gonna do
is<00:04:27.830> I'm<00:04:27.920> probably<00:04:28.040> gonna<00:04:28.310> kill<00:04:29.080> this<00:04:30.080> guy<00:04:30.680> got

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
is I'm probably gonna kill this guy got

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.000 
is I'm probably gonna kill this guy got
a<00:04:31.760> pole<00:04:32.630> actually<00:04:32.960> I'll<00:04:33.170> probably<00:04:33.260> kill<00:04:33.650> that

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
a pole actually I'll probably kill that

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.280 
a pole actually I'll probably kill that
guy<00:04:34.220> as<00:04:34.280> well<00:04:34.580> then<00:04:35.360> I'll<00:04:35.480> get<00:04:35.600> this<00:04:35.750> walking

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
guy as well then I'll get this walking

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
guy as well then I'll get this walking
one<00:04:36.440> right<00:04:36.710> here<00:04:37.990> so<00:04:38.990> this<00:04:39.440> is<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.890> best<00:04:40.130> way

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
one right here so this is the best way

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.190 
one right here so this is the best way
of<00:04:40.340> doing<00:04:40.580> out<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.030> walking<00:04:41.420> ones<00:04:41.570> go<00:04:41.750> slow

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
of doing out the walking ones go slow

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.990 
of doing out the walking ones go slow
and<00:04:42.410> if<00:04:42.470> you<00:04:42.590> make<00:04:42.740> mistake<00:04:43.160> can<00:04:43.460> easily<00:04:43.760> try

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
and if you make mistake can easily try

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.530 
and if you make mistake can easily try
again

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
again

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.760 
again
so<00:04:45.080> I<00:04:45.110> say<00:04:45.860> come<00:04:46.190> about<00:04:48.310> there<00:04:50.470> that's<00:04:51.470> heart

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
so I say come about there that's heart

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.830 
so I say come about there that's heart
again<00:04:52.070> to<00:04:52.250> this<00:04:52.400> position<00:04:52.880> it<00:04:53.000> really<00:04:53.150> is<00:04:53.450> it's

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
again to this position it really is it's

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.840 
again to this position it really is it's
not<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.080> easiest<00:04:54.350> of<00:04:54.500> glitches<00:04:54.980> either<00:04:55.220> if

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
not the easiest of glitches either if

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.790 
not the easiest of glitches either if
you<00:04:55.970> get<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.270> positioning<00:04:56.900> wrong<00:04:57.110> just<00:04:57.590> kill

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
you get the positioning wrong just kill

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.800 
you get the positioning wrong just kill
that<00:04:57.830> guy<00:04:58.160> like<00:04:58.970> and<00:04:59.090> this<00:04:59.180> is<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.390> last<00:04:59.570> one

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
that guy like and this is the last one

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.780 
that guy like and this is the last one
now<00:05:00.080> it's<00:05:01.070> all<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.250> do<00:05:01.400> is<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.640> come<00:05:01.850> here<00:05:02.290> and

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
now it's all you do is you come here and

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.520 
now it's all you do is you come here and
I<00:05:04.790> think<00:05:05.300> this<00:05:05.510> is<00:05:05.630> yes<00:05:05.870> it's<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.200> opposite

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
I think this is yes it's the opposite

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.080 
I think this is yes it's the opposite
huge<00:05:06.770> come<00:05:06.980> about<00:05:07.130> here<00:05:07.400> and<00:05:07.520> he's<00:05:07.610> been<00:05:07.760> flat

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
huge come about here and he's been flat

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.850 
huge come about here and he's been flat
on<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.330> edge<00:05:08.480> and<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:09.170> zombies<00:05:09.500> just<00:05:09.590> walk

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
on the edge and the zombies just walk

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.220 
on the edge and the zombies just walk
this<00:05:10.130> barrier<00:05:10.580> and<00:05:10.760> this<00:05:10.880> will<00:05:11.150> work<00:05:11.300> for<00:05:11.750> many

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
this barrier and this will work for many

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.130 
this barrier and this will work for many
rounds<00:05:12.860> as<00:05:12.980> a<00:05:13.520> really<00:05:13.940> useful<00:05:14.060> glitch<00:05:14.540> so<00:05:15.110> I

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
rounds as a really useful glitch so I

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.740 
rounds as a really useful glitch so I
