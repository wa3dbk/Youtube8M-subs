00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
that defeat you know we we really manage

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.400 
that defeat you know we we really manage
the<00:02:14.489> whole<00:02:14.700> process<00:02:14.940> really<00:02:15.540> really<00:02:15.930> well<00:02:16.110> I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
the whole process really really well I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.280 
the whole process really really well I
think<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.400> know<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:17.700> team<00:02:17.910> grew<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.080> rose

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
think you know the team grew and it rose

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.250 
think you know the team grew and it rose
to<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.560> occasion<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.480> over<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.540> snow<00:02:21.900> game

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
to the occasion and over the snow game

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.229 
to the occasion and over the snow game
in<00:02:22.560> denver<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:24.510> energy<00:02:24.959> was<00:02:24.989> really<00:02:25.650> kind<00:02:25.890> of

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
in denver the energy was really kind of

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.080 
in denver the energy was really kind of
getting<00:02:27.239> all<00:02:27.360> together<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:28.049> and<00:02:28.549> now<00:02:29.549> being

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
getting all together and and now being

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.750

in first place having our another home

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.569 
in first place having our another home
game<00:02:33.380> we're<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.560> very<00:02:34.590> very<00:02:35.010> good<00:02:35.190> position

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
good position in the table but uh we've

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.880

and<00:02:52.980> uh<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.700> know<00:02:53.819> make<00:02:54.150> sure<00:02:54.180> they<00:02:54.390> get<00:02:54.569> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
and uh you know make sure they get the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.180 
and uh you know make sure they get the
right<00:02:54.750> results<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.200> these<00:02:55.290> next<00:02:55.470> few<00:02:55.620> games<00:02:55.680> to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
right results in these next few games to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.309 
right results in these next few games to
make<00:02:56.340> sure<00:02:56.520> you<00:02:57.450> qualify<00:02:57.660> for<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.110> World<00:02:58.260> Cup

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
make sure you qualify for the World Cup

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.460 
make sure you qualify for the World Cup
you<00:02:59.130> know<00:02:59.250> when<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.459> get<00:02:59.580> points<00:03:00.290> takes<00:03:01.290> away

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
you know when you get points takes away

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.020 
you know when you get points takes away
some<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.860> pressure<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.670> you're<00:03:02.790> able<00:03:02.940> to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
some of that pressure and you're able to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.270 
some of that pressure and you're able to
play<00:03:03.120> with<00:03:03.270> more<00:03:03.450> freedom<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.980> think<00:03:05.160> that

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
play with more freedom and I think that

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.670 
play with more freedom and I think that
helps<00:03:05.490> your<00:03:05.610> team<00:03:05.760> play<00:03:05.850> better<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.650> we're<00:03:07.650> on

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
helps your team play better and we're on

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.900 
helps your team play better and we're on
a<00:03:07.740> good<00:03:07.950> running<00:03:08.130> form<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:08.580> about<00:03:08.730> keeping

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
a good running form it's about keeping

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.630 
a good running form it's about keeping
that<00:03:09.180> going<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.810> making<00:03:10.170> sure<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.459> put

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
that going and making sure that you put

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.120 
that going and making sure that you put
the<00:03:11.790> work<00:03:12.300> in<00:03:12.450> every<00:03:12.720> game<00:03:12.900> that's<00:03:13.470> necessary

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
the work in every game that's necessary

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.860 
the work in every game that's necessary
to<00:03:14.250> get<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.580> good<00:03:15.030> result<00:03:15.390> make<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:15.690> difficult

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
to get the good result make it difficult

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.020 
to get the good result make it difficult
for<00:03:16.200> your<00:03:16.380> opponents<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.040> that's<00:03:17.730> what<00:03:17.880> we're

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
for your opponents and that's what we're

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.000 
for your opponents and that's what we're
doing<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.840> know<00:03:18.959> we're<00:03:19.170> getting<00:03:19.620> goals

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
doing and you know we're getting goals

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.979 
doing and you know we're getting goals
and<00:03:20.370> last<00:03:21.060> game<00:03:21.300> was<00:03:21.450> good<00:03:21.570> for<00:03:21.660> us<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.870> get<00:03:21.959> a

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
and last game was good for us to get a

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.990 
and last game was good for us to get a
clean<00:03:22.260> sheet<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.800> hopefully<00:03:23.370> we<00:03:23.880> can

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
clean sheet and hopefully we can

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.610 
clean sheet and hopefully we can
continue<00:03:24.150> in<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.600> fashion<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:25.170> think<00:03:25.500> this

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
continue in this fashion I think this

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.280 
continue in this fashion I think this
group<00:03:26.190> has<00:03:26.430> grown<00:03:26.459> tremendously<00:03:27.290> obviously

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
group has grown tremendously obviously

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.140 
group has grown tremendously obviously
since<00:03:28.560> our<00:03:28.890> lost<00:03:29.130> against<00:03:29.489> honduras<00:03:30.000> in

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
since our lost against honduras in

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.640 
since our lost against honduras in
Honduras<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:31.140> just<00:03:31.860> think<00:03:32.070> since<00:03:32.459> then<00:03:33.650> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
Honduras I just think since then the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.990 
Honduras I just think since then the
chemistry<00:03:35.130> has<00:03:35.280> been<00:03:35.489> awesome<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.860> obviously

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
chemistry has been awesome and obviously

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.460 
chemistry has been awesome and obviously
I<00:03:39.000> think<00:03:39.300> we<00:03:39.360> have<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.510> lot<00:03:39.660> of<00:03:39.690> fighting<00:03:39.989> spirit

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
I think we have a lot of fighting spirit

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.000 
I think we have a lot of fighting spirit
and<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:42.180> just<00:03:43.110> get<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.320> sense<00:03:43.350> that<00:03:43.590> everyone's

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
and I just get the sense that everyone's

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.250 
and I just get the sense that everyone's
wanted<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.000> fight<00:03:45.209> for<00:03:45.420> each<00:03:45.510> other<00:03:45.690> playing

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
wanted to fight for each other playing

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.290 
wanted to fight for each other playing
as<00:03:46.470> hard<00:03:46.500> as<00:03:46.769> they<00:03:46.860> can<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.640> putting<00:03:48.180> good

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
as hard as they can and putting good

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.900 
as hard as they can and putting good
