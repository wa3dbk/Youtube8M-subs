00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:09.230
 ips panel with resolution hd 65 inches 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.030
 diagonal and a unique design that 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.250
 bet to get a sound of 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.369
 quality so the new one is presented 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.740
 axis screen in xataka we have had 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.349
 the opportunity to analyze one of the 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.749
 latest proposals of the axis a television 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.630
 that in its design section stands out with 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.819
 own merits is possibly one of 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.769
 the best built with materials 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:33.590
 which they are mostly metal that 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.440
 they provide rigidity and clear resistance that 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.679
 also a weight of nothing less than 40 and 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.050
 89 kilograms the design lines are 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:44.179
 very elegant and next to the stand stands out 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.969
 the solution of the shaft to take out the 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.469
 speakers off the screen 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.140
 place them well on the sides and 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.190
 directly oriented to the user 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.640
 allow to enhance the experience 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.100
 auditory which is located above 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.530
 most rivals not only for 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.929
 have more speakers but also for their 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.210
 better vibration control one of 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.770
 the few TVs that convinces in 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.409
 virtually all 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.119
 from possible use but ending with 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.310
 the design on the back 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.289
 we found the connections that in 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.899
 some cases make use of adapters 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:20.990
 to avoid increasing the thickness of the 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.819
 screen and a single physical pushbutton that 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.130
 is located in the lower front 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:27.170
 of the television from her we will be able to 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.170
 control the device in cases of 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.840
 need talking about the controls the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.240
 axis includes a traditional knob plus the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.880
 new and improved older remote with him and 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.000
 the new platform smrtv control this 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.009
 TV is a whole web delight is 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.470
 the system that governs this TV 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.259
 of the shaft a platform based on 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.880
 very customizable simple e cards 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.709
 intuitive that after a few videos 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.049
 demonstrations allow the user 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.869
 enjoy everything we can ask 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.280
 a smrtv we will be able to load and 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.500
 play the content from 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.599
 USB storage devices or 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.280
 connected to the local network access 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.829
 applications streaming videos networking 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.289
 social and other options that the 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.299
 lg application store offers but 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.250
 what has been most interesting to us 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.460
 on this smart tv 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.230
 is market and we will choose an assistant who 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.690
 allows us to access content 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.090
 stored on other devices like 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.710
 computers tablets and smartphones and a 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.530
 application that through devices 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.480
 ios or android allows us to reproduce the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.209
 contents that we have in them of 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.760
 simple and direct way all together 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.570
 to a fluidity and speed of use that 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.360
 they make web 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.390
 be one of the main attractions of 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.400
 this new smart tv range from lg but 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.140
 let's go to the image quality as 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.350
 we have always prepared different 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.200
 contained in different resolutions 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.709
 from a hd to 1080p 720 p and 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.850
 standard resolution under this scenario 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.700
 we have found that more and more 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.739
 resolution is the quality is fabulous the 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.709
 detail level color rendering 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.209
 the viewing angles and the contrast 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.870
 demonstrate the maturity of ips panels 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.390
 that the axis uses 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.299
 although as we had with resolutions 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.280
 720 p or lower the process of 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.290
 scaling which has to generate 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.200
 additional information to cover such 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.900
 number of pixels is a little bit 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.400
 disastrous the result tarnishes the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.709
 good sensations obtained with 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.940
 content with higher resolution but 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.400
 It is also true that it is already 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.500
 responsibility of each user 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.450
 Take advantage of an HDTV with the best 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.060
 possible content that can be 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.640
 have in general terms the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.129
 inconvenience this last one of the rsc to side 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.170
 of the image should not be a reason for not 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.790
 bet on a television that with some 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.730
 lines very elegant design and 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.220
 attractive a convincing sound a 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.129
 smrtv platform that we like in all 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.989
 its aspects and an image quality 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:59.109
 overwhelming make this model of lg 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:02.700
 be quickly on the top of the 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.700
 current hd TVs
