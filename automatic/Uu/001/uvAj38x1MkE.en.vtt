is<00:01:36.880> fit<00:01:37.119> 365<00:01:37.869> is<00:01:38.109> what<00:01:38.320> I<00:01:38.350> typically<00:01:38.740> use

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
is fit 365 is what I typically use

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.520 
is fit 365 is what I typically use
personally<00:01:39.460> this<00:01:39.549> is<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.759> phenomenal<00:01:40.539> graph

protein or a pea protein something like

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.780 
protein or a pea protein something like
that<00:02:10.420> there's<00:02:11.290> some<00:02:12.099> different<00:02:12.400> brands<00:02:12.610> that

harvest<00:02:14.860> camp<00:02:15.069> proteins<00:02:15.489> great<00:02:15.849> one<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.959> so

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
harvest camp proteins great one and so

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.780 
harvest camp proteins great one and so
we're<00:02:17.290> just<00:02:17.319> going<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.560> put<00:02:17.769> or<00:02:18.370> put<00:02:18.549> a<00:02:18.579> bunch

we're just going to put or put a bunch

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.720 
we're just going to put or put a bunch
of<00:02:18.880> protein<00:02:19.299> in<00:02:19.450> there<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.470> since<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.370> use<00:02:21.549> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
of protein in there so since I use the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.400 
of protein in there so since I use the
whole<00:02:21.880> can<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.120> coconut<00:02:22.480> milk<00:02:22.599> I'm<00:02:23.230> really

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
whole can of coconut milk I'm really

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.650 
whole can of coconut milk I'm really
making<00:02:23.650> about<00:02:24.099> three<00:02:24.730> servings<00:02:25.239> right<00:02:25.450> here

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
making about three servings right here

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.050 
making about three servings right here

know<00:02:30.670> good<00:02:30.879> bit<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.060> protein<00:02:31.269> powder<00:02:31.629> i<00:02:31.750> put<00:02:31.930> in

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
know good bit of protein powder i put in

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.650 
know good bit of protein powder i put in
almost<00:02:33.010> two<00:02:33.280> full<00:02:33.459> scoops<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.030> i'll<00:02:34.180> finish

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
almost two full scoops and i'll finish

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.080 
almost two full scoops and i'll finish
that<00:02:34.900> off<00:02:35.079> with<00:02:35.290> two<00:02:35.440> full<00:02:35.680> scoops<00:02:36.010> them<00:02:36.280> and

that off with two full scoops them and
really<00:02:37.540> when<00:02:38.139> it<00:02:38.230> comes<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.620> protein<00:02:39.010> when

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
really when it comes to the protein when

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.410 
really when it comes to the protein when
it<00:02:39.310> comes<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.609> a<00:02:39.670> lot<00:02:39.819> of<00:02:39.940> these<00:02:40.000> things<00:02:40.209> you

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
it comes to a lot of these things you

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.509 
it comes to a lot of these things you
want<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.600> do<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:41.049> taste<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.160> can<00:02:42.340> kind

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
want to do it to taste so you can kind

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.729 
want to do it to taste so you can kind
of<00:02:42.579> mess<00:02:43.000> around<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.389> little<00:02:43.510> bit<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.900> do<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.620> to

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
of mess around a little bit and do it to

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.099 
of mess around a little bit and do it to
taste<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.190> little<00:02:45.310> bit<00:02:45.780> another<00:02:46.780> thing<00:02:47.079> that

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
taste a little bit another thing that

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.020 
taste a little bit another thing that
we're<00:02:47.290> going<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.470> put<00:02:47.620> in<00:02:47.769> this<00:02:48.519> is<00:02:48.730> great<00:02:49.000> for

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
we're going to put in this is great for

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.479 
we're going to put in this is great for
brain<00:02:49.450> function<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:50.170> just<00:02:50.799> phenomenal

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
brain function and just phenomenal

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.309 
brain function and just phenomenal
protein<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.060> good<00:02:52.180> fats<00:02:52.389> we're<00:02:53.049> going<00:02:53.139> to<00:02:53.230> put

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
protein and good fats we're going to put

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.900 
protein and good fats we're going to put
an<00:02:53.440> egg<00:02:53.590> but<00:02:53.889> actually<00:02:54.250> i<00:02:54.280> won't<00:02:54.519> put<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.819> egg

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
an egg but actually i won't put the egg

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.490 
an egg but actually i won't put the egg
in<00:02:54.940> quite<00:02:55.540> yet<00:02:55.780> i'm<00:02:55.959> going<00:02:56.079> to<00:02:56.139> actually<00:02:56.230> put

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
in quite yet i'm going to actually put

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.760 
in quite yet i'm going to actually put
that<00:02:56.650> in

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
that in

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.420 
that in
right<00:02:58.580> here<00:02:58.880> we've<00:02:59.510> got<00:02:59.540> good<00:03:00.080> salts<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.250> can

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
right here we've got good salts so I can

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.090 
right here we've got good salts so I can
put<00:03:01.550> in<00:03:01.700> some<00:03:01.910> good<00:03:02.060> salts<00:03:02.540> let<00:03:03.500> me<00:03:03.590> just<00:03:03.770> pop

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
put in some good salts let me just pop

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:20.150 
put in some good salts let me just pop
the<00:03:04.340> top<00:03:04.520> on<00:03:04.760> this<00:03:05.320> all<00:03:06.320> right

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.820 

so<00:03:20.820> we<00:03:20.910> got<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.180> salt<00:03:21.420> in<00:03:21.660> there<00:03:21.840> we<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:22.650> want

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
so we got the salt in there we just want

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.260 
so we got the salt in there we just want
a<00:03:22.890> little<00:03:23.070> bit<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.520> that<00:03:23.610> just<00:03:23.820> adds<00:03:23.940> good

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
a little bit and that just adds good

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.600 
a little bit and that just adds good
minerals<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:25.380> really<00:03:25.650> actually<00:03:25.980> helps<00:03:26.490> us

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
minerals and really actually helps us

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.850 
minerals and really actually helps us
hydrate<00:03:27.060> more<00:03:27.240> effectively<00:03:27.690> all<00:03:28.410> right<00:03:28.590> so

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
hydrate more effectively all right so

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.150 
hydrate more effectively all right so
next<00:03:29.370> step<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.590> we<00:03:31.590> are<00:03:31.710> going<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.920> go<00:03:32.040> ahead

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
next step is we are going to go ahead
