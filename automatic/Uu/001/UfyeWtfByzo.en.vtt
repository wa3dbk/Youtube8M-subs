myself a new toy
it's<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.620> vigil<00:00:05.520> technology<00:00:06.330> what<00:00:06.600> you'd<00:00:06.720> call

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
it's a vigil technology what you'd call

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.240 
it's a vigil technology what you'd call
a<00:00:07.639> inspection<00:00:08.639> camera<00:00:08.849> or<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.240> borescope<00:00:10.250> it's

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
a inspection camera or a borescope it's

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.010 
a inspection camera or a borescope it's
color<00:00:11.809> it<00:00:12.809> has<00:00:13.049> its<00:00:13.259> own<00:00:14.660> there<00:00:15.660> we<00:00:15.750> go<00:00:15.870> we're

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
color it has its own there we go we're

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.550 
color it has its own there we go we're
looking<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.440> roof<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:17.130> has<00:00:17.400> its<00:00:17.580> own

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
looking in the roof it has its own

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.410 
looking in the roof it has its own
built-in<00:00:19.560> Lal<00:00:20.960> LEDs<00:00:21.960> for<00:00:22.289> illumination<00:00:22.800> and

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
built-in Lal LEDs for illumination and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.370 
built-in Lal LEDs for illumination and
I'm<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.960> figure<00:00:25.140> out

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
I'm going to have to figure out

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.140 
I'm going to have to figure out
something<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:26.820> can<00:00:27.000> inspect<00:00:27.359> with<00:00:27.630> it

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
something that we can inspect with it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.240 
something that we can inspect with it
really<00:00:30.150> right<00:00:30.539> now<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.380> useful

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
really right now it's just a useful

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.930 
really right now it's just a useful
camera<00:00:34.040> but<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.100> don't<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.489> figure<00:00:35.760> out<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
camera but I don't have to figure out a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.160 
camera but I don't have to figure out a
way<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.390> them<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> look<00:00:36.989> inside

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
way to see them I can have a look inside

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.020 
way to see them I can have a look inside
something<00:00:37.860> with<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.100> like<00:00:38.250> maybe<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.850> look

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
something with it like maybe we can look

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.270 
something with it like maybe we can look
inside<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.780> intake<00:00:40.320> manifold<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.010> running

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
inside the intake manifold of a running

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.600 
inside the intake manifold of a running
diesel<00:00:41.700> engine<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.469> see<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> valves

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
diesel engine and see what the valves

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.330 
diesel engine and see what the valves
look<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.239> even<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:46.129> let's<00:00:47.129> start

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
look like are we even but let's start

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.830 
look like are we even but let's start
with<00:00:47.460> always<00:00:47.910> love<00:00:48.120> look<00:00:48.300> at<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> inside

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
with always love look at the inside

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.910 
with always love look at the inside
copper<00:00:49.260> tube<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:51.890> heat<00:00:52.890> exchange<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.730> it

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
copper tube if this heat exchange in it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.650 
copper tube if this heat exchange in it
I'm<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.070> literally<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.910> jam<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.300> camera

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
I'm just literally just jam that camera

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.660 
I'm just literally just jam that camera
in<00:00:57.809> there<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:59.239> what<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.510> see<00:01:01.670> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
in there like that what do we see the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.289 
in there like that what do we see the
inside<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> pipe<00:01:03.780> work<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:05.090> don't<00:01:06.090> really

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
inside of the pipe work I don't really

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.140 
inside of the pipe work I don't really
want<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.750> stuck<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.170> there

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
want to get that stuck in there

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.660 
want to get that stuck in there
but<00:01:09.150> anyway<00:01:11.780> it's<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.670> LEDs

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
but anyway it's all there is to it LEDs

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.789 
but anyway it's all there is to it LEDs
a<00:01:15.000> little<00:01:15.509> triangle<00:01:15.990> color<00:01:16.320> camera<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:19.110> then

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.370

with<00:01:56.579> I've<00:01:56.729> been<00:01:56.850> playing<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> Arduino

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
with I've been playing with the Arduino

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.200 
with I've been playing with the Arduino
I'm<00:01:58.560> gonna<00:01:58.829> tear<00:01:59.100> down<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.520> truck

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
I'm gonna tear down this truck

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.920 
I'm gonna tear down this truck
alternator<00:02:00.659> later<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.740> see<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.250> baby

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
alternator later you see it's not a baby

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.620 
alternator later you see it's not a baby

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
manifold while an engine is running and

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.760
