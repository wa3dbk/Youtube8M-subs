00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
between april and june and i thought i'd

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.930 
between april and june and i thought i'd
bring<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.260> guys<00:00:10.530> up<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.860> hands-on<00:00:11.340> video<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.790> it

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
bring you guys up a hands-on video of it

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.510 
bring you guys up a hands-on video of it
so<00:00:12.509> without<00:00:12.719> further<00:00:12.780> ado<00:00:13.349> let's<00:00:14.040> get<00:00:14.250> started

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.550 

so<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.640> honor<00:00:20.850> 4x<00:00:21.180> comes<00:00:21.539> with<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> 5.5<00:00:22.380> inch

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
so the honor 4x comes with a 5.5 inch

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.790 
so the honor 4x comes with a 5.5 inch
display<00:00:22.980> at<00:00:23.490> 720p<00:00:24.180> resolution<00:00:24.650> giving<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.740> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
display at 720p resolution giving it a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.429 
display at 720p resolution giving it a
pixel<00:00:26.160> per<00:00:26.310> inch<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.609> 267<00:00:27.269> now<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.199> not

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
pixel per inch of 267 now this is not

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.740 
pixel per inch of 267 now this is not
the<00:00:28.560> sharpest<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> market<00:00:29.609> clearly<00:00:30.150> but

the sharpest on the market clearly but

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.170 
the sharpest on the market clearly but
when<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.260> consider<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.710> price<00:00:31.920> range<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.369> 150

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
when you consider the price range of 150

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.750 
when you consider the price range of 150
pounds<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:34.079> actually<00:00:34.230> great<00:00:34.559> value<00:00:34.980> there's

pounds it's actually great value there's

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.160 
pounds it's actually great value there's
also<00:00:35.969> another<00:00:36.210> feature<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.780> makes<00:00:36.989> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
also another feature that makes it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.810 
also another feature that makes it
exceptional<00:00:37.710> value<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.219> that's<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
exceptional value and that's the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.209 
exceptional value and that's the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
cold aluminium devices out there as well

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.350 
cold aluminium devices out there as well
on<00:01:25.619> storage<00:01:26.130> you've<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.460> eight<00:01:26.640> gig<00:01:26.820> internal

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
on storage you've got eight gig internal

on storage you've got eight gig internal
into<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> device<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:28.920> there's<00:01:29.070> also<00:01:29.220> my

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
into the device but there's also my

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.310 
into the device but there's also my
Kristi<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.570> can't<00:01:30.840> expand<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
Kristi so you can't expand that a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.050 
Kristi so you can't expand that a
further<00:01:31.560> thirty<00:01:31.890> two<00:01:32.130> gigabytes<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.790> well<00:01:32.970> if

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
further thirty two gigabytes as well if

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.179 
further thirty two gigabytes as well if
you<00:01:33.180> need<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.570> there's<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.590> three<00:01:34.799> thousand

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you need to there's a three thousand

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.980 
you need to there's a three thousand
million<00:01:35.460> power<00:01:35.640> battery<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.299> phone

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
million power battery and the phone

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.170 
million power battery and the phone
actually<00:01:37.229> has<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> dual<00:01:37.950> sim<00:01:38.189> capability<00:01:39.030> as

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
actually has a dual sim capability as

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
actually has a dual sim capability as
well<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.960> if<00:01:40.200> you're<00:01:40.350> someone<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.740> likes<00:01:41.070> to

but<00:03:59.430> i'm<00:03:59.580> not<00:03:59.760> sure<00:03:59.910> if<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.120> can<00:04:00.269> customize<00:04:00.750> it

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900

but i'm not sure if you can customize it
on<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.080> honor<00:04:01.230> 4x<00:04:01.530> but<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.340> would<00:04:02.459> be<00:04:02.519> cool<00:04:02.850> for

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
on the honor 4x but it would be cool for

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.430 
on the honor 4x but it would be cool for
example<00:04:03.360> if<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.540> could<00:04:03.690> do<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.840> double<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.230> to

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
example if you could do a double you to

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.400 
example if you could do a double you to
turn<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.890> or<00:04:05.099> off<00:04:05.130> Wi-Fi<00:04:05.840> but<00:04:06.840> maybe<00:04:07.170> that's

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
turn on or off Wi-Fi but maybe that's

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.930 
turn on or off Wi-Fi but maybe that's
something<00:04:07.590> they'll<00:04:07.860> add<00:04:08.010> later<00:04:08.280> on<00:04:08.550> I<00:04:08.700> hope

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
something they'll add later on I hope
