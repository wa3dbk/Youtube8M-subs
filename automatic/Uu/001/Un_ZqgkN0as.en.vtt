00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:10.349
 Hello everyone got in the mail today here 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.340
 Such are the hours ordered about one and a half 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.759
 months ago 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.240
 at the time of order they were worth $ 14 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.699
 88 cents now how we see become 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.430
 He ordered a little cheaper from 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.849
 this seller 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.250
 the seller packed well so here we go 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.009
 watch yourself watch the seller has packed 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.090
 study well came intact and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.270
 safekeeping so focusing where is our 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.950
 focusing here it means the first thing 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.300
 striking here such here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:50.940
 interesting glass at the clock convex 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.680
 when you tilt it turns out such a lens 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.960
 I honestly liked the watch 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.410
 despite the fact that they do not have a pendulum 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.149
 for automatic winding 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.500
 accordingly, the clock will have to start 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.180
 every day but thanks to that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.590
 interesting transparency as you see yes 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.590
 that is, the mechanism is very visible 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:24.200
 processing of materials also liked 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.200
 I will try to show closer now 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.710
 so here it all looks but of 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.659
 functions are natural here they are all just 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.659
 can translate time 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.500
 and accordingly start on me 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:53.030
 Now itâ€™s not full 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:57.290
 spinning so also I noticed so now 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.680
 probably will not see well, that's what these 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.610
 that white on the arrows is drawn in 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.920
 darkness glows green it also pleases 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.319
 because I was in the previous hours 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.319
 in which one of the arrows and not glow 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.290
 i.e. second second hour second 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:21.230
 Minute in my glow and the watch is not 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:23.620
 shone so what else can you say so 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:30.250
 Well, here I showed you everything 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:35.750
 I think it is clear that what strap 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:40.430
 standard chinese strap nothing 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:47.290
 I do not know such an unusual how much 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:50.420
 time he will be able to walk with this watch 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.630
 What about the light? I'll try to compare these. 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.290
 watch with gold is not interesting 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:02.930
 very much like color or not like 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:07.459
 and write it off later in the comments so that 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.260
 even more so that everything seems to be that they are still 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.380
 can say 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.470
 normal hours are worth how much 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:20.980
 450 somewhere rubles probably for such 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:24.579
 Prices can be said excellent watches 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.250
 well, that 's all happy 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:32.470
 sign up for a video coming soon 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.470
 new packages all bye
