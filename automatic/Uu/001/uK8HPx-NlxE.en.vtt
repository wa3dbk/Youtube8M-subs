years old this is how you make you know
frame<00:00:13.740> some<00:00:14.070> moldings<00:00:14.490> do<00:00:15.529> you<00:00:16.529> know<00:00:16.650> small

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
frame some moldings do you know small

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.380 
frame some moldings do you know small
projects<00:00:17.400> around<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.640> house<00:00:17.820> because<00:00:18.119> you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
can accurately cut a 45 degree angle

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.240 
can accurately cut a 45 degree angle
without<00:00:21.359> any<00:00:21.720> kind<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.020> fancy<00:00:22.230> equipment<00:00:22.439> all

right so the way you do that the two 45s

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.220 
right so the way you do that the two 45s
which<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.090> you're<00:00:27.210> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> cut<00:00:27.630> but

end another way once you get one cut

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.530 
end another way once you get one cut
like<00:02:18.410> say<00:02:18.620> this<00:02:18.769> one's<00:02:18.980> already<00:02:19.130> been<00:02:19.370> cut<00:02:19.640> you

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
like say this one's already been cut you

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.470 
like say this one's already been cut you
can<00:02:20.750> use<00:02:20.989> this<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.349> transfer<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.010> line<00:02:22.480> so

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
can use this to transfer that line so

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.900 
can use this to transfer that line so
I'm<00:02:23.540> gonna<00:02:23.800> put<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.920> flush<00:02:25.220> make<00:02:25.640> sure<00:02:25.790> that

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
I'm gonna put it flush make sure that

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.780 
I'm gonna put it flush make sure that
I'm<00:02:26.030> flush<00:02:26.269> against<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.489> backside<00:02:28.489> on<00:02:28.730> the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
I'm flush against the backside on the

I'm flush against the backside on the
front<00:02:29.060> side<00:02:29.300> right<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.110> then<00:02:30.290> I'm<00:02:30.410> gonna<00:02:30.620> go

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
front side right and then I'm gonna go

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.390 
front side right and then I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.330> make<00:02:32.330> my<00:02:32.360> line<00:02:32.890> that's<00:02:33.890> my<00:02:34.040> exact

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
ahead and make my line that's my exact

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.920 
ahead and make my line that's my exact
45<00:02:35.620> all<00:02:36.620> right<00:02:36.790> with<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.000> 45

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
45 all right with that 45

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.570 
45 all right with that 45
I<00:02:39.500> go<00:02:39.680> ahead<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:39.950> cut<00:02:40.100> this<00:02:40.220> without<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
I go ahead and cut this without the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.789 
I go ahead and cut this without the
miter<00:02:40.790> box<00:02:41.030> cuz<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.660> be<00:02:41.750> perfect<00:02:42.200> straight<00:02:42.650> now

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
miter box cuz it be perfect straight now

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.110 
miter box cuz it be perfect straight now
but<00:02:43.069> a<00:02:43.100> miter<00:02:43.310> box<00:02:43.489> will<00:02:43.670> keep<00:02:43.819> it<00:02:43.940> nice<00:02:44.060> and

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
but a miter box will keep it nice and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.490 
but a miter box will keep it nice and
straight<00:02:44.480> as<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.690> go<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.230> definitely

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
straight as you go so I definitely

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.900 
straight as you go so I definitely
recommend<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:46.190> again<00:02:46.489> keep<00:02:47.330> that<00:02:47.569> line<00:02:48.910> lined

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
recommend it again keep that line lined

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.570 
recommend it again keep that line lined
up<00:02:50.120> with<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.360> inside<00:02:50.780> not<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.110> outside<00:02:51.580> that

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
up with the inside not the outside that

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.640 
up with the inside not the outside that
would<00:02:52.730> make<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.120> too<00:02:53.299> short<00:02:53.600> you'd<00:02:54.260> cut<00:02:54.500> it

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
would make it too short you'd cut it

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.530 
would make it too short you'd cut it
you'd<00:02:54.799> end<00:02:54.980> up<00:02:55.010> cutting<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.430> too<00:02:55.580> short<00:02:55.850> that's

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
you'd end up cutting it too short that's

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.009 
you'd end up cutting it too short that's
here<00:02:57.160> alright<00:02:58.220> that's<00:02:59.090> how<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.239> get<00:02:59.420> your<00:02:59.480> 45s

made you know how to make the bracket

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.430 
made you know how to make the bracket
once<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.910> bracket<00:03:05.269> is<00:03:05.359> made<00:03:05.390> we're<00:03:06.140> gonna<00:03:06.230> go

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
once the bracket is made we're gonna go

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.690 
once the bracket is made we're gonna go
ahead<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.709> hang<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.040> now<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.160> already<00:03:07.280> have<00:03:07.430> one

a decking screw that I'm using for the
top<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:27.709> want<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:28.040> make<00:03:28.190> sure<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.640> your

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
top you want to make sure that your

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.059 
top you want to make sure that your
screw<00:03:29.150> does<00:03:29.510> not<00:03:29.870> go<00:03:30.140> all<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.440> way<00:03:30.620> through

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
screw does not go all the way through

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.130 
screw does not go all the way through
the<00:03:31.940> board<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.329> you're<00:03:32.420> screwing<00:03:32.630> into<00:03:32.930> on

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
the board that you're screwing into on

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.599 
the board that you're screwing into on
the<00:03:33.230> bottom<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:33.769> don't<00:03:33.859> want<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.130> sticking

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
the bottom you don't want this sticking

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.280 
the bottom you don't want this sticking
out<00:03:34.730> on<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.910> bottom<00:03:35.120> for<00:03:35.720> two<00:03:35.900> reasons<00:03:36.230> one

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
out on the bottom for two reasons one

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.009 
out on the bottom for two reasons one
it's<00:03:36.590> obviously<00:03:37.040> dangerous<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.630> second

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
it's obviously dangerous and the second

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.120 
it's obviously dangerous and the second
reason<00:03:39.109> is<00:03:39.319> that<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.560> actually<00:03:39.709> makes<00:03:40.010> it

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
reason is that it actually makes it

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.220 
reason is that it actually makes it
weaker<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.880> want<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:41.329> to<00:03:41.420> stay<00:03:41.660> embedded<00:03:41.870> in

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
weaker you want it to stay embedded in

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.830 
weaker you want it to stay embedded in
the<00:03:42.350> wood<00:03:42.530> all<00:03:43.190> right<00:03:43.450> which<00:03:44.450> is<00:03:44.569> another
