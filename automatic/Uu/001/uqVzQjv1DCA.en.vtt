I'm<00:00:57.660> using<00:00:57.899> them<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.530> typically<00:00:59.129> run<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
I'm using them for I typically run a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.090 
I'm using them for I typically run a
headset<00:00:59.850> with<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.320> with<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.469> helmet<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
headset with this with this helmet so

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.100 
headset with this with this helmet so
these<00:01:02.670> are<00:01:02.850> kind<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.059> my<00:01:03.239> backup<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.780> case<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
these are kind of my backup in case it

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.719 
these are kind of my backup in case it
goes<00:01:04.229> down<00:01:04.470> because<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.799> had<00:01:05.129> batteries

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
goes down because I have had batteries

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
goes down because I have had batteries
go<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.150> headset<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:06.990> during<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
go out of my headset you know during a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.620 
go out of my headset you know during a
live<00:01:08.010> fire<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.210> would<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.450> much

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
live fire and it's it would be much

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.120 
live fire and it's it would be much
easier<00:01:09.659> if<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.140> could<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.439> ditch<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.799> headset

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
easier if I could just ditch the headset

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.399 
easier if I could just ditch the headset
and<00:01:11.280> throw<00:01:11.400> these<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.600> kind<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
and throw these in so that's kind of a a

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.249 
and throw these in so that's kind of a a
good<00:01:13.650> option<00:01:14.040> there<00:01:14.479> so<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> way<00:01:15.780> these<00:01:15.990> work

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
good option there so the way these work

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.429 
good option there so the way these work
is<00:01:16.939> basically<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.180> pulling<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
is basically just pulling that out and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.620 
is basically just pulling that out and
pushing<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> button<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> come

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
pushing the button to get it to come

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.960 
pushing the button to get it to come
back<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:23.040> had<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> couple<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.790> issues

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
back in I have had a couple of issues

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
back in I have had a couple of issues
with<00:01:24.390> them<00:01:24.540> sticking<00:01:24.869> more<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.530> when<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.740> don't

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
with them sticking more so when I don't

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.890 
with them sticking more so when I don't
pulled<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.460> pull<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.909> all<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.119> way<00:01:27.299> out<00:01:27.570> before

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
pulled it pull it all the way out before

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.450 
pulled it pull it all the way out before
pressing<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> button<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.070> back<00:01:29.250> in

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
pressing the button to get it back in

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.670 
pressing the button to get it back in
it's<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.600> kind<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.020> something<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.590> aware

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
it's just kind of something to be aware

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.560 
it's just kind of something to be aware
of<00:01:32.390> they<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.600> stuck<00:01:33.960> every<00:01:34.290> once<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> while

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
of they have stuck every once in a while

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.179 
of they have stuck every once in a while
there<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.689> go<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.079> that's<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.470> little<00:01:37.950> stick

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
there you go so that's a little stick

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.560 
there you go so that's a little stick
there<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.610> notice<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.390> pull

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
there and I notice that if I just pull

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.660 
there and I notice that if I just pull
it<00:01:39.689> out<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:40.380> come<00:01:40.590> right<00:01:40.770> back<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.130> again<00:01:41.369> so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it out they come right back in again so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.530 
it out they come right back in again so
