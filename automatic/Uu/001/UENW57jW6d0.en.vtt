00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that's why we just maxed out the special

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.710 
that's why we just maxed out the special
offense<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.180> make<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.509> super

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
offense and we make it a super

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960 
offense and we make it a super
ridiculous<00:01:31.320> Pokemon<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.250> mercury<00:01:32.520> I'll<00:01:32.850> be

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
ridiculous Pokemon so mercury I'll be

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.490 
ridiculous Pokemon so mercury I'll be
able<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.180> set<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.900> make<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.200> opponent

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
able to set up just make your opponent

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.499 
able to set up just make your opponent
have<00:01:34.590> no<00:01:34.799> damage<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.820> roost<00:01:36.060> back<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
have no damage you can roost back up to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.700 
have no damage you can roost back up to
full<00:01:36.659> health<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.229> they're<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
full health and then they're going to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
full health and then they're going to
have<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.070> switch<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.240> entry<00:01:39.540> hazards<00:01:39.869> if

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
have to switch so with entry hazards if

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.480 
have to switch so with entry hazards if
you<00:01:40.110> set<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> layer<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.829> spikes<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.340> layer

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you set up the layer of spikes a layer

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.280 
you set up the layer of spikes a layer
of<00:01:41.610> stealth<00:01:41.850> rocks<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
of stealth rocks this is going to be a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.620 
of stealth rocks this is going to be a
very<00:01:43.680> terrifying<00:01:44.009> set<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.700> mercury<00:01:44.909> can

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
very terrifying set because mercury can

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.569 
very terrifying set because mercury can
just<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.110> early<00:01:46.290> game<00:01:46.920> Pokemon<00:01:47.430> that

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
just be this early game Pokemon that

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.980 
just be this early game Pokemon that
your<00:01:47.970> opponent<00:01:48.270> tries<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.630> figure<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:48.899> what

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
your opponent tries to figure out what

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.660 
your opponent tries to figure out what
options<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.649> handle<00:01:49.890> murkrow<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
options can handle murkrow so you get to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.980 
options can handle murkrow so you get to
scout<00:01:50.939> out<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> decent<00:01:51.509> amount<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.689> their<00:01:51.810> team

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
scout out a decent amount of their team

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.050 
scout out a decent amount of their team
and<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.649> they<00:01:52.770> don't<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.070> something<00:01:53.280> super

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
and if they don't have something super

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.120 
and if they don't have something super
ridiculous<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> choice<00:01:55.380> pokemon<00:01:55.979> it's

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
ridiculous like a choice pokemon it's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.310 
ridiculous like a choice pokemon it's
going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> hit<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.610> super<00:01:56.969> effective<00:01:57.509> eating

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
going to hit you super effective eating

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.389 
going to hit you super effective eating
and<00:01:58.469> then<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.680> still<00:01:58.920> might<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.250> chance

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
and then you still might have a chance

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.249 
and then you still might have a chance
to<00:01:59.549> survive<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.509> has<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.229> of

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
to survive but it has to be like one of

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.569 
to survive but it has to be like one of
the<00:02:01.350> strongest<00:02:01.649> Pokemon<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> games<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.460> able

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the strongest Pokemon the games be able

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.639 
the strongest Pokemon the games be able
to<00:02:02.640> knock<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.880> out<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.270> outright<00:02:04.200> so

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
to knock you out it just outright so

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.020 
to knock you out it just outright so
then<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.280> set<00:02:05.520> up<00:02:05.610> against<00:02:05.939> them

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
then you can just set up against them

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.639 
then you can just set up against them
like<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.540> then<00:02:06.719> torment<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.350> also<00:02:07.619> a

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
like that and then torment is also a

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.150 
like that and then torment is also a
good<00:02:07.770> option

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
good option

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.100 
good option
target<00:02:08.729> can't<00:02:08.940> select<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> same<00:02:09.509> move<00:02:09.780> truck

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
target can't select the same move truck

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.809 
target can't select the same move truck
twice<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.619> row<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.370> take<00:02:11.520> away<00:02:11.700> their

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
twice in a row so you take away their

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.740 
twice in a row so you take away their
strongest<00:02:12.209> move<00:02:12.330> from<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
strongest move from the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.210 
strongest move from the
youssef<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.110> feather<00:02:13.320> dance<00:02:13.530> go<00:02:13.710> for<00:02:13.890> torment

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
youssef a feather dance go for torment

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.950 
youssef a feather dance go for torment
users<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.850> now<00:02:15.180> they<00:02:15.330> can't<00:02:15.540> hit<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.810> with

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
users and now they can't hit you with

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.450 
users and now they can't hit you with
their<00:02:16.110> super<00:02:16.350> effective<00:02:16.710> moves<00:02:16.890> back-to-back

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
their super effective moves back-to-back

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.010 
their super effective moves back-to-back
so<00:02:17.820> just<00:02:18.030> go<00:02:18.120> be<00:02:18.210> harder<00:02:18.450> for<00:02:18.480> them<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.930> it's

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
so just go be harder for them and it's

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.600 
so just go be harder for them and it's
going<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.230> want<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.500> force<00:02:19.710> them<00:02:19.830> out<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.220> now

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
going to want to force them out and now

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.890 
going to want to force them out and now
that's<00:02:20.790> when<00:02:20.970> they're<00:02:21.090> taking<00:02:21.420> stealth<00:02:21.660> rocks

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
that's when they're taking stealth rocks

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.720 
that's when they're taking stealth rocks
so<00:02:22.440> pretty<00:02:22.680> much<00:02:22.800> until<00:02:23.040> mercury<00:02:23.400> goes<00:02:23.550> down

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
so pretty much until mercury goes down

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.310 
so pretty much until mercury goes down
you're<00:02:23.940> at<00:02:24.000> least<00:02:24.090> chipping<00:02:24.600> away<00:02:24.930> at<00:02:25.230> your

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
you're at least chipping away at your

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.600 
you're at least chipping away at your
opponent's<00:02:25.680> team<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.040> then<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.220> can<00:02:26.340> scout

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
opponent's team and then you can scout

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.310 
opponent's team and then you can scout
out<00:02:26.760> their<00:02:26.910> entire<00:02:27.030> team<00:02:27.420> there's<00:02:27.930> also<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.140> lot

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
out their entire team there's also a lot

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.780 
out their entire team there's also a lot
of<00:02:28.440> other<00:02:28.560> things<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:29.040> do<00:02:29.160> here<00:02:29.190> and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
of other things you can do here and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.610 
of other things you can do here and
throw<00:02:29.910> down<00:02:30.060> call<00:02:30.300> mined<00:02:30.600> call<00:02:31.170> mine<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.440> going

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
throw down call mined call mine is going

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.230 
throw down call mined call mine is going
to<00:02:31.709> raise<00:02:31.920> your<00:02:32.070> special<00:02:32.459> defense<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.209> that

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
to raise your special defense so that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.580 
to raise your special defense so that
means<00:02:33.660> when<00:02:33.810> your<00:02:33.930> opponent<00:02:34.230> switches<00:02:34.470> out

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
means when your opponent switches out

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.020 
means when your opponent switches out
you<00:02:34.709> still<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.160> special<00:02:35.610> defense<00:02:35.850> edge

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
you still have that special defense edge

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.310 
you still have that special defense edge
that<00:02:36.330> special<00:02:36.660> attackers<00:02:37.020> still<00:02:37.200> aren't

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
that special attackers still aren't

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.750 
that special attackers still aren't
going<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.590> do<00:02:37.709> too<00:02:37.890> much<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:38.700> not

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
going to do too much to you it's not

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.550 
going to do too much to you it's not
going<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.120> force<00:02:39.420> them<00:02:39.630> out<00:02:39.720> as<00:02:39.900> much<00:02:40.080> but

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
going to force them out as much but

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.020

now physical Pokemon aren't hurting
Gardevoir<00:05:11.330> Gardevoir<00:05:11.900> already<00:05:12.140> has<00:05:12.260> a<00:05:12.290> huge

Gardevoir Gardevoir already has a huge

Gardevoir Gardevoir already has a huge
special<00:05:13.010> defense<00:05:13.280> and<00:05:13.580> you're<00:05:14.570> really<00:05:14.810> not

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
special defense and you're really not

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.900 
special defense and you're really not
taking<00:05:15.350> damage<00:05:15.500> while<00:05:16.070> also<00:05:16.250> just<00:05:16.610> giving

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
taking damage while also just giving

yourself hyper amounts of buffs and

yourself hyper amounts of buffs and
again<00:05:18.560> murkrow<00:05:18.860> can<00:05:19.070> confuse<00:05:19.460> opponents<00:05:20.000> it

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
again murkrow can confuse opponents it

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.780 
again murkrow can confuse opponents it
can<00:05:20.480> just<00:05:20.600> kind<00:05:20.780> of<00:05:20.810> sit<00:05:20.990> there<00:05:21.020> and<00:05:21.290> be

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
can just kind of sit there and be

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.280 
can just kind of sit there and be
frustrating<00:05:22.790> to<00:05:23.180> no<00:05:23.450> end<00:05:23.780> and<00:05:23.990> that's<00:05:24.170> the

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
frustrating to no end and that's the

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.390 
frustrating to no end and that's the
great<00:05:24.440> thing<00:05:24.620> about<00:05:24.650> murkrow<00:05:25.160> with<00:05:25.280> that

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
great thing about murkrow with that

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.430 
great thing about murkrow with that

Game<00:05:27.590> Freak<00:05:27.740> overlooked<00:05:28.190> that<00:05:28.400> so<00:05:28.940> easy

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
Game Freak overlooked that so easy

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.030 
Game Freak overlooked that so easy
spreads<00:05:29.960> easy<00:05:30.290> spreads<00:05:30.560> are<00:05:30.680> going<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:30.950> be

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
spreads easy spreads are going to be

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.930 
spreads easy spreads are going to be
very<00:05:31.250> interesting

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
very interesting

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.610 
very interesting
so<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.330> Matt<00:05:32.450> behind<00:05:32.750> it<00:05:32.870> is<00:05:32.990> a<00:05:33.020> little<00:05:33.350> weird

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
so the Matt behind it is a little weird

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.400 
so the Matt behind it is a little weird
because<00:05:33.830> with<00:05:34.400> Mercury<00:05:34.820> 128<00:05:35.480> 128<00:05:35.930> is<00:05:36.110> going<00:05:36.320> to

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
because with Mercury 128 128 is going to

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.340 
because with Mercury 128 128 is going to
be<00:05:36.500> better<00:05:36.710> than<00:05:37.250> say<00:05:37.640> if<00:05:37.970> we<00:05:38.120> had<00:05:38.300> 252<00:05:39.110> in<00:05:39.230> hit

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
be better than say if we had 252 in hit

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.200 
be better than say if we had 252 in hit
points<00:05:39.650> and<00:05:39.830> then<00:05:39.950> 252<00:05:40.610> and<00:05:40.640> something<00:05:40.970> else

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
points and then 252 and something else

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.610 
points and then 252 and something else
let's<00:05:41.330> just<00:05:41.420> put<00:05:41.570> speed<00:05:41.810> for<00:05:41.990> example<00:05:42.050> I<00:05:42.440> know

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
let's just put speed for example I know

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.780 
let's just put speed for example I know
it<00:05:42.770> doesn't<00:05:42.980> worth<00:05:43.070> prankster<00:05:43.520> but<00:05:43.670> it's

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
it doesn't worth prankster but it's

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.280 
it doesn't worth prankster but it's
going<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:44.030> help<00:05:44.150> explain<00:05:44.540> how<00:05:44.570> this<00:05:44.840> works

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
going to help explain how this works

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.050 
going to help explain how this works
so<00:05:45.680> now<00:05:45.860> with<00:05:46.280> this<00:05:46.430> you<00:05:46.490> know<00:05:46.760> if<00:05:46.850> we<00:05:46.940> were

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
so now with this you know if we were

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.190 
so now with this you know if we were
trying<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.420> just<00:05:47.450> make<00:05:47.600> it<00:05:47.720> as<00:05:47.900> tanky<00:05:48.140> as

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
trying to just make it as tanky as

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.600 
trying to just make it as tanky as
possible<00:05:48.560> this<00:05:48.680> is<00:05:48.800> better<00:05:48.950> than<00:05:49.220> just<00:05:49.490> hit

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
possible this is better than just hit

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.220 
possible this is better than just hit
points<00:05:49.880> since<00:05:50.360> we<00:05:50.510> can't<00:05:50.690> integrate<00:05:50.900> a<00:05:51.110> hit

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
points since we can't integrate a hit

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.750 
points since we can't integrate a hit
points<00:05:51.470> in<00:05:51.560> the<00:05:51.650> equation<00:05:52.070> it's<00:05:52.520> going<00:05:52.700> to

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
points in the equation it's going to

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.070 
points in the equation it's going to
look<00:05:52.850> something<00:05:53.000> like<00:05:53.210> this<00:05:53.420> but<00:05:53.690> if<00:05:53.780> we<00:05:53.900> want

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
look something like this but if we want

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.990 
look something like this but if we want
to<00:05:54.140> play<00:05:54.260> it<00:05:54.380> around<00:05:54.560> even<00:05:54.950> more<00:05:55.190> well<00:05:55.730> we<00:05:55.850> need

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
to play it around even more well we need

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.340 
to play it around even more well we need
to<00:05:56.090> put<00:05:56.510> more<00:05:56.600> into<00:05:56.750> our<00:05:56.870> special<00:05:57.140> defense

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
to put more into our special defense

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.260 
to put more into our special defense
then<00:05:57.590> into<00:05:57.800> our<00:05:57.830> defenses<00:05:58.310> so<00:05:58.700> we<00:05:58.790> just<00:05:58.970> trade

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
then into our defenses so we just trade

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.060 
then into our defenses so we just trade
off<00:05:59.390> those<00:05:59.660> stats<00:06:00.260> and<00:06:00.530> now<00:06:00.650> we're<00:06:00.830> still

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
off those stats and now we're still

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.860 
off those stats and now we're still
tankier<00:06:01.520> even<00:06:02.120> though<00:06:02.210> we<00:06:02.330> took<00:06:02.450> off<00:06:02.630> of<00:06:02.750> hit

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
tankier even though we took off of hit

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.180 
tankier even though we took off of hit
points<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:03.230> put<00:06:03.320> into<00:06:03.410> special<00:06:03.560> offense<00:06:03.980> and

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
points and put into special offense and

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.890 
points and put into special offense and
we're<00:06:04.730> still<00:06:04.940> we're<00:06:05.330> still<00:06:05.480> looking<00:06:05.690> really

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
we're still we're still looking really

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.660 
we're still we're still looking really
good<00:06:05.990> on<00:06:06.110> our<00:06:06.140> defenses<00:06:06.680> as<00:06:06.770> well<00:06:06.800> so<00:06:07.550> this<00:06:07.610> is

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
good on our defenses as well so this is

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.070 
good on our defenses as well so this is
going<00:06:07.850> to<00:06:07.940> be<00:06:08.000> the<00:06:08.120> most<00:06:08.240> optimal<00:06:08.600> for<00:06:08.780> murkrow

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
going to be the most optimal for murkrow

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.330 
going to be the most optimal for murkrow
if<00:06:09.200> you're<00:06:09.320> worried<00:06:09.590> about<00:06:09.650> special<00:06:10.130> defense

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
if you're worried about special defense

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.890 
if you're worried about special defense
if<00:06:10.550> you're<00:06:11.000> going<00:06:11.150> to<00:06:11.240> be<00:06:11.330> doing<00:06:11.480> something<00:06:11.750> to

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
if you're going to be doing something to

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.120 
if you're going to be doing something to
where<00:06:12.080> you're<00:06:12.230> more<00:06:12.470> balanced<00:06:12.890> or<00:06:13.010> you're

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
where you're more balanced or you're

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.950 
where you're more balanced or you're
using<00:06:13.220> coal<00:06:13.550> mine<00:06:13.760> you<00:06:14.180> can<00:06:14.330> just<00:06:14.600> go<00:06:14.690> with<00:06:14.870> the

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
using coal mine you can just go with the

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.760 
using coal mine you can just go with the
128<00:06:15.470> 120<00:06:15.860> 252<00:06:16.370> and<00:06:16.870> with<00:06:17.870> this<00:06:18.110> you<00:06:18.440> know<00:06:18.560> it<00:06:18.680> is

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
128 120 252 and with this you know it is

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.830 
128 120 252 and with this you know it is
going<00:06:18.950> to<00:06:19.100> be<00:06:19.280> more<00:06:19.670> optimal<00:06:20.120> to<00:06:20.330> probably

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
going to be more optimal to probably

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.930 
going to be more optimal to probably
just<00:06:21.170> set<00:06:21.350> this<00:06:21.500> up<00:06:21.680> this<00:06:22.250> is<00:06:22.310> going<00:06:22.640> to<00:06:22.790> keep

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
just set this up this is going to keep

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.760 
just set this up this is going to keep
you<00:06:23.120> well<00:06:23.510> rounded<00:06:23.810> in<00:06:23.900> tanky<00:06:24.230> and<00:06:24.470> it's<00:06:24.620> just

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
you well rounded in tanky and it's just

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.900 
you well rounded in tanky and it's just
going<00:06:24.890> to<00:06:24.980> benefit<00:06:25.310> your<00:06:25.400> opponent's<00:06:25.760> really

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
going to benefit your opponent's really

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.540 
going to benefit your opponent's really
well<00:06:26.060> so<00:06:26.690> murkrow<00:06:27.230> does<00:06:27.800> have<00:06:28.010> access<00:06:28.400> to<00:06:28.520> a

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
well so murkrow does have access to a
