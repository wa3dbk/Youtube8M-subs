 Monofilament in Stihl cut is perfectly suited and checked wherever it is difficult to reach, that is: 

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:40.642
 near fences, in gardens, under trees and generally around the house and garden. 

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:47.142
 If there is a bigger, thicker mowing waiting for us, it is worth using: (metal trident) 

00:00:47.842 --> 00:00:52.242
 It changes very quickly and easily. Just a minute, in any terrain 

00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:54.242
 even in the field you can do it 

00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:00.542
 We unscrew the head first. You must first insert the rod here 

00:01:00.742 --> 00:01:04.515
 block and unscrew it. 

00:01:09.342 --> 00:01:14.142
 Now, put on a knife 

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:26.242
 bushing, such a thing, a screw (or rather a nut) 

00:01:28.342 --> 00:01:34.642
 In the reverse direction - screwed on the left side. Here we have marked in which we unscrew. 

00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:37.942
 Key 

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:50.342
 OK, it's ready! 

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:14.042
 Now a more difficult task awaits me, which is why we will use this knife. 

00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:18.042
 Before we start working with such a trident, the scythe should be reached, 

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:23.942
 i.e. pre-burn several fuel tanks on the line. 

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.042
 The positive features of this scythe are: 

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:59.042
 above all it is very easy to blow up 

00:03:00.942 --> 00:03:04.642
 The fuel tank is not too big, but you do not need it too much. 

00:03:04.942 --> 00:03:06.942
 It rarely fuels and lasts for a very long time. 

00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:11.642
 The scythe's power is enough to work at home, in the garden or in the garden. 

00:03:12.042 --> 00:03:15.042
 I do not recommend it for thicker tasks! 

00:03:15.242 --> 00:03:17.542
 However, it works great at home. 

00:03:17.742 --> 00:03:19.742
 So what I need. 

00:03:19.942 --> 00:03:25.842
 Cons of Stihl baskets, at least this model: The set was just a ragged belt 

00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:33.842
 There were no braces, there was no face mask. Only the glasses that have been left, today I have another when it comes to the sun. 

00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:39.542
 If you want to learn more about this Stihl scythe model, I invite you to my blog arura.pl 

00:03:39.642 --> 00:03:45.142
 there you will find an article - the link below in the description. And you can also see my previous movie 

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:48.202
 where I show the new scythe right after the purchase. 

00:03:50.742 --> 00:03:59.742
 Camera for dad, we cam onto the daddy straight. (voice of the child) We have straight on Daddy - we screw - what is happening with this camera!
