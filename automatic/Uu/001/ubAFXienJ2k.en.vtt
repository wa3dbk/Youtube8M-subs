 I want to show you how you can make a 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.480
 cheesecake also from mote that of a 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.790
 easy way 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.010
 and very rich so let's start 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.050
 Well, the first thing we need 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.030
 are vanilla cookies can be of 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.560
 the typical cookies Mary or anyone 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.200
 that you find but that they are like that 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.270
 simple you're going to start splitting them with 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.670
 your hands a little bit and you are going to add them 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.800
 to some blender or some device that 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.800
 help you get polvito 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.300
 then we will occupy butter without salt 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.920
 very important and previously you will go 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.040
 putting in the microwave until it's 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.110
 completely liquid adds the cookie 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.230
 in powder and with your super clean hands 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:43.740
 start mixing it so that it becomes a 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:46.530
 type more appointment with this consistency you go 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.810
 to also occupy a refractory and take 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.260
 Waxed paper cut it to size for 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.979
 that you start to accommodate it and stay more or 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.979
 less so 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.680
 Take the magic you had done and 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.070
 apply it to the bottom of the refractory 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.590
 simply press extends add more 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.570
 and so on until you complete the entire base and 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.840
 then put the refrigerator for about 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.810
 minutes while we make the mind go by 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.250
 add cream cheese type philadelphia 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.730
 preference that is at temperature 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.650
 environment and you're going to drink your blender and go 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.320
 to start to beat everything perfectly 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.360
 each and every one of the ingredients of 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.040
 this recipe are to taste so add 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.380
 how much you want depending on how much 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.470
 you want to make add also icing sugar 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.870
 and I add more or less half a cup and 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.450
 Then comes our star ingredient 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.910
 what is the nutella I add 2 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.450
 tablespoons but you add as 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.970
 I say when you want 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.400
 keep stirring perfectly until 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.140
 that you have a mixture as delicious as 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.349
 a head and on the screen in series 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.370
 is delicious and then take your mix and 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.989
 you are going to add it to the refractory 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.830
 little by little and try to 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.830
 distribute it 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.940
 when you are finished you can take a 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.760
 little knife to try to make a 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.340
 little bit if your refractory does not 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.740
 it has cover like fear simply 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.570
 take aluminum foil and ice and 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.480
 Take it to your refrigerator at least 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.280
 for three hours if it's more much better and 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.920
 after that time you will have a 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.710

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.540
