00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 today we have a bloody encounter 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.870
 iphone 6 against samsung galaxy s 6 h 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.870
 white 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.600
 cracks as they are I am Luis Jaime 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.210
 Thanks a lot for being here 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
 thanks to all those who saw the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.919
 previous video that they shared that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.650
 they left their comments but also 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.800
 thanks to three people who also 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.540
 they study there participating in this channel 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.390
 first about antuÃ±ano 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.200
 also to leo hayabusa and finally to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.329
 larroque net to the three a strong hug 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.059
 and we return with these meetings 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.370
 bloody gadgets we had time that 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.629
 we did not do the last time the last time 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.429
 we made a meeting this is good 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.679
 the video appears up here so that you 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.879
 you can also see it but what you 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.309
 I can say is that if we know that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.019
 they generate many doubts comments that if 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.179
 yes, yes, you're wrong, you're 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.039
 ok etcetera et cetera etcetera but if 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.989
 you have any doubt write a 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.450
 comment and if we do not know the answer 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.030
 we will get in touch with the people 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.670
 of apple and samsung to solve 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.820
 your doubts but for now we start 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.630
 directly with this comparative of 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.030
 specifications we 're going 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.979
 to iphone 6 and samsung galaxy s 6 h 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.740
 I remind you that this kind of 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.350
 comparative I make them using the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.290
 site versus dotcom and that you 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.930
 they can go so they can 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.240
 perform the comparison of the equipment 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.790
 who would be interested in acquiring the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.930
 versus people or the versus system 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:46.729
 mentions that there are 15 advantages in favor of 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.520
 iPhone 6 versus 38 advantages in favor of 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.640
 galaxy s 6 that is an important point 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.470
 more than are several points 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.970
 in favor of the six facts but let's 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.130
 consider which ones are 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.229
 taking into account for example in the case 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.210
 from iphone 6 they are saying that it is 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.610
 slightly lighter 129 grams versus 132 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.619
 Besides, it's thinner but it's more 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.830
 thin by 1 millimeter point so 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.739
 they are so are the same thickness is a point 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.860
 important also that the iphone 6 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.640
 It has dual led as flash thing that 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.230
 does not happen in the s 6 made another point that 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.590
 they are mentioning is that account 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.330
 with more microphones the iPhone 6 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:34.330
 versus 26 h the same they mention that 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.290
 the camera system of the iphone 6 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.910
 includes a tracking system 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.790
 autofocus is to say you can 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.560
 select the object and the camera goes 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.140
 to follow so that it is always focused 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.370
 also that works with airplay too 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.290
 that implies with a function of 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.239
 timelapse which in fact here I think 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.360
 if I will make a correction there is also a 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.630
 timelapse function in the camera of the s 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.579
 6 h in order but now let's know 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.349
 some the main advantages that the 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:07.670
 verse system is mentioning with 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:10.550
 regarding the galaxy s 68 for example 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.819
 they mention that it is that their processor 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.900
 it's much faster than it's 2.1 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.780
 gigahertz versus 1.4 giga hertz also 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.450
 that the screen is larger than 5.1 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.880
 inches versus 4.7 inches that the 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.489
 rear camera is also superior 16 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.319
 megapixels verses 8 megapixels more 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:38.780
 resolution on the screen 2560 x 1440 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:42.640
 pixels versus 1,334 by 750 pixels of the 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.160
 iphone 6 as for the front camera 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.580
 it is also superior 5 megapixels first 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.290
 its 1.2 megapixels another point 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.980
 important is that the screen of the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.920
 samsung galaxy s 68 includes gorilla 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.260
 glass is to say a system that allows you 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.350
 resist scratches resist any kind 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.630
 suddenly and that the iPhone 6 plus does not 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.260
 includes a gorilla-type system 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.400
 glass the galaxy s 68 includes speakers 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.799
 stereo what does not happen 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.620
 with the iPhone 6 in the end are some of 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:20.609
 The main features in favor 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.530
 of samsung galaxy s 6 done then there 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.110
