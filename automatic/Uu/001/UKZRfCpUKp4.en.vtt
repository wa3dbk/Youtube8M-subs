00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
technology is meant for jogging I guess

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.059 
technology is meant for jogging I guess
because<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.610> upper<00:02:09.090> leather<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.869> all<00:02:10.679> you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
know the glue is used to attach

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.690 
know the glue is used to attach
two<00:02:13.420> materials<00:02:13.959> together<00:02:14.170> kind<00:02:14.829> of<00:02:14.980> does<00:02:15.549> not

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
two materials together kind of does not
