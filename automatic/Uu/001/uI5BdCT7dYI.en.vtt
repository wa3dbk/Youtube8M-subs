 It is well designed and effective by 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.010
 it then you have some 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:21.820
 shoulder exercises so that the

 bar this exercise for shoulders is 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.109
 for the frontal head of the deltoid we 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.350
 will help to gain strength and increase 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:44.019
 ability to recruit more fibers in 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.960
 our shoulders as a recommendation 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.129
 when we go through the middle of 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.190
 travel 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:54.519
 we will raise our little trapezoids to 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:59.050
 little as we move towards the 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:02.800
 final position perform four series of 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:08.160
 6 repetitions with a maximum of 30 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:12.520
 seconds of rest between series and series 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.640
 23 with dumbbell shoulders too 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.360
 works the frontal head of the deltoid 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.540
 but to a greater extent it does so with 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.620
 lateral head in addition to the triceps and 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.620
 trapezoids very easy to make and little 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.610
 probability of an injury should never 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.030
 missing in a routine for shoulders 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.200

 with a maximum of 30 seconds of rest 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.600
 between series and series 3 elevations 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.200
 sideways this exercise you will see 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.960
 in any shoulder routine causes 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.560
 a great stimulation of the head 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.870
 lateral shoulders and trapezoids what 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.470
 better is that it is very easy to perform 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.520
 and you can rarely cheat by helping 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.750
 of other muscles perform three series 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.820
 of 12 repetitions with a maximum of 30

 4 rowing with dumbbells open elbows 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.960
 this is a kind of intermediate cross 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.690
 between bird movements and a 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.530
 rowing with dumbbell in which we 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.530
 we will focus on contracting the scapulae and 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.520
 isolate the back head of our 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.550
