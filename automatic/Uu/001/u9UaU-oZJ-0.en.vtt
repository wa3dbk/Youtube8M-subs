00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.600
 I will teach how to install the park 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.360
 paintball textures that what it does is 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.389
 how to put the your minecraft a little che 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.690
 so it does not look like we say that 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.890
 not much pixel no longer very pixilated and 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.780
 good the first thing you have to do 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.000
 how to always download 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.369
 the file of the link that I will dedicate to you 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.720
 the description and it will give them 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.720
 faithfull 32 pack 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.430
 what you have to do 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.330
 app 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:51.420
 when this comes to me 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:54.170
 point minecraft and where it says texture 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.170
 have to copy 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.300
 basically everything will be ready 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.370
 but then you have to make another mini 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.480
 process within your 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.480
 inside his sleeve 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.400
 what they have to do is open their 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.400
 common hose and current that is 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.400
 options 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.580
 and this option is to give packages of 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.850
 resources 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.890
 after giving you resource pack there 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.630
 it will appear entering options where 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.280
 is 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.990
 the default and zeitÃºn depression in 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.270
 Facebook 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.979
 it will be given as a mini change that will make 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.979
 everything looks like more beautiful 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.780
 this looks more like less 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.740
 pixels 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.750
 what I like most about this is the way 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.330
 the bones 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.670
 apart from the armors of the armor 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.050
 I like it too much like less 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.000
 redondito pixels 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.320
 and so good is more nothing that 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.320
 explain to dogs 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.450

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.840
