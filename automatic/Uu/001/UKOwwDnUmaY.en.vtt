00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.180
 I want to talk 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.890
 you have to finish with your veteran 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.080
 youtube has always come you used the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.860
 new video and because this time it's 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.780
 that when gta 17 as you can see 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.700
 pity that not much has sent me 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.550
 messages that how are they going to be able to play and 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.760
 that and that roll because they already know that there is 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.280
 the real game that is the armed of the east 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.250
 because the armed is a way that is 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.770
 Well, the implant, as it were, and 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.660
 you can play online so you can 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.670
 you're on the map and you're trying to 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.740
 Survive zombies and others 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.290
 survivors who are playing in this 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.910
 server and if you do not run then for 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.320
 cent like I do not run it because 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.820
 you can ask a lot if I do not have a 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.330
 computer is that of his fucking mother 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.450
 not so I play on this server that is 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.250
 gta 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.000
 for the moment for the moment that I 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.510
 I bought a computer 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.100
 and then all things 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.500
 Well, I will explain to those who 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.110
 treat the server more than anything well in 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.940
 that eleven then took the map 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.110
 Where I am, I 'm here in 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.480
 the city ​​of san fierro that 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.270
 practically san francisco and then I 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.210
 I'm finding things on the street 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.070
 like a tramp those who pick up garbage 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.630
 down the street but I pick things up 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.910
 materials to arming against by 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.910
 the street is that he fell from made with home 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.770
 see vean comes chasing more than a thousand 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.869
 What will happen a lot is that there are many 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.569
 books on this server in all 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.580
 servants of the ibooks diet because I 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.580
 like this server because almost dance 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.510
 popular and as you can see, I just 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.510
 get to a part was up there or 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.910
 down I find myself I think the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.960
 athletic all i need to ride fire a map 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.430
 in show 20 are for a shovel a shovel 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.110
 pity that I do not need for the hour 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.950
 I need like an ax to be able 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.780
 finish it zombies and you can give them no 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.870
 have something to defend myself 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.240
 there are so bite are super bits are 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.040
 survivors see everything they see 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.430
 tabulator we know how intimate of them the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:59.190
 29 is probably the last one so here 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:02.340
 I just find a weapon a m 1 911 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.130
 see the top the team is very similar 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.250
 the vice is nothing but obviously not 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.280
 it's mod 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.390
 and who have the head 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.390
 to this 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.630
 during a blow to the area of ​​the most 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.970
 or morphine morphine does not serve as 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.320
 for when we break a bone 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.510
 you can practically break bones if 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.210
 you have a high part you stay a 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.220
 bone even morphine just like a 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.690
 zombie is left and is bleeding in the 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.150
 right part as you can see there is a 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.180
 drop of blood and it tells you life and 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.710
 the food and those things I also find 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.290
 food as you can see you find a 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.880
 can of beans and I can eat when 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.910
 I am already hungry and it also gives me 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.850
 the temperature is also lowered by 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.590
 that kind of fire but screaming well not 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.960
 I do not have anything wrong with my inventory 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.310
 I need the backpack it's like that because 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.400
 right now if they do not bring anything 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.230
 backpack nothing else were eight spaces and I 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.200
 I need more I need even the 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.540
 cage of some backpack the smallest of 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.810
 schools and dialysis that is the morning and 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.810
 after 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.840
 28 spaces I'm going to try to direct to 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.509
 the part where the planes are where 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.889
 we are where there are usually cars so 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.110
 regular 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.139
 where the ship is sometimes appear 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.550
 some canvases with you 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.400
 and those that contain inside 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.550
 be more 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.160
 medicine food feels everything yesterday was 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.360
 playing and then he appeared in those things 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.360
 too bad it is also full 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.780
 so you can see what more realistic look I'm going 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.780
 to go through the grass 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.060
 As I say, I'm going to address the 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.130
 where is the military ship there 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.500
 where are good things and probably 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.539
 I find a car if I'm lucky 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.759
 I'm going to find a car that would not 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.250
 lack nothing I do not know is well complete 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.680
 but if I'm not going to have to find a 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.840
 car was disarmed and I 'm going to have it 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.360
 to put the tires and the engine 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.400
 is what they ask for button tires and gasoline 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.750
 also gasoline is spent although I must 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:21.410
 say that yesterday like I bring a truck 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.150
 because I had 10 gasoline of 100 and 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.259
 I walked with that all the time and not weeks 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.000
 tune 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.240
 I prefer to grab Sanchez because 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.710
 wide things better because they do not ask us 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.599
 so much gasoline you will not be transport 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.360
 gasoline nothing else you do not hear an engine or 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:39.190
 a tire is almost always and then you 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.190
 direct more and topics easier that's why 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:49.639
 and with this one that says it will look for gas 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.919
 channel and being means I did not fit 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.660
 nothing 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.699
 they are like to fill it with 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.699
 gasoline and it 's there it was full in this 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.710
 Now I 'm getting closer and closer 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.960
 I never never never never never never 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.520
 never be in front of a 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.830
 point your friend but opposite there 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.320
 newer servers with more things but 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.520
 I have a lot I prefer this one hundred 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.520
 Sometimes I really like more 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.710
 I will not kill a Christian 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.310
 survivor but a beggar also you 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.759

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.250
