00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.569 
to be moving too far from that pivot
point<00:02:00.899> you'll<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.710> into<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> motion<00:02:02.399> to

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
at this hand you can just focus entirely

this hand up here also pivot points make
it<00:02:12.909> to<00:02:13.060> where<00:02:13.209> you'll<00:02:13.719> be<00:02:13.780> almost<00:02:14.469> exactly

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
it to where you'll be almost exactly

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.069 
it to where you'll be almost exactly
where<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.879> want<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.239> pick<00:02:16.480> for<00:02:16.749> the<00:02:16.810> pinch

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:23.999 
the place where you want to palm mute so

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:29.000 
the place where you want to palm mute so
just<00:02:24.999> something<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.389> try<00:02:25.659> out<00:02:25.810> right<00:02:26.200> there

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.220 

the<00:02:30.010> next<00:02:30.250> thing<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.459> want<00:02:30.639> to<00:02:30.700> address<00:02:30.849> is

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
the next thing I want to address is

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.890 
the next thing I want to address is
finger<00:02:32.230> placement<00:02:32.500> on<00:02:32.889> the<00:02:32.920> fretboard<00:02:33.900> you're

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
finger placement on the fretboard you're

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.500 
finger placement on the fretboard you're
putting<00:02:35.139> your<00:02:35.349> finger<00:02:36.000> more<00:02:37.000> in<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.299> middle

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
putting your finger more in the middle

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.509 
putting your finger more in the middle
of<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.900> fret<00:02:38.260> which<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.709> not<00:02:38.980> something<00:02:39.280> that

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
of the fret which is not something that

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.949 
of the fret which is not something that
you<00:02:39.760> want<00:02:39.939> to<00:02:40.030> do<00:02:40.180> you're<00:02:40.389> not<00:02:40.419> going<00:02:40.749> to<00:02:40.810> get

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
you want to do you're not going to get

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.920 
you want to do you're not going to get
the<00:02:41.109> best<00:02:41.290> note<00:02:41.709> out<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.129> it<00:02:42.280> well<00:02:43.000> move<00:02:43.689> your

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
the best note out of it well move your

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.110 
the best note out of it well move your
finger<00:02:44.680> closer<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.639> fret<00:02:45.909> wire<00:02:46.169> that<00:02:47.169> way

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
finger closer to the fret wire that way

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.640 
finger closer to the fret wire that way
you'll<00:02:49.120> get<00:02:49.329> there<00:02:49.480> no<00:02:49.659> doubt<00:02:49.900> it'll<00:02:50.290> sound

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
you'll get there no doubt it'll sound

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.699 
you'll get there no doubt it'll sound
more<00:02:51.099> clear<00:02:52.260> it'll<00:02:53.260> sound<00:02:53.469> good<00:02:53.739> pretty<00:02:54.010> much

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
more clear it'll sound good pretty much

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.439 
more clear it'll sound good pretty much
the<00:02:56.709> next<00:02:57.010> thing<00:02:57.159> complexity<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.269> guess

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:58.449 
the next thing complexity and I guess

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.559 
the next thing complexity and I guess
this<00:02:58.629> goes<00:02:58.840> out<00:02:59.019> to<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.349> rest<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.799> you<00:03:00.010> who

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
this goes out to the rest of you who

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.369 
this goes out to the rest of you who
guitar<00:03:01.569> players<00:03:01.840> who<00:03:03.120> are<00:03:04.120> still<00:03:04.870> learning<00:03:05.019> I

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
guitar players who are still learning I

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.159 
guitar players who are still learning I
guess<00:03:05.590> if<00:03:05.919> you<00:03:06.569> everyone<00:03:07.569> is<00:03:07.599> still<00:03:07.930> learning

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:08.169 
guess if you everyone is still learning

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.890 
guess if you everyone is still learning
don't<00:03:09.099> think<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.699> you're<00:03:09.879> a<00:03:10.090> pro<00:03:10.419> yet<00:03:10.629> you're

don't complicate things if you can do

them simple then do it that way focus

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
and on stage it really doesn't sound

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.069 
and on stage it really doesn't sound
good<00:04:02.859> it<00:04:03.129> sounds<00:04:04.000> like<00:04:04.030> crap<00:04:04.419> on<00:04:04.689> stage

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
good it sounds like crap on stage

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.949

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
sitting down they relax they're focusing

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.640

so either that or they have a really

so either that or they have a really
good<00:04:20.270> producer<00:04:21.520> so<00:04:22.520> don't<00:04:22.760> complicate<00:04:23.180> things

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
good producer so don't complicate things

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.260 
good producer so don't complicate things
