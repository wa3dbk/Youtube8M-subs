all<00:01:24.369> right<00:01:24.490> here's<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.729> problem<00:01:25.210> most<00:01:25.420> people

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
all right here's the problem most people

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.630 
all right here's the problem most people
have<00:01:26.020> with<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:27.929> clutch<00:01:28.929> and<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.640> release

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
bearing on the third gen is this ring

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:39.149 
bearing on the third gen is this ring
here<00:01:33.909> is<00:01:34.859> bent<00:01:35.859> so<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.350> so<00:01:38.619> what<00:01:38.770> happens

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
here is bent so see that so what happens

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:50.990 
here is bent so see that so what happens
is<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:41.439> you<00:01:45.719> try<00:01:46.719> to<00:01:46.750> install<00:01:46.959> it<00:01:47.500> on<00:01:49.229> here

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
is when you try to install it on here

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:04.720 
is when you try to install it on here
these<00:01:52.000> little<00:01:52.619> prongs<00:01:57.509> this

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.200 

what<00:02:05.240> happens<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:07.810> groove<00:02:08.810> here<00:02:10.210> is

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
what happens is the groove here is

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.500 
what happens is the groove here is
supposed<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:12.430> screw<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:13.820> supposed<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.300> come

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
supposed to screw is supposed to come

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.590 
supposed to screw is supposed to come
through<00:02:15.250> some<00:02:16.250> other<00:02:16.490> side<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.270> supposed<00:02:17.720> to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
through some other side and supposed to

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.560 
through some other side and supposed to
supposed<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.750> lock<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.850> see<00:02:22.850> right<00:02:23.090> here

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
supposed to lock in see right here

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.930 
supposed to lock in see right here
but<00:02:24.470> then<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.190> when<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.430> clutch<00:02:25.670> gets

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
but then the so when the clutch gets

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.670 
but then the so when the clutch gets
pulled<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:28.340> pulls<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.080> pulls<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.200> diaphragm

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
pulled it pulls the pulls the diaphragm

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.710 
pulled it pulls the pulls the diaphragm
back<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:31.490> what<00:02:31.610> happens<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:32.090> because<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.570> way

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
back but what happens is because the way

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.320 
back but what happens is because the way
it's<00:02:32.960> bent<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:34.160> can<00:02:34.340> see<00:02:34.520> it's<00:02:34.670> not<00:02:34.820> making<00:02:35.090> a

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
it's bent you can see it's not making a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.490 
it's bent you can see it's not making a
good<00:02:35.570> grip<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:37.850> pulls<00:02:38.030> through<00:02:38.500> and

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
good grip so it just pulls through and

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.340 
good grip so it just pulls through and
you're<00:02:39.650> left<00:02:39.830> feeling<00:02:40.190> pretty<00:02:40.490> pissed

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
you're left feeling pretty pissed

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
you're left feeling pretty pissed
because<00:02:42.350> every<00:02:42.620> time<00:02:42.770> you<00:02:42.920> push<00:02:43.130> on<00:02:43.280> the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
because every time you push on the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.400 
because every time you push on the
clutch<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.820> pulls<00:02:44.300> back<00:02:44.510> through<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:48.320> the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
clutch it pulls back through so the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.830 
clutch it pulls back through so the
solution<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.490> fix<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.510> it's<00:02:50.660> not

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
solution is to fix it so that it's not

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.410 
solution is to fix it so that it's not
bent<00:02:51.200> or<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.310> use<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.460> new<00:02:52.640> ring<00:02:52.880> which<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.210> by

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
bent or to use a new ring which is by

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.390 
bent or to use a new ring which is by
the<00:02:53.480> best<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:59.660> can<00:02:59.840> see<00:03:00.050> here<00:03:00.380> I've<00:03:00.560> taken<00:03:01.190> the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
the best you can see here I've taken the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.360 
the best you can see here I've taken the
same<00:03:01.610> ring<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:03.160> straightened<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.220> out<00:03:04.310> a

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
same ring and straightened it out a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.010 
same ring and straightened it out a
little<00:03:04.730> hint<00:03:04.970> use<00:03:05.120> your<00:03:05.270> imagination<00:03:05.870> it's

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
little hint use your imagination it's

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.440 
little hint use your imagination it's
not<00:03:06.170> perfect<00:03:06.650> it's<00:03:07.250> used<00:03:07.580> just<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.090> make<00:03:08.330> this

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
not perfect it's used just to make this

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.430 
not perfect it's used just to make this
video<00:03:08.780> but<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:09.640> also<00:03:10.640> tightened<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.480> down<00:03:11.690> made

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440
