trapped there's no way out of this
unless<00:03:24.140> you<00:03:24.200> break<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.860> but<00:03:25.010> like<00:03:25.540> another<00:03:26.540> big

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
unless you break it but like another big

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.140 
unless you break it but like another big
panicking<00:03:27.410> or<00:03:27.530> whatever<00:03:27.829> so<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.489> can't<00:03:29.060> go

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
panicking or whatever so you can't go

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.080 
panicking or whatever so you can't go
down<00:03:29.390> well<00:03:30.019> you<00:03:30.440> can<00:03:30.650> right<00:03:30.829> now<00:03:30.860> but<00:03:31.220> since

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
down well you can right now but since

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.960 
down well you can right now but since
its<00:03:32.239> bedrock<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:33.590> can't<00:03:33.829> destroy<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.340> on

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
its bedrock you can't destroy it on

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.820 
its bedrock you can't destroy it on
survival<00:03:35.630> so

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
survival so

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.790 
survival so
I'm<00:03:37.310> kind<00:03:37.520> of<00:03:37.550> a<00:03:37.670> newbie<00:03:38.060> on<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.390> oh<00:03:38.660> my<00:03:39.590> god

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
I'm kind of a newbie on this oh my god

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.880 
I'm kind of a newbie on this oh my god
what<00:03:39.980> am<00:03:40.100> i<00:03:40.160> doing<00:03:42.820> but<00:03:43.820> yeah<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:45.620> they<00:03:45.680> can't

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
what am i doing but yeah so they can't

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.940 
what am i doing but yeah so they can't
get<00:03:46.040> out<00:03:46.090> especially<00:03:47.090> on<00:03:47.120> survival<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:48.740> could

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
get out especially on survival you could

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.370 
get out especially on survival you could
fill<00:03:49.490> the<00:03:49.670> roof<00:03:49.880> off<00:03:50.090> with<00:03:50.420> bedrock<00:03:51.020> but<00:03:51.230> then

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
fill the roof off with bedrock but then

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.950 
fill the roof off with bedrock but then
they<00:03:51.640> don't<00:03:52.640> know<00:03:52.790> it's<00:03:53.000> kind<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.330> like<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.540> trap

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
they don't know it's kind of like a trap

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.600 
they don't know it's kind of like a trap
so<00:03:54.380> like<00:03:54.560> just<00:03:54.920> figure<00:03:55.280> out<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.400> way<00:03:55.580> around

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
so like just figure out a way around

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.090 
so like just figure out a way around
that<00:03:56.030> so<00:03:56.480> it's<00:03:57.140> pretty<00:03:57.290> good<00:03:57.530> that's<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:57.950> pretty

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
that so it's pretty good that's a pretty

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.790 
that so it's pretty good that's a pretty
good<00:03:58.280> way<00:03:58.600> like<00:03:59.600> you<00:04:00.020> want<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.260> keep<00:04:00.380> it<00:04:00.530> safe

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
good way like you want to keep it safe

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.040 
good way like you want to keep it safe
just<00:04:01.250> like<00:04:01.370> keep<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.910> like<00:04:02.000> that<00:04:02.030> take<00:04:02.750> out<00:04:02.900> all

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
just like keep it like that take out all

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.820 
just like keep it like that take out all
the<00:04:03.200> signs<00:04:03.470> whatever<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.340> good<00:04:04.940> layout<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:06.500> yeah

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
the signs whatever a good layout so yeah

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.450 
the signs whatever a good layout so yeah
let's<00:04:07.070> get<00:04:07.220> down<00:04:07.550> to<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:07.880> structure<00:04:09.280> or<00:04:10.280> this

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
let's get down to the structure or this

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.970 
let's get down to the structure or this
how<00:04:10.670> it<00:04:10.820> looks<00:04:11.060> it's<00:04:11.990> kind<00:04:12.110> of<00:04:12.230> complicated<00:04:12.470> it

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
how it looks it's kind of complicated it

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.460 
how it looks it's kind of complicated it
took<00:04:13.160> me<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.490> long<00:04:13.820> time<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:14.180> do<00:04:14.450> this<00:04:14.630> because

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
took me a long time to do this because

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.670 
took me a long time to do this because
um<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.700> rats<00:04:17.060> don't<00:04:17.359> get<00:04:17.540> mixing<00:04:18.109> into<00:04:18.320> the

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
um the rats don't get mixing into the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.940 
um the rats don't get mixing into the
dispenser<00:04:19.430> redstone<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.030> all<00:04:20.330> that<00:04:20.540> so<00:04:20.959> yes

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
dispenser redstone and all that so yes

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.260 
dispenser redstone and all that so yes
everything<00:04:22.700> has<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:22.940> be<00:04:22.970> symmetrical

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
everything has to be symmetrical

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.480 
everything has to be symmetrical
basically<00:04:24.260> except<00:04:24.560> for<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:25.010> one<00:04:25.070> because

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
basically except for that one because

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.850 
basically except for that one because
that's<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.910> dispenser<00:04:26.420> one<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:26.780> even<00:04:27.620> the

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
that's the dispenser one and even the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.910 
that's the dispenser one and even the
pigs<00:04:28.100> interested<00:04:28.640> so<00:04:29.050> yeah<00:04:30.050> we'll<00:04:30.710> put

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
pigs interested so yeah we'll put

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.130 
pigs interested so yeah we'll put
anything<00:04:31.160> right<00:04:31.430> here<00:04:31.790> like<00:04:32.540> it<00:04:32.690> makes<00:04:32.900> it

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
anything right here like it makes it

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.100 
anything right here like it makes it
makes<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.710> noobs<00:04:33.950> want<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.370> go<00:04:34.490> in<00:04:34.670> so<00:04:35.480> I<00:04:35.810> put

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
makes the noobs want to go in so I put

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.810 
makes the noobs want to go in so I put
diamonds<00:04:36.560> because<00:04:36.650> that<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:37.190> gets<00:04:37.400> people's

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
diamonds because that that gets people's

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.140 
diamonds because that that gets people's
attention<00:04:37.970> more<00:04:38.540> so<00:04:38.870> yeah<00:04:39.290> it's<00:04:39.500> it's<00:04:40.060> kind<00:04:41.060> of

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
attention more so yeah it's it's kind of

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.120 
attention more so yeah it's it's kind of
symmetrical<00:04:41.870> right<00:04:42.050> here<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.710> right<00:04:42.740> here

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
symmetrical right here and right here

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.440 
symmetrical right here and right here
it's<00:04:43.490> just<00:04:43.580> like<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:44.000> don't<00:04:44.060> know<00:04:44.150> what<00:04:44.300> I<00:04:44.330> was
