00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
so I'm pretty much saying that you know

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
so I'm pretty much saying that you know
that<00:01:09.780> they're<00:01:10.140> pretty<00:01:10.530> much<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> same<00:01:11.040> i'm

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that they're pretty much the same i'm

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.710 
that they're pretty much the same i'm
guessing<00:01:11.700> since<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.970> mean<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> core<00:01:12.390> Cheney

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.929 
guessing since I mean the core Cheney
who<00:01:12.840> says<00:01:13.140> pretty<00:01:13.650> much<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.159> i'm<00:01:14.430> guessing

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
who says pretty much there i'm guessing

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.780 
who says pretty much there i'm guessing
that<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.270> mother<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.350> Usagi<00:01:17.040> from<00:01:17.460> like<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
that a mother it's Usagi from like the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.429 
that a mother it's Usagi from like the
future<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.360> something<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.869> like

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
future or something like that like

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.200 
future or something like that like
that's<00:01:19.890> honestly<00:01:20.430> where<00:01:20.729> i<00:01:20.759> thinkin<00:01:21.090> maybe

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that's honestly where i thinkin maybe

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.490 
that's honestly where i thinkin maybe
that's<00:01:21.509> where<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:21.810> went<00:01:21.840> through<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.380> like

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
that's where they went through and like

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.130 
that's where they went through and like
maybe<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.460> ruins<00:01:23.970> or<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.330> places<00:01:24.840> maybe

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
maybe that ruins or the places maybe

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.380 
maybe that ruins or the places maybe
like<00:01:25.710> I'm<00:01:26.310> even<00:01:26.640> getting<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.970> laughs<00:01:27.119> like<00:01:27.270> the

that<00:01:34.290> bus<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.770> did<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.130> mom<00:01:35.340> were<00:01:35.520> kind

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that bus like I did like mom were kind

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.609 
that bus like I did like mom were kind
of<00:01:35.850> 20<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.900> was<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> nice<00:01:37.200> thing<00:01:37.229> Nora

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
of 20 I think that was a nice thing Nora

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.980 
of 20 I think that was a nice thing Nora
but<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.790> thing<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.090> noticed<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.689> episode

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
but one thing I noticed in this episode

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.380 
but one thing I noticed in this episode
that<00:01:40.200> was<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.530> really<00:01:41.460> trying<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.939> show<00:01:42.090> more

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that was like really trying to show more

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.510 
that was like really trying to show more
on<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> mercury<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.229> guess<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.280> one

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
on the mercury up so I guess this is one

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.789 
on the mercury up so I guess this is one
thing<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.360> pretty<00:01:45.869> sure<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> lot<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
thing that I'm pretty sure a lot of the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.340 
thing that I'm pretty sure a lot of the
older<00:01:47.130> fans<00:01:47.340> are<00:01:47.520> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:48.140> issues<00:01:49.140> with

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
older fans are going to have issues with

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.920 
older fans are going to have issues with
and<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.770> saw<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:51.420> really

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and I can saw see this is a there really

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.889 
and I can saw see this is a there really
wasn't<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.409> lot<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.880> development<00:01:53.880> with<00:01:54.180> mercury

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
wasn't a lot of development with mercury

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.389 
wasn't a lot of development with mercury
and<00:01:54.930> I've<00:01:55.110> noticed<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.799> well<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.219> that
