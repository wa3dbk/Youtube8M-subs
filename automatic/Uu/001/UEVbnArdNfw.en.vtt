00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
to do is format them into fat32 and this

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.730 
to do is format them into fat32 and this
is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
is

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.460 
is
what<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.160> program<00:02:14.640> lets<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:15.030> do<00:02:15.350> so<00:02:16.350> you

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
what this program lets you do so you

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.430 
what this program lets you do so you

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
leave everything the same the way it is

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.700 
leave everything the same the way it is
