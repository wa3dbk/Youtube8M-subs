Olivia if I choose the lowest possible
aperture<00:01:21.960> or<00:01:22.170> f-stop<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:23.100> means<00:01:23.280> there's<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
aperture or f-stop that means there's a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.249 
aperture or f-stop that means there's a
very<00:01:23.520> shallow<00:01:24.000> depth<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.600> field<00:01:24.960> which<00:01:25.229> gives

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
very shallow depth of field which gives

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.350 
very shallow depth of field which gives
me<00:01:25.560> very<00:01:25.799> little<00:01:26.040> depth<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.729> focus<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.330> the
