00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
all the other bikes that were there this

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.830 
all the other bikes that were there this
thing<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.400> really<00:02:11.580> tall<00:02:11.880> though<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
thing is really tall though like the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.710 
thing is really tall though like the
stock<00:02:13.830> seat<00:02:14.100> height<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.610> kind<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.060> tall<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:15.690> I

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
stock seat height is kind of tall so I

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.850 
stock seat height is kind of tall so I
had<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.230> seat<00:02:17.100> shaved<00:02:17.459> but<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:19.260> seat<00:02:19.560> didn't

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
have that much padding to begin with so

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.990 
have that much padding to begin with so
they<00:02:22.410> didn't<00:02:22.860> shave<00:02:23.010> off<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.220> much<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:23.910> I'm

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:49.750 
it runs really smooth though like my
check<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.180> out

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.280 

yeah<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:50.629> the<00:02:50.840> bike<00:02:51.080> rides<00:02:51.799> really<00:02:52.099> smooth<00:02:52.549> i

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
yeah so the bike rides really smooth i

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.020 
yeah so the bike rides really smooth i
think<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.409> smoother<00:02:54.650> than<00:02:54.860> my<00:02:55.010> gixxer<00:02:55.250> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
think is smoother than my gixxer the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.940 
think is smoother than my gixxer the
throttle<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.569> kind<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:57.019> twitchy<00:02:57.200> but<00:02:57.650> once<00:02:57.829> you

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
throttle is kind of twitchy but once you

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.770 
throttle is kind of twitchy but once you
get<00:02:58.069> used<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.459> it's<00:02:58.760> not<00:02:58.879> even<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.299> problem

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
get used to it it's not even a problem

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.809 
get used to it it's not even a problem
anymore<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.540> this<00:03:03.530> bike<00:03:04.250> go<00:03:04.519> with

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
anymore and this bike go with

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.330 
anymore and this bike go with
man<00:03:05.060> like<00:03:05.390> i<00:03:05.540> can<00:03:05.720> compare<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.829> my<00:03:06.950> leader

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
man like i can compare to my leader

myself every time I get on this thing

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.970 
myself every time I get on this thing
and<00:03:42.050> write<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.930> anyway<00:03:45.500> like<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:45.830> was<00:03:45.860> saying

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
it's super nimble like I can maneuver

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.100 
it's super nimble like I can maneuver
this<00:03:52.400> thing<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:53.239> flip<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:53.569> left<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.019> right

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
this thing and flip it left to right

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.620 
this thing and flip it left to right
with<00:03:55.390> such<00:03:56.390> ease<00:03:56.690> it's<00:03:57.080> incredible<00:03:57.590> man<00:03:57.830> and

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
with such ease it's incredible man and

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.350 
with such ease it's incredible man and
the<00:04:00.010> throttle<00:04:01.010> response<00:04:01.160> is<00:04:01.670> very<00:04:01.910> sensitive

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
the throttle response is very sensitive

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.980 
the throttle response is very sensitive
so<00:04:02.769> you're<00:04:03.769> like<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:04.040> small<00:04:04.549> twist

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
so you're like a small twist

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.280 
so you're like a small twist
the<00:04:06.380> flight<00:04:06.590> kind<00:04:06.830> of<00:04:06.920> just<00:04:07.130> wants<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.430> go<00:04:08.290> so

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
the flight kind of just wants to go so

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.040 
the flight kind of just wants to go so
yeah<00:04:09.440> I<00:04:09.470> kind<00:04:09.770> of<00:04:09.860> be<00:04:09.950> careful<00:04:10.100> of<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:11.050> yeah

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
yeah I kind of be careful of that yeah

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.630 
yeah I kind of be careful of that yeah
so<00:04:12.350> that's<00:04:12.590> basically<00:04:12.710> all<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:13.070> got<00:04:13.340> right<00:04:13.370> now

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
so that's basically all I got right now

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.570
