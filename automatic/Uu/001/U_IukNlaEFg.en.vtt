00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
that lift the string half the time so

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.760 
that lift the string half the time so
going<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.000> hit<00:02:20.210> it<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.720> first<00:02:20.990> one<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.530> pluck

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
going to hit it the first one to pluck

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.589

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
it

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:32.040

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
the last one I go back to I don't think

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.340 
the last one I go back to I don't think
that's<00:04:13.390> how<00:04:13.510> an<00:04:13.569> old<00:04:13.780> does<00:04:13.959> it<00:04:13.989> that's<00:04:14.290> just

that's how an old does it that's just

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.830 
that's how an old does it that's just
the<00:04:14.560> way<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.680> do<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:15.190> I've<00:04:15.400> got<00:04:15.610> no<00:04:16.030> idea

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
the way I do it I've got no idea

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.629 
the way I do it I've got no idea
does<00:04:17.019> it<00:04:17.139> really<00:04:17.530> but<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:17.889> think<00:04:18.130> it<00:04:18.340> sounds

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639
