00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
blew me away when I saw a picture of it

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
you can see it amazing isn't it I mean I

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.190 
you can see it amazing isn't it I mean I
I<00:00:31.460> was<00:00:31.759> struggling<00:00:32.119> to<00:00:32.329> figure<00:00:32.509> out<00:00:32.750> what

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
I was struggling to figure out what

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.540 
I was struggling to figure out what
could<00:00:33.380> have<00:00:33.500> caused<00:00:33.710> that<00:00:34.040> kind<00:00:34.220> of<00:00:34.340> damage

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
could have caused that kind of damage

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.970 
could have caused that kind of damage
and<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:34.970> working<00:00:35.329> theory<00:00:35.769> after<00:00:36.769> talking

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
and the working theory after talking

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.080 
and the working theory after talking
with<00:00:37.100> dad<00:00:37.399> was<00:00:39.010> greases<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.609> fought<00:00:40.910> each

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
with dad was greases that fought each

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.840 
with dad was greases that fought each
other<00:00:41.379> but<00:00:42.379> it's<00:00:42.500> been<00:00:42.679> you<00:00:43.309> know<00:00:43.340> it's<00:00:43.460> been

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
other but it's been you know it's been

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.360 
other but it's been you know it's been
decades<00:00:45.219> since<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:46.370> had<00:00:47.859> grease<00:00:48.859> is<00:00:49.070> of<00:00:49.219> two

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
decades since you had grease is of two

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.610 
decades since you had grease is of two
different<00:00:49.789> kinds<00:00:50.210> enough<00:00:50.989> that<00:00:51.260> they<00:00:51.410> would

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
different kinds enough that they would

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.560 
different kinds enough that they would
you<00:00:52.070> know<00:00:52.190> other<00:00:52.850> than<00:00:53.000> maybe<00:00:53.179> some<00:00:53.269> of<00:00:53.449> the

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
you know other than maybe some of the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.660 
you know other than maybe some of the
high-end<00:00:54.050> synthetic<00:00:54.350> set<00:00:54.890> would<00:00:55.039> tack<00:00:55.249> a

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
high-end synthetic set would tack a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.119 
high-end synthetic set would tack a
regular<00:00:56.239> petroleum<00:00:56.809> base<00:00:57.019> but<00:00:57.800> you<00:00:57.829> know<00:00:58.010> the

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
regular petroleum base but you know the

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.000 
regular petroleum base but you know the
days<00:00:58.309> of<00:00:58.809> vegetable<00:00:59.809> and<00:00:59.899> animal<00:01:00.109> and<00:01:00.530> sperm

whale oil grease are gone and it wasn't

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.070 
whale oil grease are gone and it wasn't
until<00:01:04.339> I<00:01:04.699> knocked<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:08.150> inner<00:01:08.360> bearing<00:01:08.900> out<00:01:09.050> of

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
until I knocked the inner bearing out of

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
until I knocked the inner bearing out of
its<00:01:09.350> hole<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:10.250> I<00:01:10.280> finally<00:01:11.180> discovered<00:01:11.450> what

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
its hole that I finally discovered what

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.440 
its hole that I finally discovered what
the<00:01:13.100> culprit<00:01:13.310> was<00:01:14.350> he<00:01:15.350> was<00:01:15.470> put<00:01:15.650> in<00:01:15.740> dry<00:01:16.450> notice

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
the culprit was he was put in dry notice

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.030 
the culprit was he was put in dry notice

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
wiped it down with gear oil or something

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.990 
wiped it down with gear oil or something
but<00:01:27.590> there<00:01:27.740> never<00:01:27.890> was<00:01:28.220> any<00:01:28.430> grease<00:01:28.640> on<00:01:28.850> this

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
have no idea how long it was running

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.250 
have no idea how long it was running
like<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:55.550> couldn't<00:01:55.850> have<00:01:55.970> been<00:01:56.000> long<00:01:56.480> look

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
like that couldn't have been long look

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.940 
like that couldn't have been long look
at<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.440> race<00:01:57.620> it's<00:01:57.890> all<00:01:58.010> blued

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.830 

couldn't<00:02:01.640> have<00:02:01.730> been<00:02:01.760> running<00:02:02.030> two<00:02:02.300> very<00:02:02.630> very

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
couldn't have been running two very very

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.290 
couldn't have been running two very very
long<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:10.100> hub<00:02:10.340> still<00:02:10.640> does<00:02:10.850> appear<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.180> be

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
long the hub still does appear to be

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.370 
long the hub still does appear to be
okay<00:02:11.780> I'm<00:02:12.710> gonna<00:02:12.830> try<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.100> salvage<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:15.140> I

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
okay I'm gonna try to salvage it so I

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.500 
okay I'm gonna try to salvage it so I
don't<00:02:15.710> have<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:15.830> bearing<00:02:16.220> press<00:02:16.520> kit<00:02:16.790> large

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
don't have a bearing press kit large

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.360 
don't have a bearing press kit large
enough<00:02:17.750> for<00:02:17.930> these<00:02:18.050> things

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
enough for these things

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.400 
enough for these things
I<00:02:19.400> could<00:02:20.000> try<00:02:20.210> fighting<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.690> into<00:02:20.930> my<00:02:21.050> small

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
I could try fighting it into my small

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.060 
I could try fighting it into my small
press<00:02:21.800> but<00:02:22.790> what<00:02:23.090> if<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.300> doesn't<00:02:23.480> have<00:02:23.720> them

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
press but what if it doesn't have them

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.400 
press but what if it doesn't have them
my<00:02:25.070> thought<00:02:25.340> was<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.670> heat<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.300> with<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
my thought was to heat this with the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.250 
my thought was to heat this with the
plumbing<00:02:27.650> torch<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:29.360> know<00:02:29.450> just<00:02:29.930> good<00:02:30.170> and

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
plumbing torch you know just good and

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.820 
plumbing torch you know just good and
warm<00:02:30.850> 150<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.750> maybe<00:02:33.260> even<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> little<00:02:33.740> more

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
warm 150 so maybe even a little more

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.080 
warm 150 so maybe even a little more
degrees<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.610> then<00:02:35.560> drop<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.770> new<00:02:36.920> races<00:02:37.400> into

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
degrees and then drop the new races into

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.770 
degrees and then drop the new races into
a<00:02:38.390> bath<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.960> dry<00:02:39.230> ice<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.650> alcohol<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:41.510> try<00:02:41.720> to

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
a bath of dry ice and alcohol and try to

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.200 
a bath of dry ice and alcohol and try to
cool<00:02:42.020> them<00:02:42.200> off<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.740> and<00:02:43.580> maybe<00:02:43.850> they<00:02:44.150> could

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
cool them off and and maybe they could

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.100 
cool them off and and maybe they could
then<00:02:44.480> just<00:02:44.720> be<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.950> know<00:02:46.330> tip<00:02:47.330> tap<00:02:47.570> tap<00:02:47.840> tap

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
then just be you know tip tap tap tap

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.440 
then just be you know tip tap tap tap
with<00:02:49.040> just<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.460> butt<00:02:49.970> end<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.240> a<00:02:50.330> wooden

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
with just the butt end of a wooden

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.270 
with just the butt end of a wooden
hammer<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.080> they<00:02:51.140> might<00:02:51.350> they<00:02:52.250> might

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
hammer and they might they might

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.550 
hammer and they might they might
actually<00:02:52.730> drop<00:02:52.940> in<00:02:53.120> there<00:02:53.380> really<00:02:54.380> nice

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
actually drop in there really nice

between<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.010> two<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.250> them<00:02:55.460> and<00:02:55.550> then<00:02:57.160> anyways

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
between the two of them and then anyways

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.730 
between the two of them and then anyways
we'll<00:02:59.210> have<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.510> well<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.020> get<00:03:00.140> created<00:03:00.530> up<00:03:00.650> I

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
we'll have to well to get created up I

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:08.140 
we'll have to well to get created up I

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
home and that hub outside of the hub

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.930 
home and that hub outside of the hub
still<00:03:18.260> didn't<00:03:18.500> feel<00:03:18.650> warm<00:03:18.950> I'll<00:03:19.610> bet<00:03:19.760> if<00:03:19.850> I

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
still didn't feel warm I'll bet if I

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.280 
still didn't feel warm I'll bet if I
touch<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.330> inside<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.840> hub<00:03:20.989> it<00:03:21.170> would

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
touch the inside of the hub it would

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.330 
touch the inside of the hub it would
have<00:03:21.380> been<00:03:21.470> warm<00:03:21.739> I<00:03:23.920> don't<00:03:24.920> know<00:03:24.980> what<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.160> would

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
have been warm I don't know what I would

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.690 
have been warm I don't know what I would
have<00:03:25.370> done<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.989> road<00:03:27.170> like<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:27.580> but<00:03:28.580> at

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
have done on the road like that but at

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.270 
have done on the road like that but at
least<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:28.970> would<00:03:29.120> have<00:03:29.180> known<00:03:29.360> it<00:03:29.480> was<00:03:29.570> in<00:03:29.750> there

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
least I would have known it was in there

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.740 
least I would have known it was in there
didn't<00:03:31.280> get<00:03:31.340> too<00:03:31.550> hot<00:03:31.850> because<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.360> inside

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
didn't get too hot because of the inside

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.130 
didn't get too hot because of the inside
bearing<00:03:33.709> surface<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.310> is<00:03:35.060> incompletely<00:03:35.630> blued

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
bearing surface is is incompletely blued

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.780 
bearing surface is is incompletely blued
so<00:03:37.010> I<00:03:37.310> think<00:03:38.209> everything's<00:03:38.660> gonna<00:03:38.720> survive

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
so I think everything's gonna survive

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.470 
so I think everything's gonna survive
