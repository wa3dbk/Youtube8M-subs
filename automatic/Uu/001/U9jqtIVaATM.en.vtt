00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
as a hobby and it just so happens that

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.689 
as a hobby and it just so happens that
we<00:04:36.870> kind<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.139> mix<00:04:37.289> those<00:04:37.530> two<00:04:37.830> we<00:04:38.340> actually

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
we kind of mix those two we actually

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.719 
we kind of mix those two we actually
initially<00:04:39.320> our<00:04:40.320> group<00:04:40.650> was<00:04:40.949> all<00:04:41.130> kind<00:04:41.370> of<00:04:41.430> the

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
initially our group was all kind of the

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.340 
initially our group was all kind of the
group<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:42.150> people<00:04:42.479> that<00:04:42.570> I<00:04:42.630> made<00:04:42.840> films<00:04:43.169> with

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
group of people that I made films with

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.100 
group of people that I made films with
and<00:04:44.190> then<00:04:44.729> we<00:04:44.880> play<00:04:45.120> games<00:04:45.419> on<00:04:45.600> our<00:04:45.720> down<00:04:45.900> time

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
and then we play games on our down time

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.320 
and then we play games on our down time
so<00:04:46.440> we<00:04:46.530> kind<00:04:46.740> of<00:04:46.830> mesh<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.550> two<00:04:47.580> together<00:04:47.820> but

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
so we kind of mesh the two together but

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.110 
so we kind of mesh the two together but
I<00:04:48.570> wouldn't<00:04:49.470> say<00:04:49.530> that<00:04:49.889> you<00:04:50.580> know<00:04:50.699> the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
I wouldn't say that you know the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.050 
I wouldn't say that you know the
filmmaking<00:04:51.660> is<00:04:51.900> second<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:52.889> games<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.880> I

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
filmmaking is second to the games and I

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.580 
filmmaking is second to the games and I
think<00:04:54.300> that's<00:04:54.479> why<00:04:54.660> kind<00:04:55.050> of<00:04:55.110> our<00:04:55.229> narrative

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
think that's why kind of our narrative

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.129 
think that's why kind of our narrative
content<00:04:56.330> maybe<00:04:57.330> sometimes<00:04:57.750> leans<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.110> little

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
content maybe sometimes leans a little

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.350 
content maybe sometimes leans a little
bit<00:04:58.440> too<00:04:58.590> heavily<00:04:58.919> on<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.400> narrative<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.180> not

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
bit too heavily on the narrative and not

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.210 
bit too heavily on the narrative and not
enough<00:05:00.570> on<00:05:00.690> games<00:05:00.960> for<00:05:01.169> some<00:05:01.289> people<00:05:01.530> but<00:05:01.770> we

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
enough on games for some people but we

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.260 
enough on games for some people but we
figure<00:05:02.460> there<00:05:02.610> are<00:05:02.669> a<00:05:02.700> lot<00:05:02.789> of<00:05:02.820> people<00:05:02.940> that

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
figure there are a lot of people that

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.900 
figure there are a lot of people that
are<00:05:03.479> making<00:05:03.870> content<00:05:04.410> about<00:05:04.710> games

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
are making content about games

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.610 
are making content about games
that<00:05:06.060> are<00:05:06.240> have<00:05:06.750> played<00:05:06.930> more<00:05:07.080> games<00:05:07.140> than<00:05:07.470> us
