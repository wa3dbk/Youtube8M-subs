00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
change the color it's a really basic and

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.340 
change the color it's a really basic and
for<00:00:50.399> every<00:00:50.640> material<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:51.629> not<00:00:51.930> every<00:00:52.199> material

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
for every material or not every material

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.590 
for every material or not every material
but<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.550> majority<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.969> materials<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.510> i

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
but for the majority of materials that i

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.799 
but for the majority of materials that i
use<00:00:54.930> i<00:00:55.309> usually<00:00:56.309> use<00:00:56.579> reflection<00:00:57.180> i<00:00:57.480> usually

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
use i usually use reflection i usually

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.020 
use i usually use reflection i usually
put<00:00:57.989> my<00:00:58.230> reflection<00:00:58.710> at<00:00:58.829> about<00:00:59.070> twenty

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
put my reflection at about twenty

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.400 
put my reflection at about twenty
percent<00:01:00.059> i<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:00.719> that's<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:00.989> how<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.170> make

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
percent i think that's just how you make

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.729 
percent i think that's just how you make
really<00:01:01.710> good<00:01:02.430> looking<00:01:03.409> materials<00:01:04.409> most<00:01:04.619> of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
really good looking materials most of

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.320 
really good looking materials most of
the<00:01:04.799> time<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.700> course<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> add

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the time then of course you have to add

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.899 
the time then of course you have to add
lights<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:08.520> make<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> look

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
lights and all of that to make it look

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.370 
lights and all of that to make it look
even<00:01:09.180> better<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.640> usually<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.479> do<00:01:12.900> I

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
even better but so usually I just do I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.440 
even better but so usually I just do I
just<00:01:13.590> keep<00:01:13.860> everything<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> same<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.939> change

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
just keep everything the same I change

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.870 
just keep everything the same I change
the<00:01:15.570> color<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.840> course<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.729> just<00:01:17.729> up<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the color of course and just up to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.609 
the color of course and just up to
reflection<00:01:18.479> that's<00:01:18.720> when<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.990> create<00:01:19.439> my<00:01:19.470> own

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
reflection that's when I create my own

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.859 
reflection that's when I create my own
materials<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.820> lot<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> times<00:01:21.479> i<00:01:21.720> use

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
materials but a lot of the times i use

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.830 
materials but a lot of the times i use
preset<00:01:22.229> materials<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:24.479> way<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.659> use

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
preset materials and the way you use

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.399 
preset materials and the way you use
those<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.530> go<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> file<00:01:26.250> right<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
those is you go to file right here and

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.740 
those is you go to file right here and
load<00:01:28.409> material<00:01:28.979> presets<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.579> there<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.299> so

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
load material presets and there is so

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.679 
load material presets and there is so
many<00:01:31.159> materials<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.549> use<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.970> i<00:01:33.270> love

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
many materials that you can use I i love

you can use that are already pre-made

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.069 
you can use that are already pre-made
the<00:01:51.119> pre-made<00:01:51.450> ones<00:01:51.479> are<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:51.930> nice

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
the pre-made ones are really nice

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.170 
the pre-made ones are really nice
they're<00:01:52.500> good<00:01:53.100> high<00:01:53.280> quality<00:01:53.310> materials<00:01:56.180> yeah

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
they're good high quality materials yeah

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.590 
they're good high quality materials yeah
so<00:01:57.509> that's<00:01:58.290> how<00:01:58.439> use<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> presets<00:01:59.360> just<00:02:00.360> file

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
so that's how use the presets just file

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.580 
so that's how use the presets just file
load<00:02:01.049> material<00:02:01.619> preset<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.259> used<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.409> pick

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
load material preset and used to pick
