00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.000 
only had one ricochet whereas I had five
ricochets<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:32.050> that's<00:02:33.050> just<00:02:33.500> because<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.860> the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
ricochets and that's just because of the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.759 
ricochets and that's just because of the
way<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.310> tog<00:02:34.550> was<00:02:34.760> angled<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.750> that's<00:02:36.560> how

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
way the tog was angled and that's how

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.580 
way the tog was angled and that's how
auto<00:02:37.160> aim<00:02:37.370> works<00:02:37.610> that's<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.720> way<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.050> is<00:02:39.200> and

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
auto aim works that's the way it is and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.640 
auto aim works that's the way it is and
he<00:02:39.830> got<00:02:40.040> oh<00:02:40.820> yeah<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.600> killed<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.080> crap<00:02:42.440> out<00:02:42.620> of

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
he got oh yeah I killed the crap out of

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.840 
he got oh yeah I killed the crap out of
T's<00:02:42.950> tracks<00:02:43.340> because<00:02:44.860> oh<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:46.100> see<00:02:46.310> how<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.550> is<00:02:46.610> I

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
T's tracks because oh I see how it is I

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.090 
T's tracks because oh I see how it is I
can't<00:02:47.810> do<00:02:47.900> anything<00:02:48.170> not<00:02:48.500> just<00:02:48.739> a<00:02:48.860> silly

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
can't do anything not just a silly

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.880 
can't do anything not just a silly
little<00:02:49.190> auto<00:02:49.910> aim<00:02:50.150> plus<00:02:50.420> guy<00:02:50.600> yeah<00:02:51.410> all<00:02:51.650> right

little auto aim plus guy yeah all right
so<00:02:52.040> there<00:02:52.190> definitively<00:02:52.819> auto<00:02:53.209> aim<00:02:53.450> better

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
so there definitively auto aim better

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.810 
so there definitively auto aim better
than<00:02:53.840> auto<00:02:53.989> aim<00:02:54.170> Plus<00:02:54.440> except<00:02:55.310> it's<00:02:55.459> not<00:02:55.610> it's

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
than auto aim Plus except it's not it's

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.240 
than auto aim Plus except it's not it's
