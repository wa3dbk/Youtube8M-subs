 this application can be found what 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.350
 let's do two ways we're going to 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.270
 download in two steps the first step is 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.030
 have the phone hacked as is 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.310
 as you have already seen it in my 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.400
 videos and one of the very steps 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.460
 important is to download an application 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.290
 that is called screen ethnologist that appears 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.810
 on this side after downloading 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.660
 this application we are going to 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.540
 download a theme for the winter board 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.229
 that's the way it's called nothing else and nothing 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.360
 less call 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.660
 iphone 4 that you are seeing 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.890

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.450
 we are going to find these two 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.399
 applications well good very easy and 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.920
 simple we're going to go to cydia which is 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.410
 our search engine to be able 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.320
 customize in the visual aesthetic part 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.110
 of the device good at this time 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.920
 we are going to get the total completely 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.660
 to cydia and there we are going to look for these 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.240
 applications I repeat the first 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.920
