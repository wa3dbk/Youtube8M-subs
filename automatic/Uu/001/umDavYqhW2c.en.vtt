00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
real quick look what this is and you can

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.840 
real quick look what this is and you can
keep<00:01:50.020> your<00:01:50.200> device<00:01:50.549> being<00:01:51.549> I<00:01:51.670> guess

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
let's take a look at the device itself

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.800 
let's take a look at the device itself
now<00:01:59.409> this<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.890> second<00:02:00.369> MiFi<00:02:00.760> device<00:02:01.060> in

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
Samsung device a little while ago about

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.350 
Samsung device a little while ago about
three<00:02:06.549> weeks<00:02:06.909> ago

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
three weeks ago

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.910 
three weeks ago
we'll<00:02:07.630> take<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.780> look<00:02:08.080> at<00:02:08.170> this<00:02:08.380> here<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.769> see

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
we'll take a look at this here to see

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.990 
we'll take a look at this here to see
what<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.100> differences<00:02:09.459> are<00:02:09.580> you're<00:02:09.820> trying

your computer and get ready to rock and
this<00:03:03.010> does<00:03:03.219> have<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.579> 3G<00:03:04.090> fallback<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:05.019> it

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
this does have a 3G fallback so it

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.390 
this does have a 3G fallback so it
appears<00:03:05.379> it's<00:03:05.530> booted<00:03:05.829> up<00:03:05.950> one<00:03:06.159> of<00:03:06.219> the<00:03:06.310> nice

got very strong 4G signal as I mentioned
but<00:04:11.590> inside<00:04:12.040> here<00:04:12.489> not<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.299> strong<00:04:13.659> so<00:04:13.959> it

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
but inside here not so strong so it

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.399 
but inside here not so strong so it
tends<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.409> turn<00:04:14.799> on<00:04:15.220> or<00:04:15.849> off<00:04:16.019> I'll<00:04:17.019> be<00:04:17.199> stepping

outside and doing a full 4G speed test
in<00:04:20.109> this<00:04:20.199> device<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.949> I'll<00:04:21.070> compare<00:04:21.519> it

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
in this device and I'll compare it

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.659 
in this device and I'll compare it
head-to-head<00:04:22.120> with<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.419> other<00:04:22.599> my<00:04:22.870> thigh<00:04:23.169> in
