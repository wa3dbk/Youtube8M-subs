00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
so I've opened again here and the first

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.340 
so I've opened again here and the first
step<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.960> go<00:00:13.230> up<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.530> file<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:15.139> click<00:00:16.139> open

step is to go up to file and click open

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.980 
step is to go up to file and click open
and<00:00:17.010> then<00:00:18.980> you<00:00:19.980> will<00:00:20.279> select<00:00:20.520> whichever<00:00:21.420> image

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and then you will select whichever image

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.130 
and then you will select whichever image
you<00:00:22.529> want<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.949> resize<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.630> doesn't<00:00:24.930> matter

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
you want to resize so it doesn't matter

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.290 
you want to resize so it doesn't matter
for<00:00:25.439> purposes<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.279> exercise<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.240> will

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
for purposes of this exercise I will

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.990 
for purposes of this exercise I will
just<00:00:29.300> choose<00:00:30.300> an<00:00:30.869> image<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.320> my<00:00:31.349> desktop<00:00:32.000> so

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
just choose an image on my desktop so

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.049 
just choose an image on my desktop so
I'm<00:00:33.510> choose<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.140> logo<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.489> will<00:00:35.730> click

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
I'm choose this logo and I will click

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.840 
I'm choose this logo and I will click
open<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.620> as<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.040> see<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:39.270> image<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.899> now

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
open and as you can see the image is now

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.720 
open and as you can see the image is now
in<00:00:41.850> GIMP<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:45.329> next<00:00:45.629> step<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:47.100> resize

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
in GIMP so the next step is to resize

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.930 
in GIMP so the next step is to resize
that<00:00:48.120> image<00:00:48.480> um<00:00:49.100> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.309> want<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.610> put<00:00:50.789> this

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that image um if you want to put this

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.439 
that image um if you want to put this
image<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.660> website<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.649> your<00:00:53.160> blog<00:00:53.449> maybe

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
image on your website or your blog maybe

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.060 
image on your website or your blog maybe
you<00:00:54.750> don't<00:00:54.960> want<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.469> maybe<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
you don't want it so maybe you want a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.590 
you don't want it so maybe you want a
smaller<00:00:56.219> version<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.180> image<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:59.600> can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
smaller version of this image so you can

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.740 
smaller version of this image so you can
use<00:01:00.870> GIMP<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.359> simple

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
use GIMP to do that so it's a simple

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.289 
use GIMP to do that so it's a simple
process<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.489> case<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.790> clicking

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
process it's just a case of clicking

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.800 
process it's just a case of clicking
here<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.170> Tools<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:10.400> clicking<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.810> transform

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
here on Tools and clicking on transform

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.249 
here on Tools and clicking on transform
tools<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.689> present<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.229> a

with<00:01:28.110> some<00:01:28.290> information<00:01:28.710> about<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.520> image

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
with some information about the image

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.850 
with some information about the image
says<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> image<00:01:32.040> width<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:33.049> 434<00:01:34.049> pixels<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
image height is 246 excellest so let's

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.789 
image height is 246 excellest so let's
say<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.710> want<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:42.000> smaller<00:01:42.479> image<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.350> let's

image the job isn't finished yet
we<00:02:21.600> need<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.080> craft<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.800> image<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:24.390> remove

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
we need to craft this image to remove

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.140 
we need to craft this image to remove
all<00:02:25.230> those<00:02:25.880> gray<00:02:27.560> boxes<00:02:28.560> arms<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.640> we<00:02:29.880> will

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
all those gray boxes arms and so we will

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.050 
all those gray boxes arms and so we will
go<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.020> our<00:02:31.200> tool<00:02:31.560> box<00:02:31.890> here<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.460> right<00:02:32.700> and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
go to our tool box here on the right and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.260 
go to our tool box here on the right and
we<00:02:33.270> need<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.780> find<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.680> craft<00:02:35.070> tool<00:02:35.640> which<00:02:36.060> is

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
we need to find the craft tool which is

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.140 
we need to find the craft tool which is
this<00:02:36.450> one<00:02:37.160> where<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.370> cursor<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.880> pointing

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
this one where the cursor is pointing

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.550 
this one where the cursor is pointing
now<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:39.780> we<00:02:39.900> would<00:02:40.080> click<00:02:40.440> on<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.920> craft<00:02:41.280> tool

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
now so we would click on that craft tool

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.630 
now so we would click on that craft tool
then<00:02:44.120> we<00:02:45.120> now<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:47.630> craft<00:02:48.630> marker<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:50.340> what

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
then we now have a craft marker and what

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.850 
then we now have a craft marker and what
we<00:02:50.850> will<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.330> put<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.720> craft<00:02:52.020> marker<00:02:52.650> at

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
we will do is put the craft marker at

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.720
