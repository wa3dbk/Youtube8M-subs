00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
people getting into the hardline beta

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.799 
people getting into the hardline beta
now<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.830> might<00:00:11.040> find<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.400> useful<00:00:11.730> if<00:00:12.599> you

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
now you might find this useful if you

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.259 
now you might find this useful if you
play<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.170> hardline<00:00:13.590> beta<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.309> use<00:00:14.639> an<00:00:14.849> SLI

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
play the hardline beta and use an SLI

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.130 
play the hardline beta and use an SLI
set<00:00:15.540> up<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:16.080> might<00:00:16.289> have<00:00:16.500> noticed<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:18.140> only

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
set up you might have noticed this only

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.109 
set up you might have noticed this only
one<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.410> your<00:00:19.560> cards<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.010> used<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.580> as<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
one of your cards is used and as a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.240 
one of your cards is used and as a
result<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.720> get<00:00:21.960> less<00:00:22.170> frames<00:00:22.470> per<00:00:22.740> second<00:00:23.130> in

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
result you get less frames per second in

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.269 
result you get less frames per second in
hardline<00:00:23.670> then<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.390> get<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.660> battlefield<00:00:25.140> 4

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
hardline then you get in battlefield 4

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.040 
hardline then you get in battlefield 4
the<00:00:26.279> reason<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.300> no<00:00:27.330> sli

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the reason is that there is no sli

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.009 
the reason is that there is no sli
profile<00:00:28.650> inside<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.550> nvidia<00:00:30.000> driver<00:00:30.300> yet<00:00:30.660> for

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
profile inside the nvidia driver yet for

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.340 
profile inside the nvidia driver yet for
hardline<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.210> fix<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.600> because

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
hardline but we can fix this because

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.139 
hardline but we can fix this because
hardline<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.040> running<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> same<00:00:35.670> engine

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
hardline is running the same engine

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.810 
hardline is running the same engine
under<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.420> hood<00:00:36.540> s<00:00:36.840> battlefield<00:00:37.530> 4<00:00:37.820> but

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
under the hood s battlefield 4 but

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.810 
under the hood s battlefield 4 but
