00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.340
 opinion well what are they without packaging that 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.490
 same minus of let's link 3 lines then 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:59.780
 we have a sports headset type here 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.780
 some watch maybe estimated at 1 bar 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:13.020
 so your garbage bag we have something not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:16.920
 it is clear what it is and I realized that it 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:21.540
 boxes and so guess what it is you 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.870
 have a couple of seconds stop guess this 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.980
 mouth organ da da juiceman such 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.870
 cheap arcade hormone is very easy 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:38.150
 This is how well they look at the end 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.489
 video i will try something on it 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.980
 let's draw a naushnichki 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.970
 then this harmonica 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.130
 let's test the sound quality of these 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.900
 Headphones surprised me a lot 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.450
 doesn't play very well in principle 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.130
 loud enough and enough 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.690
 I didnâ€™t expect high quality 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.209
 such sounding thoughts will not sound 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.830
 very bad because be ita 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.810
 headphones sound very bad these 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.840
 headphones are pretty good 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.170
 the cable is pretty good almost like 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.230
 noodles . it's a little bigger so these 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.209
 I can definitely recommend headphones 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.489
 for jogging and for example for home 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.150
 even a very good reference option 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.799
 will be in the description well what are you ready 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:36.930
 listen to a work of art on this 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:40.049
 mouth organ let's drive here 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.299
 something like this can be played 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.040
 on this harmonica think all the same 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.790
 more childish version of course that 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.000
 something interesting to do well 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.130
 unrealistic because there i'm not in them 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.380
 I understand but tatna of the cheapest 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.090
 options here either 10 just these 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.489
 holes or something like this 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.160
 Well, basically , the game is completely over 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.750
 Well, I think a gift to play longer be 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.220
 very good option let's 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.240
 finally all 1 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.530
