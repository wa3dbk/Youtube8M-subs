00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.060
 because it will be once again in this channel of 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.060
 multi crisis blogs 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.140
 things we did to design the 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.120
 staff of the game but then say a 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.520
 different way 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.870
 as things that parents say that 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.870
 you have to take into account 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.990
 most of the time the inputs are 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.760
 ungrateful then we do not value what 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.360
 that our parents do for us 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.210
 then it's as good as wilson says 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.040
 but the book is the point where you say 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.620
 next right that will assume magician I'll 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.410
 Take your advice is called 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.250
 as for example when they tell you 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.250
 when I made a house 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.400
 the disorders you have to be restrained 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.240
 go here 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.610
 the people did not have how is this fucking 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.740
 rude and the fucking mother 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.050
 so 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.450
 and there are things that parents tell you 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.090
 crisis I do not feel I would have done it 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.100
 case 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.159
 and well sometimes I had a thought 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.399
 half weird because I did it today 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.600
 we manage usa has like that after not 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.730
 I am to blame for my mistakes or not 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.580
 have done something 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.820
 that you asked and I could have been 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.550
 something may well have done things 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.410
 ok and it allows me to do this then 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.200
 I was there all day 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.120
 I do not know how good then I got to the point 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.640
 in which my mom told me you know that you 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.340
 pinches want 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.409
 so they did not throw me in the face after 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.620
 it was wrong because of me then I draw 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.560
 it is good it is strong 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.360
 this gives you freedom is to catch it doing 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.990
 whatever you want 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.660
 in this way then you learn had to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.060
 make decisions and that is to say this is not 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.750
 that I did nothing because I said 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.569
 I want to make my own decisions like this 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.870
 for when 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.639
 he makes a mistake because the reguÃ© has the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.639
 maturity is to say the review 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.670
 one of the tips that you give your 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.290
 parents 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.390
 then last one that was called was not 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.250
 you marry nor you embark nor is 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.250
 who lie like him because the credits 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:48.210
 is my list for example I 'm not going to go 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.230
 I'll leave it alone they know they're going to 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.040
 do 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.909
 and so when I did this what is 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.310
 it may be because good now I'm 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:02.800
 having now then 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.710
 and they have more responsibilities you already have 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.310
 to take the first to make decisions 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.170
 and you say no then my mother was right 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.880
 and that's when you go understanding and you 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.110
 you realize how things are in 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.430
 reality 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:23.250
 and your children and you will know what it is 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.099
 feel is that as a father then they are 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.150
 things that suddenly then thank you 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.770

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.500
 and good everything happens 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.390

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.520

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.730
