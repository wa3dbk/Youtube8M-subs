00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
I believe this is actually the second

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.699 
I believe this is actually the second
round<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.760> believe<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.750> second<00:03:49.139> replay

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
round I believe the second replay

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.370 
round I believe the second replay
because<00:03:50.160> we<00:03:50.430> actually<00:03:50.519> drew<00:03:50.850> one<00:03:51.120> all<00:03:51.380> at

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
because we actually drew one all at

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.259 
because we actually drew one all at
their<00:03:52.620> place<00:03:52.859> so<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.910> was<00:03:54.030> gonna<00:03:54.120> be<00:03:54.209> a

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
their place so it was gonna be a

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.970 
their place so it was gonna be a
difficult<00:03:54.359> game<00:03:54.720> but<00:03:55.109> with<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.590> team<00:03:55.799> ours

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980
