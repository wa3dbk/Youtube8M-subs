that used to be 26,000 square miles is

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.020 
that used to be 26,000 square miles is
barely<00:00:43.000> ten<00:00:43.540> percent<00:00:44.080> of<00:00:44.230> that<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:48.040> as<00:00:48.940> you

barely ten percent of that and as you

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.170 
barely ten percent of that and as you
come<00:00:49.270> to<00:00:49.450> where<00:00:49.630> the<00:00:49.780> shoreline<00:00:50.230> used<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:50.800> be

difference when I ask them what their
dream<00:01:35.950> solution<00:01:36.610> was<00:01:36.789> money<00:01:37.119> no<00:01:37.390> object<00:01:37.420> if

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
dream solution was money no object if

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.600 
dream solution was money no object if
the<00:01:38.080> government<00:01:38.560> could<00:01:38.710> get<00:01:38.860> involved<00:01:39.399> if<00:01:39.490> the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
the government could get involved if the

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.100 
the government could get involved if the
international<00:01:40.149> community<00:01:40.600> could<00:01:40.810> get<00:01:40.990> behind

international community could get behind

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.490 
international community could get behind
it<00:01:41.500> they<00:01:42.220> were<00:01:42.280> very<00:01:42.520> fatalistic<00:01:43.259> they<00:01:44.259> said

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
it they were very fatalistic they said

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.020 
it they were very fatalistic they said
that<00:01:44.590> they<00:01:44.740> used<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:45.069> be<00:01:45.220> no<00:01:45.580> water<00:01:45.850> here

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
that they used to be no water here

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.480 
that they used to be no water here
thousands<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.780> years<00:01:46.840> ago<00:01:47.250> nature<00:01:48.250> brought

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
thousands of years ago nature brought

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.550 
thousands of years ago nature brought
that<00:01:48.700> water<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.240> then<00:01:49.869> it's<00:01:50.020> taken<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:50.470> away

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
that water and then it's taken it away

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.190 
that water and then it's taken it away
all<00:01:51.340> they<00:01:51.700> can<00:01:51.759> do<00:01:52.030> they<00:01:52.210> say<00:01:52.420> is<00:01:52.630> hope<00:01:52.929> that

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
all they can do they say is hope that

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:03.170 
all they can do they say is hope that
nature<00:01:53.979> will<00:01:54.250> bring<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.610> back<00:01:54.789> again

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.580 

roads<00:02:04.180> in<00:02:04.360> Uzbekistan<00:02:05.110> aren't<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.470> greatest

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
roads in Uzbekistan aren't the greatest

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.699 
roads in Uzbekistan aren't the greatest
but<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.250> off-road<00:02:06.670> is<00:02:07.080> absolutely<00:02:08.080> superb

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
but the off-road is absolutely superb

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.919 
but the off-road is absolutely superb
we're<00:02:08.979> now<00:02:09.099> trying<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.399> make<00:02:09.580> our<00:02:09.789> way<00:02:09.929> through

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
we're now trying to make our way through

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.490 
we're now trying to make our way through
our<00:02:11.080> campsite<00:02:11.770> for<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.040> night<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:13.500> we're

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
our campsite for the night and we're

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.320 
our campsite for the night and we're
following<00:02:14.680> little<00:02:15.370> more<00:02:15.580> than<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.819> compass

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
following little more than a compass

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.380 
following little more than a compass
bearing<00:02:16.780> but<00:02:16.959> so<00:02:17.200> far<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:18.550> going<00:02:18.910> is<00:02:19.060> pretty

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
bearing but so far the going is pretty

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.410 
bearing but so far the going is pretty
consistent

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:32.320 

it's<00:02:23.319> also<00:02:23.610> an<00:02:24.610> awful<00:02:25.240> lot<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.480> fun

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.960 

and<00:02:33.080> eventually<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.890> have<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.490> come<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.790> a

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
and eventually you have to come to a

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.080 
and eventually you have to come to a
trail<00:02:35.210> somewhere<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.830> this<00:02:37.010> looks<00:02:37.550> like<00:02:37.820> what

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
trail somewhere and this looks like what

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.900 
trail somewhere and this looks like what
we<00:02:38.240> were<00:02:38.390> off

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:57.720 

you
