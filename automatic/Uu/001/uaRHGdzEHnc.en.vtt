00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
 laboratories force pins institute 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.739
 Bioorganic Chemistry named after academics 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.579
 Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Russian 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.949
 Academy of Sciences 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.809
 the hub was presented to us 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.260
 information fields that are externally 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.300
 look like a sheet of blue paper 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.839
 with some inscriptions there and 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.489
 images question how to prove 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.350
 influence of the information field 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.350
 which is not physically possible 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.760
 measure for this there is a technique 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.629
 recognized the so-called blind 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.420
 experiment when a person does not have an object 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.700
 knowing his properties works so he 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.100
 puts them in two containers in a given 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.500
 the case is two envelopes in the same 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.490
 envelope and opaque fit in one 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.009
 the envelope 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 a simple sheet of paper from the pack in the second 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.759
 the envelope 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.530
 hub is placed here 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.750
 information fields in this case 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.970
 It was comfortable because it looked like 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:31.650
 a simple sheet of paper can be made on them 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.420
 inscription 12 ti then it is given to another 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 the person there just tells him that those 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.409
 two envelopes and there is some sort of 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.110
 a property that can be measured with 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.780
 using some device in this 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.780
 case with living organisms 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.210
 living organisms concepts too wide 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.930
 it was necessary to choose the best cells 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.060
 in a manner consistent with the objectives of the experiment 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.920
 these are glia brain cells 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.960
 which are transformed 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.310
 artificially chemically 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.950
 glioma cells that we chose 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.890
 convenient to work because they 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.980
 actually blown out well in a day 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.830
 share and plus more people use this 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.319
 line to look for a means to 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.860
 fighting gnomes who are very 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.470
 aggressive cancer but you have to consider that when 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.830
 working with live systems is always a problem 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.690
 is that every cell 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.030
 answers differently and because of this 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.160
 it turns out the scatter of results they do not 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.980
 get so homogeneous here if 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.569
 you take a ruler measure the distance 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.459
 fixed subject you can be 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.019
 sure to have your three dimensions 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.640
 most likely the same and if you 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:49.140
 working with living systems 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.079
 it is unlikely to happen so that all 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.440
 the results will be at one point therefore 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:59.160
 to overcome this this particular 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.579
 living organisms use replays we 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.290
 used swimming trunks with 96 streets in 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.769
 which is about the same amount 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.829
 cells were placed means all 96 clones 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.540
 actually served 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.870
 repeating experiments that is each 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.930
 on each envelope was actually 96 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.450
 This is not enough parallel experiences because 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.519
 Well, how is the Malvik influence ? 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.620
 some factors that we can not 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.489
 take into account and to be sure 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.120
 in that the effect is reproduced 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:35.730
 must be repeated at least three 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.950
 times on different days in order to exclude 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.660
 influence of cosmic and other factors 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.220
 which may be almost these 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.400
 experiments were carried out 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.340
 it's really quite laborious and 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.620
 experience and despite so much 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.380
 number of experiments we did not have 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.470
 no experience in which did not differ 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.570
 b-cell exposure 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.450
 on envelope containing hub 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.030
 information fields from cells 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.370
 planned on a simple envelope 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.610
 a sheet of paper and this difference was 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.540
 statistically significantly 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.240
 relevant statistical programs 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.210
 which allow us to assess the authenticity 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.310
 the results obtained and despite 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.150
 and those scatter on the graphs which 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.940
 saw the difference statistically significantly 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.320
 due to the fact that the treatment was taken 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.360
 very large array given 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.050
 However, are there sufficient grounds to consider 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.850
 all this scientific sensation 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.090
 we can fix and understand what 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.260
 really it is because 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.930
 information world he is from us from he 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.030
 we donâ€™t feel him so directly as we 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.460
 feel the physical world how we feel 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.800
 and even we don't feel oxygen but we 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.840
 we understand when we miss him 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.580
 understand what a stuffy room is and what 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.130
 is a room filled with mountain 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.530
 by air or when we go ashore 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.290
 the ocean we feel though we don't see it 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.760
 oxygen with your own eyes 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.040
 special information fields still 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.470
 harder we we can not feel them 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.780
 in good condition and for that either 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.630
 you need to have superpowers that 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.580
 alas possesses very few 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.860
 people either have some devices 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.050
 which could these information fields 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.120
 concentrate and is it time to open 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.770
 envelope and show what 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.169
 represent a hub 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.870
 information fields means it 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.260
 device hub information 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.790
 of fields 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.360
 It was 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:32.430
 invented made openly by scientists from 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.320
 St. Petersburg medical doctor 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.010
 sciences professor sergey sergey than 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.390
 konovalov pain about twenty years ago 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:43.050
 he made this discovery 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.530
 that there are means to concentrate 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.160
 information fields enough 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.320
 small volume 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.020
 secrets hub works on 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:57.240
 a distance of five meters to both sides of 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:59.790
 quiet tigo surface and he set 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.990
 what's using such a hub 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:06.630
 can help a sick person 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.180
 concentrate fields around his body for 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.710
 order to help him 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.490
 include shadows necessary mechanisms 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:17.100
 which will lead to a cure of disease in 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.600
 including chronic and so 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.000
 scientists were able to figure out in these 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.410
 experiments, the main thing you can 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.450
 fix the presence of this 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.310
 mysterious power of the information environment 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.750
 which is not captured even 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.470
 hypersensitive physical 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.990
 instrumentation 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.030
 and living dividing cells can be 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.740
 such detectors are they capable of 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.200
 feel the increase in density 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.520
 information fields and answer this 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.340
 beneficial effect 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.680
 increasing the rate of division why is it 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.570
 happens because concentration 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.090
 information fields surrounding the earth 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.880
 reduced and restore their normal 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.140
 density even by a single 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.500
 Impact Information Hub 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.540
 of fields 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.390
 leads to the restoration of normal 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.160
 rhythm cell division is equally important and 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.660
 second result recovery 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.460
 normal information environment 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.740
 allows cells for a while 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.960
 dispense with stimulating divisions 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.120
 signaling molecules in other words 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.340
 information can act directly 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.210
 after all, the task of signaling molecules 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.210
 transfer information
