00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.630
 this Friday in September the Islamists find the charts for the first 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.929
 match of the season one season that will play 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.559
 a fine and well in first division after the administrative twists 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.210
 and uncertainties the summer 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.560
 for his first continuing to save the season buttons for a 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.930
 promoted against whom it was not relevant to impose before 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.960
 difficult trip to neighboring Montpellier first day and 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.590
 always 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.669
 not obvious because manage 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.249
 I believe that 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.780
 van der haar I was shown% 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.320
 our qualities and our values 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.540
 but show that we were more trains of more demanding than the case 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.070
 usual 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.930
 we made an excellent first half actually around their 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.490
 new captain teammates of jean-philippe haon 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.730
 good dominated all the first half at the break he returns to the locker room 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.460
 with seven points advanced by the sete 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.570
 it is a promoted so theoretically we are at home london wins at kyriad the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.460
 pressure 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.260
 after the summer we had a cure 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.690
 we really want to do well 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.780
 so that's not always easy concedes I think we have very 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.330
 well started a little super takes time friends I think about the bridle on 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.620
 this game in the second half the nÃ®mes releases a little pressure the 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.230
 young people make some mistakes 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.509
 the bretons we take the opportunity to return to four points 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.590
 but he alone this season he does not intend to make a faux pas especially 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.320
 on the major point of season especially motivation convinced in view 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.740
 less than 100 m a good match at the same parnasse to deliver such a benefit this 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.760
 time to say 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.890
 to know our place in d1 so it's a victory in the final 26 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.420
 at 21 that we are beginning of his season 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.750
 while keeping in mind moving in front 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.930
 next Tuesday at the man and in summer 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.210
 we will play fair and if the newspaper is 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.090
 she came to disrupt a little I have some ideas in mind I know a 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.980
 little people 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.210
 we will see what we can do 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.110
 as for the group almost remained he draws compared to last season 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.749
 it's a satisfaction 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.129
 players and technical staff as well as the presence of 

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:57.129
 guillaume saurina who is always there to joke with friends 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 I meant on a girls team 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.460
 no
