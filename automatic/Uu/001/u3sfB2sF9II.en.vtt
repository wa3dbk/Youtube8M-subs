00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.280
 Trackter 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:47.790

 A little went Yaba 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.840
 I would like to introduce one item 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.070
 I think the number of compact 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.790
 It is not multifunctional 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:05.410
 It is said that but too 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:09.910
 Becomes even a little something de Ed s ish child-like feeling 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.190
 The user is a little lost that lamb because it has become 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.360
 Say selfish not it has become 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.570

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.700
 It is this 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.990
 The interface is already built in this size 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.420
 Yes 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.040
 Do your gold 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.620

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.360
 Report position 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:42.140
 Well Torasuta x Man in Eto native instruments 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.990
 It's a little bit about I heard from about a little big larger than say 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:51.740
 With no interface 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:56.740
 But I feel I mean Ugh is longer all control Toka equalizer Another Again 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.149
 It is a mapping of the tractor using this are people who say I want to do the tractor 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.710
 I have no good mapping 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.330
 But it was Nakane 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.120
 There were also many people who were in trouble 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.080
 Seems to be 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:17.680

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:21.400
 Stand up and Yes I have'll change the k2 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 It is that that k2 in that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.880
 That high 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:31.540
 On the mountain 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:36.120
 It seems that the principal has succeeded in entering that country as a nation 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:42.060
 In the feeling that it was not possible to put more maniac things on Maniac Bridge as well 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:47.370
 I really feel like this is okay, but for a moment 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:53.730
 It is the only advanced users of tractors today to say how was the mapping say 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:59.020
 Everyone of it is gymnastics really Well beginner and intermediate players is I was until you tired of 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:02.050
 Here eh senior's Hello place 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.020
 Why do not explain why the tractor today's tractor 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.360
 Yes 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.190
 Well how to and I wonder if you will the k2 to the tractor 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.010
 It is a story of mapping 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.049
 Yes 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.170
 So you wish to you Yes Yes a little Well laugh and I wonder I was in that there is no such even now 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.290
 You should see me while 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:25.159
 I think 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:30.020
 I have a really bought first, but we will think about here this Karato to this 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:34.280
 Hi that's genuine case 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.750
 That tractor is sold separately, so what is the tractor apart 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.370
 Zone will follow 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.090
 2 computer yes 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.569
 Impression that this controller is hard luck To the fine 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.390
 First of all, there are quite many but the cause is quite 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.060
 Perhaps 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.920
 When I think about it, the buttons around here are 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.540
 After all, if there is a struggle of ordinary d who say that by this button is a play button pressing 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.650
 Toka or with Bate is 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.450
 Isn't there any explanation ? 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:09.239
 There is no such thing at all, but it is a list of alphabets 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:14.040
 Is the kind of person who is cool in but it is I'm the eyes smart seen that certainly the Well now 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:16.480
 It 's such a Do It is a bedding is Neun a little Sommer little confusing part 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.670
 Will there is a feeling 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.100
 So 8 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:28.040
 It is a building so this time too 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:34.210
 As is this I am not not mean there is employed a large part in the only play button've seen probably now still 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.210
 I want to touch the heart a little bit easy
