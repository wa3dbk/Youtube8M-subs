00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.680
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.280
 Occasion I come to you showing the unboxing 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:24.119
 of this power source is a cooler 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:26.300
 625 watts master is the extreme model 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.300
 two 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:36.480
 well they ask us here what comes next 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.480
 being what it integrates into Spanish 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.700
 as it integrates tx of 2 volts outputs 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.370
 Dual 12 volts capacitor 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.100
 High capacity protection input 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.950
 multiple and has a 3 guarantee 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.870
 years 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.160
 here shows us what speed is 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.160
 of the fan 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.140
 here we come more specifications 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.300
 but good what interests us in the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.810
 connectors has 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:13.130
 a connector of 20 + 4 pins a connector 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:17.510
 4 + 4 pin CPU 2 connectors 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.940
 pci-express the 6 sata connectors for what 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:26.660
 what is being the hard drives and the 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:29.720
 dvd of 13 peripherals of 4 pins and one 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.880
 for what is the flop and that already great 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.250
 most of the time it is no longer used and 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.010
 electrical characteristics that we 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.940
 mark 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.940
 well let's move on to open it 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.400
 and there it is 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.579
 all right 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.860
 Here he teaches us what has been the 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.129
 Installation manual 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.280
 specifications as I already mentioned 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:19.879
 and good in this case for the cabinets 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.810
 gaming type and sources are installed 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:26.209
 at the bottom to have more 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.489
 ventilation space what comes 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.670
 where the card is installed 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.670
 mother 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.379
 and good here come Spanish Chinese 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.379
 Mandarin in other languages 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.530
 but the one that matters to us is 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.530
 the espanyol here is spanish 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.170
 well he tells us to eliminate any 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.290
 type of waste 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.180
 and anything not 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.020
 well let's get out what's been 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.240
 the most important thing that interests us 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.660
 the super source of power that weighs 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.660
 horrors 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.690
 They include what is being the 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.460
 power cord 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.460
 the one that goes straight to the stream 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.510
 the four are not included 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.510
 screws 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.140
 for the moment to install in the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:33.380
 Cabinet lived in the box and it was empty 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.380
 let's see 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.100
 and it also shows us what are the 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.110
 specifications we can see here 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.110
 squeeze 625 watts 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.670
 we can see that it has a parent design 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.860
 I think it catches a little bit I do not 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.670
 they create but I think it lights a little 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.670
 something like that 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.850
 has a switch 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.280
 to be part of disconnecting it 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.440
 you want to turn off or turn on the source or 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.120
 connected turn off turn off and turn on 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.450
 they have what is coming 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.720
 electricity configuration since in 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.209
 countries of europe are handled 225 watts me 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.480
 it seems and well there you have to move 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.480
 the configuration here comes what for 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.420
 connect to the current we can see that 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.820
 it is possible to appreciate transit what 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.009
 comes within the cabinet of the problem 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.400
 from the source 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:40.660
 esteban brings a fan 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:45.130
 the subject seems below 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.590
 well because the cabinets have another 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.280
 down fan what makes the two 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.280
 at the same time 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:54.899
 and good here the connectors come 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.449
 we can see that they are the sata connectors 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.449
 these 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:11.720
 the connectors 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:16.270
 20 4 pins the 4 pins 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.270
 here are two of four skins 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.410
 those of 6 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.270
 and the fish behind us appear 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.889
 new 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.660
 we can see that in this type of sources 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:34.740
 bring what is 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.740
 in this 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.470
 and a protective cloth so to call it 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:43.810
 to prevent cables from being damaged 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.880
 and good brings us enough cables like 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.400
 we can see here is too much 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.270
 but hey it's a pretty good source 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.820
 simple 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:59.670
 for gaming computers this average is 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.620
 could say that it is not going to apply what 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.840
 which is overclocking or something like that but 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.110
 nothing else is wanted to play or 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.530
 not anything else but hey this 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.360
 source is very good because by this type 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.599
 of ventilation they handle 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.460
 is what makes them special ok there 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.370
 other but good the fan is not going to 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.560
 the same speed or anything like that 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:28.120
 and well these resist more and are watts 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:31.780
 real ok are 600 25 watts real because 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.050
 there are other brands that handle 625 watts 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.240
 but in reality they reach 600 watts 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.390
 good brands like these give the 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.730
 real watts 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.840
 and good guys we'll see you in a next 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:48.150
 video do not forget to subscribe 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.490
 laical video follow us in our networks 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.120

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.120
 good bye
