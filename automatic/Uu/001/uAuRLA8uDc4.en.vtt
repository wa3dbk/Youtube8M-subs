00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
moving this potato out in the greenhouse

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.530 
moving this potato out in the greenhouse
and<00:01:30.160> I<00:01:30.250> put<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.490> little<00:01:30.670> fencing<00:01:31.150> around<00:01:31.270> the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
and I put a little fencing around the

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.260 
and I put a little fencing around the
pot<00:01:31.750> as<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:32.080> can<00:01:32.229> see<00:01:32.409> it<00:01:32.590> needs<00:01:32.770> some<00:01:33.100> support

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
pot as you can see it needs some support

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.210 
pot as you can see it needs some support
got<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.300> little<00:01:34.570> bit<00:01:34.690> leggy<00:01:34.900> in<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.260> house<00:01:35.440> but

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
got a little bit leggy in the house but

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.410 
got a little bit leggy in the house but
you<00:01:36.250> know<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.670> lighting<00:01:36.970> wasn't<00:01:37.180> the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
you know the lighting wasn't the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.570 
you know the lighting wasn't the
greatest<00:01:37.840> so<00:01:38.200> removed<00:01:38.740> it<00:01:38.860> out<00:01:39.009> here<00:01:39.369> we'll

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
greatest so removed it out here we'll

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.730 
greatest so removed it out here we'll
see<00:01:39.759> how<00:01:39.910> it<00:01:40.060> does<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.660> see<00:01:41.530> if<00:01:41.619> it<00:01:41.710> actually

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
see how it does and see if it actually

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.920 
see how it does and see if it actually
produces<00:01:42.550> it'll<00:01:43.060> do<00:01:43.210> much<00:01:43.390> better<00:01:43.690> out<00:01:43.900> here

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
produces it'll do much better out here

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.469 
produces it'll do much better out here
the<00:01:44.350> lighting<00:01:44.680> will<00:01:44.830> be<00:01:44.979> better<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:46.420> a

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
the lighting will be better it's a

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.140 
the lighting will be better it's a
cloudy<00:01:46.780> day<00:01:46.930> so<00:01:47.140> it's<00:01:47.440> a<00:01:47.500> perfect<00:01:47.950> day<00:01:48.160> to<00:01:48.940> move

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
cloudy day so it's a perfect day to move

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.719 
cloudy day so it's a perfect day to move
it<00:01:49.300> outdoors<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:50.229> adjust<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.220> its<00:01:51.430> new

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
it outdoors to adjust to its new

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.560 
it outdoors to adjust to its new
environment<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.680> I<00:01:53.920> think<00:01:54.060> it'll<00:01:55.060> do<00:01:55.360> better

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
environment and I think it'll do better

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.900 
environment and I think it'll do better
we'll<00:01:56.080> see<00:01:56.320> I'll<00:01:56.710> keep<00:01:57.039> you<00:01:57.160> updated<00:01:57.310> and

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.300 
we'll see I'll keep you updated and
hopefully<00:01:58.420> I'll<00:01:58.690> continue<00:01:59.259> on<00:01:59.440> with<00:01:59.860> harvest

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
hopefully I'll continue on with harvest

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.999 
hopefully I'll continue on with harvest
if<00:02:00.700> there's<00:02:01.119> a<00:02:01.180> harvest<00:02:01.660> I<00:02:01.899> hope<00:02:02.649> I<00:02:02.830> have

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
if there's a harvest I hope I have

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.380 
if there's a harvest I hope I have
something<00:02:03.310> good<00:02:03.430> to<00:02:03.490> show<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:03.759> later<00:02:04.119> on

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
something good to show you later on

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.350 
something good to show you later on
if<00:02:04.930> not<00:02:05.350> then<00:02:05.770> well<00:02:06.280> we<00:02:06.550> might<00:02:06.789> we'll<00:02:07.119> try

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
if not then well we might we'll try

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.810 
if not then well we might we'll try
again<00:02:07.539> or<00:02:07.960> otherwise<00:02:08.470> I'll<00:02:08.890> just<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.789> know

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
again or otherwise I'll just you know

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.570 
again or otherwise I'll just you know
we'll<00:02:10.300> let<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.570> go<00:02:10.720> but<00:02:11.320> I<00:02:11.350> as<00:02:12.070> you<00:02:12.220> can<00:02:12.370> see

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
we'll let it go but I as you can see

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.270 
we'll let it go but I as you can see
it's<00:02:12.760> curling<00:02:13.209> over<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.720> little<00:02:14.350> bit<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:15.070> this

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
it's curling over a little bit and this

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.600 
it's curling over a little bit and this
fencing<00:02:15.760> will<00:02:15.970> help<00:02:16.590> brace<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.620> up<00:02:18.040> now<00:02:18.250> and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
fencing will help brace that up now and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.840 
fencing will help brace that up now and
I<00:02:19.420> watered<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.900> in<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.709> would<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.130> see<00:02:21.400> just

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
I watered it in and would you see just

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.330 
I watered it in and would you see just
kind<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.150> wait<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.360> out<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:22.930> see<00:02:23.709> what<00:02:23.890> happens

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
kind of wait it out and see what happens

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.210 
kind of wait it out and see what happens
I<00:02:24.430> did<00:02:24.670> break<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:24.970> few<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.500> leaf<00:02:26.709> sections

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
I did break a few of the leaf sections

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.990 
I did break a few of the leaf sections
off<00:02:27.400> but<00:02:27.970> yeah<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:29.680> transfer<00:02:30.340> was<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.700> little

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
off but yeah the transfer was a little

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.670 
off but yeah the transfer was a little
tough<00:02:31.209> on<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.570> but<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.750> think<00:02:32.019> it'll<00:02:32.200> perk<00:02:32.500> up

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
tough on it but I think it'll perk up

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.440 
tough on it but I think it'll perk up
