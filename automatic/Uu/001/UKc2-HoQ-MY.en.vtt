this<00:02:12.960> game<00:02:13.170> compared<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.590> WoW<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:14.070> um<00:02:15.590> as

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
this game compared to WoW is um as

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.920 
this game compared to WoW is um as
you're<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.550> let's<00:02:17.730> say<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:17.970> do<00:02:18.150> ability<00:02:18.690> there

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
you're so let's say you do ability there

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.270 
you're so let's say you do ability there
is<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> one-second<00:02:19.770> global<00:02:20.070> cooldown

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
is like a one-second global cooldown

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.790 
is like a one-second global cooldown
these<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:21.150> global<00:02:21.450> clients<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.080> not<00:02:22.530> as

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
these the global clients is not as

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.700 
these the global clients is not as
effective<00:02:23.220> as<00:02:24.000> efficient<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.630> what<00:02:25.170> World<00:02:25.590> of

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
effective as efficient as what World of

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.070 
effective as efficient as what World of
Warcraft<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.280> which<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.760> very<00:02:26.970> annoying<00:02:27.090> so

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
Warcraft is which is very annoying so

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.050 
Warcraft is which is very annoying so
allowing<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:29.370> basically<00:02:29.610> queue<00:02:29.970> up

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
allowing this can basically queue up

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.180 
allowing this can basically queue up
your<00:02:30.180> next<00:02:30.450> spell<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:32.070> can

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
your next spell so that you can

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.470 
your next spell so that you can
basically<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.700> let's<00:02:32.970> say<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.120> was<00:02:33.270> going<00:02:33.420> to

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
basically just let's say I was going to

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.290 
basically just let's say I was going to
jam<00:02:34.080> battering<00:02:34.800> assault<00:02:35.100> two<00:02:35.670> times<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> row

jam battering assault two times in a row

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.740 
jam battering assault two times in a row
I<00:02:36.650> can<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.240> basically<00:02:39.360> mash

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
I can do that I can just basically mash

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.540 
I can do that I can just basically mash
that<00:02:40.050> rather<00:02:40.320> than<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:41.010> know<00:02:41.040> hit<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.340> once

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
that rather than you know hit it once

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.270 
that rather than you know hit it once
wait<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.880> second<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.330> hit<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.540> again<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:44.010> once

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
wait a second to hit it again so once

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.560 
wait a second to hit it again so once

comfortable button to use for your
toddler<00:06:09.610> autorun<00:06:10.290> because<00:06:11.290> i<00:06:11.320> have<00:06:11.800> a<00:06:12.130> i<00:06:12.910> think

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
toddler autorun because i have a i think

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.540 
toddler autorun because i have a i think
it's<00:06:13.510> like<00:06:13.570> a<00:06:13.690> mx300<00:06:14.680> or<00:06:14.770> something<00:06:15.040> mouse<00:06:15.250> I

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
it's like a mx300 or something mouse I

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.050 
it's like a mx300 or something mouse I
use<00:06:16.450> my<00:06:16.630> side<00:06:16.960> left<00:06:17.260> button<00:06:17.560> as<00:06:17.710> my<00:06:18.430> auto<00:06:18.760> run

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
use my side left button as my auto run

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.700 
use my side left button as my auto run
so<00:06:19.510> that<00:06:19.690> way<00:06:19.810> I<00:06:19.840> don't<00:06:20.110> have<00:06:20.200> to<00:06:20.320> press<00:06:20.680> like

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
so that way I don't have to press like

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.060 
so that way I don't have to press like
num<00:06:21.040> lock<00:06:21.250> or<00:06:21.430> anything<00:06:21.670> like<00:06:21.700> that

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
num lock or anything like that

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.800 
num lock or anything like that
everything<00:06:24.070> else<00:06:24.250> is<00:06:24.400> pretty<00:06:24.700> standard<00:06:25.090> you

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
everything else is pretty standard you

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.780 
everything else is pretty standard you
can<00:06:26.020> even<00:06:26.260> customize<00:06:26.830> it<00:06:27.010> to<00:06:27.040> whatever<00:06:27.520> you

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
can even customize it to whatever you

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.850 
can even customize it to whatever you
wants<00:06:28.120> up<00:06:28.240> to<00:06:28.390> you<00:06:28.600> so<00:06:29.350> that's<00:06:29.560> the<00:06:29.680> user

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
wants up to you so that's the user

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.640 
wants up to you so that's the user
interface<00:06:30.780> graphics<00:06:31.780> I<00:06:31.930> always<00:06:32.440> play

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
interface graphics I always play

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.620 
interface graphics I always play
windowed<00:06:32.980> mode

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
windowed mode

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.390 
windowed mode
way<00:06:33.810> I<00:06:33.840> can<00:06:34.320> simply<00:06:34.740> just<00:06:34.800> click<00:06:35.040> on<00:06:35.190> something

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
way I can simply just click on something

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.070 
way I can simply just click on something
because<00:06:35.910> I<00:06:36.090> use<00:06:36.240> dual<00:06:36.420> monitor<00:06:36.810> i<00:06:36.840> can<00:06:36.960> click

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
because I use dual monitor i can click

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.080 
because I use dual monitor i can click
on<00:06:37.230> something<00:06:37.470> and<00:06:37.770> i'll<00:06:38.010> be<00:06:38.220> you<00:06:38.760> know<00:06:38.850> that

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
on something and i'll be you know that

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.930 
on something and i'll be you know that
we<00:06:39.350> be<00:06:40.350> easier<00:06:40.710> for<00:06:40.740> me<00:06:40.980> I'd<00:06:41.190> off<00:06:41.340> the<00:06:41.490> alt<00:06:41.670> tab

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
we be easier for me I'd off the alt tab

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.350 
we be easier for me I'd off the alt tab
and<00:06:42.330> then<00:06:42.780> completely<00:06:43.350> minimize<00:06:43.770> the<00:06:43.920> game<00:06:44.360> as

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
and then completely minimize the game as

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.600 
and then completely minimize the game as
you<00:06:45.480> can<00:06:45.600> see<00:06:45.750> all<00:06:45.780> my<00:06:46.080> settings<00:06:46.350> are<00:06:46.680> on

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
you can see all my settings are on

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.370 
you can see all my settings are on
decent<00:06:48.240> settings<00:06:48.510> i<00:06:48.660> don't<00:06:48.840> have<00:06:48.930> it<00:06:48.960> maxed

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
decent settings i don't have it maxed

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.050 
decent settings i don't have it maxed
out<00:06:49.500> because<00:06:49.830> i<00:06:49.860> have<00:06:50.100> a<00:06:50.130> you<00:06:50.640> know<00:06:50.730> max

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
out because i have a you know max

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.200 
out because i have a you know max
resolution<00:06:51.740> but<00:06:52.740> it's<00:06:52.890> up<00:06:53.010> to<00:06:53.040> you<00:06:53.310> also<00:06:53.580> it's

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
resolution but it's up to you also it's

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.500 
resolution but it's up to you also it's
better<00:06:54.450> so<00:06:54.690> that<00:06:54.720> it<00:06:55.140> plays<00:06:55.530> much<00:06:55.770> smoother

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
better so that it plays much smoother

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.840 
better so that it plays much smoother
obviously<00:06:57.510> increase<00:06:57.780> your<00:06:57.900> distance<00:06:58.850> lower

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
obviously increase your distance lower

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.400 
obviously increase your distance lower
some<00:07:00.120> of<00:07:00.180> your<00:07:00.300> performance<00:07:00.570> but<00:07:00.960> if<00:07:01.140> you<00:07:01.290> have

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
some of your performance but if you have

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.580 
some of your performance but if you have

this<00:07:11.100> helps<00:07:11.490> this<00:07:11.910> is<00:07:12.150> the<00:07:12.360> last<00:07:12.390> day<00:07:12.870> the<00:07:13.080> beta

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
this helps this is the last day the beta

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.810 
this helps this is the last day the beta
i<00:07:13.410> think<00:07:13.680> there's<00:07:13.950> no<00:07:14.160> there's<00:07:14.550> not<00:07:14.640> going<00:07:14.760> to

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
i think there's no there's not going to

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.270 
i think there's no there's not going to
be<00:07:14.880> any<00:07:15.060> more<00:07:15.180> beta<00:07:15.980> basically<00:07:16.980> until<00:07:17.160> the

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 
be any more beta basically until the

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.540 
be any more beta basically until the
game<00:07:17.490> is<00:07:17.520> out<00:07:18.380> so<00:07:19.380> this<00:07:20.010> should<00:07:20.310> be<00:07:20.340> the<00:07:20.520> last

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.550 
game is out so this should be the last

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.880 
game is out so this should be the last
chance<00:07:20.790> to<00:07:21.030> play<00:07:21.210> it<00:07:21.300> but<00:07:21.450> take<00:07:22.350> might<00:07:22.590> take

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:22.890 
chance to play it but take might take

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.720 
chance to play it but take might take
some<00:07:23.100> of<00:07:23.250> my<00:07:23.700> advice<00:07:24.030> to<00:07:24.720> to<00:07:25.650> practice<00:07:26.190> so<00:07:26.700> that

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.730 
some of my advice to to practice so that

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.700 
some of my advice to to practice so that
way<00:07:27.060> you<00:07:27.120> can<00:07:27.480> save<00:07:27.690> a<00:07:27.750> lot<00:07:27.930> of<00:07:27.990> downtime<00:07:28.230> you

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.710 
way you can save a lot of downtime you

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.680 
way you can save a lot of downtime you
can<00:07:28.860> also<00:07:28.980> increase<00:07:29.340> efficiency<00:07:29.970> but<00:07:30.540> let<00:07:30.660> me

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:30.690 
can also increase efficiency but let me

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.270 
can also increase efficiency but let me
know<00:07:30.870> if<00:07:30.960> there's<00:07:31.110> something<00:07:31.380> else<00:07:31.560> that<00:07:31.830> you

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 
know if there's something else that you

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.160 
know if there's something else that you
typically<00:07:32.670> do<00:07:32.940> because<00:07:33.390> i'm<00:07:33.570> interested<00:07:34.050> in
