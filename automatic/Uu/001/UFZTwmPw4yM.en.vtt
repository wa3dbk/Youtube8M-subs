00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
liquids and so my thing is I think that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.340 
liquids and so my thing is I think that
the<00:00:53.309> weight<00:00:53.489> has<00:00:53.520> no<00:00:54.030> issue<00:00:54.270> or<00:00:54.690> neither<00:00:54.960> side

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the weight has no issue or neither side

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.619 
the weight has no issue or neither side
no<00:00:55.739> advantages<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.309> disadvantage<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.449> one

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
no advantages of disadvantage but one

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.790 
no advantages of disadvantage but one

tomorrow night but I still think that a
dom<00:03:48.449> team<00:03:49.310> more<00:03:50.310> concerned<00:03:50.970> about<00:03:51.359> wait<00:03:52.260> for

that<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.479> fans<00:04:18.750> will<00:04:18.870> know<00:04:19.079> when<00:04:19.289> I<00:04:19.320> speak<00:04:19.650> and

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
that the fans will know when I speak and

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.979 
that the fans will know when I speak and
hear<00:04:20.130> what<00:04:20.250> I<00:04:20.280> say<00:04:20.549> that<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.599> would<00:04:21.810> be

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989

something<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.469> they<00:04:22.740> can<00:04:22.919> agree<00:04:23.250> with<00:04:23.280> and

be<00:04:25.740> spit<00:04:26.039> whether<00:04:26.700> they<00:04:26.940> can't

the<00:05:21.750> title<00:05:22.139> but<00:05:22.379> also<00:05:22.560> for<00:05:22.979> his<00:05:23.039> country<00:05:23.460> and

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
the title but also for his country and

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.909 
the title but also for his country and
when<00:05:24.389> you<00:05:24.509> have<00:05:24.659> that<00:05:24.870> momentum<00:05:25.409> and<00:05:25.560> his

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
when you have that momentum and his

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.850 
when you have that momentum and his
aggressive<00:05:26.400> style<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:26.999> I<00:05:27.509> see<00:05:27.689> nodame<00:05:28.020> really

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
aggressive style and I see nodame really

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.879 
aggressive style and I see nodame really
really<00:05:29.189> not<00:05:29.879> fight<00:05:30.360> as<00:05:30.569> well<00:05:30.839> inside<00:05:31.500> when<00:05:31.800> he

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
really not fight as well inside when he

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.879 
really not fight as well inside when he
has<00:05:32.099> to<00:05:32.310> bite<00:05:32.550> down<00:05:32.580> and<00:05:33.089> let<00:05:33.689> it<00:05:33.719> go<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.259> think

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
has to bite down and let it go I think

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.240 
has to bite down and let it go I think
he<00:05:35.219> can<00:05:35.520> make<00:05:36.419> that<00:05:36.449> happen<00:05:37.219> sooner<00:05:38.219> than

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
he can make that happen sooner than

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.760 
he can make that happen sooner than
later<00:05:38.659> depend<00:05:39.659> on<00:05:39.870> the<00:05:39.990> first<00:05:40.259> three<00:05:40.500> four

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
later depend on the first three four

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.490 
later depend on the first three four
rounds<00:05:41.129> look<00:05:42.089> dog<00:05:42.569> I<00:05:42.779> said<00:05:43.020> it<00:05:43.139> I<00:05:43.169> think<00:05:43.319> it's

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
rounds look dog I said it I think it's

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.689 
rounds look dog I said it I think it's
possible<00:05:43.710> for<00:05:44.009> them<00:05:44.189> you<00:05:44.339> to<00:05:44.460> get<00:05:44.550> the

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
possible for them you to get the

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.490 
possible for them you to get the
knockout<00:05:44.909> if<00:05:45.330> he<00:05:45.479> does<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.080> right<00:05:46.229> things

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
knockout if he does the right things

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.769 
knockout if he does the right things
early<00:05:47.159> fight<00:05:47.580> will<00:05:47.759> be<00:05:47.909> stopped<00:05:48.210> later<00:05:48.569> on

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:48.779 
early fight will be stopped later on

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.709 
early fight will be stopped later on
around<00:05:48.930> so<00:05:49.319> either<00:05:49.469> own<00:05:49.680> cuts<00:05:50.009> or<00:05:50.270> a<00:05:51.270> knockout

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
around so either own cuts or a knockout

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.100 
around so either own cuts or a knockout
and<00:05:51.960> i<00:05:52.050> think<00:05:52.319> the<00:05:52.469> body<00:05:52.740> has<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.729> be<00:05:53.909> a<00:05:54.599> yes

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
and i think the body has to be a yes

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.600 
and i think the body has to be a yes

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:00.569 
to see the results and get the interest

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:03.170 
to see the results and get the interest
from<00:06:01.229> that<00:06:01.439> work<00:06:01.649> later<00:06:02.279> on<00:06:02.550> in<00:06:02.699> the<00:06:02.789> fight<00:06:02.969> and

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
from that work later on in the fight and

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.570 
from that work later on in the fight and
I'm<00:06:03.300> talking<00:06:03.509> about<00:06:03.779> eight<00:06:04.169> nine<00:06:04.229> ten<00:06:05.069> ten

championship<00:06:06.180> rounds<00:06:06.509> as<00:06:06.629> we<00:06:06.839> say<00:06:07.020> Doug<00:06:07.229> and

championship rounds as we say Doug and
boxing<00:06:07.800> I<00:06:07.979> think<00:06:08.520> that's<00:06:08.759> when<00:06:09.029> you<00:06:09.180> will<00:06:09.300> see

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
boxing I think that's when you will see

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:11.990 
boxing I think that's when you will see
all<00:06:09.750> of<00:06:10.500> that<00:06:10.649> investment<00:06:11.159> come<00:06:11.520> to<00:06:11.759> a

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
all of that investment come to a

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.149 
all of that investment come to a
situation<00:06:12.569> where<00:06:13.139> it<00:06:13.229> becomes<00:06:13.500> an<00:06:13.770> interest

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
situation where it becomes an interest

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:16.639 
situation where it becomes an interest
in<00:06:14.310> a<00:06:14.759> good<00:06:14.969> side<00:06:15.210> of<00:06:15.240> the<00:06:15.779> mirror<00:06:15.930> all<00:06:16.439> right
