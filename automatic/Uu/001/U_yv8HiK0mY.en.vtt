00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.290
 because everyone should know 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.879
 how to get muscle so first know 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:37.989
 what bodybuilding are going to look for 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:41.860
 it depends on your look at 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.660
 workouts and words serves and how 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.160
 you will work this aspect of their 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.190
 strength 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.120
 our work at age 97 after 65 but who 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.880
 takes small series 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:58.180
 the 3 4 and with almost the match that 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.760
 can solder in seventh volume so there 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.540
 it will be rehearsals that varies between 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.920
 10 to 12 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.750
 he did work at 70.64 sand and max 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.360
 and after there is stamina there is 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:16.320
 worked at 50% of emissions 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.520
 higher then that this is just 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.200
 then one more point against 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:34.300
 the sale has lowered the rights components 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:38.280
 Always always always quiet 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.280
 that I work 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.520
 here we are going to start a series of 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.400
 mass taken volume at 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.009
 developed-lying so series between 10 to 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.710
 12 the petition so his work at 70 75 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.960
 % on max is the right back always 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.229
 if not back pains a thing of phew 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.289
 the cac on the threshold for not getting hurt on 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.789
 will say avoid putting all the 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.890
 world does finally that's everybody 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.140
 do that but it's not too much to put me 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.060
 feet on the ground like that because 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.190
 otherwise it's pretty funny to see 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.660
 if we are well positioned in development 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.010
 lying power if we are well positioned 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.200
 we must not be able to pass his hand 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.430
 under his back so you lie down if 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.739
 you see you can move your hand 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.989
 bucket of water on the lower back there it's 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.850
 bad so what I advise is 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.530
 harder to do that but at least you 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.630
 do not leave it's work the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.280
 feet in the air like that self rights 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.299
 they work their feet up and the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.299
 series knows so here's go 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.100
 so sure 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.840
 fresh
