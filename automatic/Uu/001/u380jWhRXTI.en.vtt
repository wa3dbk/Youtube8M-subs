00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
$30.00 you just saved but this is just

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.070 
$30.00 you just saved but this is just

one of many boards getting an updated
BIOS<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.440> you<00:02:07.560> can<00:02:07.709> get<00:02:07.860> some<00:02:08.039> as<00:02:08.160> low<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.810> $67

catch<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:15.300> overclocking<00:02:16.200> though<00:02:16.380> is

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
catch this overclocking though is

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.500 
catch this overclocking though is
multiplier<00:02:17.400> only<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:17.940> you'll<00:02:18.060> get<00:02:18.270> less

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
multiplier only so you'll get less

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.119 
multiplier only so you'll get less
granular<00:02:18.810> control<00:02:19.410> but<00:02:19.590> hey<00:02:19.680> free

granular control but hey free
overclocking<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:20.910> still<00:02:21.120> overclocking<00:02:21.810> so

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
overclocking is still overclocking so

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.809 
overclocking is still overclocking so

this<00:02:28.950> as<00:02:29.129> well<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:31.560> that's<00:02:31.650> basically<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.280> you

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
this as well but that's basically it you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.910 
this as well but that's basically it you
can<00:02:33.000> get<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.390> cheaper<00:02:33.810> board<00:02:34.050> now<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.530> still

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
can get a cheaper board now and still

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.130 
can get a cheaper board now and still
overclock<00:02:35.340> your<00:02:35.640> value<00:02:36.330> processor<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.080> you

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
overclock your value processor and you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.960 
overclock your value processor and you
can<00:02:37.260> get<00:02:37.379> more<00:02:37.590> gaming<00:02:37.950> performance<00:02:38.580> by<00:02:38.730> like

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
can get more gaming performance by like

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.490 
can get more gaming performance by like
putting<00:02:39.270> them<00:02:39.390> together<00:02:39.510> not<00:02:40.140> quite<00:02:40.319> like

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
putting them together not quite like

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.900 
putting them together not quite like
this<00:02:40.709> there<00:02:40.980> there<00:02:41.220> are<00:02:41.310> guides<00:02:41.520> for<00:02:41.760> how<00:02:41.849> to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
this there there are guides for how to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.460 
this there there are guides for how to
actually<00:02:42.090> put<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.540> CPU<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.080> motherboard

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
actually put a CPU and a motherboard

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.020 
actually put a CPU and a motherboard
that<00:02:43.500> wasn't<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:43.950> anyway<00:02:44.190> thank<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.819> for

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
