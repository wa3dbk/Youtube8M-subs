even additive paint to make the paint
dry<00:00:29.699> fast<00:00:30.109> or<00:00:31.250> in<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.460> case<00:00:32.700> I'm<00:00:32.880> using<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.270> as

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
dry fast or in this case I'm using it as

used to use retouch varnish so every

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.470 
used to use retouch varnish so every
time<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.340> got<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> stage<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> wanted<00:00:39.360> to

a<00:00:50.879> broad<00:00:51.059> brush<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.500> dries<00:00:52.739> within

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
a broad brush and it dries within

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.080 
a broad brush and it dries within
minutes<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:55.010> I've<00:00:56.010> always<00:00:56.250> got<00:00:56.399> my<00:00:56.579> drawing<00:00:56.850> I

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
minutes and I've always got my drawing I

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.209 
minutes and I've always got my drawing I
like<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.329> never<00:00:57.570> lose<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:57.960> drawing<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.800> seal

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
like you never lose my drawing so seal

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.250 
like you never lose my drawing so seal
it<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.539> means<00:01:00.780> there<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.230> I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
it so that that means there and I

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260 
it so that that means there and I
thought<00:01:01.440> well<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.219> use<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.520> that

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
thought well if I can use it for that

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.850 
thought well if I can use it for that
why<00:01:03.750> can't<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:03.989> use<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.379> different<00:01:04.470> stages

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
why can't I use it for different stages

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.890 
why can't I use it for different stages
so<00:01:05.549> when<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> paint<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> face<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> get<00:01:06.780> to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
so when I paint the face and I get to

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.539 
so when I paint the face and I get to
the<00:01:07.020> face<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.260> I'm<00:01:07.500> happy<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.430> then

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the face and I'm happy with it and then

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.550 
the face and I'm happy with it and then
seal<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.750> when<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
seal it and then when I get there the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.109 
seal it and then when I get there the
background<00:01:10.920> done<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.310> see<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> lid<00:01:11.760> or<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.000> I

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
background done I can see a lid or if I

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.940 
background done I can see a lid or if I
get<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.409> do<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.530> nose

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
get to the you know I can do it nose

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.370 
get to the you know I can do it nose
lips<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.299> seal<00:01:15.509> each<00:01:15.689> different

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
lips and I can seal each different

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.910 
lips and I can seal each different
sections<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.360> our<00:01:18.509> safety<00:01:18.780> net<00:01:19.140> now

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
sections so just that our safety net now

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.490 
sections so just that our safety net now
the<00:01:19.979> safety<00:01:20.520> net<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:20.970> me<00:01:21.270> was<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.140> value

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the safety net for me was that the value

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.359 
the safety net for me was that the value
of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.770> safety<00:01:23.130> net<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.420> were<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.900> paint

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
of the safety net is if I were to paint

00:01:25.369 --> 00:02:02.130 
of the safety net is if I were to paint
now<00:01:26.750> let's<00:01:27.750> say<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> wanted<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> paint<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> hair

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.370 

then<00:02:03.140> I'll<00:02:03.229> get<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.440> that<00:02:03.470> stage<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:03.860> think<00:02:04.070> I

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
then I'll get to that stage I think I

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.499 
then I'll get to that stage I think I
don't<00:02:06.380> like

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
don't like

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.110 
don't like
it<00:02:09.020> looks<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.410> fakie<00:02:09.740> and<00:02:09.950> I've<00:02:10.399> done<00:02:10.759> like<00:02:10.910> it

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
it looks to fakie and I've done like it

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.699 
it looks to fakie and I've done like it
what<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:11.810> do<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.880> take<00:02:14.120> water<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.319> you<00:02:15.410> can

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
what you do you take water and you can

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.640 
what you do you take water and you can
leave<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.069> for<00:02:16.370> up<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:17.030> probably<00:02:17.690> half<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.530> day

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
leave this for up to probably half a day

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.830 
leave this for up to probably half a day
or<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.830> day<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.760> if<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.030> need<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.300> even<00:02:20.720> the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
or a day and if you need it to even the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.830 
or a day and if you need it to even the
second<00:02:21.349> day<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.860> use<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.420> unlocking<00:02:23.420> formula

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
second day you use a unlocking formula

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.870 
second day you use a unlocking formula
but<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.140> chemical<00:02:24.620> empty<00:02:25.190> water<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.730> just

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
but a chemical empty water and you just

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.000 
but a chemical empty water and you just
rip<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> spray<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.840> then<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.410> can<00:02:27.530> just<00:02:27.650> take

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
rip the spray and then you can just take

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.699 
rip the spray and then you can just take
it<00:02:28.100> off<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.870> go<00:02:30.050> right<00:02:30.290> back<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:32.709> the

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
it off and you go right back to the

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.340 
it off and you go right back to the
layer<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.160> had<00:02:34.720> if<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.750> sealed<00:02:36.200> it

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
layer that you had if you sealed it

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.199 
layer that you had if you sealed it
before<00:02:36.739> so<00:02:37.280> there's<00:02:37.459> no<00:02:38.420> no<00:02:39.200> risk<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:40.209> mucking

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
before so there's no no risk of mucking

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.009 
before so there's no no risk of mucking
up<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:44.480> take<00:02:44.840> it

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
up you take it

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.760 
up you take it
exactly<00:02:46.299> back<00:02:47.299> to

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.700 

at<00:02:52.130> least<00:02:52.400> on

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
at least on

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.880 
at least on
and<00:02:53.800> that's<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.790> part<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.240> I<00:02:56.050> love<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.860> just

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
and that's the part that I love it just

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.320 
and that's the part that I love it just
gives<00:02:57.520> me<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.270> much<00:02:58.510> more<00:02:58.780> freedom<00:03:00.240> because<00:03:01.240> I

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
gives me so much more freedom because I

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.810 
gives me so much more freedom because I
can<00:03:01.510> experiment<00:03:02.140> with<00:03:02.650> backgrounds<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.670> can

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
can experiment with backgrounds I can

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.600 
can experiment with backgrounds I can
put<00:03:04.030> blue<00:03:04.390> background<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.380> I<00:03:05.530> can<00:03:05.740> put<00:03:05.920> any

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
put blue background and I can put any

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.840 
put blue background and I can put any
color<00:03:06.970> background<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:07.690> want<00:03:11.250> back<00:03:12.250> on<00:03:12.430> here<00:03:12.700> and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
color background I want back on here and

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.090 
color background I want back on here and
I<00:03:12.970> can<00:03:13.150> do<00:03:13.330> that<00:03:13.540> over<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.320> over<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.800> over

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
I can do that over and over and over

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.100 
I can do that over and over and over
again<00:03:15.190> someone<00:03:15.700> said<00:03:15.940> this<00:03:16.060> morning<00:03:16.330> oh<00:03:16.690> it's

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
that's it that's what I love about it is

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.260

that it's you can you know take that
back<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:26.010> exactly<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.130> same<00:03:28.320> place<00:03:29.320> you

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
back to exactly the same place you

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.320 
back to exactly the same place you
started<00:03:29.890> with<00:03:30.040> like<00:03:30.220> when<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:30.790> first<00:03:31.030> started

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
started with like when I first started

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.270 
started with like when I first started
painting<00:03:31.540> at<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.530> end<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.770> the<00:03:32.830> day<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.040> would

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
painting at the end of the day I would

say<00:03:33.490> Toulouse<00:03:33.850> yeah<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.300> wish<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:34.870> could<00:03:35.020> start

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.020 
say Toulouse yeah I wish I could start
my<00:03:35.470> day<00:03:35.530> over<00:03:35.920> again<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.520> know<00:03:36.580> I<00:03:36.640> wish<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:36.880> was

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
my day over again you know I wish I was

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.310 
my day over again you know I wish I was
back<00:03:37.240> to<00:03:37.270> where<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.540> wasn't<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:37.900> walked<00:03:38.080> in<00:03:38.260> the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
back to where I wasn't I walked in the

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.160 
back to where I wasn't I walked in the
studio<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.770> don't<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.190> now<00:03:39.730> I<00:03:39.790> can't<00:03:40.170> that's

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
studio that don't you now I can't that's

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.860 
studio that don't you now I can't that's
what<00:03:41.440> I<00:03:41.470> love<00:03:41.710> about<00:03:41.830> it<00:03:42.300> it's<00:03:43.300> a<00:03:43.360> pretty<00:03:43.540> clear

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
what I love about it it's a pretty clear

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.920 
what I love about it it's a pretty clear
resonant<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.740> so<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.700> can<00:03:45.880> do<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.300> with<00:03:46.600> any

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
resonant and so you can do that with any

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.910 
resonant and so you can do that with any
stage<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.310> painting<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:50.350> thing<00:03:50.590> is<00:03:50.740> when

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
stage of the painting the thing is when

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.340 
stage of the painting the thing is when
when<00:03:51.250> you<00:03:51.370> when<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:51.910> take<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.570> paint<00:03:52.840> out<00:03:53.050> to

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
when you when you take the paint out to

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.480 
when you when you take the paint out to
a<00:03:53.410> section<00:03:54.130> that<00:03:55.140> hasn't<00:03:56.140> got<00:03:56.350> that<00:03:56.800> stuff<00:03:57.190> on

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
a section that hasn't got that stuff on

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.700 
a section that hasn't got that stuff on
this<00:03:58.270> is<00:03:58.450> what<00:03:58.630> happens<00:03:59.640> so<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:01.120> need<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.930> make

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
this is what happens so you need to make

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.610 
this is what happens so you need to make
sure<00:04:02.740> that<00:04:03.040> you<00:04:03.220> put<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.240> on<00:04:04.420> over<00:04:04.720> everywhere

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
sure that you put it on over everywhere

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.230 
sure that you put it on over everywhere
that<00:04:05.830> you<00:04:06.010> lost<00:04:06.250> because<00:04:06.430> if<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:06.850> didn't<00:04:07.150> do

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
that you lost because if I didn't do

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.320 
that you lost because if I didn't do
that<00:04:07.270> properly<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:09.070> would<00:04:09.490> get<00:04:09.640> there<00:04:09.850> the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
that properly I would get there the

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.260 
that properly I would get there the
paint<00:04:10.690> permeating<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.950> canvas<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:12.640> so

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
paint permeating the the canvas and so

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.059 
paint permeating the the canvas and so
now<00:04:13.450> what<00:04:13.870> it<00:04:13.960> means<00:04:14.140> is<00:04:14.290> I

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
now what it means is I

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:33.800 
now what it means is I
stop<00:04:15.700> exactly

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.870 

you
