00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
valuable than Jack was Rogers if Steven

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.490

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
Jackson goes down but I still think at

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.050 
Jackson goes down but I still think at
this<00:02:19.620> point<00:02:19.890> Freeman<00:02:20.280> should<00:02:20.459> just<00:02:20.610> be<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.880> the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
little more fluky a couple of guys to

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.740 
little more fluky a couple of guys to
add<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.069> in<00:03:38.340> even<00:03:38.579> deeper<00:03:38.700> leagues<00:03:39.120> one

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
five percent of league the Rams offense

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.340 
five percent of league the Rams offense
is<00:03:43.920> pretty<00:03:44.160> awful<00:03:44.579> but<00:03:44.819> quick<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.780> maybe<00:03:46.079> one

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
is pretty awful but quick is maybe one

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.870 
is pretty awful but quick is maybe one
of<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.560> only<00:03:46.799> guys<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.459> would<00:03:47.579> kind<00:03:47.760> of

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
get excited about at this point it looks

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.559 
get excited about at this point it looks
like<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.459> Rams<00:03:50.760> are<00:03:50.880> probably<00:03:51.120> be<00:03:51.269> playing

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
like the Rams are probably be playing

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.719 
hurt his fancy numbers but the Jets
offense<00:04:35.990> is<00:04:36.259> a<00:04:36.470> lot<00:04:37.009> better<00:04:37.280> this<00:04:37.520> year

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
offense is a lot better this year

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:38.890 
offense is a lot better this year
they're<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.940> lot<00:04:38.120> more<00:04:38.330> weapons<00:04:38.750> I<00:04:38.870> think

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
they're a lot more weapons I think

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.779 
they're a lot more weapons I think
genome<00:04:39.380> like<00:04:39.919> I've<00:04:40.039> been<00:04:40.160> talking<00:04:40.460> about<00:04:40.520> in

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
genome like I've been talking about in

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.670 
genome like I've been talking about in
previous<00:04:41.090> videos<00:04:41.240> he's<00:04:41.900> gonna<00:04:42.110> take<00:04:42.350> a<00:04:42.410> step

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
previous videos he's gonna take a step

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.680 
previous videos he's gonna take a step
forward<00:04:42.979> this<00:04:43.280> year<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:44.090> do<00:04:44.150> think<00:04:44.570> his

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
forward this year and I do think his

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.650 
forward this year and I do think his
upside<00:04:45.199> overall<00:04:45.800> could<00:04:46.250> put<00:04:46.520> him<00:04:46.699> top<00:04:47.060> 12<00:04:47.419> top

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
upside overall could put him top 12 top

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.499 
upside overall could put him top 12 top

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789

season on a locker he's been banged up
throughout<00:05:05.180> his<00:05:05.360> career<00:05:05.570> you<00:05:06.229> know<00:05:06.349> and<00:05:06.380> I

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
throughout his career you know and I

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.290 
throughout his career you know and I
think<00:05:06.560> last<00:05:07.220> year<00:05:07.460> was<00:05:07.520> kind<00:05:07.759> of<00:05:07.820> the<00:05:07.880> season<00:05:08.060> I

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
think last year was kind of the season I

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.730 
think last year was kind of the season I
was<00:05:08.419> excited<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:08.900> see<00:05:08.960> what<00:05:09.199> he<00:05:09.289> might<00:05:09.320> get<00:05:09.590> to

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
was excited to see what he might get to

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.219 
was excited to see what he might get to
do<00:05:09.860> but<00:05:10.099> he<00:05:10.610> got<00:05:10.789> hurt<00:05:11.030> and<00:05:11.240> this<00:05:11.419> year<00:05:11.690> you

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
do but he got hurt and this year you

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.870 
do but he got hurt and this year you
know<00:05:12.259> hopefully<00:05:12.710> he<00:05:12.979> can<00:05:13.099> stay<00:05:13.310> healthy<00:05:13.490> but<00:05:13.789> I

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
know hopefully he can stay healthy but I

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.240 
know hopefully he can stay healthy but I
do<00:05:13.940> like<00:05:14.240> his<00:05:14.449> upside<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:15.080> he<00:05:15.620> has<00:05:15.770> a<00:05:15.800> couple

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
do like his upside and he has a couple

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.980 
do like his upside and he has a couple
of<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.729> best<00:05:16.940> young<00:05:17.270> receivers<00:05:17.630> in<00:05:17.960> the

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
of the the best young receivers in the

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.950 
of the the best young receivers in the
league<00:05:18.080> so<00:05:18.560> that<00:05:19.010> offense<00:05:19.430> I<00:05:19.610> think<00:05:19.639> is<00:05:20.030> is

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
league so that offense I think is is

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.510 
league so that offense I think is is
headed<00:05:21.320> in<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.530> right<00:05:21.680> direction<00:05:21.740> if<00:05:22.280> Locker

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
headed in the right direction if Locker

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.520 
headed in the right direction if Locker
can<00:05:22.820> stay<00:05:23.030> healthy<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.990> then<00:05:24.080> one<00:05:24.229> pick<00:05:24.409> up

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
can stay healthy and then one pick up

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.140 
can stay healthy and then one pick up
and<00:05:24.650> play<00:05:24.740> defense<00:05:25.130> for<00:05:25.400> you<00:05:25.430> I<00:05:25.550> talked<00:05:25.909> about

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
and play defense for you I talked about

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.790 
and play defense for you I talked about
it<00:05:26.240> earlier<00:05:26.539> as<00:05:26.690> far<00:05:26.900> as<00:05:26.990> how<00:05:27.139> I<00:05:27.169> hate<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.620> Rams

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
it earlier as far as how I hate the Rams

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.469 
it earlier as far as how I hate the Rams
offense<00:05:28.280> so<00:05:28.699> that's<00:05:28.820> what<00:05:29.030> I'm<00:05:29.120> going<00:05:29.360> with

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
offense so that's what I'm going with

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.600 
offense so that's what I'm going with
Tampa<00:05:29.840> Bay<00:05:30.020> as<00:05:30.260> I<00:05:30.740> pick<00:05:31.039> up<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.280> play<00:05:31.400> defense

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.770
