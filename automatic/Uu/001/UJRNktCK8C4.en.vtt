so if y'all want that this is still the
original<00:02:05.759> no<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.630> they<00:02:07.229> had<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.439> from

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
original no I think they had it from

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.279 
original no I think they had it from
what

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
what

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.830 
what
do<00:02:10.770> drinker<00:02:11.099> design<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.730> them<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.150> winner<00:02:12.390> and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
do drinker design to them the winner and

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.170 
do drinker design to them the winner and
then<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.440> think<00:02:13.800> they<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.010> stop<00:02:14.700> putting<00:02:15.000> the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
then I think they just stop putting the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.460 
then I think they just stop putting the
winner<00:02:15.360> on<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.599> box<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.930> he's<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.200> playing

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
winner on the box and he's just playing

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.190 
winner on the box and he's just playing
now<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.010> um<00:02:17.269> that<00:02:18.269> one<00:02:18.390> has<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.690> winner<00:02:18.840> on<00:02:19.019> it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
now but um that one has the winner on it

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.309 
now but um that one has the winner on it
