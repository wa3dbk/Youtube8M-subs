very early stages of the development of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.880 
very early stages of the development of
this<00:00:47.040> training<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:48.210> soon<00:00:48.480> realized<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.650> it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
this training we soon realized that it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.490 
this training we soon realized that it
was<00:00:50.040> becoming<00:00:50.430> bigger<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.120> bigger<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
was becoming bigger and bigger and it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.220 
was becoming bigger and bigger and it
was<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.280> very<00:00:53.519> long<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.960> try<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
was going to be very long then we try to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.500 
was going to be very long then we try to
shorten<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.980> little<00:00:56.010> bit<00:00:56.339> but<00:00:57.120> then<00:00:57.330> we

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
shorten it a little bit but then we

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.790 
shorten it a little bit but then we
thought<00:00:57.540> you<00:00:57.900> know<00:00:57.960> what<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.410> heck<00:00:58.559> let's
