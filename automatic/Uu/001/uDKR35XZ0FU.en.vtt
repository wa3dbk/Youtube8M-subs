00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.900
 in your shot we always 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.269
 wanted to put the see in the center of the game and 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.559
 give him the option of a package the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.849
 possible world around him 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.500
 for stage still miss a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.730
 important feature in the game it's 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.560
 for that we developed them really 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.570
 the idea behind it is precisely him 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.539
 allow to create an entire region with 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.980
 his songs his houses his taverns and 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.210
 the monsters of course that surrounds them 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.619
 it's something that asked us 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.099
 a lot of time for reflection and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.720
 development 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.759
 but I think it's a future that 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.800
 is pretty rare and even unique guys 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.940
 in the world loved so beautiful the idea 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.930
 central or turned really it's from 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.910
 to ensure that players can 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.230
 customize not only content but 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.300
 also the appearance of their haven at 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.829
 world so we found it's absolutely 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.020
 essential that players can 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.910
 change the appearance of their buildings 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.170
 it's like that if you ever 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.190
 want to display loudly the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.739
 brÃ¢kmar colors you will have to your 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.180
 provision directly at stake or on the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.770
 shop skins pack applicable 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.420
 on your different buildings 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.160
 in addition to that we created an empty building 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.090
 fully customizable for him 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.530
 adapts to everyone's desires 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.840
 the eavv goes back are entirely 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.920
 customizable from the building alone 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.720
 going through the monsters that you 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.189
 surround everyone will find his account 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.700
 for example if you like 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.860
 crafts you can create 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.700
 workshops if it's ever the fight 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.020
 which interest you 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.270
 you are free to put any 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.159
 monster of teeth or even created a 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.049
 exclusive dungeon at the harbor in the world 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.240
 if by cons I do not know enough hollow 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.520
 master that makes you dream of a sudden 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.560
 you are free to create a room dedicated to 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.759
 that or so I do not know at dar casino 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.579
 you will be able to create a casino and 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.590
 master of slot machines finally the 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.210
 haven world will look like what you 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.200
 go do it 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.329
 the evolution of the really has based on 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.100
 a single building the guild hall is fine 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.899
 really become the heart of your has 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.659
 really the idea behind is enough 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.369
 simple the more he evolves the more he will you 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.009
 allow to unlock new 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.929
 buildings and so two possibilities 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.880
 the idea being to have a pretty system 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.170
 simple that avoids you to go through 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.420
 different long stages and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.459
 laborious and arrive very quickly 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.959
 a power to customize in fact works 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.369
 what we wanted was that the 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.649
 players can create a real - who 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.989
 matches their desires but the 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.340
 cravings may change over time 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:09.110
 so this time it will be quite 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.940
 possible to move at will 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.340
 different elements already built as 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.810
 you can arrange the arrangement 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.639
 of your buildings two days to the sources 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.889
 so that it is always suitable for 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:20.540
 your needs we know how much 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.760
 wakfu players including gamers 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.400
 love to organize animations that this 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.620
 either competitions pvp fights and 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.989
 with the arrival of the world's harbors in play 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.940
 it's going to be an opportunity for them to have 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.829
 access to a community tool that is 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.139
 really out of the ordinary 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.650
 build with their guild upside down 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.019
 on the ceiling 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.160
 ok we can give access they 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.720
 want and 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.040
 so it's going to be an opportunity for them 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.320
 to set up new 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.020
 animations that could not do 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.280
 so far and we can not wait to see what 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.290
 will give you already have a lot of 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.330
 proposals of the players on the forums 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.370
 original proposals 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.930
 so here we are anxious to see what 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.230
 wanted to see you're going to be able to do 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.550
 of this brand new tool and what kind of 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.800
 haven world you will be able to put 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.180
 on foot that we will evolve your 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.370
 world's admission will require a big 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.050
 investment to your entire guild that 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.060
 be it ankama or in resources 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.680
 any game resource 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.340
 matter its level and its rarity you 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.050
 will be helpful 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.490
 we wanted your guild to be 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.350
 rewarded for the efforts she has 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.420
 provided that's why bonuses 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.610
 will be available with the buildings 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.560
 for example bonuses in defense or in 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.450
 attack even life points these 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.530
 bonus will be applied in the harbor at 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.800
 world but some are also 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.910
 available in the whole world 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.500
 with the really we have sought to 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.910
 put even more see them in the center of 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.110
 game and as you understood you 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.270
 will be able to do what you 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.680
 wish this is however only a beginning 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.200
 and we hope your returns will 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.090
 allow us to improve this fisher 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.980
 and who knows maybe we're going 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.980
 impacted the entire world with it
