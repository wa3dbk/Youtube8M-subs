the visibility icon okay that is your
new<00:00:31.590> ghost<00:00:32.399> mode<00:00:32.790> feature<00:00:33.140> what<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.230> will<00:00:34.320> do

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
new ghost mode feature what it will do

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.869 
new ghost mode feature what it will do
is<00:00:34.469> not<00:00:34.770> only<00:00:34.890> give<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.129> a<00:00:35.280> 50-percent

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
is not only give it a 50-percent

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.670 
is not only give it a 50-percent
transparency<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.350> don't<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.560> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
transparency so that you don't have to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.170 
transparency so that you don't have to
worry<00:00:37.890> about<00:00:38.040> working<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.700> shaders<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
worry about working with shaders and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.200 
worry about working with shaders and
such<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.770> quickly<00:00:41.010> create<00:00:41.910> transparency

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
such you can quickly create transparency

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.430 
such you can quickly create transparency
and<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.989> also<00:00:43.520> alt<00:00:44.520> click<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:46.290> create

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and you can also alt click to create

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.350 
and you can also alt click to create
transparency<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.250> everything<00:00:47.640> else<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.239> it's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
transparency for everything else so it's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.090 
transparency for everything else so it's
much<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.140> alt<00:00:49.620> click<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.010> the

much like the alt click on the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.650 
much like the alt click on the
visibility<00:00:50.579> icon<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.300> will<00:00:51.329> make<00:00:51.570> your

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
visibility icon it will make your

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.380 
visibility icon it will make your
advanced<00:00:51.870> invisible<00:00:52.910> okay<00:00:53.910> or<00:00:54.180> hide

post tool I'm going to go to
orthographic<00:01:26.070> view<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.020> say

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.050 

be<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.530> kind<00:01:32.530> of<00:01:32.620> funnel<00:01:32.830> view<00:01:33.130> here<00:01:33.310> all<00:01:33.880> right

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
be a kind of funnel view here all right

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.020 
be a kind of funnel view here all right
so<00:01:34.300> I'm<00:01:34.420> going<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.600> zoom<00:01:34.660> in<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:36.160> show<00:01:36.850> that

you can work through it where before you

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.220 
you can work through it where before you
know<00:01:39.400> there's<00:01:39.580> no<00:01:39.730> possibility<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.600> doing

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
know there's no possibility of doing

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.990 
know there's no possibility of doing
this<00:01:41.410> van<00:01:41.680> will<00:01:41.920> see<00:01:42.100> where<00:01:42.370> it's<00:01:42.580> going<00:01:42.820> to

this van will see where it's going to

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.420 
this van will see where it's going to
poke<00:01:43.270> through<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.530> transform<00:01:45.100> at<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.310> same

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
poke through and transform at the same
