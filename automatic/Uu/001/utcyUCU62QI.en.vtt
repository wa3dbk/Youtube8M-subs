can finally the pres-n-snap tool if
you're<00:00:15.540> using<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.990> anvil<00:00:16.440> tools<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.980> showing

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
you're using the anvil tools is showing

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.740 
you're using the anvil tools is showing
here<00:00:17.609> you'll<00:00:17.820> need<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.970> punch<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.390> hole<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
here you'll need to punch a hole in the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.960 
here you'll need to punch a hole in the
material<00:00:19.230> first<00:00:19.500> we've<00:00:20.160> gone<00:00:20.400> through<00:00:20.730> both

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
material first we've gone through both

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.090 
material first we've gone through both
layers<00:00:21.300> with<00:00:21.750> just<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.080> single<00:00:22.470> hole<00:00:22.650> punched

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
layers with just a single hole punched

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.439 
layers with just a single hole punched
because<00:00:23.490> that's<00:00:23.640> where<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.910> snap<00:00:24.210> will<00:00:24.420> be

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
because that's where that snap will be

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.089 
because that's where that snap will be
installed<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:25.050> both<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.410> top<00:00:25.590> layer<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
installed on both the top layer and the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.279 
installed on both the top layer and the
bottom<00:00:26.130> layer<00:00:26.539> okay<00:00:27.539> take<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> look<00:00:28.050> at<00:00:28.170> this

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
bottom layer okay take a look at this

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.710 
bottom layer okay take a look at this
button<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.220> button<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.670> says<00:00:30.000> pull<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
button on the button it says pull the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.020 
button on the button it says pull the
dot<00:00:31.130> traditionally<00:00:32.130> speaking<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.700> want<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
dot traditionally speaking we want the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.790 
dot traditionally speaking we want the
dot<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.480> be<00:00:33.600> facing<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> direction<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.649> that

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
dot to be facing the direction that that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.700 
dot to be facing the direction that that
snap<00:00:35.190> will<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.640> snap<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.809> we'll<00:00:37.079> position<00:00:37.260> that

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
snap will on snap so we'll position that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.590 
snap will on snap so we'll position that
dot<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.610> facing<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.180> edge<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.510> this

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
dot so that it's facing the edge of this

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.090 
dot so that it's facing the edge of this
fabric<00:00:39.930> that's<00:00:40.379> where<00:00:40.710> I'm<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> have

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
fabric that's where I'm going to have

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.610 
fabric that's where I'm going to have
this<00:00:41.489> snap<00:00:41.790> unsnap<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.020> other<00:00:43.170> three<00:00:43.440> sides

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
this snap unsnap the other three sides

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.720 
this snap unsnap the other three sides
will<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:44.040> locked<00:00:46.039> there<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.219> go<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.520> dots

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
will be locked there we go the dots

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.900 
will be locked there we go the dots
facing<00:00:48.239> towards<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.570> bottom<00:00:48.930> edge<00:00:49.730> okay<00:00:50.730> now

facing towards the bottom edge okay now

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.389 
facing towards the bottom edge okay now
we'll<00:00:51.120> take<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.539> socket<00:00:52.110> you'll<00:00:52.530> notice<00:00:52.890> in

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
we'll take the socket you'll notice in

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.549 
we'll take the socket you'll notice in
the<00:00:53.640> inside<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.210> socket<00:00:54.690> there<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> hole

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the inside of the socket there is a hole

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.490 
the inside of the socket there is a hole
that<00:00:56.370> hole<00:00:56.789> has<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.180> little<00:00:57.629> finger<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.109> the

that hole has a little finger on the
backside<00:00:59.780> where<00:01:00.780> there's<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.350> finger<00:01:01.680> you

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
backside where there's the finger you

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.900 
backside where there's the finger you
can<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.190> right<00:01:02.370> there

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
can see it right there

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.600 
can see it right there
okay<00:01:03.480> that's<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.080> part<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.100> want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.460> be

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
okay that's the part that you want to be

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.670 
okay that's the part that you want to be
facing<00:01:05.880> towards<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> dot<00:01:07.049> or<00:01:07.380> towards<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
facing towards the dot or towards the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.990 
facing towards the dot or towards the
edge<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> material<00:01:08.369> where<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.520> want<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.820> pull

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
edge of material where you want to pull

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.630 
edge of material where you want to pull
apart<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.960> always<00:01:10.140> think<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> space<00:01:11.460> in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
apart so always think of the space in

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.609 
apart so always think of the space in
the<00:01:11.700> center<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.150> pulling<00:01:12.540> apart<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.500> on

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the center is pulling apart and then on

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.010 
the center is pulling apart and then on
the<00:01:13.710> other<00:01:13.740> side<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.369> rotated<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.150> socket

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the other side I rotated this socket

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.600 
the other side I rotated this socket
around<00:01:16.320> there's<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:16.920> finger<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
around there's a little finger on the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.359 
around there's a little finger on the
inside<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.869> snap<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.619> finger<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
inside of the snap that finger is the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.490 
inside of the snap that finger is the
locking<00:01:20.580> mechanism<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.840> will<00:01:22.140> lock<00:01:22.320> me

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
locking mechanism so it will lock me

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.140 
locking mechanism so it will lock me
lock<00:01:22.710> there<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.310> locked<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.970> two

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
lock there and locked on the two

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.510 
lock there and locked on the two
opposite<00:01:24.600> sides<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> finger<00:01:25.530> okay<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
opposite sides of the finger okay so

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.240 
opposite sides of the finger okay so
remember<00:01:26.820> there's<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.869> prong<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.979> that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
remember there's a prong here and that

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.590 
remember there's a prong here and that
prong<00:01:29.549> we're<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:29.970> facing<00:01:30.210> towards

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
prong we're going to be facing towards

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.149 
prong we're going to be facing towards
this<00:01:30.780> edge<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.259> fabric<00:01:31.470> that's<00:01:31.920> where

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
this edge of this fabric that's where

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.700 
this edge of this fabric that's where
we're<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.400> pull<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.880> snap<00:01:33.329> apart<00:01:33.810> so

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
we're going to pull this snap apart so

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.560 
we're going to pull this snap apart so
position<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.430> snap<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> tricky<00:01:36.540> part

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
position that snap this is a tricky part

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.149 
position that snap this is a tricky part
because<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.110> got<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.470> these<00:01:37.650> facing<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
because you got to have these facing the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.219 
because you got to have these facing the
right<00:01:38.310> direction<00:01:38.750> position<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.079> that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
right direction position that so that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.080 
right direction position that so that

the the eyelet barrel then again we take

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.379 
the the eyelet barrel then again we take
our<00:03:03.409> anvil<00:03:03.829> now<00:03:04.069> this<00:03:04.310> time<00:03:04.519> we<00:03:04.669> use<00:03:04.849> the<00:03:05.150> side

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
our anvil now this time we use the side

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.659 
our anvil now this time we use the side
that<00:03:05.629> is<00:03:05.780> not<00:03:05.810> concave<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.829> looks<00:03:07.250> like<00:03:07.430> that

that is not concave that looks like that

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.330 
that is not concave that looks like that
I<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.719> eyelet<00:03:09.079> would<00:03:09.230> fit<00:03:09.439> very<00:03:09.590> well<00:03:09.859> on<00:03:10.069> this

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
I the eyelet would fit very well on this

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.039 
I the eyelet would fit very well on this
is<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.549> concave<00:03:10.939> side<00:03:11.000> don't<00:03:11.419> use<00:03:11.599> that<00:03:11.750> side

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
is the concave side don't use that side

is the concave side don't use that side
use<00:03:12.769> this<00:03:13.099> side<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:15.109> we<00:03:15.829> position<00:03:16.340> it

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
use this side and we position it

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.459 
use this side and we position it
underneath<00:03:16.849> our<00:03:17.030> material<00:03:17.569> and<00:03:18.109> we<00:03:18.230> make<00:03:18.439> sure

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:18.469 
underneath our material and we make sure

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.189 
underneath our material and we make sure

this snap can also be installed with a

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.080 
this snap can also be installed with a
two-piece<00:04:03.620> snap<00:04:03.950> fastener<00:04:04.580> this<00:04:04.760> is<00:04:04.910> the

installation tool with the pres-n-snap

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.980 
installation tool with the pres-n-snap
tool<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.580> still<00:04:10.850> use<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.210> same<00:04:11.480> button

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
tool you still use the same button

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.190 
tool you still use the same button
however<00:04:12.830> you<00:04:13.310> do<00:04:13.490> need<00:04:13.640> a<00:04:13.700> one-way<00:04:14.300> socket<00:04:14.990> die

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
however you do need a one-way socket die

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.260 
however you do need a one-way socket die
a<00:04:15.230> special<00:04:15.920> one<00:04:16.100> way<00:04:16.280> to<00:04:16.340> socket<00:04:16.910> die<00:04:17.060> which

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
a special one way to socket die which

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.870 
a special one way to socket die which
has<00:04:17.420> a<00:04:17.450> flat<00:04:17.840> side<00:04:18.140> here<00:04:18.739> this<00:04:19.370> die<00:04:19.610> is<00:04:19.670> not

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
has a flat side here this die is not

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.850 
has a flat side here this die is not
does<00:04:20.690> not<00:04:20.840> come<00:04:21.140> with<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.440> pres-n-snap<00:04:21.680> tool

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
does not come with the pres-n-snap tool

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.710 
does not come with the pres-n-snap tool
so<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:22.580> need<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:22.820> purchase<00:04:23.000> it<00:04:23.300> separately

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
so you need to purchase it separately

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.920 
so you need to purchase it separately
and<00:04:24.080> you<00:04:24.740> can<00:04:24.890> see<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.700> socket<00:04:26.390> fits<00:04:26.600> on<00:04:26.780> there

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
and you can see the socket fits on there

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.160 
and you can see the socket fits on there
very<00:04:27.200> nicely<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:27.860> will<00:04:27.980> not<00:04:28.130> fall<00:04:28.400> off<00:04:28.430> easily

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
very nicely and will not fall off easily

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.660 
very nicely and will not fall off easily
so<00:04:30.170> there's<00:04:30.380> a<00:04:30.440> flat<00:04:30.710> side<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.370> socket

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
so there's a flat side to the socket

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.040 
so there's a flat side to the socket
which<00:04:32.030> needs<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.330> be<00:04:32.390> purchased<00:04:32.870> separately

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
which needs to be purchased separately

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.530 
which needs to be purchased separately
for<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.560> pressing<00:04:33.830> stamp<00:04:34.220> tool<00:04:34.550> it<00:04:35.090> installs

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
for the pressing stamp tool it installs

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.070 
for the pressing stamp tool it installs
exactly<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.260> same<00:04:36.470> way<00:04:36.710> that<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.190> other

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
exactly the same way that the other

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.500 
exactly the same way that the other
socket<00:04:39.080> does<00:04:39.380> socket<00:04:40.190> diagonals<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.790> notice

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
socket does socket diagonals and notice

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.970 
socket does socket diagonals and notice
you<00:04:41.600> can<00:04:41.750> roll<00:04:41.960> it<00:04:42.110> around<00:04:42.230> to<00:04:42.650> get<00:04:42.770> that

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
you can roll it around to get that

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.400 
you can roll it around to get that
little<00:04:43.310> finger<00:04:43.730> on<00:04:44.150> whichever<00:04:44.570> side<00:04:44.840> that<00:04:45.170> you

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
little finger on whichever side that you

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.400 
little finger on whichever side that you
want<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.800> snap<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.610> release<00:04:47.000> so<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.780> can<00:04:48.170> roll

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
want the snap to release so you can roll

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.030 
want the snap to release so you can roll
the<00:04:48.620> socket<00:04:49.130> to<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.610> outside<00:04:50.390> or<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:50.690> inside

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
the socket to the outside or the inside

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.770 
the socket to the outside or the inside
now<00:04:52.040> to<00:04:52.580> install<00:04:53.030> this<00:04:53.240> we're<00:04:53.450> going<00:04:53.570> to<00:04:53.630> take

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
now to install this we're going to take

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.270 
now to install this we're going to take
the<00:04:53.960> button<00:04:54.320> and<00:04:54.470> we're<00:04:54.590> going<00:04:54.710> to<00:04:54.740> see<00:04:55.100> where

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
the button and we're going to see where

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.830 
the button and we're going to see where
it<00:04:55.370> says<00:04:55.550> dot<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.360> we're<00:04:56.510> going<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.720> take<00:04:56.810> a

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
it says dot and we're going to take a

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.170 
it says dot and we're going to take a
permanent<00:04:57.140> marker<00:04:57.710> roll<00:04:58.340> this<00:04:58.610> button<00:04:58.970> over

permanent marker roll this button over
and<00:04:59.480> put<00:04:59.840> a<00:04:59.870> dot<00:05:00.140> right<00:05:01.010> on<00:05:01.070> that<00:05:01.340> side<00:05:01.580> because

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
and put a dot right on that side because

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.040 
and put a dot right on that side because
this<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.150> side<00:05:02.360> you're<00:05:02.540> going<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.720> see<00:05:02.930> in

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
this is the side you're going to see in

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.110 
this is the side you're going to see in
the<00:05:03.140> press<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.560> snap<00:05:03.770> tool<00:05:04.070> you<00:05:04.550> will<00:05:04.760> not<00:05:04.940> be

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
the press and snap tool you will not be

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.420 
the press and snap tool you will not be
able<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.360> see<00:05:05.600> where<00:05:06.140> it<00:05:06.200> is<00:05:06.290> marked<00:05:06.620> dot<00:05:06.890> so

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
able to see where it is marked dot so

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.570 
able to see where it is marked dot so
that's<00:05:07.670> why<00:05:07.790> we<00:05:07.910> put<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.120> mark<00:05:08.660> there<00:05:08.780> then

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
that's why we put a mark there then

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.530 
that's why we put a mark there then
insert<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.850> socket<00:05:11.630> on<00:05:12.370> that<00:05:13.370> special<00:05:14.000> socket

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
insert the socket on that special socket

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.040 
insert the socket on that special socket
die<00:05:15.160> okay<00:05:16.160> and<00:05:16.400> then<00:05:17.000> we<00:05:17.150> roll<00:05:17.390> it<00:05:17.540> around<00:05:17.840> to

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
die okay and then we roll it around to

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.720 
die okay and then we roll it around to
the<00:05:18.080> fingers<00:05:18.620> on<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:18.980> inside<00:05:19.310> because<00:05:19.550> that's

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
the fingers on the inside because that's

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.970 
the fingers on the inside because that's
where<00:05:19.970> our<00:05:20.000> we<00:05:20.840> were<00:05:20.990> we<00:05:21.230> want<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.560> snap<00:05:21.770> to

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
where our we were we want the snap to

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.960 
where our we were we want the snap to
release<00:05:22.250> so<00:05:22.400> you<00:05:22.430> have<00:05:22.580> to<00:05:22.700> think<00:05:22.850> this

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
release so you have to think this
