00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
small as you can see this is pretty much

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.399 
small as you can see this is pretty much
it<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.780> counters<00:01:58.229> are<00:01:58.469> average

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
but the Blendtec fits right underneath

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.889 
but the Blendtec fits right underneath

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
underneath the counter it won't be a big

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:07.410 
underneath the counter it won't be a big
problem

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
problem

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.070 
problem
the<00:02:07.689> Vitamix<00:02:08.319> was<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:09.250> big<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.720> wouldn't

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
the Vitamix was so big that it wouldn't

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
fit under any of my counter so I had to

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.990 
fit under any of my counter so I had to
take<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.110> apart<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:15.010> just<00:02:15.250> looked<00:02:15.489> really<00:02:15.610> ugly

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
take it apart it just looked really ugly

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
in my kitchen but that was something I

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.650 
in my kitchen but that was something I
looked<00:02:18.220> past<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:18.580> my<00:02:18.670> first<00:02:18.910> body<00:02:19.150> because<00:02:19.480> hey

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
looked past on my first body because hey

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.930 
looked past on my first body because hey
you<00:02:19.720> spend<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.739> much<00:02:20.799> money<00:02:21.280> on<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.489> blender

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
and you're gonna fool yourself into

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.380 
and you're gonna fool yourself into
thinking<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:24.400> doesn't<00:02:24.790> matter<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.120> it

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
thinking it doesn't matter that it

you can clean it so much easier the
Vitamix<00:03:29.019> I<00:03:29.260> wish<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.739> still<00:03:29.950> had<00:03:30.010> kept<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.579> and

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
Vitamix I wish I still had kept it and

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.640 
Vitamix I wish I still had kept it and
made<00:03:30.819> a<00:03:30.849> video<00:03:31.060> while<00:03:31.389> I<00:03:31.419> still<00:03:31.720> had<00:03:31.959> it<00:03:32.169> but<00:03:32.410> I

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
made a video while I still had it but I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.770 
made a video while I still had it but I
wanted<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.280> return<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:34.060> Vitamix<00:03:34.569> has<00:03:34.750> a

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
wanted to return it the Vitamix has a

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.800 
wanted to return it the Vitamix has a
base<00:03:35.079> that<00:03:35.500> is<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:35.950> tiny<00:03:36.459> in<00:03:36.819> there<00:03:37.060> hold<00:03:37.690> on

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
base that is so tiny in there hold on

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.960 
base that is so tiny in there hold on
one<00:03:37.989> second<00:03:38.319> let's<00:03:38.590> say<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.919> Vitamix<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.849> a

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
one second let's say the Vitamix is a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.659 
one second let's say the Vitamix is a
little<00:03:40.450> bit<00:03:40.630> wider<00:03:41.200> than<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:42.130> Cup<00:03:42.430> at<00:03:42.579> the

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
little bit wider than this Cup at the

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.909 
little bit wider than this Cup at the
bottom<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.510> Vitamix<00:03:43.959> has<00:03:44.109> a<00:03:44.169> very<00:03:44.530> large

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
bottom the Vitamix has a very large

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.159 
bottom the Vitamix has a very large
opening<00:03:45.669> at<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.790> top<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.510> then<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.019> gets

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
opening at the top and then it gets

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.039 
opening at the top and then it gets
smaller<00:03:47.650> as<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.040> go<00:03:48.220> down<00:03:48.579> you<00:03:48.910> can<00:03:49.660> see<00:03:49.870> this

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
smaller as you go down you can see this

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.360 
smaller as you go down you can see this
by<00:03:50.200> looking<00:03:50.230> at<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.680> pictures<00:03:51.130> of<00:03:51.160> the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
by looking at the pictures of the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.150 
by looking at the pictures of the
Vitamix<00:03:51.819> and<00:03:52.090> it<00:03:52.720> may<00:03:52.870> not<00:03:53.019> seem<00:03:53.349> that<00:03:53.410> small

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
Vitamix and it may not seem that small

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.150 
Vitamix and it may not seem that small
but<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:54.819> is<00:03:54.940> because<00:03:55.750> when<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.560> look<00:03:56.769> into<00:03:57.010> a

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
but it is because when you look into a

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.580 
but it is because when you look into a
Vitamix<00:03:57.790> it's<00:03:58.060> so<00:03:58.359> small<00:03:58.750> it's<00:03:59.079> got<00:03:59.260> five
