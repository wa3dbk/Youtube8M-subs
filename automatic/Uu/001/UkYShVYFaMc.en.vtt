differences<00:02:19.830> between<00:02:20.069> these<00:02:20.489> are<00:02:20.879> that<00:02:21.030> I

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
differences between these are that I

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.089 
differences between these are that I
find<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> urban<00:02:22.140> decay<00:02:22.260> one<00:02:22.709> truly

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
find that the urban decay one truly

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.220 
find that the urban decay one truly
prolongs<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.269> wear<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.510> my<00:02:24.629> makeup<00:02:24.870> if<00:02:25.110> I'm

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
prolongs the wear of my makeup if I'm

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.500 
prolongs the wear of my makeup if I'm
going<00:02:25.560> out<00:02:25.739> for<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.129> night<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.209> what<00:02:27.390> I'll

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
going out for a night this is what I'll

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.930 
going out for a night this is what I'll
use<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.470> do<00:02:28.530> find<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.159> for<00:02:29.400> an<00:02:29.459> everyday

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
use but I do find that for an everyday

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.500 
use but I do find that for an everyday
kind<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:31.280> finishing<00:02:32.280> touch<00:02:32.579> NYX<00:02:33.239> works

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
kind of like finishing touch NYX works

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.960 
kind of like finishing touch NYX works
just<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.989> little<00:02:34.560> bit<00:02:34.739> better<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.310> me<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.730> it's

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
just a little bit better for me and it's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.809 
just a little bit better for me and it's
weird<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:37.019> don't<00:02:37.440> know<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:37.799> just<00:02:38.010> think<00:02:38.549> that

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
weird but I don't know I just think that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.729 
weird but I don't know I just think that
it's<00:02:39.150> slightly<00:02:39.450> more<00:02:39.659> hydrating<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.530> feels

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
it's slightly more hydrating it feels

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.229 
it's slightly more hydrating it feels
more<00:02:41.040> cooling<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.579> skin<00:02:41.700> it's<00:02:42.060> more

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
more cooling on the skin it's more

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.899 
more cooling on the skin it's more
comfortable<00:02:42.750> I'm<00:02:43.200> not<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.159> urban<00:02:44.790> decay

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
comfortable I'm not that the urban decay

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.670 
comfortable I'm not that the urban decay
one<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.329> uncomfortable<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:46.170> think<00:02:46.560> that

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
one is uncomfortable I just think that

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.500 
one is uncomfortable I just think that
this<00:02:46.829> one<00:02:47.010> truly<00:02:47.250> adds<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.790> little<00:02:48.000> bit<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.209> life

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
this one truly adds a little bit of life

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.690 
this one truly adds a little bit of life
back<00:02:48.780> into<00:02:48.959> my<00:02:49.109> skin<00:02:49.349> adds<00:02:49.590> some<00:02:49.859> moisture<00:02:50.459> and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
back into my skin adds some moisture and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.630 
back into my skin adds some moisture and
my<00:02:51.329> skin<00:02:51.690> still<00:02:52.230> looks<00:02:52.260> matte<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.400> just

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
my skin still looks matte but it just

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.430 
my skin still looks matte but it just
looks<00:02:53.910> healthier<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.900> looks<00:02:55.079> more<00:02:55.260> like

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
looks healthier and it looks more like

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.440 
looks healthier and it looks more like
skin<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:55.769> less<00:02:56.069> like<00:02:56.250> powder<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:57.180> will

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
skin and less like powder it will

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.089 
skin and less like powder it will
slightly<00:02:57.720> prolong<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.500> wear<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.650> your<00:02:58.769> makeup

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
but I can safely say that I can go for

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.979 
but I can safely say that I can go for
16<00:03:02.459> hours<00:03:02.700> with<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.299> Chill<00:03:03.510> makeup<00:03:03.810> setting

it's<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.440> not<00:03:07.620> gonna<00:03:07.829> look<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:08.220> good<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.700> would

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
it's just not gonna look as good I would

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.970 
it's just not gonna look as good I would
say<00:03:08.909> that<00:03:09.239> this<00:03:09.359> really<00:03:09.629> prolongs<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.829> wear

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
say that this really prolongs the wear

that aspect it's not that much of a
price<00:04:09.030> difference<00:04:09.329> it's<00:04:09.840> still<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.079> big<00:04:10.379> one

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
price difference it's still a big one

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.949 
price difference it's still a big one
but<00:04:11.040> it's<00:04:11.310> not<00:04:11.879> as<00:04:12.060> much<00:04:12.239> as<00:04:12.449> you<00:04:12.629> know<00:04:12.750> this

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
one is eight and this one is 29 that's a

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.620 
one is eight and this one is 29 that's a
huge<00:04:16.919> huge<00:04:17.280> jump<00:04:17.760> but<00:04:18.269> there's<00:04:18.449> also

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
huge huge jump but there's also

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.180 
huge huge jump but there's also
difference<00:04:19.139> in<00:04:19.260> quantity<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.829> did<00:04:20.010> want<00:04:20.160> to

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
difference in quantity so I did want to

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.310 
difference in quantity so I did want to
point<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.519> out<00:04:20.579> as<00:04:20.849> well<00:04:21.000> if<00:04:21.599> I<00:04:21.870> had<00:04:22.169> to

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
point that out as well if I had to

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.390 
point that out as well if I had to
choose<00:04:22.560> one<00:04:22.620> um<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.940> would<00:04:24.390> probably<00:04:24.419> say

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
choose one um I would probably say

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.010 
choose one um I would probably say
that<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.729> would<00:04:26.090> go<00:04:26.270> with<00:04:26.419> this<00:04:26.570> one<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:26.990> just

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
that I would go with this one I just

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.810 
that I would go with this one I just
think<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:27.590> really<00:04:27.620> gets<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.070> job<00:04:28.160> done

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
think it really gets the job done

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.629 
think it really gets the job done
I<00:04:28.850> think<00:04:29.600> that<00:04:29.930> while<00:04:30.320> this<00:04:30.590> one<00:04:30.830> almost<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.460> me

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
I think that while this one almost to me

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.730 
I think that while this one almost to me
feels<00:04:31.940> slightly<00:04:32.330> more<00:04:32.690> luxurious<00:04:32.930> on<00:04:33.620> the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
feels slightly more luxurious on the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.909 
feels slightly more luxurious on the
skin<00:04:34.039> and<00:04:34.250> more<00:04:34.789> like<00:04:34.970> a<00:04:35.000> treat<00:04:35.449> for<00:04:35.630> myself

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
skin and more like a treat for myself

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.020 
skin and more like a treat for myself
for<00:04:36.919> like<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.100> special<00:04:37.460> night<00:04:37.610> out<00:04:37.759> or

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
for like a special night out or

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.629 
for like a special night out or
something<00:04:38.449> I<00:04:38.660> think<00:04:39.199> that<00:04:39.350> this<00:04:39.590> one<00:04:39.919> gets<00:04:40.430> the

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
something I think that this one gets the

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.820 
something I think that this one gets the
job<00:04:40.820> done<00:04:40.880> it<00:04:41.330> makes<00:04:41.509> me<00:04:41.690> feel<00:04:42.050> comfortable

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
job done it makes me feel comfortable

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.550 
job done it makes me feel comfortable
with<00:04:43.039> my<00:04:43.190> makeup<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:43.789> it<00:04:44.690> does<00:04:45.169> everything

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
with my makeup and it does everything

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.820 
with my makeup and it does everything
right<00:04:45.949> so<00:04:46.370> I<00:04:46.639> just<00:04:47.120> don't<00:04:47.270> see<00:04:47.600> why<00:04:47.990> not<00:04:48.020> this

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830
