00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
techniques and one of them was this

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.410 
techniques and one of them was this
ability<00:01:07.159> with<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.549> flower<00:01:07.820> on<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.090> this

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
ability with the flower on it this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.149 
ability with the flower on it this
flower<00:01:08.630> seems<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.470> have<00:01:09.620> some<00:01:09.799> kind<00:01:09.920> of<00:01:10.010> a

sleeping<00:01:10.610> like<00:01:10.760> knockout<00:01:11.210> kind<00:01:11.450> of

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
sleeping like knockout kind of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.660 
sleeping like knockout kind of
properties<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.140> that's<00:01:12.710> um<00:01:13.040> when<00:01:13.520> that

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
properties and that's um when that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.300 
properties and that's um when that
happened<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.270> like<00:01:14.330> um<00:01:14.740> he<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:15.979> know<00:01:16.070> did

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
happened and like um he you know did

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.010 
happened and like um he you know did
like<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.610> fire<00:01:16.820> fire<00:01:17.240> building<00:01:17.540> like<00:01:17.930> you

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
like the fire fire building like you

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.469 
like the fire fire building like you
know<00:01:18.110> eternal<00:01:18.530> flame<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.549> know<00:01:19.670> burn<00:01:20.299> the

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
know eternal flame to you know burn the

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:21.670 
know eternal flame to you know burn the
forest<00:01:20.659> that<00:01:20.930> was<00:01:21.050> pretty<00:01:21.320> much<00:01:21.500> do

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
forest that was pretty much do

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.920 
forest that was pretty much do
exponentially<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:22.640> know<00:01:22.760> increase<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.570> rate

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
exponentially you know increase the rate

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.320 
exponentially you know increase the rate
of<00:01:23.960> how<00:01:24.230> fast<00:01:24.650> you<00:01:25.040> know<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.850> sleeping

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
of how fast you know the sleeping

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.230 
of how fast you know the sleeping
properties<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:27.320> know<00:01:27.410> spread<00:01:27.860> out<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.370> that

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
properties you know spread out and that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.790 
properties you know spread out and that
pretty<00:01:29.390> much<00:01:29.510> knocked<00:01:29.900> out<00:01:30.080> all<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.410> kages

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
pretty much knocked out all the kages

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.950 
pretty much knocked out all the kages
except<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.190> citric<00:01:31.550> rj<00:01:31.940> and<00:01:32.150> that<00:01:32.570> opened<00:01:32.900> a

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
except the citric rj and that opened a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.690 
except the citric rj and that opened a
pathway<00:01:33.410> it's<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.740> know<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:33.950> flashback<00:01:34.550> for

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
pathway it's you know a flashback for

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.010 
pathway it's you know a flashback for
the<00:01:34.760> city<00:01:34.940> cog<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.330> I'm<00:01:35.450> not<00:01:35.600> really<00:01:35.750> going<00:01:35.960> to

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
the city cog a I'm not really going to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.380 
the city cog a I'm not really going to
go<00:01:36.140> into<00:01:36.290> detail<00:01:36.710> about<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:36.980> you<00:01:37.310> know

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
go into detail about that you know

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.490 
go into detail about that you know
background<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.630> know<00:01:38.690> that<00:01:38.870> flashback<00:01:39.110> is

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
background you know that flashback is

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.140 
background you know that flashback is
pretty<00:01:39.680> much<00:01:39.830> just<00:01:40.010> a<00:01:41.800> like<00:01:42.800> a<00:01:42.850> like<00:01:43.850> a
