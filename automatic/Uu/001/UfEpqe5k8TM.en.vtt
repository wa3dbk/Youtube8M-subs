money especially for a student um so

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.600 
money especially for a student um so
yeah<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:22.049> what<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.979> build<00:01:23.189> steel

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
yeah we what we do we build steel

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.490 
yeah we what we do we build steel
springs<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.240> transport<00:01:24.689> truck<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.409> it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
springs for transport truck so it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.200 
springs for transport truck so it
involves<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.920> lot<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.100> heavy<00:01:26.340> lifting<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.030> hot

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
involves a lot of heavy lifting in a hot

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.810 
involves a lot of heavy lifting in a hot
environment<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.009> this<00:01:29.009> factories<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
environment and this factories and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.039 
environment and this factories and
climate<00:01:30.180> controlled<00:01:31.250> so<00:01:32.450> what<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.479> means<00:01:33.840> is

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
climate controlled so what that means is

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.289 
climate controlled so what that means is
like<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.920> will<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.159> fans<00:01:35.490> blowing<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.150> us
