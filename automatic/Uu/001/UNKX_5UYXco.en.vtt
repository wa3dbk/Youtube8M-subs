00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
video here because I actually have

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.990 
video here because I actually have
something<00:00:25.980> else<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.160> say<00:00:26.220> name<00:00:26.580> at<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.760> end<00:00:26.910> of

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
something else to say name at the end of

something else to say name at the end of
the<00:00:27.060> video<00:00:27.269> I'd<00:00:27.900> like<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.140> start<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.439> point

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the video I'd like to start this point

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.880 
the video I'd like to start this point
because<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.189> something<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.820> think<00:00:29.880> is

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
because it is something that I think is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.410 
because it is something that I think is
pretty<00:00:31.890> big<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.309> honestly<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.090> may<00:00:33.239> believe

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
pretty big and honestly you may believe

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330 
pretty big and honestly you may believe
that<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.809> won't<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.050> anything<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.620> arguably

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
that it won't do anything but arguably

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.620 
that it won't do anything but arguably

like you have to do you ought to think
about<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.390> because<00:01:57.689> there<00:01:58.350> are<00:01:58.380> probably

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
about that because there are probably

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859

would like to help probably even if

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.259 
would like to help probably even if
great<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.620> would<00:02:52.680> literally<00:02:53.010> take<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.519> 25

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
great it would literally take you 25

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.199 
great it would literally take you 25
seconds<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.810> time<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.170> do<00:02:55.319> it<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:56.000> put<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.120> this

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
seconds of time to do it and put it this

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.610 
seconds of time to do it and put it this
way<00:02:57.390> if<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.569> vote<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.170> service<00:02:58.440> come

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
way if you vote and the service come

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.319 
way if you vote and the service come
back<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:59.010> will<00:02:59.160> probably<00:02:59.459> be<00:02:59.700> very<00:02:59.730> happy<00:03:00.090> if

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
back you will probably be very happy if

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.610 
back you will probably be very happy if
you<00:03:00.390> didn't<00:03:00.750> vote<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.140> they<00:03:01.200> don't<00:03:01.410> come<00:03:01.590> back

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
you didn't vote and they don't come back

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.270 
you didn't vote and they don't come back
then<00:03:02.900> well<00:03:03.900> no<00:03:04.170> time<00:03:04.410> lost<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.799> guess<00:03:04.860> if<00:03:05.160> you

be like oh my god I didn't throw the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.059 
be like oh my god I didn't throw the
game<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.930> don't<00:03:10.019> know<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:10.440> yeah<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.860> just

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
game I don't know but yeah I just

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.350 
game I don't know but yeah I just
thought<00:03:11.280> I'd<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.519> my<00:03:11.640> part<00:03:11.879> and<00:03:12.000> help<00:03:12.180> out

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
thought I'd do my part and help out

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.309 
thought I'd do my part and help out
seriously<00:03:12.750> because<00:03:12.959> I'm<00:03:13.049> one<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.260> those

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
seriously because I'm one of those

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.140 
seriously because I'm one of those
people<00:03:13.379> that<00:03:13.769> would<00:03:14.430> honestly<00:03:14.579> love<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.030> see

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
people that would honestly love to see

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.520 
people that would honestly love to see
old<00:03:15.299> school<00:03:15.510> sends<00:03:15.750> back<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.019> think<00:03:16.079> if<00:03:16.319> they

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
old school sends back I think if they

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.750 
old school sends back I think if they
came<00:03:16.739> back<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.099> only<00:03:17.280> thing<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.459> do<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.730> just

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
came back the only thing I do is just

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.490 
came back the only thing I do is just
peek<00:03:18.030> around<00:03:18.209> mage<00:03:18.540> Bank<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.049> honestly<00:03:19.350> those

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
peek around mage Bank and honestly those

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.470 
peek around mage Bank and honestly those
videos<00:03:19.859> were<00:03:19.950> probably<00:03:20.190> my<00:03:20.370> arguably<00:03:21.060> my<00:03:21.209> best

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
videos were probably my arguably my best

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.309 
videos were probably my arguably my best
so<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:21.840> think<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:22.519> completely<00:03:23.519> just

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
so I think I just completely just

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.140 
so I think I just completely just
destroyed<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:25.590> just<00:03:25.980> got<00:03:26.130> there<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.489> just<00:03:26.609> sick

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
destroyed I just got there and just sick

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.460 
destroyed I just got there and just sick
really<00:03:27.480> just<00:03:27.630> enjoyed<00:03:27.900> but<00:03:28.019> yeah<00:03:28.170> like<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.380> said

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
really just enjoyed but yeah like I said

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.479 
really just enjoyed but yeah like I said

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.080 
have moved on to new games that up or
yeah<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.620> would<00:03:46.739> be<00:03:46.859> honestly<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.489> cool<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.940> see

the majority of the hours I haven't
loved<00:04:24.240> on<00:04:24.390> anything<00:04:24.690> risk<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.140> really<00:04:25.320> except

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
loved on anything risk it really except

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.879 
loved on anything risk it really except
for

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
for

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.469 
for
like<00:04:26.039> two<00:04:26.249> minutes<00:04:26.430> ago<00:04:26.610> I<00:04:26.909> haven't<00:04:27.210> looked<00:04:27.330> on

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
like two minutes ago I haven't looked on

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.899 
like two minutes ago I haven't looked on
it<00:04:27.569> and<00:04:27.719> risk<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.990> late<00:04:28.139> for<00:04:28.349> a<00:04:28.409> while<00:04:28.590> so<00:04:28.979> yeah

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:29.909 
it and risk it late for a while so yeah

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.330 
it and risk it late for a while so yeah
I<00:04:29.939> believe<00:04:30.090> overall<00:04:30.810> I've<00:04:31.080> next<00:04:32.009> to<00:04:32.099> quit

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
I believe overall I've next to quit

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.499 
I believe overall I've next to quit
runescape<00:04:32.729> really<00:04:32.939> I<00:04:32.969> will<00:04:33.150> probably<00:04:33.360> make

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
runescape really I will probably make

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.059 
runescape really I will probably make
some<00:04:33.749> videos<00:04:34.050> on<00:04:34.289> this<00:04:34.439> slide<00:04:34.680> I'm<00:04:34.770> not<00:04:34.889> saying

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
some videos on this slide I'm not saying

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:36.140 
some videos on this slide I'm not saying
of<00:04:35.129> quick<00:04:35.279> video<00:04:35.460> making<00:04:35.639> I'll<00:04:35.789> definitely

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
of quick video making I'll definitely

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.760 
of quick video making I'll definitely
still<00:04:36.360> look<00:04:36.509> on<00:04:36.659> riskier<00:04:37.080> premises<00:04:37.469> I'm<00:04:37.590> just

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
still look on riskier premises I'm just

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.980 
still look on riskier premises I'm just
saying<00:04:37.949> that<00:04:38.189> I'm<00:04:38.400> not<00:04:39.029> really<00:04:39.330> interested<00:04:39.930> in

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
saying that I'm not really interested in

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.080 
saying that I'm not really interested in
locking<00:04:40.259> on<00:04:40.379> to<00:04:40.529> record<00:04:41.009> them<00:04:41.129> and<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.759> will

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
locking on to record them and I will

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.339 
locking on to record them and I will
probably<00:04:42.300> go<00:04:42.539> back<00:04:42.719> and<00:04:42.870> be<00:04:42.930> horrible<00:04:43.259> at

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
probably go back and be horrible at

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:44.959 
probably go back and be horrible at
clicking<00:04:43.770> so<00:04:43.949> that's<00:04:44.099> probably<00:04:44.310> a<00:04:44.490> downside

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:44.969 
clicking so that's probably a downside

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:46.969 
clicking so that's probably a downside
to<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.180> but<00:04:45.509> yeah<00:04:46.020> I'm<00:04:46.139> much<00:04:46.379> more<00:04:46.529> enjoying<00:04:46.860> a

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
to it but yeah I'm much more enjoying a

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.769 
to it but yeah I'm much more enjoying a
quick<00:04:47.370> life<00:04:47.550> at<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:47.759> moment<00:04:47.879> so<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.539> will

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:48.779 
quick life at the moment so I will

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:50.689 
quick life at the moment so I will
probably<00:04:49.110> get<00:04:49.199> back<00:04:49.349> to<00:04:49.499> you<00:04:49.590> all<00:04:49.740> when<00:04:50.490> I<00:04:50.520> do

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
probably get back to you all when I do

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.179 
probably get back to you all when I do
get<00:04:50.969> on<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.210> ask<00:04:51.749> for<00:04:51.990> runescape<00:04:52.469> itself<00:04:52.949> I've

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:53.189 
get on to ask for runescape itself I've

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:54.890 
get on to ask for runescape itself I've
pretty<00:04:53.819> much<00:04:53.879> the<00:04:54.029> next<00:04:54.120> acquit<00:04:54.449> I<00:04:54.479> don't<00:04:54.840> know

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
pretty much the next acquit I don't know

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.360 
pretty much the next acquit I don't know
if<00:04:54.960> I'll<00:04:55.110> look<00:04:55.469> back<00:04:55.620> on<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:55.889> I've<00:04:55.979> counseled

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
if I'll look back on that I've counseled

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.459 
if I'll look back on that I've counseled
both<00:04:56.490> my<00:04:56.669> subscriptions<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:57.779> I<00:04:58.050> don't<00:04:58.319> know

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:58.469 
both my subscriptions so I don't know

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:00.050 
both my subscriptions so I don't know
that<00:04:58.650> does<00:04:59.129> mean<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.460> evolution<00:04:59.819> but<00:04:59.969> you

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
that does mean the evolution but you

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.369 
that does mean the evolution but you
will<00:05:00.210> probably<00:05:00.449> end<00:05:00.689> I<00:05:00.840> don't<00:05:01.020> know<00:05:01.229> it

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
will probably end I don't know it

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.769 
will probably end I don't know it
depends<00:05:01.740> if<00:05:01.800> I<00:05:01.889> get<00:05:02.099> back<00:05:02.250> into<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.580> game<00:05:02.779> but

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:03.779 
depends if I get back into the game but

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.089 
depends if I get back into the game but
I<00:05:03.840> have<00:05:03.900> cancelled<00:05:04.259> both<00:05:04.500> my<00:05:04.650> ownerships

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
like I guess just look at a black screen

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.189 
like I guess just look at a black screen
I<00:05:23.759> put<00:05:23.909> those<00:05:24.029> clips<00:05:24.270> in<00:05:24.419> then<00:05:24.659> just<00:05:24.990> trying<00:05:25.139> to

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
I put those clips in then just trying to

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.300 
I put those clips in then just trying to
commentate<00:05:25.529> over<00:05:25.589> probably<00:05:25.949> throw<00:05:26.099> another

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
commentate over probably throw another

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.129 
commentate over probably throw another
one<00:05:26.370> in<00:05:26.490> above<00:05:26.939> it<00:05:27.089> just<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:27.930> you've<00:05:28.020> got
