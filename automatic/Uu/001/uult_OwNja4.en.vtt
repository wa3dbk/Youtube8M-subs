is a king for doing this I spent 29
hours<00:01:22.590> or<00:01:23.250> something<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> number

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
hours or something like that the number

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.570 
hours or something like that the number
gets<00:01:24.869> bigger<00:01:25.049> every<00:01:25.110> day<00:01:25.470> trying<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.399> this

at<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> normal<00:01:27.840> way<00:01:27.960> which<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.320> guess<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.679> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
at the normal way which I guess is to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.109 
at the normal way which I guess is to
just<00:01:28.950> turn<00:01:29.130> all<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> sliders<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.820> one<00:01:29.970> guy

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

down of the goalkeeper down you're
facing<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.720> turns<00:01:33.899> sighs<00:01:34.110> your<00:01:34.380> guy<00:01:34.500> up

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240

way<00:04:13.030> even<00:04:13.300> farther<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:14.080> he<00:04:14.200> can<00:04:14.410> get<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.530> look<00:04:14.680> at

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
way even farther so he can get a look at

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.650 
way even farther so he can get a look at
how<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:14.950> was<00:04:15.070> trying<00:04:15.400> this<00:04:15.580> before<00:04:15.970> I<00:04:16.150> show<00:04:16.630> you

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
how I was trying this before I show you

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.650 
how I was trying this before I show you
a<00:04:16.810> few<00:04:16.840> failures<00:04:17.230> a<00:04:17.730> few<00:04:18.730> of<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.060> many

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
a few failures a few of the many

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.720 
a few failures a few of the many
failures<00:04:20.080> so<00:04:20.410> let's<00:04:20.620> start<00:04:20.830> here<00:04:20.859> so<00:04:21.489> I<00:04:21.520> figure

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
failures so let's start here so I figure

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.040 
failures so let's start here so I figure
with<00:04:21.850> him<00:04:22.000> right<00:04:22.210> I<00:04:22.240> go<00:04:22.450> right<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.720> this<00:04:22.810> point

with him right I go right to this point

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.230 
with him right I go right to this point
and<00:04:23.410> I'm<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:24.070> screw<00:04:24.580> up<00:04:24.640> cuz<00:04:24.850> I'm<00:04:24.940> doing<00:04:25.150> this
