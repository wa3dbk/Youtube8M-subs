it's<00:03:26.040> best<00:03:26.190> for<00:03:26.280> people<00:03:26.579> that<00:03:26.700> are

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
it's best for people that are

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.460 
it's best for people that are
disproportionate<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.959> make<00:03:28.110> them<00:03:28.320> more

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
disproportionate to make them more

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.780 
disproportionate to make them more
proportionate<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.280> certainly<00:03:29.610> have<00:03:29.760> been

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
proportionate I certainly have been

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.300 
proportionate I certainly have been
people<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.180> are<00:03:30.390> very<00:03:30.750> overweight<00:03:30.959> or<00:03:31.310> obese

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
technique we talked about it on friday

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.300 
technique we talked about it on friday
but<00:03:39.390> let's<00:03:39.660> rehearse<00:03:40.049> it<00:03:40.260> again<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.280> not

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
but let's rehearse it again this is not

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.190 
but let's rehearse it again this is not
liposuction<00:03:41.850> where<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.660> are<00:03:42.780> knocked<00:03:43.049> out

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
liposuction where you are knocked out

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.870 
liposuction where you are knocked out
cold<00:03:43.500> obviously<00:03:44.010> because<00:03:44.280> we<00:03:44.310> were<00:03:44.519> talking

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
cold obviously because we were talking

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.670 
cold obviously because we were talking
to<00:03:44.970> Liz<00:03:45.120> while<00:03:45.390> it<00:03:45.510> was<00:03:45.630> happening<00:03:45.660> but<00:03:46.500> this

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
to Liz while it was happening but this

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.680 
to Liz while it was happening but this
is<00:03:46.920> liposuction<00:03:47.790> called<00:03:48.060> tumescent

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
is liposuction called tumescent

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.810 
is liposuction called tumescent
liposuction<00:03:48.750> in<00:03:49.560> which<00:03:49.920> what's<00:03:50.670> the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
liposuction in which what's the

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
liposuction in which what's the
difference<00:03:50.910> what<00:03:51.239> do<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.390> do<00:03:51.510> different

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
difference what do you do different

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.880 
difference what do you do different
right<00:03:51.989> well<00:03:52.140> this<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.380> tumescent<00:03:52.859> liposuction

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
right well this is tumescent liposuction

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.550 
right well this is tumescent liposuction
I<00:03:53.459> like<00:03:53.609> to<00:03:53.730> distinguish<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.269> from<00:03:54.560> just

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
I like to distinguish it from just

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.140 
I like to distinguish it from just
general<00:03:55.920> tumescent<00:03:56.340> liposuction<00:03:56.370> call<00:03:57.030> it

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
general tumescent liposuction call it

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.150 
general tumescent liposuction call it
pure<00:03:57.450> tumescent<00:03:57.900> liposuction<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.130> a

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
pure tumescent liposuction and this is a

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.610 
pure tumescent liposuction and this is a
technique<00:03:59.400> I'm<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.790> dermatological<00:04:00.500> elip<00:04:01.500> by<00:04:01.590> a

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
technique I'm a dermatological elip by a

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.620 
technique I'm a dermatological elip by a
dermatological<00:04:02.180> actually<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.600> the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
dermatological actually in the in the

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.750 
dermatological actually in the in the
mid<00:04:03.810> 80s<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.890> problem<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.609> has

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
mid 80s and the problem is that it has

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.240 
mid 80s and the problem is that it has
been<00:04:06.060> used<00:04:06.810> since<00:04:07.049> then<00:04:07.350> but<00:04:07.590> people<00:04:07.920> are<00:04:08.070> not

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
been used since then but people are not

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.740 
been used since then but people are not
keeping<00:04:08.459> within<00:04:08.730> safe<00:04:09.000> boundaries<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.540> their

plastic surgery showed using it with

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.789 
plastic surgery showed using it with
general<00:04:15.780> anesthesia<00:04:16.140> for<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.560> number<00:04:16.680> of

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
general anesthesia for a number of

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.650 
general anesthesia for a number of
reasons<00:04:16.859> really<00:04:17.370> increases<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:17.910> risks<00:04:18.299> so

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
reasons really increases the risks so

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.870 
reasons really increases the risks so
the<00:04:18.870> benefits<00:04:19.350> of<00:04:19.440> not<00:04:19.680> using<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:20.160> general<00:04:20.579> dr

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
the benefits of not using a general dr

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.050 
the benefits of not using a general dr
imran<00:04:21.169> their<00:04:22.169> number<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.440> benefits<00:04:22.740> kelly<00:04:23.430> the

main one being it really is a safer

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.020 
main one being it really is a safer
procedure

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
procedure

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.490 
procedure
one<00:04:27.210> thing<00:04:27.450> is<00:04:27.480> that<00:04:27.780> that<00:04:27.840> article<00:04:28.350> talking

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
one thing is that that article talking

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.530 
one thing is that that article talking
to<00:04:28.620> patients<00:04:29.040> died<00:04:29.220> of<00:04:29.250> clots<00:04:29.790> forming<00:04:30.330> and

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
to patients died of clots forming and

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.240 
to patients died of clots forming and
that<00:04:30.570> was<00:04:30.960> number<00:04:31.139> one<00:04:31.350> reason<00:04:31.710> with<00:04:32.130> this

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
that was number one reason with this

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.100 
that was number one reason with this
technique<00:04:32.700> people<00:04:33.150> are<00:04:33.300> up<00:04:33.480> and<00:04:33.660> walking

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
technique people are up and walking

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.230 
technique people are up and walking
within<00:04:34.920> an<00:04:35.070> hour<00:04:35.220> after<00:04:35.400> surgery<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.150> that

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
within an hour after surgery and that

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.120 
within an hour after surgery and that
two<00:04:36.389> mile<00:04:36.570> walk<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.930> next<00:04:37.110> day<00:04:37.230> is<00:04:37.620> very<00:04:37.980> very

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
two mile walk the next day is very very

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.680 
two mile walk the next day is very very
important<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.669> get<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:38.850> fluid<00:04:39.120> mobilizing

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
important to get the fluid mobilizing

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.879 
important to get the fluid mobilizing
and<00:04:39.840> again<00:04:40.020> reduce<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.380> chance<00:04:40.560> of<00:04:40.680> clot

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
and again reduce the chance of clot

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.040 
and again reduce the chance of clot
formation<00:04:41.250> one<00:04:42.120> question<00:04:42.510> I<00:04:42.630> want<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:42.870> know<00:04:43.020> I

formation one question I want to know I
