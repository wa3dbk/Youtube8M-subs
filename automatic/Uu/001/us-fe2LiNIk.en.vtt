 Ok, I'm going to talk about how I started playing the drums. I started at 3 years old, my dad gave me a drum kit because he always armed me with batteries in the kitchen and thought maybe I would have liked it, and the truth is that I loved it and never gave up. I started with that battery making groups with friends, we played, we did not know how to play a lot, but that's how I started at a very young age, at 3 years old; and then, at age 9, I had my first full-size battery, which was given to me, my dad gave it to me as well. I had a lot of time on that battery and I took 9 years of private drum lessons, with a private teacher and I also studied at different universities, I studied at ITMC which is one, an institute in Buenos Aires, it is called Technological Institute of Contemporary Music; I studied there for 2 years, I took drum lessons with different teachers and there I also learned harmony and music theory, which is not what I like the most, but I had to learn it. After that I went to live in the United States and studied at the Musicians Institute, which is one, a well-known institute that remains in Hollywood, in Los Angeles and, and now I arrived here, I came back again now, to Florida, I am ... I also played in Argentina for the last 2 years; I was playing in an orchestra of jazz and swing, and so, also there I learned, that was also a great apprentice for me, for playing in an orchestra and having to read at first sight and having a large group of musicians that are playing all together, that was also a great learning for me. And now I'm in Florida, I teach drums in the United States. Now I teach drums and I give drum lessons with 2 batteries at the same time, which is the best way to teach, with 2 batteries at the same time so that the teacher and student touch at the same time and there is no confusion, do not have to stop and sit the other; It is better to always have 2 batteries facing each other, one next to the other, always with a metronome ... and I recommend that you practice as much as you can and that you do very well.
