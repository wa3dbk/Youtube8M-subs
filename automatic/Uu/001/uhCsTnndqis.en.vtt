bit<00:01:10.009> toying<00:01:10.490> with<00:01:10.850> his<00:01:11.000> opponent<00:01:11.750> I<00:01:11.840> think<00:01:12.200> he

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
bit toying with his opponent I think he

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.960 
bit toying with his opponent I think he
probably<00:01:12.560> could<00:01:13.040> have<00:01:13.070> done<00:01:13.549> a<00:01:13.579> lot<00:01:13.790> more

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
probably could have done a lot more

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.850 
probably could have done a lot more
damage<00:01:14.149> I<00:01:14.360> he<00:01:15.020> could<00:01:15.170> probably<00:01:15.320> just<00:01:15.560> run<00:01:15.770> in

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860
