00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.280
 you have to see if uvi expressions are yes 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.139
 as you can see in a new video that 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.960
 basically as it says title of this les 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.050
 I will teach how to optimize your card 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.949
 integrated video intel hd she be the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.300
 3000 2000 etc. well I will do it 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.150
 quickly so as not to take away much 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.460
 time so let's go with the first step 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.859
 of the three that you have to do good 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.530
 first of all we have to update 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.659
 our driver and for that they are going to have 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.579
 to access the link that I leave in the 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.889
 description of the video that will take them to 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.600
 this page ok once you are here 

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:46.129
 obviously what we are going to do is 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.030
 check if updates for your 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.289
 system 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.199
 this page is very good because it is 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.959
 automatic and well it does everything to us 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.639
 easier to good to be able to do this 

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:57.799
 process on this page we have to have 

00:00:55.639 --> 00:01:00.409
 installed the java driver if not what 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.940
 we have installed then right there we are 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.829
 will give the option to install it 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.869
 if we do not download it there you see 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.720
 but the thing is that you have to have it 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.310
 installed 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.880
 good if we have it installed 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.700
 we are just going to give it to execute us 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.680
 will ask as a permit we give in 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.840
 run the most likely to come a 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.150
 little slow the pc for a few moments now 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.670
 that java has always been characterized by 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.320
 electrify a for example here but 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.260
 we're just going to wait for him and they're going to 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.350
 see how everything works so I do not know 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.950
 do not get dramatic about that because 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.950
 it is normal 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.970
 and how can they see and analyze the equipment and 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.670
 these would be the results I update 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.070
 today is on my video card so 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.649
 obviously I have everything updated good 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.619
 we are going to give in seeing all and we will go 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.149
 downloading drivers that do not 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.149
 let's keep up to date but obviously what 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.210
 interesting for this video is to download 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.070
 the graphics drivers so 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.659
 when we give to see all in 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.869
 graphics drivers will give us a 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.670
 option on a button that will be downloaded 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.670
 here and obviously if you have 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.560
 update more necessary but if not what 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.350
 you have update it will obviously come out 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.910
 here download the latest version 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.660
 once you download that is going 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.989
 obviously to give your controller that is 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.260
 something like that is amazing 140 megabytes 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.569
 in this case 64-bit paralysis and 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.310
 good once you have it downloaded 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.640
 they just run it or they install and 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.410
 all this as you already know 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.030
 good and here what we are going to do 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.240
 then it would be the second and the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.290
 third step which are the simplest 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.390
 simply we will go to flechita 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.340
 from here we will give you right click on 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.290
 hd intel graphics and we will give in 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.030
 graphics properties if it comes up here 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.380
 a one tab 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.440
 when what we are going to do is give 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.069
 Advanced the advanced option and accept 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.800
 here good once we have that we 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.950
 this menu is going to come out and in this menu 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.450
 let's make some small changes we 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.390
 let's go to the tab back and from here 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.640
 and this will surely be here even if 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.640
 what are we going to do is move this 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.800
 to performance as the word says to 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.270
 model the performance the computer the 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.790
 video card against all your effort 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.420
 so that the game faced more effectively 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.100
 with more fps etcetera etcetera ok and if 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.140
 we move to quality obviously will walk more 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.050
 slow but with better video quality 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.670
 image quality effects what do I know the 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.610
 thing is that as we want performance 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.550
 obviously we put it there that good 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.430
 it would be the second step and the third step 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.590
 it would be that we are going to give energy and here 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.019
 in connected to the current if adenosine 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.850
 with battery we will leave everything the same 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.380
 and we're going to get connected to the 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.730
 current someone connected to the 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.489
 current new colors we have it 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.870
 here put but obviously connected to 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.780
 the current we do not have balance 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.510
 we wanted maximum performance so I would 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.240
 We give that little eyelash this little dove and 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.710
 after that we will give to apply ok 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.020
 I do not leave it because obviously 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.390
 I have applied and that would be all friends 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.600
 It's very easy and it's very good indeed 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.810
 that works and goes up from 5 to 10 up 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.170
 you can be 15 fps a game that's that 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.690
 pretty note so how can you see me 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.650
 for example I have games the likes of 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:29.180
 armed games the likes of far cry 3 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:33.110
 of gta 4 even and I'm doing very well with 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.510
 the very stable fps after doing this 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.940
 method and I really noticed a great 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.670
 change so good friends I hope that 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.190
 it's all very well and if not 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.200
 Well, I hope it helped you 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.930
 make it a little bit so these friends 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.600
 have a good day late or night and 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.960
 see you in the next video until the 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.960
 next
