hey<00:00:11.000> this<00:00:11.240> is<00:00:11.389> Stan<00:00:11.690> I'm<00:00:11.900> doing<00:00:12.170> a<00:00:12.410> review<00:00:12.920> on

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
hey this is Stan I'm doing a review on

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.040 
hey this is Stan I'm doing a review on
my<00:00:13.719> little<00:00:14.719> fridge<00:00:15.440> freezer<00:00:15.830> by<00:00:16.160> Dometic<00:00:17.050> it's

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
my little fridge freezer by Dometic it's

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.330 
my little fridge freezer by Dometic it's
called<00:00:18.410> a<00:00:18.560> cool<00:00:18.830> freeze<00:00:19.599> cf-18<00:00:20.599> and<00:00:20.980> I<00:00:21.980> think

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
called a cool freeze cf-18 and I think

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.700 
called a cool freeze cf-18 and I think
these<00:00:23.180> are<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.570> last<00:00:23.599> of<00:00:23.990> them<00:00:24.140> I<00:00:24.349> don't<00:00:24.410> see

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
these are the last of them I don't see

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.220 
these are the last of them I don't see
them<00:00:24.800> on<00:00:24.949> Domenic's<00:00:25.460> website<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.809> get<00:00:27.140> them

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
them on Domenic's website so get them

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.359 
them on Domenic's website so get them
while<00:00:27.259> you<00:00:27.529> can<00:00:28.899> it's<00:00:29.899> it's<00:00:30.680> a<00:00:30.919> complete

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
while you can it's it's a complete

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.990 
while you can it's it's a complete
electric<00:00:32.020> 12<00:00:33.020> volt<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:34.250> does<00:00:34.460> not<00:00:34.579> have<00:00:34.850> an

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
electric 12 volt it does not have an

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.810 
electric 12 volt it does not have an
option<00:00:35.180> for<00:00:35.390> plugging<00:00:36.320> into<00:00:37.059> your<00:00:38.140> AC<00:00:39.460> I<00:00:40.460> have

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
option for plugging into your AC I have

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.580 
option for plugging into your AC I have
it<00:00:41.180> running<00:00:41.539> off<00:00:41.690> of<00:00:41.840> my<00:00:41.960> deep<00:00:42.200> cycle

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
it running off of my deep cycle

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.710 
it running off of my deep cycle
batteries<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.610> I<00:00:43.850> bought<00:00:44.060> an<00:00:44.150> extra<00:00:44.270> deep

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
batteries and I bought an extra deep

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.840 
batteries and I bought an extra deep
cycle<00:00:45.110> battery<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:45.560> you<00:00:45.680> have<00:00:45.770> 110<00:00:46.310> amp<00:00:46.490> hours

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
cycle battery so you have 110 amp hours

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.810 
cycle battery so you have 110 amp hours
and<00:00:47.090> then<00:00:47.900> I<00:00:47.930> bought<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.230> hundred<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:48.980> 55<00:00:49.610> watt

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
and then I bought a hundred and 55 watt

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.490 
and then I bought a hundred and 55 watt
solar<00:00:50.090> panel<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.600> run<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:50.840> during<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.110> day<00:00:51.260> I'm

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
solar panel to run it during the day I'm

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.580 
solar panel to run it during the day I'm
serious<00:00:52.100> about<00:00:52.430> my<00:00:53.239> ice<00:00:53.570> my<00:00:54.200> little

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
serious about my ice my little

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.610 
serious about my ice my little
refrigerator<00:00:55.190> here<00:00:55.570> also<00:00:56.570> a<00:00:56.600> old<00:00:57.079> Dometic

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
refrigerator here also a old Dometic

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.520 
refrigerator here also a old Dometic
runs<00:00:58.310> great<00:00:58.700> but<00:00:59.000> it<00:00:59.090> only<00:00:59.239> is<00:00:59.750> a<00:00:59.780> refrigerator

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
runs great but it only is a refrigerator

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.310 
runs great but it only is a refrigerator
at<00:01:00.620> no<00:01:00.649> freezer<00:01:01.160> climate<00:01:01.700> and<00:01:01.850> I<00:01:02.630> have<00:01:02.930> to<00:01:03.140> have

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
at no freezer climate and I have to have

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.789 
at no freezer climate and I have to have
my<00:01:03.530> ice<00:01:03.800> so<00:01:04.960> here<00:01:05.960> we<00:01:06.110> go

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
my ice so here we go

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.149 
my ice so here we go
let's<00:01:07.310> see<00:01:07.579> let's<00:01:08.390> look<00:01:08.780> at<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:08.990> buttons<00:01:09.860> here

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
let's see let's look at the buttons here

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.209 
let's see let's look at the buttons here
okay<00:01:10.759> it's<00:01:11.210> got<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.649> power<00:01:12.649> button<00:01:12.979> there

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
okay it's got a power button there

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.870 
okay it's got a power button there
that's<00:01:13.430> normal<00:01:14.000> it's<00:01:14.270> not<00:01:14.479> when<00:01:14.780> it's<00:01:14.930> cycling

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
that's normal it's not when it's cycling

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.410 
that's normal it's not when it's cycling
on<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:16.940> off<00:01:17.299> its<00:01:17.630> going<00:01:17.870> to<00:01:18.940> it's<00:01:19.940> going<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.270> go

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
on and off its going to it's going to go

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.539 
on and off its going to it's going to go
green<00:01:20.780> when<00:01:21.020> it's<00:01:21.200> when<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.620> fan<00:01:22.100> is<00:01:22.280> running

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
green when it's when the fan is running

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.230 
green when it's when the fan is running
and<00:01:23.380> it's<00:01:24.380> going<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.770> go<00:01:24.950> yellow<00:01:25.880> when<00:01:26.119> it's

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
and it's going to go yellow when it's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.070 
and it's going to go yellow when it's
when<00:01:26.630> it's<00:01:26.659> idling<00:01:27.320> or<00:01:27.560> off<00:01:28.190> and<00:01:29.060> if<00:01:29.869> it's

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
when it's idling or off and if it's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.210 
when it's idling or off and if it's
green<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:32.479> air<00:01:33.080> light<00:01:33.440> is<00:01:33.590> flashing<00:01:33.830> that

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
green and the air light is flashing that

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.740 
green and the air light is flashing that
means<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:35.240> is<00:01:36.670> it's<00:01:37.670> out<00:01:37.850> of<00:01:38.000> battery<00:01:38.420> or<00:01:38.540> the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
means it is it's out of battery or the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.840 
means it is it's out of battery or the
battery<00:01:39.229> is<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:39.560> low<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.979> will<00:01:40.130> not<00:01:40.369> run<00:01:40.729> it

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
battery is so low it will not run it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.630 
battery is so low it will not run it
anymore<00:01:41.150> this<00:01:41.570> also<00:01:41.780> occurs<00:01:42.400> occurred<00:01:43.400> when<00:01:43.610> I

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
anymore this also occurs occurred when I

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.480 
anymore this also occurs occurred when I
first<00:01:44.150> bought<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.450> would<00:01:44.810> not<00:01:44.990> run<00:01:45.320> because<00:01:46.280> I

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
first bought it would not run because I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.250 
first bought it would not run because I
had<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:46.700> plugged<00:01:46.970> into<00:01:47.150> that<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:47.930> says

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
had to plugged into that it says

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.469 
had to plugged into that it says
explicitly<00:01:48.560> instructions<00:01:49.460> do<00:01:49.729> not<00:01:50.000> plug<00:01:50.330> it

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
explicitly instructions do not plug it

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.289 
explicitly instructions do not plug it
into<00:01:50.600> distribution<00:01:51.460> panels<00:01:52.460> or<00:01:52.610> splitters<00:01:53.090> or

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
into distribution panels or splitters or

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.280 
into distribution panels or splitters or
anything<00:01:53.420> like<00:01:53.540> that<00:01:53.630> because<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:55.150> that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
anything like that because that that

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.480 
anything like that because that that
raises<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.619> resistance<00:01:58.220> in<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:59.320> electrical

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
raises the resistance in the electrical

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.850 
raises the resistance in the electrical
lines<00:02:01.490> electrical<00:02:02.270> wires<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:03.409> makes<00:02:03.619> it

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
lines electrical wires and it makes it

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.310 
lines electrical wires and it makes it
think<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.640> have<00:02:05.060> low<00:02:05.330> voltage<00:02:05.869> even<00:02:06.200> though<00:02:06.290> I

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
think you have low voltage even though I

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.119 
think you have low voltage even though I
had<00:02:06.650> full<00:02:06.979> batteries<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:09.259> that's<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.649> no<00:02:09.860> known

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
had full batteries so that's a no known

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.729 
had full batteries so that's a no known
do<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.789> direct<00:02:11.329> a<00:02:11.769> direct<00:02:12.769> head<00:02:13.189> run<00:02:13.519> into<00:02:14.209> the

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
do a direct a direct head run into the

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.430 
do a direct a direct head run into the
the<00:02:15.739> batteries<00:02:16.069> also<00:02:16.610> by<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.030> way<00:02:17.299> if<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:18.200> do

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
the batteries also by the way if you do

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.000 
the batteries also by the way if you do
get<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:19.010> where<00:02:19.250> your

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
get it to where your

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.610 
get it to where your
these<00:02:20.159> are<00:02:20.340> charged<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:21.000> my<00:02:21.629> solar<00:02:22.019> panel<00:02:22.409> is

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
these are charged like my solar panel is

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.740 
these are charged like my solar panel is
plenty<00:02:23.310> strong<00:02:23.489> enough<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.909> run<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.269> all<00:02:24.510> day

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
plenty strong enough to run this all day

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.110 
plenty strong enough to run this all day
without<00:02:25.650> really<00:02:26.010> taking<00:02:26.370> from<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.610> batteries

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
without really taking from the batteries

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.860 
without really taking from the batteries
but<00:02:27.780> if<00:02:28.319> you<00:02:28.920> get<00:02:29.129> that<00:02:29.400> red<00:02:30.000> light<00:02:30.209> flashing

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
but if you get that red light flashing

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.780 
but if you get that red light flashing
you're<00:02:31.620> going<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.799> have<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.099> pull<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.489> all

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
you're going to have to pull this all

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.289 
you're going to have to pull this all
the<00:02:32.970> way<00:02:33.090> out<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.780> reset<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.939> it's<00:02:35.939> got<00:02:36.090> some

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
the way out to reset it it's got some

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.520 
the way out to reset it it's got some
kind<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.540> memory<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:36.959> there<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.200> won't<00:02:37.349> just

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
kind of memory in there it won't just

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.530 
kind of memory in there it won't just
power<00:02:37.829> back<00:02:38.129> on<00:02:38.370> itself<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.849> then<00:02:39.120> plug<00:02:39.390> it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
power back on itself so then plug it

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.869 
power back on itself so then plug it
back<00:02:39.569> in<00:02:40.049> you'll<00:02:40.950> get<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.310> green<00:02:41.549> light<00:02:41.579> or

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
back in you'll get the green light or

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.059 
back in you'll get the green light or
there<00:02:42.269> yellow<00:02:42.659> light<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.319> green<00:02:43.470> light<00:02:43.560> and

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
there yellow light and a green light and

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.460 
there yellow light and a green light and
we'll<00:02:44.159> run<00:02:44.459> again<00:02:44.819> but<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:46.319> will<00:02:46.680> not<00:02:47.010> power

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
we'll run again but it will not power

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.520 
we'll run again but it will not power
back<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.739> by<00:02:49.950> itself<00:02:50.340> because<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.790> some<00:02:51.209> I

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
back on by itself because of some I

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.619 
back on by itself because of some I
assume<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.709> protections<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.549> it<00:02:53.700> all<00:02:54.420> right

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
assume it's protections in it all right

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.250 
assume it's protections in it all right
now<00:02:54.780> let's<00:02:55.019> get<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.590> meat<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:55.950> potatoes

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
now let's get to the meat and potatoes

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.530 
now let's get to the meat and potatoes
and<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:59.519> is<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:01.549> interior<00:03:02.549> which<00:03:02.879> by<00:03:03.480> the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
and that is the interior which by the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.930 
and that is the interior which by the
way<00:03:03.659> this<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.049> very<00:03:04.139> hard<00:03:05.069> to<00:03:05.340> get<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.639> lock

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
way this is a very hard to get that lock

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.240 
way this is a very hard to get that lock
open<00:03:06.389> I<00:03:06.540> thought<00:03:07.409> I<00:03:07.440> was<00:03:07.590> gonna<00:03:07.680> have<00:03:07.829> to<00:03:07.920> break

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
open I thought I was gonna have to break

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.890 
open I thought I was gonna have to break
it<00:03:08.459> when<00:03:08.579> I<00:03:08.639> first<00:03:08.879> bought<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.690> thought

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
it when I first bought it and I thought

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.569 
it when I first bought it and I thought
how<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.139> heck<00:03:10.500> did<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.739> get<00:03:10.799> this<00:03:11.069> open<00:03:11.280> but

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
how the heck did I get this open but

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.240 
how the heck did I get this open but
just<00:03:11.819> had<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.480> really<00:03:12.870> pull<00:03:13.200> hard<00:03:13.470> and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
just had to really pull hard and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.280 
just had to really pull hard and
eventually<00:03:14.909> got<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.150> through<00:03:15.389> okay<00:03:16.109> down

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
eventually got it through okay down

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.259 
eventually got it through okay down
below<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.609> section<00:03:18.000> down<00:03:18.090> below

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
below that that the section down below

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.720 
below that that the section down below
does<00:03:18.659> not<00:03:18.930> get<00:03:19.230> as<00:03:19.349> cold<00:03:19.650> as<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:20.010> top<00:03:20.250> kind<00:03:20.639> of

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
does not get as cold as the top kind of

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.750 
does not get as cold as the top kind of
same<00:03:20.940> as<00:03:21.090> refrigerators<00:03:21.900> in<00:03:22.709> motorhomes<00:03:23.430> they

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
same as refrigerators in motorhomes they

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.210 
same as refrigerators in motorhomes they
put<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.449> freezer<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:25.169> the<00:03:25.230> top<00:03:25.949> because

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
put the freezer in the top because

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.490 
put the freezer in the top because
that's<00:03:26.400> what's<00:03:26.579> going<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.760> be<00:03:26.879> coldest<00:03:27.500> and

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
that's what's going to be coldest and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.849 
that's what's going to be coldest and
then<00:03:28.980> down<00:03:29.160> there<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.489> bottom<00:03:29.879> and<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.480> like

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
then down there in the bottom and I like

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.289 
then down there in the bottom and I like
being<00:03:31.859> a<00:03:31.919> put<00:03:32.099> my<00:03:32.220> beers<00:03:32.459> down<00:03:32.699> there<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.180> don't

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
being a put my beers down there I don't

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.599 
being a put my beers down there I don't
drink<00:03:33.690> very<00:03:33.900> often<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.829> like<00:03:35.040> bottled<00:03:35.459> beer

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
drink very often but I like bottled beer

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.349 
drink very often but I like bottled beer
when<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.790> do<00:03:35.879> and<00:03:36.750> there<00:03:37.379> you<00:03:37.560> go<00:03:38.180> it's<00:03:39.180> got<00:03:39.329> a

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
when I do and there you go it's got a

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.500 
when I do and there you go it's got a
little<00:03:39.720> thing<00:03:39.900> here<00:03:40.199> that<00:03:40.879> I'm<00:03:41.879> going<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.239> mess

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
little thing here that I'm going to mess

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.379 
little thing here that I'm going to mess
it<00:03:42.660> up<00:03:42.780> we'll<00:03:44.599> make<00:03:45.599> it<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.620> can<00:03:47.269> sixth<00:03:48.269> up

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
it up we'll make it so you can sixth up

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.650 
it up we'll make it so you can sixth up
on<00:03:48.569> there<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.230> could<00:03:49.410> put<00:03:49.730> ice<00:03:50.730> cube<00:03:51.030> trays<00:03:51.389> in

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
on there you could put ice cube trays in

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.119 
on there you could put ice cube trays in
here<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.199> it<00:03:52.379> will<00:03:52.500> freeze<00:03:52.799> them<00:03:52.980> up

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
here and it will freeze them up

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.220 
here and it will freeze them up
especially<00:03:54.120> overnight<00:03:54.389> it<00:03:54.720> will<00:03:54.900> freeze

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
especially overnight it will freeze

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.920 
especially overnight it will freeze
because<00:03:56.220> it's<00:03:56.489> like<00:03:56.699> a<00:03:56.730> really<00:03:57.060> kicks<00:03:57.629> butt

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
because it's like a really kicks butt

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.699 
because it's like a really kicks butt
anyway<00:03:58.769> don't<00:03:59.549> like<00:03:59.879> that<00:04:00.090> latch<00:04:00.449> I<00:04:01.079> think<00:04:01.620> it

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
anyway don't like that latch I think it

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.550 
anyway don't like that latch I think it
should<00:04:01.859> be<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.280> lot<00:04:03.090> smoother<00:04:03.659> to<00:04:03.780> use<00:04:04.049> but<00:04:04.440> it

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
should be a lot smoother to use but it

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.460 
should be a lot smoother to use but it
does<00:04:04.790> work<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.060> keep<00:04:06.359> it<00:04:06.510> locked<00:04:06.720> get<00:04:07.440> a

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
does work and keep it locked get a

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.619 
does work and keep it locked get a
carrying<00:04:07.829> handle<00:04:07.859> weighs<00:04:08.730> about<00:04:08.909> 30<00:04:09.299> pounds

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
carrying handle weighs about 30 pounds

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.350 
carrying handle weighs about 30 pounds
and<00:04:10.230> it's<00:04:11.159> just<00:04:11.400> been<00:04:11.549> wonderful<00:04:11.760> other<00:04:12.329> than

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
and it's just been wonderful other than

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.650 
and it's just been wonderful other than
surmounting<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:14.349> problems<00:04:15.069> with<00:04:15.660> the

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
surmounting the problems with the

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.240 
surmounting the problems with the
electrical<00:04:17.639> demands<00:04:18.639> of<00:04:18.940> this<00:04:19.090> thing<00:04:20.130> but<00:04:21.130> if

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
electrical demands of this thing but if

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.440 
electrical demands of this thing but if
you're<00:04:21.340> plugged<00:04:21.579> in<00:04:21.700> at<00:04:21.790> a<00:04:21.850> campground<00:04:22.300> you

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
you're plugged in at a campground you

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.900 
you're plugged in at a campground you
got<00:04:22.600> your<00:04:22.780> converter<00:04:23.139> going<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:23.770> running<00:04:24.669> all

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
got your converter going and running all

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.320 
got your converter going and running all
the<00:04:25.030> time<00:04:25.270> it'll<00:04:25.570> just<00:04:25.870> it'll<00:04:26.110> be<00:04:26.680> great<00:04:27.330> that

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
the time it'll just it'll be great that
