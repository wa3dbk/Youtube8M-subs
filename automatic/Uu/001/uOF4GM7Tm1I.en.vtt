00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 
didn't say zero in so what we have here

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.450 
didn't say zero in so what we have here
is<00:00:11.240> this<00:00:11.960> is<00:00:12.080> my<00:00:12.170> homemade<00:00:12.560> outrigger<00:00:13.070> I'm

is this is my homemade outrigger I'm

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.820 
is this is my homemade outrigger I'm
gonna<00:00:13.610> give<00:00:13.760> a<00:00:13.790> little<00:00:14.050> information<00:00:15.050> about<00:00:15.620> it

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
gonna give a little information about it

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.679 
gonna give a little information about it
before<00:00:16.100> I<00:00:16.160> send<00:00:16.429> it<00:00:16.550> out<00:00:18.009> I<00:00:19.009> just<00:00:19.939> used<00:00:20.210> DuPont

that's a simply eliminated so let's see
if<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.130> get<00:01:10.369> it<00:01:10.549> nice<00:01:14.770> nice<00:01:15.770> thing<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.250> it

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.920 

bear<00:01:27.670> with<00:01:27.910> me<00:01:27.940> here<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:31.390> will<00:01:31.540> be<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.720> first

bear with me here this will be the first
man<00:01:32.530> with<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.860> British<00:01:33.130> motor

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.070 

I've<00:01:53.980> got<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.250> tugboat<00:01:54.610> in<00:01:55.600> case<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:55.990> gets

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
I've got a tugboat in case it gets

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:18.839 
I've got a tugboat in case it gets
stalled<00:01:56.440> out<00:01:56.680> there<00:01:56.890> which<00:01:57.070> they<00:01:57.300> often<00:01:58.300> do

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.470 

Cindy<00:02:19.849> gone<00:02:20.030> fine<00:02:21.280> my<00:02:22.280> concern<00:02:22.700> was<00:02:22.909> that<00:02:22.969> you

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
Cindy gone fine my concern was that you

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.000 
Cindy gone fine my concern was that you
know<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.599> don't<00:02:23.989> have<00:02:24.019> any<00:02:24.230> protection<00:02:24.469> over

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
know I don't have any protection over

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:36.580 
know I don't have any protection over
the<00:02:25.099> motor<00:02:29.230> for<00:02:30.230> uh<00:02:34.659> you<00:02:35.659> know<00:02:35.689> when<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:36.049> that

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
the motor for uh you know when that that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.250 
the motor for uh you know when that that
brushless<00:02:36.889> doesn't<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.629> really<00:02:41.959> wants<00:02:42.230> to

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
brushless doesn't and it really wants to

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.190 
brushless doesn't and it really wants to
go<00:02:42.439> in<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.680> circle<00:02:46.450> but<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.599> does<00:02:47.780> get<00:02:47.989> right

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
go in a circle but it does get right

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:57.069 
go in a circle but it does get right
about<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.709> law<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:56.450> know<00:02:56.540> that's<00:02:56.780> kind<00:02:56.959> of

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
about the law you know that's kind of

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.470 
about the law you know that's kind of
neat<00:02:57.260> information<00:02:57.439> for<00:02:58.040> me<00:02:58.129> that<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:59.269> boat

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
neat information for me that the boat

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.199 
neat information for me that the boat
itself<00:02:59.870> can't<00:03:00.200> handle<00:03:00.680> much<00:03:01.489> more<00:03:01.790> than<00:03:01.969> that

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
itself can't handle much more than that

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.890 
itself can't handle much more than that
brushed<00:03:02.840> motor<00:03:03.169> anyway<00:03:04.419> so<00:03:05.419> it<00:03:05.659> was<00:03:05.780> about

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
brushed motor anyway so it was about

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.080 
brushed motor anyway so it was about
that<00:03:06.319> it<00:03:06.560> was<00:03:06.680> about<00:03:06.889> as<00:03:07.099> high<00:03:07.280> as<00:03:07.310> speed<00:03:07.790> as<00:03:07.939> it

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
that it was about as high as speed as it

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:28.130 
that it was about as high as speed as it
to<00:03:08.239> give

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.540 

see<00:03:29.140> that<00:03:29.290> brush<00:03:29.500> motor<00:03:29.740> can<00:03:30.040> push<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.310> lot

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
see that brush motor can push a lot

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.270 
see that brush motor can push a lot
harder<00:03:30.820> but<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:32.350> doesn't<00:03:32.650> get<00:03:32.770> it<00:03:32.860> going<00:03:33.100> any

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
harder but it doesn't get it going any

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.550 
harder but it doesn't get it going any
faster<00:03:33.630> one<00:03:34.630> thing<00:03:34.810> that's<00:03:34.960> nice<00:03:35.080> about<00:03:35.140> this

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
faster one thing that's nice about this

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.420 
faster one thing that's nice about this
is<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:38.200> have<00:03:38.410> all<00:03:38.560> my<00:03:38.590> low-voltage

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
is is that I have all my low-voltage

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:49.830 
is is that I have all my low-voltage
protection<00:03:40.270> and<00:03:40.420> everything<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:48.570> steers<00:03:49.570> fine

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
protection and everything so steers fine

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.780 
protection and everything so steers fine
at<00:03:50.050> about<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:50.440> speed<00:03:53.250> he<00:03:54.250> just<00:03:54.430> doesn't<00:03:54.670> want

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
at about that speed he just doesn't want

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.460 
at about that speed he just doesn't want
to<00:03:54.820> come<00:03:55.030> this<00:03:55.210> way<00:03:55.420> very<00:03:55.660> well<00:03:55.930> at<00:03:56.170> a<00:03:56.230> low

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
to come this way very well at a low

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.610 
to come this way very well at a low
speed<00:03:57.420> she<00:03:58.420> wants<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.810> flip<00:03:59.020> around<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.500> other

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
speed she wants to flip around the other

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.459 
speed she wants to flip around the other
way<00:03:59.740> well

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:05.469 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.740 

yeah<00:04:06.469> see<00:04:06.799> how<00:04:06.890> it<00:04:07.040> just<00:04:07.269> really<00:04:08.269> can't<00:04:08.540> handle

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
yeah see how it just really can't handle

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.780 
yeah see how it just really can't handle
much<00:04:09.079> more<00:04:09.109> than<00:04:09.469> that<00:04:09.500> brush<00:04:09.859> motor<00:04:10.189> so

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
much more than that brush motor so

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.190 
much more than that brush motor so
that's<00:04:10.969> good<00:04:11.209> information<00:04:11.359> that's<00:04:11.959> neat

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
that's good information that's neat

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.199 
that's good information that's neat
problem<00:04:12.980> with<00:04:13.159> the<00:04:13.280> brush<00:04:13.459> motor<00:04:14.109> is<00:04:15.109> that<00:04:15.439> I

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
problem with the brush motor is that I

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.749 
problem with the brush motor is that I
only<00:04:17.209> have<00:04:17.509> seven<00:04:18.079> point<00:04:18.289> four<00:04:18.560> lipos<00:04:19.100> and

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 
only have seven point four lipos and

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.469 
only have seven point four lipos and
that<00:04:20.509> brush<00:04:20.720> motor<00:04:21.019> really<00:04:21.620> needs<00:04:21.889> about<00:04:22.729> you

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
that brush motor really needs about you

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.210 
that brush motor really needs about you
know<00:04:23.600> since<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:23.990> seven<00:04:24.289> point<00:04:24.500> four<00:04:24.710> goes

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
know since that seven point four goes

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.850 
know since that seven point four goes
for<00:04:25.550> about<00:04:25.610> ten<00:04:26.150> minutes<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:26.630> shuts<00:04:26.870> off<00:04:27.080> not

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
for about ten minutes it shuts off not

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.200 
for about ten minutes it shuts off not
because<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.460> low<00:04:28.610> voltage<00:04:28.789> protection

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
because of the low voltage protection

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.540 
because of the low voltage protection
but<00:04:29.720> because<00:04:30.020> it<00:04:30.710> just<00:04:30.860> doesn't<00:04:31.100> have<00:04:31.310> enough

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
but because it just doesn't have enough

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.460 
but because it just doesn't have enough
voltage<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:31.940> turn<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.449> tightened<00:04:32.900> motor

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.839 

play<00:04:36.470> she's<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.370> our<00:04:37.490> Eastern

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
play she's a of our Eastern

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.240 
play she's a of our Eastern
something<00:04:38.270> huh<00:04:38.419> I<00:04:38.810> can<00:04:39.740> give<00:04:39.889> it<00:04:39.919> to<00:04:40.130> go

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
something huh I can give it to go

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.890 
something huh I can give it to go
straight<00:04:40.310> if<00:04:40.759> I<00:04:40.910> go<00:04:41.120> really<00:04:41.389> fast

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
straight if I go really fast

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.839 
straight if I go really fast
yeah<00:04:42.860> that<00:04:43.009> brushless<00:04:43.250> motor<00:04:43.639> is<00:04:43.880> like

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
yeah that brushless motor is like

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:51.189 
yeah that brushless motor is like
amazing<00:04:46.849> I<00:04:49.240> had<00:04:50.240> a<00:04:50.270> voice<00:04:50.539> in<00:04:50.720> my<00:04:50.750> head<00:04:50.990> saying

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
amazing I had a voice in my head saying

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.990 
amazing I had a voice in my head saying
you're<00:04:51.410> gonna<00:04:51.500> leave<00:04:51.770> it<00:04:52.039> yeah<00:04:52.310> you<00:04:52.520> know<00:04:52.550> cuz

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
you're gonna leave it yeah you know cuz

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.290 
you're gonna leave it yeah you know cuz
I<00:04:53.120> came<00:04:54.050> out<00:04:54.289> here<00:04:54.560> I<00:04:54.889> think<00:04:55.849> it's<00:04:56.090> going

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
I came out here I think it's going

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.770 
I came out here I think it's going
pretty<00:04:56.360> good

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
pretty good

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.710 
pretty good
and<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:58.250> glassy<00:04:58.699> water<00:04:58.940> blow<00:04:59.210> you<00:04:59.270> can't<00:04:59.539> use

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
and the glassy water blow you can't use

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.280 
and the glassy water blow you can't use
that

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
that

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.390 
that
and<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.950> price<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.700> price<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.120> rather<00:05:04.400> my

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
and the price the price is rather my

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.020 
and the price the price is rather my
poor<00:05:05.940> mini<00:05:06.210> has<00:05:07.020> been<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:07.610> subject<00:05:08.610> for

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
poor mini has been the subject for

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.670 
poor mini has been the subject for
mineus<00:05:09.360> experiment<00:05:12.080> so<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.110> must<00:05:13.320> have<00:05:13.380> some

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
mineus experiment so I must have some

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:28.279 
mineus experiment so I must have some
crop<00:05:13.980> angle<00:05:14.490> stuff<00:05:14.760> going<00:05:15.120> on<00:05:15.210> that<00:05:15.510> it's<00:05:15.870> uh

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:50.210 

because<00:05:29.289> I<00:05:29.379> can<00:05:29.500> only<00:05:29.560> get<00:05:29.860> it<00:05:29.979> to<00:05:30.069> go<00:05:30.189> straight

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.530 

because<00:05:51.220> I<00:05:51.310> can<00:05:51.460> tell<00:05:51.610> about<00:05:51.790> the<00:05:52.090> speed<00:05:52.390> it

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
because I can tell about the speed it

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.370 
because I can tell about the speed it
can<00:05:52.660> handle

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:06.200 

bringing<00:05:59.010> in<00:05:59.130> say<00:05:59.310> they<00:05:59.430> look<00:05:59.610> better<00:06:04.940> yeah<00:06:05.940> so

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
bringing in say they look better yeah so

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.390 
bringing in say they look better yeah so
again<00:06:06.330> my<00:06:06.780> concern<00:06:07.260> was<00:06:07.530> I<00:06:07.920> don't<00:06:08.190> have

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
again my concern was I don't have

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.670 
again my concern was I don't have
anything<00:06:08.610> on<00:06:08.880> there<00:06:09.210> it's<00:06:09.810> just<00:06:10.020> just<00:06:10.530> the

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
anything on there it's just just the

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.990 
anything on there it's just just the
motor<00:06:10.890> so<00:06:11.130> my<00:06:11.250> concern<00:06:11.430> is<00:06:11.580> can<00:06:11.970> that

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
motor so my concern is can that

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.150 
motor so my concern is can that
brushless<00:06:12.360> handle<00:06:12.960> cuz<00:06:13.560> I<00:06:13.650> thought<00:06:13.860> it<00:06:14.040> was

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
brushless handle cuz I thought it was

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.910 
brushless handle cuz I thought it was
the<00:06:14.280> water<00:06:14.490> knocking<00:06:15.390> that<00:06:15.570> brush<00:06:16.380> motor<00:06:16.650> out

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
the water knocking that brush motor out

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.920 
the water knocking that brush motor out
but<00:06:17.100> it<00:06:17.220> wasn't<00:06:17.400> it<00:06:17.640> just<00:06:17.820> it<00:06:18.210> needs<00:06:18.450> a<00:06:18.630> certain

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
but it wasn't it just it needs a certain

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.980 
but it wasn't it just it needs a certain
voltage<00:06:19.080> to<00:06:19.800> to<00:06:20.430> turn<00:06:20.640> those<00:06:20.850> that<00:06:21.630> are<00:06:21.810> mature

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
voltage to to turn those that are mature

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.520 
voltage to to turn those that are mature
and<00:06:23.420> so<00:06:24.420> you<00:06:24.480> know<00:06:24.750> I<00:06:24.780> don't<00:06:25.050> know<00:06:25.140> if<00:06:25.260> I'll<00:06:25.380> go

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
and so you know I don't know if I'll go

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.800 
and so you know I don't know if I'll go
brush<00:06:25.770> I<00:06:26.100> think<00:06:26.370> I<00:06:26.490> need<00:06:26.640> some<00:06:26.850> new<00:06:27.000> design<00:06:27.360> my

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
brush I think I need some new design my

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.770 
brush I think I need some new design my
my<00:06:28.650> my<00:06:29.100> things<00:06:29.400> get<00:06:29.610> some<00:06:29.820> condensation<00:06:30.210> in

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
my my things get some condensation in

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.130 
my my things get some condensation in
there<00:06:31.020> so<00:06:31.470> you<00:06:31.530> know<00:06:31.800> this<00:06:32.370> was<00:06:32.580> my<00:06:32.610> third<00:06:33.450> boat

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
there so you know this was my third boat

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.870 
there so you know this was my third boat
prototype<00:06:34.680> of<00:06:34.860> my<00:06:34.950> second<00:06:35.340> outrigger<00:06:35.700> and<00:06:35.790> I

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
prototype of my second outrigger and I

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.840 
prototype of my second outrigger and I
got<00:06:36.030> a<00:06:36.060> nice<00:06:36.270> carbon<00:06:36.750> fiber<00:06:37.020> for<00:06:37.380> that<00:06:37.760> for<00:06:38.760> the

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
got a nice carbon fiber for that for the

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.930 
got a nice carbon fiber for that for the
poles<00:06:39.120> here<00:06:39.570> I<00:06:39.810> just<00:06:40.650> love<00:06:41.040> all<00:06:41.070> the<00:06:41.310> words<00:06:41.520> for

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
poles here I just love all the words for

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.360 
poles here I just love all the words for
for<00:06:42.660> the<00:06:42.750> boats<00:06:42.990> you<00:06:43.200> know<00:06:43.230> like<00:06:43.530> the<00:06:43.650> sponsons

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
for the boats you know like the sponsons

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:54.920 
for the boats you know like the sponsons
and<00:06:45.320> prop<00:06:52.970> and<00:06:53.970> you<00:06:54.090> know<00:06:54.210> I<00:06:54.240> kind<00:06:54.540> of<00:06:54.600> said<00:06:54.810> to

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
and prop and you know I kind of said to
