something that's very weird and caught

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.270 
something that's very weird and caught
my<00:04:48.090> eye<00:04:48.120> because<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.870> was<00:04:49.020> weird<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:49.590> is

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
my eye because it was weird and that is

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.700 
my eye because it was weird and that is
these<00:04:50.490> cotton<00:04:51.150> candy<00:04:51.600> creams<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.440> they're
