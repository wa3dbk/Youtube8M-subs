goes way up pressure goes way up and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.650 
goes way up pressure goes way up and
we're<00:00:32.369> trying<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.669> find<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> work<00:00:33.149> done<00:00:33.450> in

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
we're trying to find the work done in

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.750 
we're trying to find the work done in
that<00:00:34.110> process<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.860> yes<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.340> use<00:00:35.520> this

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
that process and yes we use this

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.479 
that process and yes we use this
equation<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.930> previous<00:00:37.340> example<00:00:38.340> but

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
equation in the previous example but

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.000 
equation in the previous example but
what<00:00:38.910> we're<00:00:39.030> going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.300> do<00:00:39.450> now<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.710> also<00:00:40.710> just

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
what we're going to do now and also just

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.799 
what we're going to do now and also just
to<00:00:41.160> remind<00:00:41.550> ourselves<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:42.180> find<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
to remind ourselves to find the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.180 
to remind ourselves to find the
temperatures<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.469> also<00:00:43.620> use<00:00:43.890> this

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
temperatures we also use this

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.860 
temperatures we also use this
relationship<00:00:44.760> between<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.450> temperature<00:00:45.629> and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
relationship between the temperature and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229 
relationship between the temperature and
the<00:00:45.989> volume<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.620> an<00:00:46.680> adiabatic<00:00:46.890> process<00:00:47.239> but

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the volume for an adiabatic process but

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.610 
the volume for an adiabatic process but
we're<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.899> something<00:00:49.170> different

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
we're going to do something different

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.439 
we're going to do something different
here<00:00:49.649> we're<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.309> use<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.820> gas<00:00:51.090> equation

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
here we're going to use the gas equation

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.720 
here we're going to use the gas equation
that<00:00:52.079> says<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.559> PV<00:00:53.309> equals<00:00:54.000> n<00:00:54.180> RT<00:00:55.579> there<00:00:56.579> go

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that says that PV equals n RT there go

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.420 
that says that PV equals n RT there go
and<00:00:56.940> solve<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.230> temperature<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.309> we

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and solve this for temperature so if we

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.029 
and solve this for temperature so if we
do<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.579> we<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.690> temperature<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.590> equal<00:01:01.800> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
do that we get temperature is equal to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.950 
do that we get temperature is equal to
PV<00:01:02.730> ache<00:01:02.969> over<00:01:03.239> NR<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:06.570> we're<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
PV ache over NR and so we're going to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.310 
PV ache over NR and so we're going to
replace<00:01:07.229> T<00:01:07.619> 2<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.920> T<00:01:08.100> 1<00:01:08.130> by<00:01:08.549> P<00:01:08.610> V<00:01:09.119> over<00:01:09.630> N<00:01:09.810> R<00:01:10.020> now

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
replace T 2 and T 1 by P V over N R now

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.460 
replace T 2 and T 1 by P V over N R now
when<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.950> notice<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.990> we<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.140> work

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
when we do that notice that we get work

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.550 
when we do that notice that we get work
done<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.950> equal<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.400> minus<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.000> C<00:01:15.570> sub<00:01:15.840> P<00:01:15.869> over

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
done is equal to minus and C sub P over

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.340 
done is equal to minus and C sub P over
N<00:01:16.740> R<00:01:17.009> because<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.180> factor<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> NR<00:01:19.110> for

N R because I can factor out the NR for

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.820 
N R because I can factor out the NR for
the<00:01:19.439> two<00:01:20.390> terms<00:01:21.390> right<00:01:21.540> there<00:01:21.900> instead<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.320> T<00:01:22.590> -

we have the final volume because we know

think<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.159> don't<00:01:56.340> know<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.880> pressure<00:01:57.600> at

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
think we don't know is the pressure at

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.999 
think we don't know is the pressure at
the<00:01:58.469> final<00:01:59.070> state<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> gas<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.960> how<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:01.829> we

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the final state of the gas so how do we

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.950 
the final state of the gas so how do we
find<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.430> well<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.060> find<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.630> use<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
find that well to find that we use the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.630 
find that well to find that we use the
following<00:02:04.409> equation<00:02:04.829> we<00:02:05.189> use<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.490> equation

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
following equation we use the equation

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.820 
following equation we use the equation
that<00:02:06.060> p1<00:02:06.780> v1<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> gamma<00:02:08.129> equals<00:02:09.030> p2<00:02:09.420> v2<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
that p1 v1 to the gamma equals p2 v2 to

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.040 
that p1 v1 to the gamma equals p2 v2 to
the<00:02:10.920> gamma<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.599> equation

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
the gamma so just like this equation

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.890 
the gamma so just like this equation
right<00:02:13.200> here<00:02:13.230> where

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
right here where

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.929 
right here where
late<00:02:14.049> temperature<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.769> volume<00:02:14.950> we<00:02:15.579> have<00:02:15.610> this

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
late temperature and volume we have this

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.729 
late temperature and volume we have this
equation<00:02:16.209> right<00:02:16.599> here<00:02:16.659> for<00:02:17.409> adiabatic

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.789 
equation right here for adiabatic

point<00:02:24.099> four<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.640> now<00:02:25.360> what<00:02:25.599> we're<00:02:25.750> doing<00:02:25.780> is

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
point four and now what we're doing is

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.559 
point four and now what we're doing is
solve<00:02:26.409> for<00:02:26.500> p2<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.519> when<00:02:27.670> we<00:02:27.790> do<00:02:27.939> that<00:02:28.120> we<00:02:28.390> get

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
solve for p2 so when we do that we get

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.640 
solve for p2 so when we do that we get
p2<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:30.459> equal<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.849> p1<00:02:31.049> we're<00:02:32.049> going<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.379> divide

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
p2 is equal to p1 we're going to divide

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.009 
p2 is equal to p1 we're going to divide
both<00:02:32.829> sides<00:02:33.099> by<00:02:33.250> v2<00:02:33.609> to<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.090> gamma<00:02:34.299> so<00:02:34.689> we<00:02:34.810> hand

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
both sides by v2 to the gamma so we hand

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.640 
both sides by v2 to the gamma so we hand
up<00:02:35.170> with<00:02:35.349> v1<00:02:35.829> over<00:02:36.010> v2<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.569> gamma<00:02:38.140> power

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
up with v1 over v2 to the gamma power

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.750 
up with v1 over v2 to the gamma power
remember<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.819> v1<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.980> 15<00:02:41.980> times<00:02:42.280> as<00:02:42.459> big<00:02:42.609> as

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
remember that v1 is 15 times as big as

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.680 
remember that v1 is 15 times as big as
v2<00:02:43.269> so<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.959> ratio<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.439> 15<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.040> 1<00:02:45.220> gamma<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.940> 1.4

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
v2 so that ratio is 15 to 1 gamma is 1.4

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.470 
v2 so that ratio is 15 to 1 gamma is 1.4
so<00:02:47.319> p2<00:02:48.329> is<00:02:49.329> equal<00:02:49.629> to<00:02:49.840> 1<00:02:50.019> atmosphere<00:02:51.150> times<00:02:52.150> the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
so p2 is equal to 1 atmosphere times the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.619 
so p2 is equal to 1 atmosphere times the
ratio<00:02:52.659> of<00:02:52.900> 15<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.040> 1.4<00:02:54.790> power<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.599> a

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
ratio of 15 to the 1.4 power but a

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.339 
ratio of 15 to the 1.4 power but a
calculator<00:02:56.109> 15<00:02:56.829> raised<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.120> 1.4<00:02:58.870> power

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
calculator 15 raised to the 1.4 power

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.160 
calculator 15 raised to the 1.4 power
is<00:02:59.530> forty<00:03:00.220> four<00:03:00.459> point<00:03:00.700> three<00:03:00.849> so<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.930> means

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
is forty four point three so that means

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.619 
is forty four point three so that means
that<00:03:02.379> this<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.739> equal<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.159> forty<00:03:03.639> four<00:03:04.030> point

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
that this is equal to forty four point

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.349 
that this is equal to forty four point
three<00:03:04.810> atmospheres<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:06.129> so<00:03:06.639> that<00:03:06.819> means<00:03:07.030> that

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
three atmospheres and so that means that

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.170 
three atmospheres and so that means that
now<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:07.780> have<00:03:08.109> both<00:03:08.409> the<00:03:09.220> initial<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.120> final

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
now we have both the initial and final

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.270 
now we have both the initial and final
pressure<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.230> initial<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.769> final<00:03:11.799> volume

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
pressure the initial and final volume

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.009 
pressure the initial and final volume
and<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.909> should<00:03:13.150> be<00:03:13.239> able<00:03:13.389> to<00:03:13.480> find<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.810> work

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
and I should be able to find the work

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.050 
and I should be able to find the work
done<00:03:14.049> using<00:03:15.040> pressure<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.549> volume<00:03:15.670> in<00:03:15.970> this

but<00:03:52.030> now<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:52.299> course<00:03:52.479> we<00:03:52.750> have<00:03:52.780> atmospheres

that<00:04:00.099> to<00:04:00.159> cubic<00:04:00.549> meters<00:04:00.879> so<00:04:01.769> let<00:04:02.769> me<00:04:02.889> put<00:04:03.069> a

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
that to cubic meters so let me put a

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.099 
that to cubic meters so let me put a
line<00:04:03.280> here<00:04:03.310> so<00:04:03.609> don't<00:04:03.909> get<00:04:04.060> this<00:04:04.150> confused<00:04:04.329> so

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
line here so don't get this confused so

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.259 
line here so don't get this confused so
we<00:04:05.199> need<00:04:05.349> a<00:04:05.379> hundred<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:06.299> 1300<00:04:07.299> Pascal's<00:04:08.190> per

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
we need a hundred and 1300 Pascal's per

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.530 
we need a hundred and 1300 Pascal's per
atmosphere<00:04:10.269> so<00:04:10.930> that's<00:04:11.139> a<00:04:11.229> conversion<00:04:11.620> that

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
atmosphere so that's a conversion that

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.699 
atmosphere so that's a conversion that
scales<00:04:13.540> of<00:04:13.720> course<00:04:13.930> are<00:04:14.109> Newton's<00:04:14.500> per<00:04:14.680> square

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
scales of course are Newton's per square

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.800 
scales of course are Newton's per square
meter<00:04:14.979> and<00:04:15.459> then<00:04:16.000> we<00:04:16.090> have<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.329> convert<00:04:16.630> from

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
meter and then we have to convert from

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.819 
meter and then we have to convert from
leaders<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.380> cubic<00:04:17.829> meters<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:18.760> we<00:04:18.789> have<00:04:19.829> 0.001

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
leaders to cubic meters so we have 0.001

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.959 
leaders to cubic meters so we have 0.001
meters<00:04:21.430> cubed<00:04:21.940> divided<00:04:22.690> by<00:04:22.719> 1<00:04:23.590> liter<00:04:24.159> and<00:04:24.430> the

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:24.969 
meters cubed divided by 1 liter and the

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.810 
meters cubed divided by 1 liter and the
notice<00:04:25.389> that<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:26.139> atmospheres<00:04:27.070> cancel

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
notice that the atmospheres cancel

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.210 
notice that the atmospheres cancel
and<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.300> leaders<00:04:28.630> canceled<00:04:29.110> out<00:04:29.260> leaders<00:04:30.040> and

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
and the leaders canceled out leaders and

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.340 
and the leaders canceled out leaders and
atmospheres<00:04:30.730> and<00:04:30.880> Lisa<00:04:31.390> with<00:04:31.690> Pascal's<00:04:32.170> and

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
atmospheres and Lisa with Pascal's and

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.110 
atmospheres and Lisa with Pascal's and
cubic<00:04:32.620> meters<00:04:32.950> and<00:04:33.100> now<00:04:33.220> we're<00:04:33.430> ready<00:04:33.580> to

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
cubic meters and now we're ready to

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.960 
cubic meters and now we're ready to
calculate<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.750> result<00:04:35.140> so<00:04:36.070> starting<00:04:36.880> out

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
calculate that result so starting out

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.160 
calculate that result so starting out
with<00:04:37.240> forty<00:04:38.080> four<00:04:38.350> point<00:04:39.250> three<00:04:39.750> times<00:04:40.750> point

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
with forty four point three times point

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.970 
with forty four point three times point
5<00:04:41.500> divided<00:04:42.160> by<00:04:42.190> 15<00:04:43.320> we<00:04:44.320> subtract<00:04:44.770> from<00:04:44.890> that

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
5 divided by 15 we subtract from that

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.200 
5 divided by 15 we subtract from that
point<00:04:45.460> five<00:04:46.980> we<00:04:47.980> multiply<00:04:48.520> times<00:04:48.850> two<00:04:49.060> point

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
point five we multiply times two point

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.660 
point five we multiply times two point
five<00:04:51.180> we<00:04:52.180> multiply<00:04:52.750> times<00:04:53.290> 101<00:04:54.040> three<00:04:54.340> hundred

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
five we multiply times 101 three hundred

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.890 
five we multiply times 101 three hundred
and<00:04:54.910> we<00:04:55.150> divide<00:04:55.480> by<00:04:55.690> a<00:04:55.720> thousand<00:04:56.410> equals<00:04:57.340> and

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
and we divide by a thousand equals and

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.400 
and we divide by a thousand equals and
we're<00:04:58.900> done

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
we're done

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.710 
we're done
equals<00:04:59.920> minus<00:05:00.550> two<00:05:00.730> hundred<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.150> forty-seven

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
equals minus two hundred and forty-seven

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.020 
equals minus two hundred and forty-seven
joules<00:05:02.200> which<00:05:02.800> is<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.070> same<00:05:03.310> answer<00:05:03.700> that<00:05:03.730> we

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
joules which is the same answer that we

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.030 
joules which is the same answer that we
received<00:05:04.930> before<00:05:05.110> I<00:05:05.350> don't<00:05:05.710> have<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:05.950> whole

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
received before I don't have the whole

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.070 
received before I don't have the whole
answer<00:05:06.190> down<00:05:06.460> there<00:05:06.700> but<00:05:06.880> same<00:05:07.780> answers

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
answer down there but same answers

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.740 
answer down there but same answers
before<00:05:08.610> but<00:05:09.610> instead<00:05:09.880> of<00:05:09.940> using<00:05:10.180> temperature

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
before but instead of using temperature

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.230 
before but instead of using temperature
we<00:05:11.290> use<00:05:11.320> depression<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.310> volume<00:05:12.730> at<00:05:12.910> the

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
we use depression the volume at the

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.570 
we use depression the volume at the
beginning<00:05:13.600> then<00:05:13.960> state<00:05:14.260> notice<00:05:15.040> we<00:05:15.250> get<00:05:15.400> the

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
beginning then state notice we get the

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.730 
beginning then state notice we get the
exact<00:05:15.910> same<00:05:16.090> answer<00:05:16.240> works<00:05:16.930> just<00:05:17.200> as<00:05:17.320> well<00:05:17.350> and

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
exact same answer works just as well and

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.470 
exact same answer works just as well and
that's<00:05:18.460> how<00:05:18.640> you<00:05:18.700> work<00:05:18.940> with<00:05:18.970> adiabatic

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
that's how you work with adiabatic

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.480 
that's how you work with adiabatic
processes<00:05:20.110> so<00:05:20.380> I'm<00:05:20.500> hoping<00:05:20.860> that<00:05:20.920> these<00:05:21.190> last

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
processes so I'm hoping that these last

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.580 
processes so I'm hoping that these last
several<00:05:21.910> videos<00:05:22.330> really<00:05:23.020> help<00:05:23.410> you

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
several videos really help you

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.260 
several videos really help you
understand<00:05:24.160> how<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:24.520> work<00:05:24.790> with<00:05:24.850> adiabatic

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
understand how to work with adiabatic

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.760 
understand how to work with adiabatic
processes<00:05:25.900> normally<00:05:26.410> they're<00:05:26.530> very

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
processes normally they're very

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.250 
processes normally they're very
confusing<00:05:27.220> but<00:05:27.760> as<00:05:27.850> you<00:05:27.970> can<00:05:28.090> see<00:05:28.300> using

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
confusing but as you can see using

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.320 
confusing but as you can see using
utilizing<00:05:30.070> these<00:05:30.220> equations<00:05:30.700> it<00:05:31.030> becomes

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
utilizing these equations it becomes

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.320 
utilizing these equations it becomes
fairly<00:05:31.690> straightforward
