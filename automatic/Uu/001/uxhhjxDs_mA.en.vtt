00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
loose and just splash something all over

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.490

the<00:00:57.060> studio<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.200> see<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the studio as you can see in the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.690 
the studio as you can see in the
background<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.240> was<00:01:00.510> pretty<00:01:00.720> liberating

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.820 

my<00:01:05.700> art<00:01:06.150> style<00:01:06.480> would<00:01:06.660> be<00:01:06.840> better<00:01:07.290> described

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
my art style would be better described

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.280 
my art style would be better described
as<00:01:07.980> modern<00:01:08.310> slop<00:01:08.700> art<00:01:08.910> is<00:01:09.180> very<00:01:09.540> colorful<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
as modern slop art is very colorful a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.690 
as modern slop art is very colorful a
lot<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.530> people<00:01:10.740> compare<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.310> Andy<00:01:11.670> Warhol

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
lot of people compare it to Andy Warhol

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.000 
lot of people compare it to Andy Warhol
I<00:01:12.390> guess<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.690> because<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> iconic

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
I guess it's because of the iconic

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.770 
I guess it's because of the iconic
figures<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.550> I<00:01:14.580> use<00:01:14.910> but<00:01:15.240> my<00:01:15.360> technique<00:01:15.690> is

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
figures that I use but my technique is

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.480 
figures that I use but my technique is
very<00:01:16.020> different<00:01:16.410> I<00:01:16.650> use<00:01:16.890> acrylic<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.460> canvas

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
very different I use acrylic on canvas

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.350 
very different I use acrylic on canvas
and<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.480> I<00:01:19.010> finished<00:01:20.010> my<00:01:20.280> paintings<00:01:20.910> with<00:01:21.120> a

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and then I finished my paintings with a

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.450 
and then I finished my paintings with a
layer<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.660> resin<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.380> makes<00:01:23.010> them<00:01:23.160> very

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
layer of resin so it makes them very

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.300 
layer of resin so it makes them very
very<00:01:23.790> shiny<00:01:24.120> and<00:01:24.480> colors<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.440> big<00:01:25.980> heartedly

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
very shiny and colors are big heartedly

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.730 
very shiny and colors are big heartedly
inspiration<00:01:26.940> I<00:01:29.900> never<00:01:30.900> knew<00:01:31.230> that<00:01:31.260> I<00:01:31.530> was

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.930 
explains in 57 so before the Revolution
I<00:03:11.560> guess<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:11.980> could<00:03:12.099> describe<00:03:12.340> as<00:03:12.549> a<00:03:12.640> drama

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
I guess I could describe as a drama

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.960 
I guess I could describe as a drama
thriller<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.690> it's<00:03:14.530> about<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:15.459> revolution

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
thriller and it's about the revolution

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.210 
thriller and it's about the revolution
so<00:03:16.150> it's<00:03:16.299> about<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:17.620> drugs<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.129> the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
so it's about the drugs and the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.970 
so it's about the drugs and the
corruption<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.209> cops<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.930> play<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.769> role

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
corruption and the cops I play the role

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.069 
corruption and the cops I play the role
