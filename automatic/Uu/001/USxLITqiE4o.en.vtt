00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
connect up here with the iPad and I see

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.380 
connect up here with the iPad and I see
how<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.410> sounds<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.070> would<00:00:26.670> come<00:00:26.849> over<00:00:27.119> here

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
how it sounds so would come over here

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.810

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
up would connect up the audio so you

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.520 
up would connect up the audio so you
have<00:00:33.120> an<00:00:33.210> audio<00:00:33.540> link<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.960> you'd<00:00:34.110> connect<00:00:34.410> up

virtual mouse I'll take it over and I've
have<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> connect<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.310> had<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.610> not

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
have a connect so if I had it not

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.149 
have a connect so if I had it not
connected<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.659> light<00:01:54.869> would<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.170> black<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
connected the light would be black and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.389 
connected the light would be black and
when<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> connect<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.329> yellow<00:01:57.659> light

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
when you connect it's a yellow light

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.830 
when you connect it's a yellow light
signaling<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.909> computer<00:02:00.420> is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
signaling that is the computer is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.770 
signaling that is the computer is
connected<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.680> mm<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.240> once<00:02:03.570> it's

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
connected to the mm and once it's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.590 
connected to the mm and once it's
connect<00:02:04.140> I'd<00:02:04.320> power<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.850> you'll<00:02:06.420> see

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
connect I'd power it on and you'll see

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.410 
connect I'd power it on and you'll see
the<00:02:06.750> radio<00:02:06.990> come<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.380> light
