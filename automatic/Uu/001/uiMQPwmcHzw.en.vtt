your<00:01:06.600> iphone<00:01:07.260> will<00:01:07.619> give<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:09.320> sense<00:01:10.320> of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
your iphone will give you a sense of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.270 
your iphone will give you a sense of
turning<00:01:10.979> back<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.680> turning<00:01:13.680> left<00:01:14.070> or

cool game I want to definitely tell you
that<00:01:23.310> guys<00:01:23.520> check<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.060> off<00:01:24.299> for<00:01:24.509> sure<00:01:24.750> but

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
that guys check this off for sure but

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.830 
that guys check this off for sure but
b6o

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
b6o

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.569 
b6o
doing<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.530> well<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:30.000> car<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.450> heavy<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
doing so well the car is heavy and

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.690 
doing so well the car is heavy and
physics<00:01:32.579> are<00:01:32.729> very<00:01:32.759> very<00:01:33.570> realistic<00:01:34.670> but<00:01:35.670> I

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
physics are very very realistic but I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.330 
physics are very very realistic but I
guess<00:01:35.939> maximum<00:01:36.479> speed<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.869> 100<00:01:40.040> slow<00:01:41.040> down<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
guess maximum speed is 100 slow down a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.080 
guess maximum speed is 100 slow down a
little<00:01:41.490> bit

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
little bit

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.460 
little bit
this<00:01:42.240> turns
