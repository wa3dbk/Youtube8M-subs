00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.530
 hello friends welcome back to a 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:11.180
 new chess position 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:16.100
 ok in this case we continue with the theme 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:19.370
 of the deviation is valid but if we do not 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.820
 we realize it's time for them to say that it's their turn 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:26.090
 move the blacks and with the theme of the 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.690
 deviation earn but if not we are not 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.509
 to the parrot with the correct play that does not 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.960
 we have seen White win 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.550
 strongly worth it with which if you 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.989
 touches to move to the black the subject is 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:48.390
 sacrifice the two bishops for the tower 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:51.270
 and win a pawns end is worth 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.309
 if they do not do that, White wins now 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.040
 I say we are now going to see to 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.149
 watch the video try to stop the video from 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.809
 try to look at solving the problem to 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.800
 see if I'm capable and if I do not say it now 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:13.780
 it's worth the issue of aviation is it 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:17.049
 bishop sacrifice check what we see 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.979
 and is forced to eat 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.979
 white as 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:29.980
 Black people eat their tower worth 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 At last, forgiveness, they come back to eat at last 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.360
 and see 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.690
 how 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:45.880
 remain the black and how are the 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:50.260
 white in this in this final of the King 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.620
 has eaten on c2 and if now moves the 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.110
 we see that Black arrives earlier 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.500
 crown your pawn is worth 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:06.530
 and win in the game 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:10.210
 but in the case that the black woman does not 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.210
 give an account of this play 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.489
 White would win bluntly 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.950
 or if he touches them he will move to them they would win 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.240
 quickly with a checkmate with the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.220
 move 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.220
 tower h 3 happy 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.430
 we see that the king can not move 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.690
 because this box is controlled by 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.690
 the king with which 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.570
 is forced to eat and now with the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.320
 simple play we would not eat the bishop 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.320
 but with 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.840
 is simple is a checkmate because his 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.650
 king is imprisoned here and can not 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.940
 to leave a courageous pawn has given check 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.870
 kill the black king 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.390
