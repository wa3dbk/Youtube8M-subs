00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and these guys can have a battery life

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.389 
and these guys can have a battery life
in<00:00:45.660> excess<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.289> nine<00:00:46.860> hours<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> there<00:00:50.340> you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
in excess of nine hours so there you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.000 
in excess of nine hours so there you
have<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.850> Toshiba<00:00:51.270> wt3<00:00:51.840> 1<00:00:52.440> 0

have the Toshiba wt3 1 0

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.000 
have the Toshiba wt3 1 0
it's<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.940> twin<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:54.930> Intel<00:00:55.559> calls<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
it's a twin one is what Intel calls it

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.700 
it's a twin one is what Intel calls it
so<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.420> take<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.780> off<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> becomes<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
so you can take it off and it becomes a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:11.390 
so you can take it off and it becomes a
tablet<00:00:59.870> now<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.410> becomes<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:02.100> notebook

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.070

keyboard<00:02:41.600> is<00:02:41.750> just<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.670> mr.<00:02:43.670> talking<00:02:44.030> station

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
keyboard is just the mr. talking station

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.600 
keyboard is just the mr. talking station
so<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.780> does<00:02:44.959> not<00:02:45.110> control<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.620> tablet<00:02:46.160> in<00:02:46.310> any

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
so it does not control the tablet in any

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
so it does not control the tablet in any
way

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.100

some of the features you have a nice big
soft<00:02:55.110> keyboard<00:02:55.530> there<00:02:59.960> they<00:03:00.960> see<00:03:01.170> two<00:03:01.440> one

prices not confirmed but I assume it

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.789

should<00:04:04.569> be<00:04:04.750> between<00:04:05.019> 60<00:04:05.829> to<00:04:05.980> 80<00:04:06.189> K<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:07.799> the

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
should be between 60 to 80 K and the

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.949 
should be between 60 to 80 K and the
good<00:04:08.980> thing<00:04:09.129> about<00:04:09.220> this<00:04:09.579> guy<00:04:10.060> is<00:04:10.329> that<00:04:10.390> I

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
good thing about this guy is that I

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.199 
good thing about this guy is that I
really<00:04:11.379> find<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.829> tablet<00:04:12.069> part<00:04:12.459> very<00:04:12.970> light

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
really find the tablet part very light

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.990 
really find the tablet part very light
it<00:04:13.359> it<00:04:13.659> should<00:04:13.810> be<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:14.349> is<00:04:14.409> slightly<00:04:15.000> heavier

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
it it should be it is slightly heavier

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.140 
it it should be it is slightly heavier
than<00:04:16.269> your<00:04:16.750> usual<00:04:16.959> not<00:04:17.829> an<00:04:18.010> inch<00:04:18.190> tablet<00:04:18.609> it

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
than your usual not an inch tablet it

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.140 
than your usual not an inch tablet it
would<00:04:19.389> be<00:04:19.510> what<00:04:19.690> about<00:04:19.959> 800<00:04:20.350> grams<00:04:20.979> also<00:04:21.579> so

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
would be what about 800 grams also so

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.760 
would be what about 800 grams also so
generally<00:04:22.510> we<00:04:22.630> found<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.050> convertibles<00:04:23.680> to

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
generally we found the convertibles to

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.420 
generally we found the convertibles to
be<00:04:23.860> very<00:04:24.070> expensive<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.880> almost<00:04:25.780> unusable<00:04:26.500> in

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
be very expensive and almost unusable in

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.670 
be very expensive and almost unusable in
the<00:04:27.729> tablet<00:04:28.090> mode<00:04:28.330> but<00:04:28.600> this<00:04:28.780> guy<00:04:29.169> is<00:04:29.229> pretty

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
the tablet mode but this guy is pretty

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.730 
the tablet mode but this guy is pretty
light<00:04:30.100> considering<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.120> fact<00:04:31.389> that<00:04:31.510> it<00:04:32.320> has

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
light considering the fact that it has

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.779 
light considering the fact that it has
an<00:04:32.830> x86<00:04:33.280> processor<00:04:34.240> its<00:04:34.870> tablet<00:04:35.260> plus<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:36.580> can

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
an x86 processor its tablet plus you can

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.990 
an x86 processor its tablet plus you can
use<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.780> keyboard<00:04:38.050> here<00:04:38.410> as<00:04:38.560> well<00:04:41.849> so<00:04:42.849> that

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
use the keyboard here as well so that

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.659 
use the keyboard here as well so that
