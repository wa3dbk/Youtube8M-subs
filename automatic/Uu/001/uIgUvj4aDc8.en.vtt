00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:50.229 
every time that we look out this window

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:51.990 
every time that we look out this window
or<00:00:50.859> we<00:00:51.159> look<00:00:51.309> out<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.579> windows<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:51.940> the

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
or we look out the windows and the

or we look out the windows and the
cupola<00:00:52.449> we're<00:00:52.899> absolutely<00:00:53.229> amazed<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:54.039> and

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
cupola we're absolutely amazed and and

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.369 
cupola we're absolutely amazed and and
the<00:00:55.300> same<00:00:55.449> thing<00:00:55.510> goes<00:00:55.690> for<00:00:55.839> being<00:00:56.140> on<00:00:56.229> board

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
the same thing goes for being on board

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.039 
the same thing goes for being on board
of<00:00:56.500> space<00:00:56.710> shuttle<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:57.219> i<00:00:58.089> would<00:00:58.809> say<00:00:59.019> that

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
of space shuttle and i would say that

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:01.109 
of space shuttle and i would say that
two<00:00:59.440> nights<00:00:59.589> ago<00:00:59.829> I<00:00:59.979> probably<00:01:00.399> saw<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:00.879> most

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.119

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
amazing thing I have ever seen in space

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.680 
amazing thing I have ever seen in space
and<00:01:03.159> that's<00:01:03.699> saying<00:01:03.909> an<00:01:04.000> awful<00:01:04.269> lot<00:01:04.360> because

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
and that's saying an awful lot because

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.300 
and that's saying an awful lot because
every<00:01:04.930> day<00:01:04.960> is<00:01:05.110> filled<00:01:05.440> with<00:01:05.619> amazing<00:01:05.890> things

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310

every day is filled with amazing things
and<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:07.060> was<00:01:07.270> we<00:01:07.450> were<00:01:07.539> flying<00:01:07.780> over

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
and that was we were flying over

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.170 
and that was we were flying over
Tasmania<00:01:08.680> we'd<00:01:09.039> actually<00:01:09.250> just<00:01:09.789> seen<00:01:10.000> the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
Tasmania we'd actually just seen the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.969 
Tasmania we'd actually just seen the
storms<00:01:10.539> in<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.869> South<00:01:11.080> Pacific<00:01:11.259> over<00:01:11.890> the

storms in the South Pacific over the

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.309 
storms in the South Pacific over the
Philippines<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.759> it<00:01:13.750> was<00:01:13.899> nighttime

Philippines and it was nighttime

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.290 
Philippines and it was nighttime
thunderstorms<00:01:15.250> lighting<00:01:15.580> up<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.759> entire<00:01:15.970> sky

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
thunderstorms lighting up the entire sky

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.660 
thunderstorms lighting up the entire sky
and<00:01:16.600> then<00:01:17.200> just<00:01:17.530> before<00:01:17.679> the<00:01:17.920> Sun<00:01:18.100> came<00:01:18.310> up<00:01:18.369> the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
and then just before the Sun came up the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.279 
and then just before the Sun came up the
earth<00:01:18.789> slim<00:01:19.090> was<00:01:19.330> you<00:01:19.600> know<00:01:19.720> lit<00:01:19.960> up<00:01:20.080> as<00:01:20.259> a

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
earth slim was you know lit up as a

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.730 
earth slim was you know lit up as a
sliver<00:01:20.890> of<00:01:21.009> blue<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:21.759> in<00:01:22.420> purple<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.350> then

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
sliver of blue and in purple and then

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.289 
sliver of blue and in purple and then
there<00:01:23.920> was<00:01:23.979> this<00:01:24.159> long<00:01:24.460> green<00:01:24.850> arc<00:01:25.090> that

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
there was this long green arc that

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.300 
there was this long green arc that
extended<00:01:25.810> probably<00:01:26.289> 10<00:01:26.530> degrees<00:01:26.830> or<00:01:26.979> so<00:01:27.130> from

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
extended probably 10 degrees or so from

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.730 
extended probably 10 degrees or so from
the<00:01:27.460> horizon<00:01:28.140> actually<00:01:29.140> from<00:01:29.619> the

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
the horizon actually from the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.680 
the horizon actually from the
perspective<00:01:30.250> of<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.399> cupola<00:01:30.880> which<00:01:31.090> in<00:01:31.479> which

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
perspective of the cupola which in which

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.109 
perspective of the cupola which in which
case<00:01:31.869> we're<00:01:32.080> upside<00:01:32.380> down<00:01:32.619> up<00:01:32.920> up<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.850> know<00:01:33.970> in

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
case we're upside down up up you know in

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.669 
case we're upside down up up you know in
my<00:01:34.270> field<00:01:34.539> of<00:01:34.659> view<00:01:34.780> upwards<00:01:35.170> in<00:01:35.350> fact<00:01:35.560> it

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
my field of view upwards in fact it

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.949 
my field of view upwards in fact it
disappeared<00:01:36.159> behind<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.640> gym<00:01:36.880> at<00:01:37.330> least<00:01:37.720> 10

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:37.959 
disappeared behind the gym at least 10

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.190 
disappeared behind the gym at least 10
degrees<00:01:38.259> i<00:01:38.440> think<00:01:38.740> twenty<00:01:39.310> earth<00:01:39.700> 20<00:01:40.479> moon

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
degrees i think twenty earth 20 moon

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.870 
degrees i think twenty earth 20 moon
diameters<00:01:41.860> if<00:01:42.100> you<00:01:42.220> think<00:01:42.459> about<00:01:42.549> it<00:01:42.700> in<00:01:42.850> those

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
diameters if you think about it in those

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.089 
diameters if you think about it in those
terms<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.539> i<00:01:43.929> had<00:01:44.050> no<00:01:44.200> idea<00:01:44.229> what<00:01:44.679> it<00:01:44.709> was<00:01:44.890> he

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099 
terms and i had no idea what it was he

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.760 
terms and i had no idea what it was he
was<00:01:45.129> a<00:01:45.250> long<00:01:45.489> green<00:01:45.910> glowing<00:01:46.270> arc<00:01:46.599> and<00:01:46.780> turns

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
was a long green glowing arc and turns

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.350 
was a long green glowing arc and turns
out<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.160> end<00:01:48.310> up<00:01:48.489> being<00:01:48.520> ended<00:01:48.970> up<00:01:49.060> being<00:01:49.239> a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
out it end up being ended up being a

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.630 
out it end up being ended up being a
comet<00:01:49.840> that<00:01:50.080> somebody<00:01:50.679> in<00:01:50.800> Tasmania<00:01:51.340> had<00:01:51.429> seen

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
comet that somebody in Tasmania had seen

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.999 
comet that somebody in Tasmania had seen
about<00:01:51.849> the<00:01:52.000> same<00:01:52.209> time<00:01:52.239> comet<00:01:52.899> lovejoy<00:01:53.050> that

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
about the same time comet lovejoy that

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.490 
about the same time comet lovejoy that
had<00:01:54.190> passed<00:01:54.369> about<00:01:54.899> 140,000<00:01:55.899> kilometres<00:01:55.989> from

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
had passed about 140,000 kilometres from

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.440 
had passed about 140,000 kilometres from
the<00:01:56.649> surface<00:01:56.860> of<00:01:57.129> the<00:01:57.220> Sun<00:01:57.700> when<00:01:58.420> it

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
the surface of the Sun when it

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.119 
the surface of the Sun when it
disappeared<00:01:59.080> behind<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.470> Sun<00:01:59.679> I<00:01:59.920> think

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:00.129 
disappeared behind the Sun I think

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:01.770 
disappeared behind the Sun I think
astronomers<00:02:00.640> thought<00:02:00.819> it<00:02:01.090> would<00:02:01.269> not<00:02:01.450> appear

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
astronomers thought it would not appear

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.660 
astronomers thought it would not appear
again<00:02:01.989> it<00:02:02.140> probably<00:02:02.440> would<00:02:02.560> burn<00:02:02.709> up<00:02:02.920> but<00:02:03.489> it's

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
again it probably would burn up but it's

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.490 
again it probably would burn up but it's
probably<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.239> most<00:02:04.420> spectacular<00:02:04.750> thing<00:02:05.229> you

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
probably the most spectacular thing you

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.719 
probably the most spectacular thing you
can<00:02:05.649> imagine<00:02:05.679> and<00:02:06.190> from<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.429> vantage<00:02:06.610> point

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
can imagine and from the vantage point

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.180 
can imagine and from the vantage point
of<00:02:07.030> space<00:02:07.300> it's<00:02:08.110> different<00:02:08.590> than<00:02:08.769> seeing<00:02:09.039> it

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
of space it's different than seeing it

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.710 
of space it's different than seeing it
from<00:02:09.429> Planet<00:02:09.819> Earth<00:02:09.910> because<00:02:10.330> there's<00:02:10.539> no

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
from Planet Earth because there's no

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.110 
from Planet Earth because there's no
intervening<00:02:11.110> atmosphere<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.860> see<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.790> we<00:02:12.970> took

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
intervening atmosphere to see so we took

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.089 
intervening atmosphere to see so we took
some<00:02:13.330> really<00:02:13.870> neat<00:02:14.050> pictures<00:02:14.410> last<00:02:14.830> night<00:02:14.980> a

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
some really neat pictures last night a

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.860 
some really neat pictures last night a
bit<00:02:15.310> about<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.519> hundred<00:02:15.730> or<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.420> we<00:02:16.510> hope

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
bit about a hundred or so that we hope

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.470 
bit about a hundred or so that we hope
to<00:02:17.019> make<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.170> movie<00:02:17.530> out<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.830> but<00:02:18.069> just<00:02:18.480> wanted

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
to make a movie out of but just wanted

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.580 
to make a movie out of but just wanted
to<00:02:19.569> toss<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.959> out<00:02:20.019> in<00:02:20.260> case<00:02:20.440> you're

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590
