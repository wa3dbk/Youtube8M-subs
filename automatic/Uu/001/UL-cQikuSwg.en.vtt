00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.580
 Hey guys I find Flow and I have something from the rumor mill again 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.560
 from Apple for you 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.350
 by watching a video he saw that on the twentieth of October 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.520
 The new Apple Keynote will be held covered with the theme that is to say 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.529
 it will be about the Macs 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.800
 and probably a new MAK buck 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.470
 he introduced 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.810
 and also in power times 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.840
 Checks in the last few days already have individual stores details about these 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.409
 see new MacBook Air 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:30.669
 and 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.960
 that really terrifying that yes me if you as 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.920
 Just introduce Helfrich 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.200
 Although this MacBook would like to be exactly 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.400
 It is already rather thin to Zeil I do not know if it is still the thinnest 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.780
 Günzler wants to be dead 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.260
 Percent that moment gives but it will be even thinner 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.320
 it is supposed to be 6 2 m tall next to it 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.970
 two stood a little taller m are smaller than it must have now 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.290
 it should be on the new operating system Lion also with this keynote 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.340
 presented 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.580
 will be ten points 7 based 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.650
 and then comes the absolute hammer that is something completely new countries in things 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.570
 technology 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.280
 and it should probably be a flash-based one 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.650
 credit 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.220
 and that means that 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.500
 the Mac Book Air at your fingertips instantly 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.140
 starts so press the button and the computer immediately started up 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.120
 how this works technically 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.420
 I do not know exactly there on the twentieth of October 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.570
 to get 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.210
 and we are now guessed picture with so four plates 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.610
 that's the inside of the new MacBook Air and that's batteries 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.330
 that means the battery is much better than it already was 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.770
 probably even better than the MacBook pro or CER moment I have 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.240
 twelve hours are 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.299
 and year 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.860
 Of course even better is a blatant thing 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.610
 and for weir «he also has tracked my videos on photo lousy tutorials 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.559
 maybe the video seen usb3 customers 0 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.899
 the Pre will also be a theme here on the new MacBook Air 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.419
 namely it should be the first Noack Bocas 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.229
 has usb3 dolls and support 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:23.699
 he recognizes all the minister Cindy has her normally that's Urs b 2 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:27.379
 Points only when he often sees files because everything is really fast 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.860
 with bus picture old clock, the whole thing should go much faster 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.589
 and yes, Metelen 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:34.819
 EA the 9th 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.819
 it may be possible soon 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:42.569
 of course, the Wars is of course also at the Keynote am 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.919
 20th of October 2010 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.420
 and I thank you already for looking 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.209
 I'm curious what is really true and what is not 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.189
 we are not like Dirk me the bike
