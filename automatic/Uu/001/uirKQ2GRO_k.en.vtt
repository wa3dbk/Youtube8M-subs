00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.630 
and the idea behind this device is it
mounts<00:01:39.570> right<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.109> top<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.500> here<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.829> it's

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
mounts right on top of here and it's

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.630 
mounts right on top of here and it's
designed<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:43.409> allow<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.770> head<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.310> move<00:01:44.490> in

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
designed to to allow the head to move in

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.389 
designed to to allow the head to move in
any<00:01:44.789> direction<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.840> out<00:01:45.960> side<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> side

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
any direction in and out side to side

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.999 
any direction in and out side to side
circles<00:01:48.329> whatever<00:01:48.929> their<00:01:49.170> their<00:01:49.560> head<00:01:49.740> feels

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
circles whatever their their head feels

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.800 
circles whatever their their head feels
like<00:01:50.250> doing<00:01:50.460> as<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.850> move<00:01:51.030> their<00:01:51.240> body<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.689> we

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
like doing as you move their body so we

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.169 
like doing as you move their body so we
get<00:01:51.960> rid<00:01:52.109> of<00:01:52.140> cervical<00:01:52.700> compression<00:01:53.700> when

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
get rid of cervical compression when

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.849 
get rid of cervical compression when
you're<00:01:54.299> working<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> back<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.590> very

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
you're working in the back it's very

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
like it's floating by the time you put

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.490 
like it's floating by the time you put
this<00:02:26.770> system<00:02:26.980> together<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:28.210> can<00:02:28.390> see<00:02:28.720> how

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
this system together you can see how

this system together you can see how
easily<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:30.280> moves<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:30.940> takes<00:02:31.180> all<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.480> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
easily this moves this takes all of the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.480 
easily this moves this takes all of the
tension<00:02:32.200> out<00:02:32.320> of<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.560> person's<00:02:32.980> neck<00:02:33.250> and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
tension out of the person's neck and

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.120 
tension out of the person's neck and
releases<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.660> pressure<00:02:34.960> on<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.440> faces<00:02:35.920> is

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
releases the pressure on the faces is

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.520 
releases the pressure on the faces is
very<00:02:36.610> minimal<00:02:36.880> in<00:02:37.210> this<00:02:37.330> case<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.230> makes<00:02:38.410> an

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
very minimal in this case so it makes an

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.070 
very minimal in this case so it makes an
incredibly<00:02:39.160> comfortable<00:02:40.090> system<00:02:40.600> between

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
incredibly comfortable system between

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.550 
incredibly comfortable system between
this<00:02:41.680> face<00:02:41.980> rest<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:43.600> narrow<00:02:43.840> cell<00:02:44.140> padded

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
this face rest and a narrow cell padded

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.460 
this face rest and a narrow cell padded
table<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.340> have<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.970> setup<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.930> will<00:02:47.290> make
