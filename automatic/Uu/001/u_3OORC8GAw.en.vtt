bathroom fixtures and I've got like

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.630 
bathroom fixtures and I've got like
examples<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.740> shower<00:00:32.040> tray<00:00:32.279> we've<00:00:32.460> got

examples like the shower tray we've got

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.389 
examples like the shower tray we've got
here<00:00:32.850> ok<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.480> I'm<00:00:33.809> how<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.050> works<00:00:34.230> well<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.219> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
here ok so I'm how it works well it's a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.690 
here ok so I'm how it works well it's a
it's<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.730> process<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.739> basically<00:00:38.129> taking

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
it's a process and it's basically taking

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.130 
it's a process and it's basically taking
your<00:00:39.140> worn<00:00:40.140> or<00:00:40.500> damaged<00:00:41.719> fixture<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
your worn or damaged fixture and and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.490 
your worn or damaged fixture and and
basically<00:00:43.890> turning<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.670> back<00:00:44.850> sanu<00:00:45.180> or

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
basically turning it back sanu or

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.060 
basically turning it back sanu or
rejuvenating<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.680> guess<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:46.980> best

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
rejuvenating it I guess is the best

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.979 
rejuvenating it I guess is the best
example<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.879> about<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:48.690> what

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
example of that about what what

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.500 
example of that about what what
materials<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.760> with<00:00:51.030> well

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
materials can you do this with well

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.540 
materials can you do this with well
specifically<00:00:52.170> down<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.920> materials<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.430> we

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
specifically down the materials that we

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.189 
specifically down the materials that we
use<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:54.449> stuff<00:00:54.629> that's<00:00:54.840> actually<00:00:55.079> what

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
use that stuff that's actually what

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.500 
use that stuff that's actually what
unites<00:00:55.469> us<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.550> specific<00:00:56.879> product

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
unites us and it's a specific product

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
designed to do exactly what this is and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.010 
designed to do exactly what this is and
that<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.239> resurfacing<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.870> these

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
that is for resurfacing of these

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.720 
that is for resurfacing of these
fixtures<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.649> ok<00:01:01.949> that's<00:01:02.280> designed<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
fixtures so ok that's designed to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.640 
fixtures so ok that's designed to
withstand<00:01:03.000> hot<00:01:03.359> water<00:01:03.600> doesn't<00:01:03.960> yellow<00:01:04.439> it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
guarantee ok for most fixtures so it's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.859 
guarantee ok for most fixtures so it's
