00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.750
 here i have a third wave 5 v6 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.639
 Motor often used world delivered 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.019
 and if you then measure by 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.059
 you realize that the waves in the middle 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.560
 stronger fascists are on the edge and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.020
 heart maybe the squeal and also 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.449
 maybe that's not more 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.730
 Kraft just needs a sentence that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.080
 same 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.279
 yes you can not just over 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.960
 polish easily with the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.199
 polishing machine is beautiful smooth as beautiful 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.880
 but it worked in detail , it fits 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.500
 not because that's about 500,000 mm where 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.100
 the tang in the medium is such a 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:48.260
 I have already made the cones 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.260
 there it is very even 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.480
 that in detail things but how does that mean 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.480
 not everyone 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.250
 4 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.670
 even if 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.390
 who knew who has 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.000
 with the v6 engines 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.760
 they are so close to each other 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.760
 that I always slip off with the band 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.909
 already left once 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.049
 sometimes yes and that's just it 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:45.369
 to what they could so sharp here 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.369
 kaeslin music 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.400
 that is more emotional than actually 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.560
 with this breed working with the 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.119
 ratchet division of labor not at all i have to 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.229
 to hear that and I have to do that a lot 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.450
 I feel it to the right side 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.200
 very good but to the middle where 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.910
 mirage leiblein is torn there is 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.569
 it too tight because still needs a bit 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.569
 continue to write
