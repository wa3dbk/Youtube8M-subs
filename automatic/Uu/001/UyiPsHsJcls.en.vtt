 Cuba 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.159
 with the 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.159
 the fires 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.320
 let's expand it 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.630
 for one hundrerd 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.710
 the twenties of retes 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.040
 what is the other time 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.040
 because that's where we're going to connect the lines 0 1 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.110
 let's go to the line connection tab 0 1 or in that structure 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.350
 we select i drag this excludes that save 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.150
 until the drafting tab 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.690
 let's go 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.160
 and there they are 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.480
 we are already connected to the main channel 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.460
 I did not want that channel below we are not interested 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.460
 let's go to philips arena 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.630
 that are heard butt 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.850
 they are still at risk 1 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.150
 strelkov 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.990
 are here 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.799
 we are already connected if I go to a mythical tree my tribe 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.270
 here is the structure 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.730
 is active concrete 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.110
 what are we going to do 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.080
 let's accommodate the 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.540
 to space 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.540
 that we are going caritas 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.700
 we were going 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 animations that spain animation ceilings 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.930
 batista let's see her with the camera at herrera 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.290
 the perspective cameras 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.290
 that is structured that is huge 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.250
 remember that the rotation system back surveys and click x true 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.739
 the sunca wishes tail in front to hide 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.739

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.339
 come on edited adt 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:25.069
 per hundred objects in the eyelash objects of the animation window are found 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.329

 min 0 1 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.319
 and said be let's select lines 0 1 stahl roh 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:36.320
 Manu did not forgive us 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.719
 and you are not or not children or of slopes 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.129
 as structure 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.749
 here appear the earthquakes that are the same as it is has bonuses and the 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:46.599
 options to move scalar rotary 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.859
 salty ounce masters 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.029
 we go down 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.409
 we go down 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.409
 and low bush 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.079
 6 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.079
 now how are they moving 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.929
 I want you to observe something the camera 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.239
 aquino is found 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.939
 By default, the travel camera will always start 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:21.419
 in this point 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.419
 I will try to put the house 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.900
 that the door of the entrance of my house 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.730
 this one next to the camera soon I want to go very far for lenders 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.419
 I'm going to rotate the 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.269
 thus 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.919
 do not 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.559
 oquendo 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:49.959

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.099
 travel 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.099
 now it turns out that you are very small 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.229
 I am already very big 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.229
 well now let's keep climbing 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:07.809
 fruit of this space 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.489

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.299
 let's move 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.239
 and if to go up until we can see the kiss 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.069
 a new test round 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:28.909
 and perhaps 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.189
 good but not to complicate following the other camera we will be what 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:33.139
 following 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.189
 let's activate the option rule ask that we can 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:39.650
 visualize and avoid at the same time 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.919
 with your calculations 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.559
 and that is that the campus 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:46.620
 here is still 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.080
 it's still very small 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.080
 as you see 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:02.319
 according to him 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.319
 it's a little bit bigger 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.889
 in the structure that I reviewed - small flaws 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.219
 yÃºnes of polygons but pay attention to that 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.379
 Kim Jong-un 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.229

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:34.979
 candidate 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.979
 and if we move 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:44.139
 p 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.139
 it's okay 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:52.770
 issues to be now let's put it hindu mines sion 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.089
 what many were waiting for 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.110
 as we have 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.240

 he tells us that he does not have textures at the moment because I do not have any texture 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.819
 I brought 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.900
 all of that will come clean but I will bring a
