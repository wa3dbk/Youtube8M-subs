but the NBA Finals do you think now

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.930 
but the NBA Finals do you think now
especially<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:44.129> your<00:00:44.250> video<00:00:44.550> coming<00:00:44.850> out

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
especially with your video coming out

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.110 
especially with your video coming out
that<00:00:45.329> referees<00:00:45.930> will<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.410> more<00:00:47.340> attentive<00:00:47.700> or

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
that referees will be more attentive or

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
that referees will be more attentive or
more<00:00:48.629> likely<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.260> make<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.469> call<00:00:49.770> against<00:00:50.160> him

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
more likely to make the call against him

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.490 
more likely to make the call against him
being<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:50.879> such<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> national<00:00:52.020> stage

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
being that it's such a national stage

now it's the finals and since your video
service<00:00:55.190> you<00:00:56.190> know<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.399> they<00:00:56.850> certainly

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
service you know I think they certainly

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.959 
service you know I think they certainly
are<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:58.070> you<00:00:59.070> know<00:00:59.160> more<00:00:59.370> aware<00:00:59.699> of

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
are going to be you know more aware of

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.599 
are going to be you know more aware of
it<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:00.660> sense<00:01:01.079> ly<00:01:01.350> travels<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.980> would

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it and if they sense ly travels I would

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.000 
it and if they sense ly travels I would
success<00:01:03.090> suspect<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.199> they<00:01:04.350> would<00:01:04.530> call<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
success suspect that they would call it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.679 
success suspect that they would call it
because<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:06.000> don't<00:01:06.210> know<00:01:06.360> when<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> next

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
because they don't know when the next

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.960 
because they don't know when the next
video<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.530> pop<00:01:07.770> off<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.820> know

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
misses a traveling violation that

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.960 
misses a traveling violation that
enables<00:01:15.000> him<00:01:15.180> again<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.630> make<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> winning<00:01:16.110> shot

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
be as fair as humanly possible for both

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.039 
be as fair as humanly possible for both
teams<00:01:46.890> because<00:01:47.430> Mark<00:01:48.090> Cuban<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.540> not<00:01:48.750> going<00:01:48.960> to

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
teams because Mark Cuban is not going to

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.420 
teams because Mark Cuban is not going to
stand<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.880> know<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.390> basically<00:01:52.250> put<00:01:53.250> at<00:01:53.340> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
stand you know to be basically put at a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.310 
stand you know to be basically put at a
disadvantage<00:01:53.460> again<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.570> he<00:01:54.720> was<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
disadvantage again like he was in the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200 
disadvantage again like he was in the
last<00:01:55.500> Finals<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.159> he<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.670> five<00:01:56.909> years

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
last Finals that he was in five years

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.649 
last Finals that he was in five years
ago<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.990> really<00:01:58.649> believe<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.450> he's<00:02:00.450> going

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
ago so I really believe that he's going

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.030 
ago so I really believe that he's going
to<00:02:00.750> start<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:02.270> be<00:02:03.270> someone<00:02:03.719> who<00:02:03.930> works<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:05.009> a

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
to start to be someone who works like a

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.280 
to start to be someone who works like a
volcano<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.030> eventually<00:02:06.810> he's<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.200> to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
volcano and eventually he's going to

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.960 
volcano and eventually he's going to
erupt<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.829> cause<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> lot<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.340> embarrassment

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
erupt and cause a lot of embarrassment

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.960 
erupt and cause a lot of embarrassment
for<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.300> league<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:10.080> he's<00:02:10.430> not<00:02:11.430> giving<00:02:11.760> fair

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
for the league if he's not giving fair

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.680 
for the league if he's not giving fair
to

be hearing any more comments again from
standing<00:02:49.470> Gandhi<00:02:49.890> because<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.430> fine<00:02:50.730> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
standing Gandhi because of the fine and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.890 
standing Gandhi because of the fine and
because<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.420> repercussions<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:53.750> could<00:02:54.750> take

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
because of repercussions that could take

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.050 
because of repercussions that could take
place<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.230> as<00:02:55.680> we<00:02:55.890> saw<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.190> know<00:02:56.460> Orlando<00:02:56.910> was

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
place in as we saw you know Orlando was

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.430 
place in as we saw you know Orlando was
out<00:02:57.210> in<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.390> first<00:02:57.600> round<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.050> playoffs

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
out in the first round of the playoffs

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.800 
out in the first round of the playoffs
so<00:02:58.710> I<00:02:58.980> think<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.730> he<00:02:59.910> has<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> way<00:03:00.360> of<00:03:00.390> getting

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
so I think that he has a way of getting

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.220 
so I think that he has a way of getting
his<00:03:01.320> message<00:03:01.590> across<00:03:02.120> year<00:03:03.120> through<00:03:03.420> fines<00:03:03.780> or

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
his message across year through fines or

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.190 
his message across year through fines or
year<00:03:04.650> through<00:03:04.920> officiating<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:06.900> know<00:03:06.990> but<00:03:07.170> I

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
year through officiating you know but I

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.990 
year through officiating you know but I
just<00:03:07.320> think<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.860> Mark<00:03:08.160> Cuban<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.700> one<00:03:08.910> of

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
just think that Mark Cuban is one of

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.080 
just think that Mark Cuban is one of
those<00:03:09.120> guys<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.860> know<00:03:11.700> nothing<00:03:12.060> can

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
those guys that you know nothing can

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.760 
those guys that you know nothing can
stop<00:03:12.510> him<00:03:12.690> when<00:03:12.840> he<00:03:12.990> feels<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.380> he's<00:03:13.530> right

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
stop him when he feels that he's right

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.080 
stop him when he feels that he's right
he's<00:03:14.010> going<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.250> speak<00:03:14.490> out<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.850> he's<00:03:14.970> going

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
he's going to speak out and he's going

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.390 
he's going to speak out and he's going
to<00:03:15.180> be<00:03:15.270> heard<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.020> think<00:03:16.050> that<00:03:16.530> it's<00:03:17.250> going

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
to be heard and I think that it's going

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.860 
to be heard and I think that it's going
to<00:03:17.460> cause<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.670> lot<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:17.970> embarrassment<00:03:18.690> for<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
to cause a lot of embarrassment for the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.590 
to cause a lot of embarrassment for the
league<00:03:19.110> if<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:20.370> know<00:03:20.490> it's<00:03:20.700> as<00:03:20.850> obvious<00:03:21.330> as<00:03:21.480> it

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
league if you know it's as obvious as it

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
where there's you know probably not

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.990 
where there's you know probably not
going<00:06:07.259> to<00:06:07.319> be<00:06:07.440> 5,000<00:06:08.159> people<00:06:08.279> in<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.639> stands

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
going to be 5,000 people in the stands

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.499 
going to be 5,000 people in the stands
when<00:06:09.180> he<00:06:09.300> leaves<00:06:09.569> so<00:06:09.930> it's<00:06:10.560> a<00:06:10.889> it's<00:06:11.490> tough<00:06:11.880> it's

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:12.509 
when he leaves so it's a it's tough it's

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:14.629 
when he leaves so it's a it's tough it's
really<00:06:12.840> going<00:06:12.960> to<00:06:13.050> detract<00:06:13.440> on<00:06:13.770> these<00:06:13.949> smaller

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
really going to detract on these smaller

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.120 
really going to detract on these smaller
market<00:06:15.180> and<00:06:15.330> lower<00:06:15.479> level<00:06:15.930> teams<00:06:16.199> and<00:06:16.740> I<00:06:16.860> think

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
market and lower level teams and I think

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.980 
market and lower level teams and I think
that<00:06:17.310> eventually<00:06:17.909> it's<00:06:18.479> going<00:06:18.599> to<00:06:18.659> certainly

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
that eventually it's going to certainly

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.110 
that eventually it's going to certainly
hurt<00:06:19.259> the<00:06:19.440> league<00:06:19.620> but<00:06:19.919> what<00:06:20.520> it<00:06:20.610> does<00:06:20.819> now<00:06:21.090> is

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
hurt the league but what it does now is

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.360 
hurt the league but what it does now is
it<00:06:21.479> draws<00:06:21.719> a<00:06:21.840> lot<00:06:21.870> of<00:06:22.169> global<00:06:22.440> attention<00:06:22.949> to

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
it draws a lot of global attention to

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.730 
it draws a lot of global attention to
these<00:06:23.490> big<00:06:24.090> stars<00:06:24.479> to<00:06:24.690> other<00:06:24.779> teams<00:06:25.139> and<00:06:25.529> I

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
these big stars to other teams and I

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.100 
these big stars to other teams and I
guess<00:06:26.250> from<00:06:26.759> a<00:06:26.909> marketing<00:06:27.300> standpoint<00:06:27.630> that's

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
guess from a marketing standpoint that's

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.559 
guess from a marketing standpoint that's
good<00:06:28.349> for<00:06:28.529> the<00:06:28.620> NBA<00:06:29.270> alright<00:06:30.270> last<00:06:30.479> question

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:30.569 
good for the NBA alright last question

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.249 
good for the NBA alright last question

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:41.939 
agreement you see it getting as far as

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:43.579 
agreement you see it getting as far as
the<00:06:42.089> NFL<00:06:42.329> where<00:06:42.839> right<00:06:43.049> now<00:06:43.199> there's<00:06:43.379> not<00:06:43.529> even

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:43.589 
the NFL where right now there's not even

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:45.109 
the NFL where right now there's not even
a<00:06:43.859> season<00:06:44.219> and<00:06:44.369> there's<00:06:44.489> no<00:06:44.669> guarantee<00:06:44.879> that

00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:45.119 
a season and there's no guarantee that

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:47.119 
a season and there's no guarantee that
there<00:06:45.419> will<00:06:45.599> be<00:06:45.629> or<00:06:46.169> do<00:06:46.379> you<00:06:46.439> see<00:06:46.619> this<00:06:46.769> somehow

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:49.589 
working out I think there's too much

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:52.219 
working out I think there's too much
money<00:06:49.829> at<00:06:50.039> stake<00:06:50.099> for<00:06:50.759> both<00:06:51.659> sides<00:06:51.959> to<00:06:52.169> be

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
money at stake for both sides to be

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:55.129 
money at stake for both sides to be
stubborn<00:06:52.649> and<00:06:53.339> not<00:06:53.579> get<00:06:53.819> this<00:06:53.969> worked<00:06:54.269> out<00:06:54.449> I

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
stubborn and not get this worked out I

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.479 
stubborn and not get this worked out I
think<00:06:55.589> eventually<00:06:57.559> now<00:06:58.559> before<00:06:58.889> the<00:06:59.039> regular

00:06:59.479 --> 00:06:59.489 
think eventually now before the regular

00:06:59.489 --> 00:07:01.009 
think eventually now before the regular
season<00:06:59.879> starts<00:07:00.269> that<00:07:00.419> they<00:07:00.539> will<00:07:00.749> get<00:07:00.929> it

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:01.019 
season starts that they will get it

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:04.489 
season starts that they will get it
worked<00:07:01.229> out<00:07:01.409> and<00:07:01.649> will<00:07:01.829> be<00:07:01.949> resolved
