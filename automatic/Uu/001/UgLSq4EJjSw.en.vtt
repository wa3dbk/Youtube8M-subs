00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.870 

now<00:00:07.440> here's<00:00:07.710> something<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.429> like<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.700> do

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
now here's something that I like to do

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.910 
now here's something that I like to do
whenever<00:00:09.059> I'm<00:00:09.240> cleaning<00:00:09.630> cobia<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.290> actually

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
whenever I'm cleaning cobia I actually

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.549 
whenever I'm cleaning cobia I actually
like<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.219> cut<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.730> head<00:00:11.969> all<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.660> way<00:00:13.259> off

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
like to cut the head all the way off

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.279 
like to cut the head all the way off
otherwise<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.519> really<00:00:14.849> bends<00:00:15.269> your<00:00:15.540> fish<00:00:15.929> and

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
otherwise it really bends your fish and

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.279 
otherwise it really bends your fish and
keeps<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.250> from<00:00:17.400> getting<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.760> good<00:00:18.260> fillet<00:00:19.260> on

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
keeps you from getting a good fillet on

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.340 
keeps you from getting a good fillet on
both<00:00:19.650> sides<00:00:20.359> what<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> beautiful<00:00:21.720> fish<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.230> mean
