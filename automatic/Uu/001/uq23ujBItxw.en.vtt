difference with the flat so we'll get to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.209

solid<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.660> run<00:00:57.870> decently<00:00:58.350> wider<00:00:58.710> um<00:00:59.039> then

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
solid they run decently wider um then

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.150 
solid they run decently wider um then
the<00:00:59.910> cleats<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.079> found<00:01:01.590> there<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> little<00:01:01.980> bit

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the cleats do I found there a little bit

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.189 
the cleats do I found there a little bit
wider<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> front<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.600> also<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.870> found<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
wider in the front and also I found I

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.630 
wider in the front and also I found I
had<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.409> go<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> half<00:01:04.769> size<00:01:04.979> down<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.460> these

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
had to go to half size down with these

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.510 
had to go to half size down with these
so<00:01:05.909> if<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.479> guys<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.810> normally<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.439> 9<00:01:08.040> i'd<00:01:08.340> go

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
so if you guys are normally a 9 i'd go

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.219 
so if you guys are normally a 9 i'd go
eight<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> half<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.780> only<00:01:09.930> eight<00:01:10.080> and

eight and a half if it's only eight and
a<00:01:10.260> half<00:01:10.290> i<00:01:10.530> go<00:01:10.680> eight<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.460> forth

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

through this entire bottom and they got

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.850 
through this entire bottom and they got
the<00:02:05.640> kind<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.939> grittier<00:02:06.439> little<00:02:07.439> pockets

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
about them is this guy back here I what

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.300 
about them is this guy back here I what
they<00:02:40.819> called<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.060> file<00:02:41.299> on<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.840> heel<00:02:42.260> wedge<00:02:42.500> it

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
they called a file on a heel wedge it

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.129 
they called a file on a heel wedge it
kind<00:02:43.519> of<00:02:43.579> elevated<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.480> shoe<00:02:44.659> a<00:02:44.689> little<00:02:44.989> bit

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
kind of elevated the shoe a little bit

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.619 
kind of elevated the shoe a little bit
it's<00:02:45.290> kind<00:02:45.439> of<00:02:45.500> awkward<00:02:46.329> almost<00:02:47.329> as<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.510> can

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
it's kind of awkward almost as you can

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.149 
it's kind of awkward almost as you can
see<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.900> goes<00:02:48.079> in<00:02:48.230> here<00:02:48.439> and<00:02:48.560> then<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.739> drops

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
see it goes in here and then it drops

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.009 
see it goes in here and then it drops
off<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.549> then<00:02:49.639> they<00:02:49.760> got<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:50.389> front<00:02:50.629> part<00:02:50.870> so

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
off and then they got the front part so

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.360 
off and then they got the front part so
it's<00:02:51.139> almost<00:02:51.290> like<00:02:51.560> two<00:02:51.709> separate<00:02:52.010> sections

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
it's almost like two separate sections

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.729 
it's almost like two separate sections
even<00:02:52.609> though<00:02:52.700> it's<00:02:52.819> one<00:02:53.030> full<00:02:53.560> bottom<00:02:54.560> but<00:02:54.709> I

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
even though it's one full bottom but I

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.530 
even though it's one full bottom but I
really<00:02:54.980> didn't<00:02:55.159> like<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.430> wedge<00:02:55.609> I<00:02:55.849> kind<00:02:56.510> of

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
really didn't like the wedge I kind of

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.940 
really didn't like the wedge I kind of
raises<00:02:56.750> your<00:02:57.049> foot<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.290> little<00:02:57.379> bit<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.799> it's

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
raises your foot a little bit and it's

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.069 
raises your foot a little bit and it's
kind<00:02:58.099> of<00:02:58.129> an<00:02:58.250> awkward<00:02:58.400> um<00:02:58.879> just<00:02:59.840> an<00:02:59.989> awkward

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
kind of an awkward um just an awkward

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.990 
kind of an awkward um just an awkward
feel<00:03:00.530> at<00:03:00.709> first<00:03:00.919> at<00:03:01.099> least<00:03:01.129> for<00:03:01.400> me<00:03:01.519> when<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:01.819> was

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
feel at first at least for me when I was

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.699 
feel at first at least for me when I was
running<00:03:02.150> with<00:03:02.389> them<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:02.780> that's<00:03:03.439> something<00:03:03.620> to

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
running with them so that's something to

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:04.990 
running with them so that's something to
take<00:03:03.889> in<00:03:04.010> consideration<00:03:04.099> as<00:03:04.669> well<00:03:04.849> when

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
take in consideration as well when

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.849 
take in consideration as well when
you're<00:03:05.120> going<00:03:05.269> with<00:03:05.540> with<00:03:06.290> an<00:03:06.409> indoor<00:03:06.620> flat

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
you're going with with an indoor flat

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.470 
you're going with with an indoor flat
like<00:03:07.040> this<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.669> heel<00:03:07.849> which<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.180> wasn't

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
like this that the heel which I wasn't

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.629 
like this that the heel which I wasn't
too<00:03:08.780> too<00:03:08.989> fond<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.409> but<00:03:09.650> they'll<00:03:10.250> be<00:03:10.310> something

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
too too fond of but they'll be something

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:11.949 
too too fond of but they'll be something
you<00:03:10.700> guys<00:03:10.819> can<00:03:10.970> kind<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.180> decide<00:03:11.299> for<00:03:11.629> yourself

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
you guys can kind of decide for yourself

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.750 
you guys can kind of decide for yourself
but<00:03:12.169> as<00:03:12.500> far<00:03:12.650> as<00:03:12.709> technology<00:03:13.040> is<00:03:13.310> like<00:03:13.519> I<00:03:13.609> said

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
but as far as technology is like I said

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.610 
but as far as technology is like I said
very<00:03:13.939> similar<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.389> victory<00:03:14.750> cleat<00:03:15.470> we
