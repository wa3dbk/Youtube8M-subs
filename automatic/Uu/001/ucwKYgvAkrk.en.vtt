and not to mention that doesn't you know
it<00:00:53.820> doesn't<00:00:53.969> make<00:00:54.120> sense<00:00:54.180> because<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.870> one

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it doesn't make sense because in one

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.990 
it doesn't make sense because in one
story<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:55.980> pick<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.340> side<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.850> then

the next they're like mortal enemies and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.189 
the next they're like mortal enemies and
then<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.789> next<00:00:59.940> one<00:01:00.180> their<00:01:00.390> best<00:01:00.539> friend<00:01:00.780> it's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199

the graphics for the most part aren't
terrible<00:01:35.020> i<00:01:35.200> would<00:01:35.380> say<00:01:35.530> some<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:35.770> the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
terrible i would say some of the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.649 
terrible i would say some of the
environments<00:01:36.490> definitely<00:01:37.000> needed<00:01:37.300> some<00:01:37.330> work

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
environments definitely needed some work

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.230 
environments definitely needed some work
and<00:01:37.960> some<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.920> character<00:01:39.490> models<00:01:39.850> look<00:01:40.119> a

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
and some of the character models look a

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.570 
and some of the character models look a
bit<00:01:40.420> iffy<00:01:40.840> in<00:01:40.990> terms<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.320> design<00:01:41.710> I'm<00:01:42.070> actually

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
bit iffy in terms of design I'm actually

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.670 
bit iffy in terms of design I'm actually
the<00:01:42.970> majority<00:01:43.450> look<00:01:43.750> a<00:01:43.840> bit<00:01:44.020> if<00:01:44.170> he<00:01:44.200> enters<00:01:44.619> the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
the majority look a bit if he enters the

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.130 
the majority look a bit if he enters the
design<00:01:45.159> however<00:01:46.030> what<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.300> will<00:01:46.570> say<00:01:46.600> is<00:01:47.050> that

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
design however what I will say is that

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.260 
design however what I will say is that
the<00:01:47.530> effects<00:01:47.890> look<00:01:48.310> awesome<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:48.940> the

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
the effects look awesome and the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.090 
the effects look awesome and the
movements<00:01:49.869> are<00:01:50.050> pretty<00:01:50.380> cool<00:01:50.590> though<00:01:50.860> of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
movements are pretty cool though of

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.370 
movements are pretty cool though of
course<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.610> still<00:01:51.850> feels<00:01:52.119> stiff<00:01:52.509> when<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.229> see

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
course it still feels stiff when you see

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.410 
course it still feels stiff when you see
your<00:01:53.530> guy<00:01:53.710> kind<00:01:54.070> of<00:01:54.159> fall<00:01:54.400> from<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.940> sky<00:01:55.180> after
