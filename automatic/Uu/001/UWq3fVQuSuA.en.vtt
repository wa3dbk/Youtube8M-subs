going<00:00:23.039> back<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.369> Adam<00:00:23.730> these<00:00:24.449> are<00:00:24.630> not

going back to Adam these are not

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.570 
going back to Adam these are not
different<00:00:24.930> names<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> same<00:00:25.680> people<00:00:25.949> they

different names of the same people they

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.849 
different names of the same people they
are<00:00:26.730> completely<00:00:27.090> different<00:00:27.330> genealogies<00:00:28.140> so

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
are completely different genealogies so

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.279 
are completely different genealogies so
do<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> contradiction<00:00:29.779> not<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.019> fast

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
do we have a contradiction not so fast

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.680 
do we have a contradiction not so fast
there<00:00:31.890> are<00:00:31.949> two<00:00:32.219> ways<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.550> handling<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
there are two ways of handling this the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.600 
there are two ways of handling this the
first<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.110> most<00:00:34.230> common<00:00:34.469> argument<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
first and most common argument is the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.569 
first and most common argument is the
genealogy<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:36.270> Luke<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:37.079> Mary's<00:00:37.410> line<00:00:37.649> heal<00:00:38.399> I

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
genealogy of Luke was Mary's line heal I

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.400 
genealogy of Luke was Mary's line heal I
was<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> father<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.239> Mary<00:00:39.480> who<00:00:39.960> became<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
was the father of Mary who became the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.500 
was the father of Mary who became the
father-in-law<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.010> Joseph<00:00:41.550> thus<00:00:42.239> making

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
father-in-law of Joseph thus making

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.630 
father-in-law of Joseph thus making
Joseph<00:00:42.960> his<00:00:43.079> son<00:00:43.290> as<00:00:43.410> well<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:44.460> would<00:00:44.610> be

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
Joseph his son as well this would be

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.100 
Joseph his son as well this would be
consistent<00:00:45.090> with<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> idea<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.899> some

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
consistent with the idea that some

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.290 
consistent with the idea that some
scholars<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.649> suggested<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.219> Luke<00:00:47.940> used<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
scholars have suggested that Luke used a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.970 
scholars have suggested that Luke used a
relative<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.809> Mary's<00:00:49.110> side<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> family<00:00:49.829> as

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
relative of Mary's side of the family as

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.310 
relative of Mary's side of the family as
a<00:00:50.039> source<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.460> his<00:00:50.670> birth<00:00:50.910> narrative<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.110> he

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
a source for his birth narrative so he

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.959 
a source for his birth narrative so he
would<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.440> taken<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.890> genealogy<00:00:53.250> instead

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
would have taken that genealogy instead

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.910 
would have taken that genealogy instead
and<00:00:54.239> since<00:00:54.989> there<00:00:55.170> was<00:00:55.260> no<00:00:55.410> Greek<00:00:55.680> word<00:00:55.890> for

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
and since there was no Greek word for

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
and since there was no Greek word for
son-in-law<00:00:56.480> Joseph<00:00:57.480> has<00:00:57.600> simply<00:00:57.899> called<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
son-in-law Joseph has simply called the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.080 
son-in-law Joseph has simply called the
son<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.469> heal<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.730> perfectly

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
son of heal I that is perfectly

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.270 
son of heal I that is perfectly
acceptable<00:01:00.539> by<00:01:00.750> most<00:01:00.989> scholars<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:02.190> is

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
acceptable by most scholars as there is

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.460 
acceptable by most scholars as there is
no<00:01:02.489> indication<00:01:02.879> Mary<00:01:03.270> had<00:01:03.420> any<00:01:03.539> brothers<00:01:03.989> but

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
no indication Mary had any brothers but

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950 
no indication Mary had any brothers but
only<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.769> sister<00:01:05.070> thus<00:01:06.060> if<00:01:06.299> there<00:01:06.420> were<00:01:06.510> no<00:01:06.630> sons

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
only a sister thus if there were no sons

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.080 
only a sister thus if there were no sons
of<00:01:07.110> heal<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.470> Joseph<00:01:08.250> would<00:01:08.400> become<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> legal

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
of heal I Joseph would become the legal

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.480 
of heal I Joseph would become the legal
heir<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.720> heal<00:01:09.930> as<00:01:10.080> inheritance<00:01:10.650> thus<00:01:11.280> his

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
heir to heal as inheritance thus his

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
heir to heal as inheritance thus his
heir<00:01:11.700> by<00:01:11.909> law<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.960> would<00:01:13.140> also<00:01:13.290> make<00:01:13.530> sense

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
heir by law this would also make sense

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.200 
heir by law this would also make sense
with<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> fact<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.369> Mary<00:01:14.670> wedded<00:01:15.000> within

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
with the fact that Mary wedded within

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.330 
with the fact that Mary wedded within
the<00:01:15.270> family<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.720> David<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.680> ensure<00:01:16.950> he<00:01:17.189> lies

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the family of David to ensure he lies

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.340 
the family of David to ensure he lies
inheritance<00:01:17.939> remained<00:01:18.600> among<00:01:18.810> those<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
inheritance remained among those of the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.929 
inheritance remained among those of the

and neither genealogy makes an error in
what<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.810> records<00:03:37.290> jacob<00:03:38.220> begat<00:03:38.370> joseph<00:03:39.060> but

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
what it records jacob begat joseph but

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.780 
what it records jacob begat joseph but
joseph<00:03:39.959> was<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.260> son<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.470> he<00:03:40.709> lie<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.640> there

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
joseph was the son of he lie so there

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.340 
joseph was the son of he lie so there
are<00:03:41.880> two<00:03:42.090> completely<00:03:42.600> cogent<00:03:43.050> ways<00:03:43.200> to

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
are two completely cogent ways to

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.110 
are two completely cogent ways to
resolve<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.800> suppose<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> contradiction<00:03:44.820> and

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
resolve this suppose a contradiction and

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.570 
resolve this suppose a contradiction and
since<00:03:45.690> both<00:03:45.900> are<00:03:46.080> entirely<00:03:46.410> possible<00:03:46.770> this

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
since both are entirely possible this

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.310 
since both are entirely possible this
bible<00:03:47.970> contradiction<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.720> be<00:03:48.870> addressed<00:03:49.200> and

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
bible contradiction can be addressed and

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.740 
bible contradiction can be addressed and
resolved
