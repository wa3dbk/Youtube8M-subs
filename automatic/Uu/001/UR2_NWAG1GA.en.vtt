00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.237
 [FOUNTAIN SPLASHES]

00:00:02.222 --> 00:00:03.544
 [UPBEAT MUSIC]

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.276
 [MUSIC ENDS]

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.043
NARRATOR: Here are the items
you will need to bottom drill

00:00:12.043 --> 00:00:12.820
on a lathe.

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:14.058
A center drill,

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:15.782
a starter drill bit larger than

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:18.218
the web of a larger bit
you intend to drill to,

00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:21.996
the larger drill bit, and the
bottom drill of equal size,

00:00:21.996 --> 00:00:23.229
and a feeler gauge.

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:45.030
NARRATOR: Here are some
important things to remember.

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.420
Do not drill the entire
depth of the hole

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.664
with the flat bottom
drill.

00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:51.688
A flat bottom drill is not
designed for this purpose.

00:01:51.971 --> 00:01:54.931
When drilling the initial holes,
measure from the chisel edge of

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.675
the bit rather than the margins.

00:01:57.388 --> 00:02:00.041
When using a feeler gauge,
remember to account for the

00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:01.086
thickness of the blade.

00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:02.984
Deburr the hole
with the countersink,

00:02:02.984 --> 00:02:04.851
deburring tool, or a boring bar.

00:02:05.452 --> 00:02:07.782
If you are unsure of any
part of the procedure,

00:02:07.932 --> 00:02:09.876
ask shop staff for assistance.
