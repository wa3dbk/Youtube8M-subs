00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.210
 one 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.640
 most of the people around us to 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.070
 Unfortunately, I do not know how the labial sounds 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.829
 harmonica how this really sounds 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.170
 tool for many this tool 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:37.089
 associated with the Germans on the tanks 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.500
 who play german marches better 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.030
 when someone perceives a labial 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.339
 harmonica as a tool that can 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.530
 use in bardic music yet 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.019
 better when people remember that 1 gram 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.800
 hk sounds bands like beatles in 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.820
 tp-link 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:59.089
 deep purple in russian rock tank boiled 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.659
 the chayf band sounds and only when 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.180
 person 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.309
 I decide that he wants to master this 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.369
 musicality not only when he 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.979
 dipped into the world of harmonica only 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.960
 then he becomes aware of what it is 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.850
 truly awesome tool 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.619
 possibilities for harmonica 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.430
 you can play literally in any style 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.799
 music 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.590
 and knowledge is not important 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.409
 musical credentials are not necessarily not 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.840
 read the notes literally every person 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.939
 can set a goal to start 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.189
 develop reach develop your 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.299
 mastery and in time become 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.090
 really professional 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.240
 harmonica player performs on stage as 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.079
 the soul of the company speaking with his 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.869
 musical group and set such goals 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.179
 and reaching them literally everyone can 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.539
 prove yourself to those around you that 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:54.130
 everyone can be everyone who wishes everyone 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:57.520
 can succeed and be happy and 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.590
 in order to start learning and 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.079
 play full compositions in 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.600
 different music styles for this 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.479
 it is important for us to learn how to play 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.819
 single clean notes get into 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.600
 every mouth harmonica hole 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:19.220
 separately for this it is important to perform three 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:23.300
 conditions 1 it is important for us to 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.270
 moment you have worked well three basic 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.530
 fundamental rule of beautiful sound 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.140
 if you think that you are not enough 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.300
 worked on the development of the previous 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.090
 skills we recommend you 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.220
 little hold out mastering with his 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.140
 previously single notes 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.230
 go back to this lesson as soon as you 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.210
 play enough chords inhale 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.330
 really feel what you are with 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.520
 ease playing chords and you 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.150
 it brings pleasure to both sound the same 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.670
 the very feeling of the game and so the first 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.890
 condition is well worked out three basic 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.860
 skills 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.310
 the picking second rule in the second 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.730
 the rule 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.610
 we will make a slight exception since 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.090
 we all know that the harmonica 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.060
 need to keep deep enough we 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.030
 the very beginning of mastering and steal night 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.870
 the notes will barely neglect this 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.090
 rules in the near future you 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.930
 you yourself will begin to notice that you can with 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.730
 ease to bring back this skill and maybe 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.330
 it's hard to believe but literally through 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.810
 month with a regular game you can 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.830
 again play not holding deep enough 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.510
 harmonica 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.270
 but at the same time fall clearly into one 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.330
 hole is not some kind of magic you 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.910
 really regular playing learn 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.610
 very well manage the flow of air and 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.070
 holding two three three holes in your mouth 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.070
 harmonica can clearly fall 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:04:00.200
 in each individual hole by 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:02.840
 separately and so in the second rule we 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.239
 it is important to create with lips a round hole 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:11.560
 exactly rounded what can be like 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.880
 such a hole when we apply it 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.489
 lips by the way should be completely 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.010
 soft as you remember our muscles should 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:24.020
 faces should be soft lips by itself 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:26.150
 it is also why we form it this way 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.990
 we have such a hole with lips more often 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.060
 when the whistle of just such a whistle in 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.650
 time rykov whistling lips as you can 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.450
 notice really not soft they are not 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.740
 tense up they have some 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.660
 natural tone to a minimum 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.880
 but it is not overstrained and second lips 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.639
 such lips we can use in 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.650
 such exaggerated kisses that 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.410
 can can be directed to 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.789
 children when we speak my dear go 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.669
 here i will kiss you and 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.180
 and kissing the kids let's say forehead yes then 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.440
 eat while kissing 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.259
 such an exaggerated kiss 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:09.750
 pioneer kiss lips with us 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:12.210
 necessarily remain soft and then we 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.940
 also use just such soft 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.710
 lips with small holes try 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.599
 experiment and find in your 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.479
 comfortable and but please from round 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:25.500
 the hole is not oblong namely 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:28.800
 round and third important rule to 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.229
 start playing single notes though it 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.990
 the third rule and duplicates the three main 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.030
 basic rules of sound but we 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.610
 should emphasize again as this 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:43.199
 very important rule of action and small 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.300
 hole we don't hurt again start not 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.340
 breathe correctly namely you think 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.509
 sucking air in here is important to us 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.110
 check that we are still 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:55.940
 keep breathing warm relaxed 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:59.159
 breathing even with a small hole and 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:03.120
 this breath is quiet as you remember 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:06.919
 so 3 rule first all three basic 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.650
 skills of beautiful sounding second 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:15.110
 rounded hole with soft lips and 3 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.460
 breathe properly and as soon as you 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.509
 practice a little as soon as you 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.030
 find your 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.870
 your solitary but your solitary 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.460
 holes on the light harmonicas 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.099
 please see also the video about 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.060
 critical errors that most often 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:35.250
 allow all novice harmonist and 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.560
 train on the holes let's say 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.210
 fourth to fifth sixth holes not 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.000
 tune the harmonica on the bottom not 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:47.039
 exercise from above is also a must 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.849
 see the task that is attached to 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:53.729
 this video tutorial and after you 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.620
 learn to play single notes when 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:07:00.029
 every natka you will sound clean and 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.279
 nice already back no way yes let you 

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:05.190
 still will not be able to have in your 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:07.229
 arsenal all the techniques and tricks of the game 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.820
 harmonica but no one can 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.339
 tell you that you can't play 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.560
 harmonica because from now on you 

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:16.110
 start playing full songs 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.330
 which is enough on our website 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:22.130
 plenty which you can play 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:27.210
 under the musical cons and record your 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:29.370
 letters are actually the way you play with 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:33.389
 a full group of cons that we 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:36.360
 provided you good luck successes 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:39.259
 find your most beautiful solitary 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.259
 clean notes 

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.170
 but 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.210
 one
