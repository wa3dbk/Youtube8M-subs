00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
you see these vertical lines these are

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.189 
you see these vertical lines these are
for<00:00:41.820> folding<00:00:43.670> optional<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.760> course<00:00:44.790> I<00:00:45.390> mean

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
for folding optional of course I mean

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.319 
for folding optional of course I mean
will<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:47.010> all<00:00:47.190> know<00:00:47.399> how<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.550> make<00:00:47.670> paper<00:00:48.030> chain

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
will we all know how to make paper chain

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.510 
will we all know how to make paper chain
you<00:00:48.540> fold<00:00:48.810> it<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.290> glue<00:00:49.470> it<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.800> stapled<00:00:50.190> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
you fold it in you glue it be stapled it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.049 
you fold it in you glue it be stapled it
or<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.570> tape<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> next<00:00:53.790> one

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
or you tape it and you do the next one

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.060 
or you tape it and you do the next one
and<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.780> round<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:57.500> if<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.649> pay<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.890> can

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
and it's round and if you pay you can

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.590 
and it's round and if you pay you can
point<00:00:59.219> craft<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.700> know<00:00:59.850> there's<00:01:00.329> nothing

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
point craft you know there's nothing

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
point craft you know there's nothing
back<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.110> Minecraft<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.890> that's<00:01:02.579> why<00:01:02.790> I've

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
back and in Minecraft so that's why I've

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.200 
back and in Minecraft so that's why I've
given<00:01:03.630> you<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.020> option<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.940> fold<00:01:05.940> them<00:01:06.180> there

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
given you the option to fold them there

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.700 
given you the option to fold them there
so<00:01:09.210> yeah<00:01:10.550> let's<00:01:11.550> get<00:01:11.700> story<00:01:12.000> though<00:01:12.470> I'll<00:01:13.470> cut

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
so yeah let's get story though I'll cut

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:37.530 
so yeah let's get story though I'll cut
them<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.899> we'll<00:01:15.899> take<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.080> from<00:01:16.200> there

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.680 

okay<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:38.600> we've<00:01:39.020> cut<00:01:39.260> everything<00:01:39.650> out<00:01:40.690> you've

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
okay so we've cut everything out you've

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.380 
okay so we've cut everything out you've
noticed<00:01:42.080> I<00:01:42.200> even<00:01:42.410> cut<00:01:42.590> these<00:01:42.770> out<00:01:43.100> as<00:01:43.970> period

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
noticed I even cut these out as period

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.210 
noticed I even cut these out as period
for<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.660> fact<00:01:44.840> I'm<00:01:45.320> gonna<00:01:45.500> save<00:01:45.680> these<00:01:45.860> for<00:01:46.100> my

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
for the fact I'm gonna save these for my

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.000 
for the fact I'm gonna save these for my
children<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:46.990> they<00:01:47.990> can<00:01:48.200> cut<00:01:48.560> them<00:01:48.680> out<00:01:48.800> and

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
children so they can cut them out and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.090 
children so they can cut them out and
make<00:01:49.160> them<00:01:49.190> themselves<00:01:50.590> later<00:01:51.590> when<00:01:51.890> they<00:01:51.980> get

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
make them themselves later when they get

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.970 
make them themselves later when they get
back<00:01:52.280> from<00:01:52.340> school<00:01:53.200> but<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.350> purpose<00:01:54.740> of<00:01:54.860> this

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
back from school but the purpose of this

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.000 
back from school but the purpose of this
video<00:01:55.190> I'm<00:01:55.400> just<00:01:55.490> gonna<00:01:55.820> do<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.060> couple<00:01:58.570> yeah<00:02:00.010> as

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
video I'm just gonna do a couple yeah as

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.900 
video I'm just gonna do a couple yeah as
I<00:02:01.160> said<00:02:01.220> these<00:02:01.520> guidelines<00:02:01.850> were<00:02:03.760> to<00:02:04.760> be

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
I said these guidelines were to be

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.230 
I said these guidelines were to be
folded<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:07.700> we<00:02:07.820> basically<00:02:08.090> get<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.450> nice

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
folded so we basically get a nice

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.400 
folded so we basically get a nice
minecraft<00:02:11.240> block<00:02:12.130> paper<00:02:13.130> chain

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.070 

so<00:02:17.920> let's<00:02:18.160> go<00:02:18.310> ahead<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.610> follow<00:02:19.570> those<00:02:19.960> a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
so let's go ahead and follow those a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:30.070 
so let's go ahead and follow those a
second

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.970 

also<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:31.190> will<00:02:31.340> need<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.820> funk<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.570> tab<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
also you will need to funk the tab the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.820 
also you will need to funk the tab the
tabs<00:02:34.280> there<00:02:34.720> but<00:02:35.720> not<00:02:35.840> for<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.380> option<00:02:36.740> of

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
tabs there but not for the option of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.280 
tabs there but not for the option of
gluing<00:02:38.230> tape<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:40.420> or<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.630> can<00:02:41.780> use<00:02:41.900> a<00:02:41.930> staple

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
gluing tape in or you can use a staple

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.210 
gluing tape in or you can use a staple
it's<00:02:42.980> up<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.340> you

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.130 

but<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.850> will<00:02:49.030> need<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.300> fold<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.690> as<00:02:49.930> well

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
but you will need to fold that as well

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.230 
but you will need to fold that as well
okay<00:02:51.600> so

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.710 

and<00:02:55.570> then<00:02:55.690> we<00:02:55.780> do<00:02:55.900> another<00:02:55.930> paper<00:02:56.380> chain<00:02:57.720> see

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
and then we do another paper chain see

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.800 
and then we do another paper chain see
through<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.760> repeat<00:03:01.030> process

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
through that and repeat process

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:20.810 
through that and repeat process
I<00:03:03.210> do<00:03:04.210> that<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> minute

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.760 

okay<00:03:21.820> so<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:22.120> doesn't<00:03:22.240> folded<00:03:25.020> I'm<00:03:26.020> gonna<00:03:26.200> use

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
okay so it doesn't folded I'm gonna use

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.700 
okay so it doesn't folded I'm gonna use
tape<00:03:27.100> today<00:03:31.020> because<00:03:32.020> I<00:03:32.140> don't<00:03:32.200> have<00:03:32.500> another

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
tape today because I don't have another

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.370 
tape today because I don't have another
stapler<00:03:33.510> stapler<00:03:34.510> would<00:03:34.870> probably<00:03:35.170> be<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
stapler stapler would probably be the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.050 
stapler stapler would probably be the
best<00:03:35.560> option<00:03:37.890> if<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.490> have<00:03:39.520> very<00:03:39.940> particular

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
best option if you have very particular

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.240 
best option if you have very particular
