can give folks a little background on
Runner<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.980> how<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.760> grew<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
Runner and how this grew out of the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.550 
Runner and how this grew out of the
bit.trip<00:00:27.660> series<00:00:28.199> all<00:00:28.650> right<00:00:28.769> excellent<00:00:29.390> so

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
bit.trip series all right excellent so

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.229 
bit.trip series all right excellent so
this<00:00:31.560> isn't<00:00:31.769> actually<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.340> bit<00:00:32.550> trip<00:00:32.790> game<00:00:33.030> this

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
this isn't actually a bit trip game this

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.190 
this isn't actually a bit trip game this
is<00:00:33.450> bit.trip<00:00:34.079> presents<00:00:34.500> runner<00:00:34.950> 2<00:00:35.219> and

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
is bit.trip presents runner 2 and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.799 
is bit.trip presents runner 2 and
basically<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:38.070> better<00:00:38.820> video<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
basically it's better video in a

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.540 
basically it's better video in a
different<00:00:40.200> world<00:00:40.350> than<00:00:40.649> he's<00:00:40.829> been<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.100> before

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
different world than he's been in before

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.580 
different world than he's been in before
and<00:00:42.510> we're<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.809> explain<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
and we're going to explain that in the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
and we're going to explain that in the
story<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.160> bit<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:46.110> games<00:00:46.289> has<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.100> same<00:00:47.340> basic

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
story a bit the games has the same basic

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.420 
story a bit the games has the same basic
moves<00:00:48.170> but<00:00:49.170> we've<00:00:49.289> added<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.680> couple<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.129> new

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
moves but we've added a couple of new

moves but we've added a couple of new
moves<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> dance<00:00:51.840> move<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.850> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
moves we have a dance move in here and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.420 
moves we have a dance move in here and
in<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> later<00:00:55.110> levels<00:00:55.320> there's<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.710> slide<00:00:56.100> kick

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
in the later levels there's a slide kick

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.119 
in the later levels there's a slide kick
and<00:00:56.670> we've<00:00:57.180> got<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> lot<00:00:57.570> more<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.809> store<00:00:58.129> for

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
and we've got a lot more in store for

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.209 
and we've got a lot more in store for
even<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> later<00:01:00.300> levels<00:01:00.539> such<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.219> rail

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
even the later levels such as rail

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.140 
even the later levels such as rail
sliding<00:01:03.710> we<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.830> loop-de-loops<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
sliding we have loop-de-loops in the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.109 
sliding we have loop-de-loops in the
game<00:01:06.299> which<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.770> lot<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.790> fun<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
game which are really a lot of fun and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.539 
game which are really a lot of fun and
there's<00:01:09.299> sort<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:10.010> timed<00:01:11.010> mini<00:01:11.340> game

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
there's sort of like a timed mini game

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.310 
there's sort of like a timed mini game
in<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:15.380> it's<00:01:16.380> right<00:01:16.619> trigger<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
in there and it's right trigger so you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.590 
in there and it's right trigger so you
go<00:01:19.470> into<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> fixed<00:01:20.130> dance<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.790> you'll<00:01:21.479> get

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
go into a fixed dance and you'll get

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.230 
go into a fixed dance and you'll get
points<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:23.070> because<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.520> fixed<00:01:23.939> if

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
points for it but because it's fixed if

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.730 
points for it but because it's fixed if
you<00:01:24.390> do<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.750> front<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.960> an<00:01:25.049> obstacle<00:01:25.320> you'll

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
you do it in front of an obstacle you'll

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.300 
you do it in front of an obstacle you'll
bunk<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.220> die<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.520> reset<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> we're<00:01:29.070> trying

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
bunk and die and reset so we're trying

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.929 
bunk and die and reset so we're trying
to<00:01:29.430> add<00:01:29.579> more<00:01:30.590> up<00:01:31.590> sort<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.549> there

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
to add more up sort of like this there

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.789 
to add more up sort of like this there
it<00:01:33.060> goes<00:01:33.770> did<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.950> from<00:01:35.250> oh<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.880> also<00:01:36.619> this<00:01:37.619> is

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
it goes did you from oh and also this is

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.140 
it goes did you from oh and also this is
probably<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.280> thing<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.610> we've<00:01:38.729> been<00:01:38.759> asked

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
probably the thing that we've been asked

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.140 
probably the thing that we've been asked
about<00:01:39.240> most<00:01:39.890> are<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.310> requests<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.970> feature

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
about most are the requests the feature

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.469 
about most are the requests the feature
request<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.680> checkpoint<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:45.329> added

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
request is the checkpoint and we added

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.740 
request is the checkpoint and we added
the<00:01:45.689> checkpoint<00:01:46.170> much<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.220> our<00:01:47.340> sugar<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.850> but

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the checkpoint much to our sugar in but

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.999 
the checkpoint much to our sugar in but
you'll<00:01:48.869> notice<00:01:49.140> if<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.320> jump<00:01:49.619> over<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
you'll notice if you jump over the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.770 
you'll notice if you jump over the
checkpoint<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.729> get<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> better<00:01:51.149> reward<00:01:51.659> than

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
checkpoint you get a better reward than

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.550 
checkpoint you get a better reward than
going<00:01:52.290> through<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.740> checkpoint<00:01:53.210> so

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
going through the checkpoint so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.510 
going through the checkpoint so
hopefully<00:01:55.560> you'll<00:01:55.710> get<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> chance<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.369> jump

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
hopefully you'll get a chance to jump

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.600 
hopefully you'll get a chance to jump
over<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> checkpoint

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.770 

we're<00:02:00.610> going<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.790> add<00:02:01.140> big<00:02:02.220> dynamic<00:02:03.780> scenes

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
we're going to add big dynamic scenes

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.680 
we're going to add big dynamic scenes
and<00:02:05.430> happiness<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:07.090> at<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.360> end<00:02:07.509> of<00:02:07.600> the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
and happiness and at the end of the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.630 
and happiness and at the end of the
level<00:02:07.960> if<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.229> get<00:02:08.380> up<00:02:08.470> perfect<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.280> goes<00:02:09.459> into

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
level if you get up perfect it goes into

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.510 
level if you get up perfect it goes into
another<00:02:09.789> minigame<00:02:10.270> which<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:11.350> basically<00:02:11.770> you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
another minigame which is basically you

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.720 
another minigame which is basically you
fired<00:02:12.819> out<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.270> Canon<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.410> target<00:02:14.860> so

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
fired out of a Canon and to a target so

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.280 
fired out of a Canon and to a target so
there<00:02:16.000> should<00:02:16.150> be<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.300> lot<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.510> little<00:02:16.870> elements

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
there should be a lot of little elements

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.850 
there should be a lot of little elements
of<00:02:17.610> fun<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.760> randomness<00:02:19.300> in<00:02:19.480> there<00:02:21.810> now

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860

one the original bit trips series we

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.880 
one the original bit trips series we
said<00:02:39.459> we<00:02:39.580> were<00:02:39.670> only<00:02:39.790> going<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.060> do<00:02:40.180> six<00:02:40.480> and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.250 
said we were only going to do six and
we're<00:02:41.890> going<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.069> stick<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.459> that

we're going to stick to that

we're going to stick to that
however<00:02:45.120> runner<00:02:46.120> was<00:02:46.590> one<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.680> our<00:02:47.800> favorite

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
however runner was one of our favorite

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.729 
however runner was one of our favorite
in<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.340> studio<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.260> it's<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.380> personal

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
in the studio and it's a personal

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.440 
in the studio and it's a personal
favorite<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.100> mine<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.580> wanted<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.940> explore

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
favorite of mine and I wanted to explore

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.750 
favorite of mine and I wanted to explore
it<00:02:52.600> more<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.950> will<00:02:57.190> tie<00:02:57.400> into<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
it more and so it will tie into the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.789 
it more and so it will tie into the
bit.trip<00:02:57.910> story<00:02:58.480> but<00:02:58.870> it's<00:02:59.019> sort<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.319> like<00:02:59.380> an

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
bit.trip story but it's sort of like an

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.030 
bit.trip story but it's sort of like an
offshoot<00:03:01.500> obviously<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.620> art<00:03:02.709> style<00:03:02.920> is

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
offshoot obviously the art style is

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.530 
offshoot obviously the art style is
completely<00:03:03.459> different

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
completely different

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.370 
completely different
so<00:03:04.870> it's<00:03:05.019> kind<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.230> commander<00:03:05.620> video<00:03:05.860> in<00:03:06.040> this

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
so it's kind of commander video in this

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.600 
so it's kind of commander video in this
the<00:03:08.380> story<00:03:08.620> will<00:03:08.799> kind<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.040> explain<00:03:09.190> this<00:03:09.549> a

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
the story will kind of explain this a

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.850 
the story will kind of explain this a
bit<00:03:09.880> but<00:03:10.030> it's<00:03:10.209> he<00:03:10.720> basically<00:03:11.110> gets<00:03:11.440> shot<00:03:11.829> with

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
bit but it's he basically gets shot with

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.670 
bit but it's he basically gets shot with
a<00:03:12.100> reality<00:03:12.489> on<00:03:12.850> fusion<00:03:13.120> beam<00:03:13.450> which<00:03:14.200> basically

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
a reality on fusion beam which basically

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.460 
a reality on fusion beam which basically
puts<00:03:14.950> them<00:03:15.130> on<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.280> drug<00:03:15.579> trip<00:03:16.170> but<00:03:17.170> don't<00:03:17.290> quote

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
puts them on a drug trip but don't quote

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.590 
puts them on a drug trip but don't quote
me<00:03:17.620> on<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:17.769> but<00:03:17.980> it's<00:03:18.519> sort<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:19.390> just

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
me on that but it's sort of you just

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.259 
me on that but it's sort of you just
said<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.870> into<00:03:20.079> a<00:03:20.109> microphone<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.120> could

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
said it into a microphone but you could

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.810 
said it into a microphone but you could
equate<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.810> drug<00:03:23.079> trip<00:03:23.260> but<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.579> is<00:03:24.790> a

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
equate it to a drug trip but it is a

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.780 
equate it to a drug trip but it is a
reality<00:03:25.000> on<00:03:25.329> fusion<00:03:25.570> dream<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:27.070> so<00:03:27.400> now<00:03:27.549> he's

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
reality on fusion dream and so now he's

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.949 
reality on fusion dream and so now he's
sort<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.120> like<00:03:28.299> in<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:30.280> weird<00:03:30.549> world<00:03:30.959> having
