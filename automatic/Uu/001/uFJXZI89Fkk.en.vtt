00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.380
 the gold reserves of the national bank 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.300
 Swiss are a subject of concern 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.010
 important for the Swiss after the 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.929
 crisis of 2008 there have been a lot of 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.890
 questions about the state of these reservations the 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:22.329
 rebound both the place where they were deposited 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.070
 last year we saw that the bank 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.349
 Swiss National Association can also make 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.569
 significant losses because of gold gold 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.399
 has indeed lost 25% in the markets 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.740
 last year what has 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.750
 generated for the bns 15 billion 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.300
 losses and forced him to give up 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.790
 to pay the promised revenue to the cantons 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.160
 and to the confederation 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.980
 now where we are today the bns 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.910
 with his gold stock one must first get 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:52.210
 remember that between 2000 and 2005 the bns has 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.280
 sold 1300 tons of gold at prices 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.790
 extremely low which made him lose 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.400
 money 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.200
 she raised only 21 billion 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.120
 of francs on his benches while he 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.230
 today would be worth its stocks 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.050
 61 billion next between 2007 and 2009 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.750
 she still sold 250 m at prices 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.750
 also low but a bit higher 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.770
 than in 2000 2005 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.909
 nevertheless she still lost 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.440
 money since when it is still 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.890
 much appreciated afterwards 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.600
 in total it is estimated that bns has lost 70 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.110
 billion francs selling all this 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.080
 gold indeed between the 250 dollars an ounce 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.420
 what they were worth in 2000 and the 1800s 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.220
 dollars an ounce that gold was worth to his 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.490
 August 2011 summit 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.220
 BNS obviously sold at the worst moment 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.950
 where he will have appreciated 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.500
 dazzling and even though gold has since its 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.990
 August 2011 summit correct by the way 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.600
 from 1800 to 1200 that is to say a dive 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.119
 of 35 % all the same it has none the less 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.340
 quadruple and since the price he 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.229
 was worth ten years ago ie after 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.510
 the end of sales from 1300 tons of the 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.180
 bns when it was worth 400 dollars 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.150
 finally he stays at the bns today 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.340
 1040 tonnes of gold that is valued 40 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.179
 times more than all 1300 tons 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.319
 who she sold between 2000 and 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.450
 they 5 if the bns had retained the 2600 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.090
 tons she had before the sales of 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.129
 the year 2000 and well today its 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.439
 audrey reserves 130 billion francs 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.569
 Swiss gold what she has today in 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.540
 worth represents 50 billion francs 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.629
 Swiss for bns no problem 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.209
 since the national bank does not want 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.189
 have more than 10% gold reserves it's 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.420
 the case today 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.030
 the initiative of the UDPS and fled 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.000
 during the Swiss who is who was 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.730
 launched in April 2013 would like the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.400
 bns retains 20% gold reserves on 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.379
 its balance sheet and that it is repatriating the entire 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.620
 order to drop elsewhere in the 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.139
 world 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.919
 BNS responded and with the support of 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.900
 Federal Council 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.370
 she refuted the arguments of the 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.409
 initiators of the eu deaths who launched 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.389
 this initiative by answering them that 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.239
 first she would not wish to be frozen 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:04.069
 its gold reserves and that it could not 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.590
 not then sell if ever the markets 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.060
 allowed her she could she 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.849
 would like to be flexible in the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.470
 selling and buying gold and then she 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.909
 would also like to be flexible when 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.949
 is to anchor for example the franc 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.159
 Swiss on the euro or other currencies 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:20.959
 in case of need to lower the prices 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.579
 the franc or to intervene in general on 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.349
 the forex market so then he 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:30.049
 remember that the bns had before 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:32.209
 2001 gold parity of the franc the franc was not 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.489
 that a substitute then and could be 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.519
 refunded at any time by 2 years and 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.199
 it is in 99-2000 that this gold standard of 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.639
 Swiss national bank has come to an end so 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.650
 today the national bank has a 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.840
 different look at gold that has become 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.099
 an investment like another that is 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.560
 simply an investment of 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.239
 diversification versus reserves 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.030
 monetary that is there since it ad 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.189
 sterling euro and the coming 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.449
 of course the dollar on its balance sheet 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.829
 gold is no more than an asset of 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.030
 diversification she does not wish 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.609
 that he is they occupy a place 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.790
 different and she also responded to 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:09.259
 emissions of the EU death that currently 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.079
 gold stocks stood at 70% in 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:15.319
 Switzerland itself and for 30% it would be 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.760
 distributed between the 20% and England 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.889
 canada thoroughbred 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.570
 will the initiators be satisfied 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.870
 will the Swiss people be satisfied 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.509
 of his answers 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.669
 it's not so sure that if a 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.620
 new crisis was to hit the eye 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.270
 that the population as well as the banks 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.889
 central gold deals could to 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.949
 change again and we could again 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.410
 design it as a standard an asset 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.419
 actually refuge in the times when one 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.750
 again doubts markets and 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.750
 currencies
