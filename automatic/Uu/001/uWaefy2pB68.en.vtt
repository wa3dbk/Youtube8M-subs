00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.620 
Queen takes Knight actually assuming
black<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.299> castle<00:03:04.750> ah<00:03:06.239> because<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.390> bishop

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
black and castle ah because the bishop

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.130 
black and castle ah because the bishop
is<00:03:07.660> not<00:03:07.840> going<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.019> be<00:03:08.109> lost<00:03:08.290> after<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
is not going to be lost after and the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.490 
is not going to be lost after and the
art<00:03:11.290> thing<00:03:11.500> under<00:03:11.739> try<00:03:11.950> Queen<00:03:12.280> takes<00:03:12.459> Knight<00:03:12.609> I

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
art thing under try Queen takes Knight I

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.920 
art thing under try Queen takes Knight I
think<00:03:14.500> if<00:03:14.590> rook<00:03:14.769> takes<00:03:14.950> b7<00:03:15.400> just<00:03:15.549> castle

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.530 

that's<00:03:19.930> not<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.140> crap<00:03:20.410> move<00:03:20.620> oh<00:03:22.079> well<00:03:24.359> what<00:03:25.359> is

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
that's not the crap move oh well what is

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:39.319 
that's not the crap move oh well what is
this<00:03:35.910> Bishop<00:03:36.910> d5<00:03:37.510> pretty<00:03:38.319> sure<00:03:38.470> that<00:03:38.680> was

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
this Bishop d5 pretty sure that was

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:48.210 
this Bishop d5 pretty sure that was
ruled<00:03:40.329> out<00:03:40.510> um<00:03:43.829> tricky

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.009 

run<00:03:49.220> out<00:03:49.250> time<00:03:49.670> on<00:03:49.819> this<00:03:49.939> one<00:03:50.150> as<00:03:50.269> well<00:03:50.450> ah<00:03:53.019> so

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
run out time on this one as well ah so

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.100 
run out time on this one as well ah so
I'm<00:03:54.079> just<00:03:54.700> cancelling<00:03:55.700> just<00:03:56.599> rule<00:03:56.780> out<00:03:56.959> this

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
I'm just cancelling just rule out this

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.360 
I'm just cancelling just rule out this
move<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:59.500> let's<00:04:00.500> just<00:04:00.590> roll<00:04:00.860> out<00:04:00.890> this<00:04:01.159> move

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
move and let's just roll out this move

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.520 
move and let's just roll out this move
as<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.670> sanity<00:04:01.939> check<00:04:02.120> surely<00:04:03.110> yeah<00:04:03.290> Brooke

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
as a sanity check surely yeah Brooke

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.080 
as a sanity check surely yeah Brooke
takes<00:04:03.799> is<00:04:04.159> just<00:04:04.280> winning<00:04:04.579> there<00:04:04.700> anyway<00:04:04.939> it's

takes is just winning there anyway it's

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:14.649 
takes is just winning there anyway it's
not<00:04:05.150> worth<00:04:05.329> trying<00:04:06.159> Bishop<00:04:07.159> a6<00:04:08.769> rook<00:04:09.769> c8<00:04:13.659> let's

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
not worth trying Bishop a6 rook c8 let's

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:24.490 
not worth trying Bishop a6 rook c8 let's
just<00:04:14.750> rule<00:04:15.019> that<00:04:15.170> one<00:04:15.319> else<00:04:15.940> Wow<00:04:16.989> um<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:23.199> think<00:04:24.199> I

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
really quite handy um I think I've got

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.480 
really quite handy um I think I've got
the<00:04:55.490> picture<00:04:55.940> now<00:04:56.470> if<00:04:57.470> I<00:04:57.590> give<00:04:57.770> you<00:04:57.800> 10<00:04:58.070> seconds

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
the picture now if I give you 10 seconds

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.670 
the picture now if I give you 10 seconds
I<00:04:58.760> think<00:04:59.270> I<00:04:59.360> know<00:04:59.449> what<00:04:59.750> black<00:04:59.960> does<00:05:00.199> here<00:05:00.470> for

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
I think I know what black does here for

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.960 
I think I know what black does here for
the<00:05:00.770> week<00:05:00.889> bat<00:05:01.130> rank<00:05:01.400> that<00:05:01.580> is<00:05:01.699> a<00:05:01.729> good<00:05:01.970> clue<00:05:02.240> I

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
the week bat rank that is a good clue I

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.879 
the week bat rank that is a good clue I
I<00:05:04.970> think<00:05:05.599> the<00:05:06.080> first<00:05:06.289> move<00:05:06.500> is<00:05:06.620> at<00:05:06.740> least

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
I think the first move is at least

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.580 
I think the first move is at least
taking<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:07.659> can't<00:05:08.659> switch<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:09.080> we<00:05:09.199> just<00:05:09.229> need<00:05:09.500> to

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
that looks fairly clear cut looks like a

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:02.670 
that looks fairly clear cut looks like a
much<00:05:56.570> easier<00:05:56.599> one<00:05:57.020> than<00:05:57.139> the<00:05:57.229> other<00:05:57.349> one
