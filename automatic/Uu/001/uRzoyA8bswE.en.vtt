00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.100
 that modaris honors for welcome in a 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.150
 new spot light of what we talk about today 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.820
 let's talk about the polos lo glass shaders 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.100
 a fashion that allows us to use 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.710
 a shader in minecraft without the races 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.530
 this is because it was created for 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.270
 be used by those who do not 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.640
 manage to use the other shaders 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.199
 they can't use because they are 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.739
 really very heavy like for example 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.499
 I don't even read this in fact 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.050
 lowered the positions to succeed in 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:47.370
 make the video as you see the graphic not 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.319
 it's the maximum 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.179
 pro because I lower the settings 

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:53.039
 but I guarantee you that this mode that 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.379
 this shader is really done a lot 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.229
 well therefore a great alternative to 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.249
 those to the important official ones that 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:03.809
 you all know but those are 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.400
 impossible to hold you must have only 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.280
 a computer from NASA or in any case a 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.160
 good computer while mine is a 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.320
 charcoal then had to use this 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.530
 I recommend using it because 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.750
 precisely it makes minecraft in hd not only 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:26.490
 the graphics but also the water and so on 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:30.060
 then it also adds a feature 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.470
 a lot that is if you look at the sun if 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.720
 watch the sun 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.730
 this failed to see it right 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.990
 as in reality because 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.610
 and powerful not being able to see then there 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.910
 advice to use together with this 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.780
 fashion also fps plus is the hope to find 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.570
 since the hope you make yourself I am competing for 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.050
 aim and in any case let's say they make the race 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.450
 you can therefore use the less 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.890
 shader you can make the most of it 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.440
 and I advise you to use it 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.710
 especially if you make videos because if you do 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.750
 video let's say your writings 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.790
 seeing this anyway is much more 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.280
 nice to see in hd and these effects 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.270
 that still see it normal since 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.870
 today nobody uses minecraft 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.190
 normally so I recommend you 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.940
 use this mod 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.440
 remember you have to use it with the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.440
 hope to find for the race less and with 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.400
 the fps plus you will find in china 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.880
 registration then you will find notes you will find 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.230
 also the tutorial and all the subnets 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.460
 all in description we will see you at 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.050
 next video and hope this video 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.510
 you only enjoyed it then let me 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.430
 in peace the channel cards and commented 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.900

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.350
