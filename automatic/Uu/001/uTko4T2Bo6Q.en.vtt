first<00:01:49.300> workout<00:01:49.660> nutrition<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.620> that<00:01:50.770> that's<00:01:51.100> a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
first workout nutrition so that that's a

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.260 
first workout nutrition so that that's a
video<00:01:51.340> like<00:01:51.580> are<00:01:51.760> they<00:01:51.850> getting<00:01:52.000> enough

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
video like are they getting enough

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.450 
video like are they getting enough
protein<00:01:52.420> and<00:01:52.810> carbs<00:01:53.050> those<00:01:53.260> workout<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:54.280> kind

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
protein and carbs those workout to kind

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.550 
protein and carbs those workout to kind
of<00:01:54.490> get<00:01:54.610> ready<00:01:54.820> for<00:01:55.120> next<00:01:55.540> chunk<00:01:55.900> of<00:01:56.110> training

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
of get ready for next chunk of training

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.620 
of get ready for next chunk of training
and<00:01:56.710> as<00:01:57.490> always<00:01:57.730> you<00:01:57.940> know<00:01:58.270> these<00:01:58.450> other

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
kind of dragging down the recovery and

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.160 
kind of dragging down the recovery and
in<00:02:03.820> that<00:02:03.940> final<00:02:04.180> thing<00:02:04.480> you<00:02:04.630> like<00:02:04.780> is<00:02:04.900> the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
in that final thing you like is the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.350 
in that final thing you like is the
programming<00:02:05.860> good<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.910> guys<00:02:07.060> sound<00:02:07.330> like

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
programming good you guys sound like

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.940 
programming good you guys sound like
you're<00:02:07.450> doing<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.750> really<00:02:07.780> good<00:02:08.080> program<00:02:08.290> but

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
you're doing a really good program but

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.020 
you're doing a really good program but
looking<00:02:09.280> at<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.429> little<00:02:09.640> periodization

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
looking at a little periodization

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.210 
looking at a little periodization
looking<00:02:10.720> at<00:02:10.810> their<00:02:10.960> weak<00:02:11.470> points<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.190> game

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
looking at their weak points in the game

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.010 
looking at their weak points in the game
and<00:02:12.790> getting<00:02:12.970> really<00:02:13.300> really<00:02:13.420> efficient<00:02:13.900> on

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
and getting really really efficient on

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.660 
and getting really really efficient on
the<00:02:14.110> training<00:02:14.500> side<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.250> food<00:02:15.430> obviously

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
the training side so the food obviously

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.750 
the training side so the food obviously
is<00:02:16.120> huge<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.860> lifestyle<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.010> huge<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.430> then

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
is huge the lifestyle is huge and then

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.980 
is huge the lifestyle is huge and then
bring<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.030> in<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.209> training<00:02:19.450> bringing<00:02:19.900> up

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
bring it in the training bringing up

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.630 
bring it in the training bringing up
weak<00:02:20.260> areas<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.040> roots<00:02:21.220> efficient

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
weak areas so that the roots efficient

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.420 
weak areas so that the roots efficient
is<00:02:21.760> able<00:02:22.060> okay<00:02:22.810> great<00:02:23.080> that's<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.160> we're<00:02:24.310> here
