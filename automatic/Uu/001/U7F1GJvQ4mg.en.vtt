00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
this box these are the most confusing

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.099 
this box these are the most confusing
rules<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.980> ever<00:00:23.279> read<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:24.269> any<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
rules I have ever read for any of the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.910 
rules I have ever read for any of the
expansions<00:00:25.740> from<00:00:25.949> Twilight<00:00:26.340> creations<00:00:26.849> I

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
expansions from Twilight creations I

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.070 
expansions from Twilight creations I
literally<00:00:28.920> spent<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> last<00:00:29.820> few<00:00:30.090> days<00:00:30.150> poring

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
literally spent the last few days poring

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.450 
literally spent the last few days poring
over<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.470> we've<00:00:31.740> been<00:00:31.769> discussing<00:00:32.250> it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
over this we've been discussing it

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.110 
over this we've been discussing it
together<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:33.030> my<00:00:33.180> group<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.820> just<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.910> little

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
together with my group and just a little

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.380 
together with my group and just a little
copy<00:00:36.329> right<00:00:36.630> here<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.110> says<00:00:38.000> let's<00:00:39.000> see<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.300> was

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
copy right here it says let's see it was

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.950 
copy right here it says let's see it was
just<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:40.050> any<00:00:40.160> expansions<00:00:41.780> fiddle<00:00:42.780> with

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
just as with any expansions fiddle with

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.529 
just as with any expansions fiddle with
the<00:00:43.079> rules<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.610> is

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
the rules as you like and that is

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.600 
the rules as you like and that is
exactly<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:46.590> we're<00:00:46.770> gonna<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.160> we're<00:00:47.460> going

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
exactly what we're gonna do we're going

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.360 
exactly what we're gonna do we're going
to<00:00:47.730> fiddle<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.329> rules<00:00:48.510> because<00:00:49.370> we

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
to fiddle with the rules because we

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.610 
to fiddle with the rules because we
really<00:00:50.789> don't<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.660> way<00:00:51.809> they<00:00:52.170> set<00:00:52.410> this

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
really don't like the way they set this

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.540 
really don't like the way they set this
up<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> lot<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:54.289> things<00:00:55.289> about<00:00:55.590> this

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
up we like a lot of things about this

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.849 
up we like a lot of things about this
expansion<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.449> though<00:00:58.109> some<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.710> rules

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
expansion but though some of the rules

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.799 
expansion but though some of the rules
depending<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.699> well<00:00:59.940> basically<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
depending on well basically just the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.779 
depending on well basically just the
locks<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.680> do<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.430> we're<00:01:02.579> changing

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
locks we do not like so we're changing

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.200 
locks we do not like so we're changing
that<00:01:03.170> also<00:01:04.170> one<00:01:04.830> side<00:01:05.220> note<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.850> actually

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
that also one side note this is actually

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.890 
that also one side note this is actually
the<00:01:06.360> thickest<00:01:06.840> expansion<00:01:07.770> box<00:01:08.630> they've<00:01:09.630> had

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the thickest expansion box they've had

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.230 
the thickest expansion box they've had
for<00:01:10.200> some<00:01:10.409> time<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:11.010> short<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> other

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
for some time it's short like the other

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.840 
for some time it's short like the other
ones<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.799> has<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> little<00:01:14.549> bit<00:01:14.610> more

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
ones but this one has a little bit more

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.420 
ones but this one has a little bit more
thickness<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.479> that's<00:01:15.689> due<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.049> all<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
thickness to it that's due to all the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.340 
thickness to it that's due to all the
zombies<00:01:17.460> oh<00:01:17.580> speaking<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:18.330> let's<00:01:19.049> get<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
you flip over the lot Tok and it goes

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.230 
you flip over the lot Tok and it goes
from<00:04:58.000> 60<00:04:58.509> to<00:04:58.750> 30<00:04:59.320> they<00:05:00.190> don't<00:05:00.520> explain<00:05:00.970> what

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
from 60 to 30 they don't explain what

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.230 
from 60 to 30 they don't explain what
the<00:05:01.330> purpose<00:05:01.810> of<00:05:02.020> this<00:05:02.259> is<00:05:02.560> if<00:05:03.160> it's<00:05:03.849> on<00:05:03.940> 30

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
the purpose of this is if it's on 30

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.990 
the purpose of this is if it's on 30
then<00:05:04.599> the<00:05:04.720> lock<00:05:04.900> is<00:05:05.139> removed<00:05:05.560> now<00:05:06.520> it's<00:05:06.729> weird

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
then the lock is removed now it's weird

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.700 
then the lock is removed now it's weird
because<00:05:07.210> it<00:05:07.419> doesn't<00:05:07.630> say<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:07.900> tiles<00:05:08.289> removed

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
because it doesn't say the tiles removed

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.040 
because it doesn't say the tiles removed
however<00:05:09.490> and<00:05:09.849> the<00:05:10.060> rulebook<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.660> says<00:05:10.870> if

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
however and the rulebook is says if

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.110 
however and the rulebook is says if
someone<00:05:11.380> gets<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.830> tile<00:05:12.099> they<00:05:12.699> have<00:05:12.849> to<00:05:12.940> go<00:05:13.060> to

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
someone gets the tile they have to go to

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.610 
someone gets the tile they have to go to
the<00:05:13.300> next<00:05:13.599> adjacent<00:05:13.750> square<00:05:14.440> immediately

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
the next adjacent square immediately

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.610 
the next adjacent square immediately
well<00:05:15.340> okay<00:05:15.880> they<00:05:16.030> just<00:05:16.210> go<00:05:16.300> back<00:05:16.479> one<00:05:16.780> place<00:05:17.259> in

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
well okay they just go back one place in

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.969 
well okay they just go back one place in
all<00:05:18.009> cases<00:05:18.370> and<00:05:19.330> or<00:05:20.139> in<00:05:20.289> this<00:05:20.470> case<00:05:20.680> I<00:05:20.830> guess

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
all cases and or in this case I guess

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.730 
all cases and or in this case I guess
two<00:05:21.220> spaces<00:05:21.550> okay<00:05:22.120> so<00:05:22.900> they<00:05:23.050> go<00:05:23.229> backwards

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
two spaces okay so they go backwards

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.610 
two spaces okay so they go backwards
there<00:05:24.009> gaint<00:05:24.550> their<00:05:24.849> play<00:05:25.449> ends<00:05:26.080> right<00:05:26.320> there

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
there gaint their play ends right there

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.730 
there gaint their play ends right there
and<00:05:27.009> then<00:05:27.759> this<00:05:27.970> whole<00:05:28.210> tile<00:05:28.570> is<00:05:28.900> removed<00:05:29.409> from

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
and then this whole tile is removed from

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.149 
and then this whole tile is removed from
the<00:05:29.889> game

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159 
the game

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.999 
the game
what<00:05:31.259> we<00:05:32.259> don't<00:05:32.349> get<00:05:32.530> to<00:05:32.620> fight<00:05:33.090> zombies<00:05:34.090> and

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
what we don't get to fight zombies and

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.350 
what we don't get to fight zombies and
and<00:05:36.009> by<00:05:36.159> the<00:05:36.190> way<00:05:36.340> this<00:05:36.550> is<00:05:36.729> zombies<00:05:37.060> that<00:05:37.180> come

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
and by the way this is zombies that come

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.629 
and by the way this is zombies that come
out<00:05:37.509> of<00:05:37.539> the<00:05:37.690> cage<00:05:37.930> you<00:05:38.320> would<00:05:38.830> replace<00:05:39.219> them

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
out of the cage you would replace them

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.990 
out of the cage you would replace them
with<00:05:40.449> an<00:05:40.750> additional<00:05:41.349> zombie<00:05:42.340> from<00:05:42.550> your<00:05:42.729> pile

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
with an additional zombie from your pile

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.480 
with an additional zombie from your pile
here<00:05:43.530> so<00:05:44.530> the<00:05:44.650> zombies<00:05:45.009> are<00:05:45.130> just<00:05:45.280> never

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
here so the zombies are just never

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.209 
here so the zombies are just never
ending<00:05:45.849> coming<00:05:46.060> out<00:05:46.300> of<00:05:46.389> the<00:05:46.449> cages<00:05:46.960> here<00:05:47.229> but

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219 
ending coming out of the cages here but

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:50.270 
ending coming out of the cages here but
this<00:05:48.460> makes<00:05:48.729> no<00:05:48.969> sense<00:05:49.000> when<00:05:49.539> you<00:05:49.630> remove<00:05:49.930> the

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
this makes no sense when you remove the

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.800 
this makes no sense when you remove the
lockdown<00:05:51.280> you<00:05:51.669> remove<00:05:51.969> these<00:05:52.150> tiles<00:05:52.449> well

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
lockdown you remove these tiles well

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.620 
lockdown you remove these tiles well
that<00:05:52.930> makes<00:05:53.139> it<00:05:53.460> harder<00:05:54.460> for<00:05:54.490> everyone<00:05:54.969> to<00:05:55.090> die

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
that makes it harder for everyone to die

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.149 
that makes it harder for everyone to die
I<00:05:55.659> mean<00:05:55.960> if<00:05:56.020> animals<00:05:56.409> just<00:05:56.560> keep<00:05:56.770> coming<00:05:57.039> out

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
I mean if animals just keep coming out

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:58.589 
I mean if animals just keep coming out
here<00:05:57.460> you<00:05:57.639> have<00:05:57.759> a<00:05:57.789> lot<00:05:57.940> of<00:05:57.969> animals<00:05:58.360> flying

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
here you have a lot of animals flying

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.360 
here you have a lot of animals flying
around<00:05:58.750> you're<00:05:58.990> always<00:05:59.020> fine<00:05:59.500> here<00:05:59.770> you<00:06:00.250> have

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
around you're always fine here you have

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.680 
around you're always fine here you have
limited<00:06:00.550> hearts<00:06:00.969> and<00:06:01.150> bullets<00:06:01.419> then<00:06:01.570> yeah<00:06:01.659> I

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
limited hearts and bullets then yeah I

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.830 
limited hearts and bullets then yeah I
can<00:06:01.960> see<00:06:02.110> everyone<00:06:02.349> dying<00:06:02.710> but<00:06:03.039> if<00:06:03.460> you<00:06:03.610> keep

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
can see everyone dying but if you keep

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.120 
can see everyone dying but if you keep
moving<00:06:04.840> these<00:06:04.960> tiles<00:06:05.409> from<00:06:05.500> the<00:06:05.590> game<00:06:05.860> will

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
moving these tiles from the game will

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.469 
moving these tiles from the game will
that<00:06:06.250> remove<00:06:06.520> those<00:06:06.639> animals<00:06:07.060> from<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.330> game

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
that remove those animals from the game

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.649 
that remove those animals from the game
and<00:06:07.780> there's<00:06:08.530> really<00:06:08.740> no<00:06:08.979> point<00:06:09.190> so<00:06:09.669> here's

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
and there's really no point so here's

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:12.689 
and there's really no point so here's
what<00:06:11.110> we<00:06:11.320> did<00:06:11.560> to<00:06:11.710> do<00:06:11.830> it<00:06:11.949> differently<00:06:12.340> yes

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
what we did to do it differently yes

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.779 
what we did to do it differently yes
when<00:06:13.030> someone<00:06:13.389> gets<00:06:13.539> their<00:06:13.719> first<00:06:13.930> six<00:06:14.289> kills

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
when someone gets their first six kills

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.029 
when someone gets their first six kills
the<00:06:15.789> locks<00:06:16.030> will<00:06:16.300> flip<00:06:16.599> over<00:06:16.840> now<00:06:17.590> there<00:06:17.889> are

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 
the locks will flip over now there are

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:20.610 
the locks will flip over now there are
other<00:06:18.340> cards<00:06:18.940> in<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:19.360> deck<00:06:19.389> that<00:06:19.599> say<00:06:20.020> hey<00:06:20.259> if

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
other cards in the deck that say hey if

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.909 
other cards in the deck that say hey if
you<00:06:21.460> you<00:06:21.699> can<00:06:21.909> unclip<00:06:22.509> a<00:06:22.539> card<00:06:22.900> or<00:06:23.199> flip<00:06:23.770> it

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
you you can unclip a card or flip it

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
action it would still count for five

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.640

points<00:06:58.089> in<00:06:58.360> the<00:06:58.419> game<00:06:58.599> if<00:06:58.900> they<00:06:59.050> got<00:06:59.199> it<00:06:59.409> so<00:06:59.589> it

points in the game if they got it so it

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.500 
points in the game if they got it so it
