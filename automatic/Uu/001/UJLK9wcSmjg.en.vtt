00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
so just set Jake's tire pressures up to

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.420 
so just set Jake's tire pressures up to
32<00:00:37.079> psi<00:00:37.289> which<00:00:37.769> is<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> manufacturers

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
32 psi which is the manufacturers

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.130 
32 psi which is the manufacturers
recommendation<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.539> this<00:00:39.660> car

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
recommendation for this car

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.389 
recommendation for this car
you<00:00:40.559> should<00:00:40.680> always<00:00:40.800> set<00:00:41.100> your<00:00:41.190> tire

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
you should always set your tire

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.490 
you should always set your tire
pressures<00:00:41.850> when<00:00:42.179> the<00:00:42.420> tires<00:00:42.659> are<00:00:42.809> cold<00:00:43.199> either

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
pressures when the tires are cold either

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.319 
pressures when the tires are cold either
when<00:00:43.769> it's<00:00:43.890> sitting<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.159> your<00:00:44.190> garage<00:00:44.280> after<00:00:45.149> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
when it's sitting in your garage after a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.759 
when it's sitting in your garage after a
short<00:00:45.539> trip<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> service<00:00:46.260> station<00:00:46.649> and

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
short trip to the service station and

00:00:46.769 --> 00:01:00.630 
short trip to the service station and
here's<00:00:47.430> why

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.190 

so<00:01:01.640> now<00:01:01.820> that<00:01:01.880> you've<00:01:02.150> warmed<00:01:02.480> up<00:01:02.720> your<00:01:02.900> tires

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
so now that you've warmed up your tires

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.700 
so now that you've warmed up your tires
I'll<00:01:03.740> have<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:03.920> little<00:01:04.160> look<00:01:04.250> here<00:01:05.560> so<00:01:06.560> that's

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
I'll have a little look here so that's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.040 
I'll have a little look here so that's
sitting<00:01:06.920> at<00:01:07.010> 37<00:01:07.880> it's<00:01:08.210> five<00:01:08.510> pounds<00:01:08.720> higher

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
sitting at 37 it's five pounds higher

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.660 
sitting at 37 it's five pounds higher
than<00:01:09.290> when<00:01:09.470> we<00:01:09.590> go<00:01:09.740> set<00:01:10.010> them<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.310> five<00:01:10.460> pounds

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
than when we go set them and five pounds

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.070 
than when we go set them and five pounds
hide<00:01:10.910> what<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:11.240> manufacturer<00:01:11.780> says<00:01:11.960> we

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
hide what the manufacturer says we

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.200 
hide what the manufacturer says we
should<00:01:12.230> set<00:01:12.380> than<00:01:12.500> that<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.430> now<00:01:13.640> they're<00:01:13.910> hot

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
should set than that so now they're hot

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.840 
should set than that so now they're hot
let's<00:01:14.540> reset<00:01:14.870> and<00:01:15.080> 32<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.830> wait<00:01:16.580> around<00:01:16.700> and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
let's reset and 32 and wait around and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:38.020 
let's reset and 32 and wait around and
see<00:01:16.940> what<00:01:17.060> happens

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:47.380 

oh<00:01:43.570> okay<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:44.630> now<00:01:44.930> it's<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.200> 24<00:01:46.040> P<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:46.340> 24<00:01:46.909> psi

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
oh okay so now it's a 24 P so 24 psi

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.880 
oh okay so now it's a 24 P so 24 psi
it's<00:01:47.570> way<00:01:47.960> too<00:01:48.380> low

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890

265 mescaline oumax- it back to a time

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.550 
265 mescaline oumax- it back to a time
that's<00:02:06.170> right

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
that's right
