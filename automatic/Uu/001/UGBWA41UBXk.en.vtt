auto<00:01:12.869> fire<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.619> various<00:01:14.189> lots<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.939> variables

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
auto fire so various lots of variables

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.969 
auto fire so various lots of variables
to<00:01:15.420> consider<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:16.490> will<00:01:17.490> switch<00:01:17.640> back<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> Jill
