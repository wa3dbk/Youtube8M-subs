alright<00:00:01.860> so<00:00:02.010> I<00:00:02.040> was<00:00:02.190> actually<00:00:02.310> going<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.700> try

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
alright so I was actually going to try

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.030 
alright so I was actually going to try
to<00:00:02.909> show<00:00:03.750> myself<00:00:03.929> taking<00:00:04.440> him<00:00:04.560> out<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.830> box

but I was a little bit more complicated
than<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.259> thought<00:00:07.290> because<00:00:07.740> there's<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.490> lot<00:00:08.610> of
