00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.689
 here on the outskirts of the airport in 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.820
 where there is a large enough continent 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.460
 of search for these two bodies that 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.890
 they have not yet been found in the sea 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.420
 as you mentioned last night 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.879
 they found the two bodies of a man 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.309
 and a woman apparently this one from 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.860
 this miss or lady nurse and of 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.500
 one of the men who traveled in this 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.239
 aircraft to one of the three that left 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.220
 aircraft is not known if these pilots and 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.080
 from the passenger 12 pilots or the 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.699
 passenger although it was found but then yes 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.470
 confirmed the two bodies as you 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.720
 mention however continues the 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.949
 operative rescue and search of the 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.739
 two others that is still missing another novelty is 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.860
 that we may have heard a little 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.619
 what is the conversation between the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.780
 pilot and the control tower where he 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.520
 immediately after taking off this 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.080
 Powder is Airport 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.330
 approximately 20 minutes from the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.070
 city of miami as it takes off 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.900
 immediately communicates with tower of 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.929
 control informing that it has 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.980
 mechanical problems and starts a 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.680
 conversation with 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.320
 of control of plus or minus 5 to 10 minutes 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.350
 and you can hear a silence where 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.440
 they can no longer communicate the one with 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.000
 the other and that after unfortunately 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.220
 the tragedy that the plane falls is confirmed 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.630
 in the sea about three miles from 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.080
 residents airport 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.120
 and very close the city of miami is the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.700
 moment to open the authorities what is 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.500
 the report that they also give of this 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.270
 expertise that itself with respect to 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.440
 the reasons and how it could be carried out 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.450
 well this unfortunate accident details 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.370
 about the accident and they have not wanted 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.590
 shield them they simply say that 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.270
 is still under investigation has been 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.190
 could observe that observe that they have 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.380
 collected parts of the plane in the 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.540
 there are already some pictures that the guard 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.190
 coastal is providing the media itself 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.290
 same as well as how I repeat follows the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.030
 search still of these two bodies not 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.460
 they have wanted to confirm them the names 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.780
 however, we have learned the 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.620
 names like you already mentioned it 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.240
 in the program and then still 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.489
 and giving hard to the search because 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.470
 they are not going to stop saying they are going to exhaust 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.420
 your efforts to take advantage of that 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.670
 of dawn here and then they will continue 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.980
 all the rest of the day says confirmed that 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.560
 It is a medical aircraft which is 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.910
 I used to lead the old man 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.250
 relatives have not been present 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.720
 still in spite of that good 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.720
 We have officially released the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.760
 names the right there are many 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.410
 speculation but nevertheless this 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.090
 airports with the port enough 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.830
 big and here where we find the 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.019
 means we have not been able to observe any 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.300
