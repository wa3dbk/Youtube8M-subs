00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.300
 I wanted what was that 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.570
 without much understanding of how Fritz Walter actually is Fritz Walter 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.079
 my 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:10.320
 l first single 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.619
 she was desperate that was 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.469
 his dream of being a provider 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.789
 in Germany can be now 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.939
 but by the war, the dancer had long to international vineyard 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.659
 With 34 years it was finally time 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:31.199
 Walter for the German team through the World Cup 54 Richter was the extended arm 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.360
 be careful of the boss for the players 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.510
 Sepp Herberger 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.780
 also i want i so saw the big terrain 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.360
 to be moved 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.930
 they offer themselves 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.390
 For example, if everything is so that it is filled up and downright on 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.800
 Balzer not only shines on the pitch as a footballer 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.600
 but also as a righteous person to opponents and to play along 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.930
 even in the hour of the greatest victory at the home victory against Hungary 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.250
 he gives the "miracle of Bern" a rather restrained use 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.400
 so that was Aigner 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.820
 that too deserves to be because of the jackdaw 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.190
 to unbelievably nice guy this was less 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.150
 To defend the title in Sweden Nadal then again on the aged 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.940
 Director Fritz Walter 38 annually 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.970
 presented himself in Bern 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.090
 no risk for everyone in the team 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.090
 but a matter of course 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.920
 the diesel leaked people of this world with more old 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.900
 Somebody from Somalia, what can I say now but all since this deadline 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.510
 Problem if the publisher Werthers but clever message 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.090
 he never forgot that anymore 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.680
 in the semifinals ended up being part of their injury break 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.200
 but the honors and the epi tons for his achievements Bryson's lifetime 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.740
 Not 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.550
 Walter remains a star 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.550
 at 1 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.970
 we want to give an autograph of Diego Godin 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.950
 there and knew very well that this is a great personality 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.899
 This is the first team to be accompanied by national team captains 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.139
 many tournaments until his death 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.389
 during the 2002 World Cup 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.799
 we ourselves in the remote venue South Korea 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.799
 leaves its mark 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.089
 have that 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.419
 such a humble person a soul 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.589
 7 o'clock was good 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:31.569
 wonderful person
