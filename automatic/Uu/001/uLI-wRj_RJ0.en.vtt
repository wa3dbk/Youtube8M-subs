00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.670
 we were shooting this first episode of lucie 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.780
 from paris this blog medica was really 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.460
 an enriching experience 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.720
 when I was offered the test I have everything 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.550
 immediately jumped at the opportunity because 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.480
 I really wanted to know it 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.750
 that she is what she had in the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.090
 belly 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.990
 this camera will still be bluffing in 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.990
 image rendering terms 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.430
 at 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.329
 one of the big dots times this camera 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.799
 it's still taxonomic that has 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.449
 announced at 13 10 years old we can really 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.129
 fun to score has marked its lights 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.879
 can you can type creates strong 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.960
 interesting things 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.070
 the light at random right away 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.259
 natural for example at the florist 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.149
 or we shot against the light 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.220
 of the showcase there were the justices in 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.259
 more of the store is a system that plays 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.880
 and we managed to keep the information and 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.369
 outside on the street and at 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.690
 Inside the store without any worries 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.369
 it was interesting to see that we had 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.990
 this opportunity to turn to a 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.789
 content of his letter to give up a 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.770
 car on the bottom who is who and what 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.720
 ridges and so we were just 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.670
 interesting to see how she was managing 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.100
 highlights on the Aix and 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.590
 again it's sweet it's all 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.539
 quite exploitable in the shouting that 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.950
 in the kitchen there is a mini- tip 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.380
 someone in who is who is just placed 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.240
 above the actress whose whose 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.679
 do and that tape tape relatively strong 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.750
 and it was interesting to see 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.810
 also how to succeed the township pots 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.360
 exceed 60% of the exposure to 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.000
 usual and again it works 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.769
 pretty good 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.269
 the magic really did a great 

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:56.530
 working on the sensor is enough 

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:58.370
 impressive with the mayor who are 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.630
 come three times more expensive and who 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.760
 as soon as we are con and dynamic who 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.560
 do not exceed the 10 diaf so on it 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.750
 a big congratulations to beak matic we have a 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.120
 picture all 12 years not look too much 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.920
 clinic compared to other cameras such 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.270
 that the sony or buildings are 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.430
 lures in terms of sensitivity 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.900
 it's not bad so we went up to 1600 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.490
 iso especially in the root of the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.380
 victory we just lit up with a tube 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.140
 of 120 kino and guarantor of the same if he is 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:31.610
 not surprisingly contrasted and that we 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:33.740
 quite like the cooking of 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.180
 calves louise complete regarding rendering 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.520
 colorimetric it's definitely the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.220
 camera accuses the shot a little bit 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.110
 colors do not stand out very natural 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.420
 difficult to have a skin tone 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.370
 realistic statement was the snow we have 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.160
 a lot fired we searched a lot and 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.660
 there is always one trend 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.340
 magenta which very present is a 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.930
 trend is a little green trend 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.330
 so I made it is not necessarily ugly 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.130
 but it's hard work on them 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.290
 skin tones there it was difficult 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.340
 actually get you a hue 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.480
 really interesting skin 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.560
 that is, the room for maneuver 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.060
 is very narrow 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.770
 finally and where it stands out most 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.750
 it's mostly in the interiors in 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.370
 night interiors that are illuminating 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.620
 tungsten where there is a lot less 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.120
 information in the blues or there the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.540
 skins are very difficult to find 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.540
 in fact 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.209
 let's take the same case 1600 iso the camera 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.670
 gross not bad it was a problem 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.770
 for the opening scene the intro of the 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.020
 dream to an integration we put a 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.970
 fish behind the two characters on 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.800
 realized that this aggression 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.020
 been quite complicated and the Green Fund does not 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.970
 was not so easy to pick up 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.850
 characters there was not enough stung 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.230
 or sharpness on some outlines so 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.540
 the clipping was a bit complicated 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.290
 explains family 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.290
 menu your passwords 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.000
 14 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.580
 the one that is about the size of 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:17.280
 the pill 16 min plus sensor is small 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:18.480
 and inevitably the ticket is tight we are 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.150
 really inhabited now camera a 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.280
 size sensor 35 the small sensor 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.300
 it's a little pity it's 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.190
 really used to those fuzzy tips and 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.930
 lassana good that it frustrates a little bit 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.919
 still 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.590
 the other big frustration is that 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.410
 all the optics are his pedant croc 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.650
 knowing all the focal values to 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.910
 1 18 mm from 20 to 40 mm it's really a 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.050
 great difficulty in finding the big ones 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.040
 time on this rear camera on 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.560
 was stopping a battery to make 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.240
 counterweight and also to reload 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.190
 in fact internal battery beyond the 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.940
 magic joke that she normally holds 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.360
 an hour this system is enough 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.360
 essential 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.280
 it's indecent baseball that makes 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.710
 weird 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.830
 this camera records in raw format the 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.560
 format is very heavy a ssd disk of 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.440
 256 gia for about half an hour 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.960
 when the big disadvantage is that we 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.889
 can not formatted the ssd in the camera 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.040
 or have a computer next door to be able to 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.040
 format the disc 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:30.459
 I was quite anxious to shoot with 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:34.519
 the magic joke 

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:39.079
 I am satisfied with the image that we have 

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:41.839
 recover with maneuverability at 

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:44.539
 filming quite remarkable black 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:46.969
 magic is small which allows to hang 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.429
 fast and easy enough there I think in 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:50.120
 particular to the scene there is a top shot 

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:51.830
 in the 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.770
 the sequence in the bathroom is 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.900
 a sequence shot and we were able to 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.990
 install a hook quite easily 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.419
 I find that it combines maneuverability 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:07.300
 by its small size and rendering 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.300
 aesthetic of a very cinematic image 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.620
 for this price this camera is really 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.900
 a very good surprise 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.300
 his great momentum is clearly his 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.220
 strong point as well as its sensitivity and 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.750
 the possibility to go around in circles 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.280
 against them actually sin in his 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.080
 rendering colors that are too much 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.260
 party girl sky and skin tones 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.760
 slightly magenta I would see her 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.770
 more still in fiction we can 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.360
 shoot shorts where there is no 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.140
 a lot of budget with programs 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.090
 short for the web 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.760
 the photo directors can really 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.380
 have fun with this camera because 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.450
 that they react very well to strong 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.120
 lights at low lights we can 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.530
 can really have fun 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.200
 I think this camera a little 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:50.090
 career and I think she has she has 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.090
 a true legitimacy in fiction
