00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
hand that's totally open source and the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.419 
hand that's totally open source and the
proprietary<00:01:50.140> or<00:01:50.319> closed<00:01:50.649> version<00:01:51.189> that

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
proprietary or closed version that

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:52.830 
proprietary or closed version that
they're<00:01:51.700> mimicking<00:01:52.299> cost<00:01:52.539> about<00:01:52.719> a<00:01:52.780> hundred

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
they're mimicking cost about a hundred

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.880 
they're mimicking cost about a hundred
thousand<00:01:53.380> dollars

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
thousand dollars

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.410 
thousand dollars
the<00:01:54.009> open<00:01:54.280> hand<00:01:54.399> projects<00:01:54.880> version<00:01:55.240> cost

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
the open hand projects version cost

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.690 
the open hand projects version cost
about<00:01:55.569> $1,000<00:01:56.289> in<00:01:56.500> terms<00:01:57.159> of<00:01:57.310> build<00:01:57.520> materials

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
about $1,000 in terms of build materials

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.059 
about $1,000 in terms of build materials
cost<00:01:58.329> of<00:01:58.479> materials<00:01:58.869> so<00:01:59.289> it's<00:01:59.409> two<00:01:59.619> orders<00:01:59.950> of

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
cost of materials so it's two orders of

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.919 
cost of materials so it's two orders of
magnitude<00:02:00.520> less<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:04.630> of<00:02:04.719> the<00:02:04.780> other

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
magnitude less one of the other

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.630 
magnitude less one of the other
interesting<00:02:05.109> applications<00:02:06.099> that<00:02:06.219> we've<00:02:06.369> seen

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
interesting applications that we've seen

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.150 
interesting applications that we've seen
is<00:02:06.909> in<00:02:07.299> university<00:02:07.929> research<00:02:08.229> labs<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:08.830> at

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
is in university research labs so at

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.400 
is in university research labs so at
Michigan<00:02:09.610> Tech<00:02:09.640> they're<00:02:10.149> using<00:02:10.629> 3d<00:02:11.080> printers

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
Michigan Tech they're using 3d printers

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.650 
Michigan Tech they're using 3d printers
to<00:02:11.709> create<00:02:11.860> lab<00:02:12.489> equipment<00:02:12.940> at<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.090> fraction<00:02:13.420> of

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
to create lab equipment at a fraction of

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.470 
to create lab equipment at a fraction of
the<00:02:13.720> cost<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.319> one<00:02:14.799> example<00:02:14.950> was<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.519> $2,000

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
the cost so one example was a $2,000

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.360 
the cost so one example was a $2,000
meter<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.290> manufacturer<00:02:17.950> was<00:02:18.160> going<00:02:18.310> to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
meter that a manufacturer was going to

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.000 
meter that a manufacturer was going to
sell<00:02:18.579> the<00:02:18.670> lab<00:02:18.930> instead<00:02:19.930> their<00:02:20.230> campus<00:02:20.680> 3d

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
sell the lab instead their campus 3d

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.140 
sell the lab instead their campus 3d
printing<00:02:21.280> lab<00:02:21.340> made<00:02:21.610> one<00:02:21.790> for<00:02:21.940> about<00:02:22.120> a

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
printing lab made one for about a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.490 
printing lab made one for about a
hundred<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.510> fifty<00:02:22.780> dollars<00:02:25.049> so<00:02:26.049> this<00:02:26.230> is<00:02:26.379> the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
hundred and fifty dollars so this is the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.830 
hundred and fifty dollars so this is the
chef<00:02:26.799> jet<00:02:27.129> 3d<00:02:27.579> printer<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.180> it's<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.599> first

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
chef jet 3d printer and it's the first

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.110

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
it's printing in a chocolate recipe but

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.099 
it's printing in a chocolate recipe but
it's<00:02:33.400> compatible<00:02:33.790> with<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.209> lot<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.569> different

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
it's compatible with a lot of different

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.990 
it's compatible with a lot of different
confectionery<00:02:35.829> recipes<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.489> you<00:02:36.549> can<00:02:36.640> 3d

what<00:02:43.870> can<00:02:44.019> these<00:02:44.139> machines<00:02:44.530> do<00:02:44.799> that<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.099> pastry

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
what can these machines do that a pastry

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.390 
what can these machines do that a pastry
chef<00:02:45.700> can't<00:02:46.000> do<00:02:46.239> so<00:02:46.720> pastry<00:02:47.349> chefs<00:02:47.620> are<00:02:47.859> true

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
chef can't do so pastry chefs are true

innovators<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.420> artists<00:02:49.989> in<00:02:50.139> their<00:02:50.319> own

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
innovators and artists in their own

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.289 
innovators and artists in their own
right<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:50.950> what<00:02:51.400> we're<00:02:51.549> hoping<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.060> this

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
right and what we're hoping is that this

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.140 
right and what we're hoping is that this
is<00:02:52.510> just<00:02:52.540> another<00:02:53.109> tool<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.859> their<00:02:54.040> toolbox<00:02:54.340> so

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
is just another tool in their toolbox so

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.140 
is just another tool in their toolbox so
it<00:02:55.329> can<00:02:55.510> make<00:02:55.720> incredibly<00:02:56.380> complex

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
it can make incredibly complex

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.300 
it can make incredibly complex
dimensional<00:02:58.150> structural<00:02:59.019> shapes<00:02:59.500> that<00:03:00.040> maybe

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
dimensional structural shapes that maybe

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.550 
dimensional structural shapes that maybe
couldn't<00:03:00.669> be<00:03:00.819> made<00:03:01.000> by<00:03:01.180> hand<00:03:01.569> it<00:03:02.260> can<00:03:02.380> also

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
couldn't be made by hand it can also

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.110 
couldn't be made by hand it can also
make<00:03:02.859> things<00:03:03.190> like<00:03:03.519> you<00:03:03.700> see<00:03:03.730> these

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
make things like you see these

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.509 
make things like you see these
interlocking<00:03:04.810> loosely<00:03:05.590> interlocking<00:03:06.250> shapes

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
interlocking loosely interlocking shapes

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.520 
interlocking loosely interlocking shapes
but<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.120> really<00:03:07.389> couldn't<00:03:07.660> make<00:03:07.959> any<00:03:08.260> other

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
but you really couldn't make any other

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.770 
but you really couldn't make any other
way<00:03:08.769> but<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.130> 3d<00:03:09.459> apprentice<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:10.209> can<00:03:10.359> also<00:03:10.510> do

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
way but to 3d apprentice you can also do

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.140 
way but to 3d apprentice you can also do
super<00:03:11.200> customized<00:03:11.829> things<00:03:12.250> like<00:03:12.549> if<00:03:12.910> you're<00:03:13.120> a

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150

metal<00:03:50.320> gun<00:03:50.590> tell<00:03:51.190> me<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> little<00:03:51.460> bit<00:03:51.580> about

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
metal gun tell me a little bit about

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.730 
metal gun tell me a little bit about
that<00:03:52.030> product<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.750> why<00:03:53.020> you<00:03:53.080> decided<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.650> do

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
that product and why you decided to do

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.790 
that product and why you decided to do
that<00:03:53.940> we<00:03:54.940> actually<00:03:55.150> had<00:03:55.540> some<00:03:55.720> engineers<00:03:56.440> that

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
that we actually had some engineers that

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.650 
that we actually had some engineers that
wanted<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.310> prove<00:03:57.610> out<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.940> technology<00:03:58.510> and

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
wanted to prove out the technology and

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.380 
wanted to prove out the technology and
just<00:03:58.870> show<00:03:59.110> in<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.560> very<00:03:59.830> dramatic<00:04:00.070> way<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:01.270> it

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
just show in a very dramatic way that it

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.020 
just show in a very dramatic way that it
was<00:04:01.570> usable<00:04:02.050> on<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.470> commercial<00:04:03.030> industrial

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
was usable on a commercial industrial

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.150 
was usable on a commercial industrial
kind<00:04:04.240> of<00:04:04.390> scale<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.410> gun<00:04:05.710> that<00:04:05.860> we<00:04:05.980> made

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
kind of scale and the gun that we made

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.400 
kind of scale and the gun that we made
is<00:04:06.340> in<00:04:06.490> 1911<00:04:06.910> browning<00:04:07.630> model<00:04:07.900> gun<00:04:08.050> so<00:04:08.200> it's<00:04:08.320> a

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
is in 1911 browning model gun so it's a

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.770 
is in 1911 browning model gun so it's a
very<00:04:08.590> old<00:04:08.860> gun<00:04:09.250> but<00:04:09.940> we're<00:04:10.090> using<00:04:10.270> two<00:04:10.630> new

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
very old gun but we're using two new

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.810 
very old gun but we're using two new
technology<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.560> produce<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:12.010> or<00:04:12.160> we<00:04:12.310> did<00:04:12.520> on

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
technology to produce it or we did on

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.810 
technology to produce it or we did on
this<00:04:13.030> one<00:04:13.390> gun<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:15.220> know<00:04:15.310> that<00:04:15.490> holds

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
this one gun and you know that holds

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.270 
this one gun and you know that holds
20,000<00:04:16.690> psi<00:04:16.989> in<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.500> chamber<00:04:17.859> every<00:04:18.010> time

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
20,000 psi in the chamber every time

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.560 
20,000 psi in the chamber every time
it's<00:04:18.400> fired<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:18.850> it's<00:04:18.940> been<00:04:19.060> fired<00:04:19.269> four

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
it's fired and it's been fired four

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.380 
it's fired and it's been fired four
thousand<00:04:19.989> times<00:04:20.200> so<00:04:20.530> very<00:04:21.190> good<00:04:21.459> proof<00:04:21.820> of<00:04:22.060> the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
thousand times so very good proof of the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.450 
thousand times so very good proof of the
technology<00:04:23.020> just<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.770> show<00:04:23.980> that<00:04:24.010> it<00:04:24.250> will

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
technology just to show that it will

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.310 
technology just to show that it will
work<00:04:24.610> in<00:04:24.820> other<00:04:24.970> applications<00:04:25.230> do<00:04:26.230> you

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
work in other applications do you

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.260 
work in other applications do you
ultimately<00:04:26.470> see<00:04:26.950> people<00:04:27.550> as<00:04:27.640> being<00:04:27.760> able<00:04:27.970> to

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
ultimately see people as being able to

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.600 
ultimately see people as being able to
make<00:04:28.660> guns<00:04:28.840> themselves<00:04:29.110> on<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:29.830> home<00:04:30.160> freely

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
make guns themselves on a home freely

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.610 
make guns themselves on a home freely
printer<00:04:30.970> well<00:04:31.630> they<00:04:31.810> have<00:04:32.110> they've<00:04:32.440> done

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
printer well they have they've done

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.020 
printer well they have they've done
plastic<00:04:32.860> guns<00:04:33.340> but<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.760> know<00:04:33.880> they're

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
plastic guns but you know they're

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.670 
plastic guns but you know they're
dangerous<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:34.780> hold<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.230> they're<00:04:35.320> dangerous

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
dangerous to hold and they're dangerous

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.470 
dangerous to hold and they're dangerous
to<00:04:35.830> fire<00:04:36.040> and<00:04:36.220> it's<00:04:36.340> not<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.550> gun<00:04:36.820> I<00:04:37.060> would<00:04:37.090> want

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
to fire and it's not a gun I would want

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.440 
to fire and it's not a gun I would want
to<00:04:37.600> fire<00:04:38.160> over<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.550> long-term<00:04:39.760> of<00:04:40.210> course

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
to fire over the long-term of course

to fire over the long-term of course
this<00:04:40.600> technology<00:04:41.260> is<00:04:41.350> going<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.650> get<00:04:41.860> more<00:04:42.130> and

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
this technology is going to get more and

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.700 
this technology is going to get more and
more<00:04:42.310> sophisticated<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:43.810> chances<00:04:44.680> of

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
more sophisticated and the chances of

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.980 
more sophisticated and the chances of
that<00:04:44.980> happening<00:04:45.220> become<00:04:45.790> greater<00:04:46.090> do<00:04:46.900> you

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
that happening become greater do you

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.390 
that happening become greater do you
think<00:04:47.200> that<00:04:47.290> ultimately<00:04:47.440> it's<00:04:47.950> going<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.280> be

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
think that ultimately it's going to be

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.130 
think that ultimately it's going to be
difficult<00:04:48.700> for<00:04:49.120> government<00:04:49.510> to<00:04:49.660> stop<00:04:49.930> people

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
difficult for government to stop people

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.960 
difficult for government to stop people
creating<00:04:50.980> whatever<00:04:51.310> they<00:04:51.460> want<00:04:51.640> in<00:04:51.820> their

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
creating whatever they want in their

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.360 
creating whatever they want in their
homes<00:04:52.150> oh<00:04:52.480> yeah<00:04:53.470> certainly<00:04:54.010> would<00:04:54.220> be

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
homes oh yeah certainly would be

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.080 
homes oh yeah certainly would be
difficult<00:04:54.820> you<00:04:56.490> know<00:04:57.490> I<00:04:57.520> just<00:04:57.790> don't<00:04:57.940> know

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
difficult you know I just don't know

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.450 
difficult you know I just don't know
where<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.300> go<00:04:58.540> with<00:04:58.720> that<00:04:58.750> one<00:04:59.190> it's<00:05:00.190> not<00:05:00.430> a

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
where to go with that one it's not a

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.130 
where to go with that one it's not a
thing<00:05:00.760> I've<00:05:00.910> put<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.150> lot<00:05:01.330> of<00:05:01.480> thought<00:05:01.630> into<00:05:01.840> we

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
thing I've put a lot of thought into we

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.780 
thing I've put a lot of thought into we
control<00:05:02.590> our<00:05:02.770> environments<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:03.460> we<00:05:03.550> can

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
control our environments and we can

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.360 
control our environments and we can
control<00:05:04.210> what<00:05:04.390> we're<00:05:04.540> doing<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:06.040> home

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
control what we're doing so the home

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.250 
control what we're doing so the home
printer<00:05:06.940> market<00:05:07.510> then<00:05:07.870> you<00:05:07.900> know<00:05:08.020> that's<00:05:08.200> a

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
printer market then you know that's a

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.990 
printer market then you know that's a
whole<00:05:08.410> different<00:05:08.770> story<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.070> it's<00:05:09.610> gonna

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
whole different story so it's gonna

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.200 
whole different story so it's gonna
shake<00:05:10.300> out<00:05:10.450> over<00:05:10.690> time

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210

staffer what excites you most about this
technology<00:05:20.460> well<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.670> fact<00:05:21.880> that<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.240> open

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
technology well the fact that the open

technology well the fact that the open
source<00:05:22.810> developments<00:05:23.800> have<00:05:24.040> been<00:05:24.250> coming<00:05:24.520> in

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
source developments have been coming in

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.430 
source developments have been coming in
over<00:05:24.850> the<00:05:24.940> last<00:05:24.970> five<00:05:25.510> to<00:05:25.720> eight<00:05:25.780> years<00:05:25.840> that's

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
over the last five to eight years that's

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.490 
over the last five to eight years that's
really<00:05:26.830> what's<00:05:27.840> revitalizing<00:05:28.840> 3d<00:05:29.140> printing

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
really what's revitalizing 3d printing

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.440 
really what's revitalizing 3d printing
and<00:05:29.620> why<00:05:30.310> it's<00:05:30.550> getting<00:05:30.850> into<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.090> hands<00:05:31.390> of

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
and why it's getting into the hands of

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.570 
and why it's getting into the hands of
everyone<00:05:31.690> we've<00:05:32.620> seen<00:05:32.830> that<00:05:32.980> as<00:05:33.130> some<00:05:33.430> of<00:05:33.520> the

patents have expired the cost of some of
this<00:05:35.530> technology<00:05:36.010> has<00:05:36.130> gone<00:05:36.280> down<00:05:36.460> by<00:05:36.610> 98%

this technology has gone down by 98%

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.210 
this technology has gone down by 98%
you're<00:05:37.750> also<00:05:37.900> seeing<00:05:38.200> development<00:05:38.920> and<00:05:39.100> new

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
you're also seeing development and new

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.030 
you're also seeing development and new
ideas<00:05:39.430> come<00:05:40.270> out<00:05:40.450> of<00:05:40.630> high<00:05:40.810> schools<00:05:41.140> even<00:05:41.650> home

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
ideas come out of high schools even home

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.650 
ideas come out of high schools even home
inventors<00:05:42.550> a<00:05:42.790> lot<00:05:43.060> of<00:05:43.150> the<00:05:43.210> parts<00:05:43.540> on<00:05:43.630> our

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
inventors a lot of the parts on our

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.720 
inventors a lot of the parts on our
machine<00:05:44.140> were<00:05:44.320> invented<00:05:44.770> by<00:05:44.890> our<00:05:45.100> customers<00:05:45.520> a

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
machine were invented by our customers a

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.100 
machine were invented by our customers a
lot<00:05:45.850> of<00:05:46.120> times<00:05:46.270> they're<00:05:46.450> just<00:05:46.480> lying<00:05:46.960> around

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
lot of times they're just lying around

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.900 
lot of times they're just lying around
at<00:05:47.440> home<00:05:47.470> on<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.770> weekends<00:05:48.160> and<00:05:48.340> they're

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
at home on the weekends and they're

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
at home on the weekends and they're
coming<00:05:49.150> up<00:05:49.240> with<00:05:49.330> parts<00:05:49.570> that<00:05:49.630> are<00:05:49.810> better

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
coming up with parts that are better

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.630 
coming up with parts that are better
than<00:05:50.020> what<00:05:50.140> we<00:05:50.320> came<00:05:50.500> up<00:05:50.560> with<00:05:50.680> so<00:05:51.340> I<00:05:51.370> think

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
than what we came up with so I think

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.920 
than what we came up with so I think
it's<00:05:51.970> going<00:05:52.150> to<00:05:52.180> have<00:05:52.390> really<00:05:52.720> interesting

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
it's going to have really interesting

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.260 
it's going to have really interesting
effects<00:05:53.350> on<00:05:53.500> both<00:05:53.800> sides<00:05:54.250> in<00:05:54.580> terms<00:05:54.610> of<00:05:54.940> really

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
effects on both sides in terms of really

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.910 
effects on both sides in terms of really
complex<00:05:55.600> versus<00:05:56.440> really<00:05:56.560> simple

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
complex versus really simple

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.800 
complex versus really simple
developments<00:05:57.400> and<00:05:57.580> I<00:05:58.120> think<00:05:58.300> overall<00:05:58.540> you're

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
developments and I think overall you're

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.090 
developments and I think overall you're
going<00:05:58.930> to<00:05:58.990> see<00:05:59.200> it's<00:05:59.530> going<00:05:59.590> to<00:05:59.710> get<00:05:59.830> more

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
going to see it's going to get more

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.950 
going to see it's going to get more
competitive<00:06:00.250> and<00:06:00.790> prices<00:06:01.330> are<00:06:01.420> keep<00:06:01.570> falling

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
competitive and prices are keep falling

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.460 
competitive and prices are keep falling
and<00:06:02.380> so<00:06:02.680> we'll<00:06:02.860> see<00:06:03.070> what<00:06:03.280> happens<00:06:03.550> next

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.290 

do<00:06:07.470> you<00:06:07.530> see<00:06:07.740> any<00:06:07.920> particular<00:06:08.070> threats<00:06:08.760> to<00:06:09.120> the

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
do you see any particular threats to the

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.360 
do you see any particular threats to the
3d<00:06:09.600> printing<00:06:10.050> industry<00:06:10.170> such<00:06:10.830> as<00:06:10.860> patent

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
3d printing industry such as patent

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.070 
3d printing industry such as patent
holders<00:06:11.880> or<00:06:12.120> certain<00:06:12.450> companies<00:06:12.840> who<00:06:12.960> might

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
holders or certain companies who might

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.750 
holders or certain companies who might
want<00:06:13.290> to<00:06:13.350> protect<00:06:13.710> their<00:06:14.130> product

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
want to protect their product

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.850 
want to protect their product
I<00:06:14.790> think<00:06:15.300> the<00:06:15.750> old-school<00:06:16.050> way<00:06:16.200> of<00:06:16.410> thinking

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
I think the old-school way of thinking

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.090 
I think the old-school way of thinking
for<00:06:17.100> a<00:06:17.160> patent<00:06:18.110> enforcement<00:06:19.110> it's<00:06:19.800> going<00:06:20.010> to

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
for a patent enforcement it's going to

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.770 
for a patent enforcement it's going to
have<00:06:20.220> to<00:06:20.400> adapt<00:06:20.640> to<00:06:20.670> the<00:06:20.850> new<00:06:21.000> reality<00:06:21.030> because

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
have to adapt to the new reality because

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.780 
have to adapt to the new reality because
it's<00:06:22.110> something<00:06:22.320> it's<00:06:22.710> much<00:06:22.950> like<00:06:23.130> the<00:06:23.160> the

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
it's something it's much like the the

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:24.650 
it's something it's much like the the
music<00:06:24.090> industry

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
music industry

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.210 
music industry
the<00:06:24.780> first<00:06:25.020> few<00:06:25.200> years<00:06:25.380> of<00:06:25.560> the<00:06:25.770> technology

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
the first few years of the technology

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.380 
the first few years of the technology
coming<00:06:26.400> out<00:06:26.550> there's<00:06:26.790> going<00:06:26.880> to<00:06:26.940> be<00:06:27.030> a<00:06:27.120> lot<00:06:27.360> of

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
coming out there's going to be a lot of

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.040 
coming out there's going to be a lot of
China<00:06:27.780> fighting<00:06:28.560> the<00:06:29.250> reality<00:06:29.780> this<00:06:30.780> is<00:06:30.930> going

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
China fighting the reality this is going

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.200 
China fighting the reality this is going
to<00:06:31.110> prove<00:06:31.320> to<00:06:31.560> be<00:06:31.700> unstoppable<00:06:32.700> in<00:06:32.820> terms<00:06:33.030> of

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
to prove to be unstoppable in terms of

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.530 
to prove to be unstoppable in terms of
its<00:06:33.420> implementation<00:06:34.400> so<00:06:35.400> I<00:06:35.880> think<00:06:36.180> the<00:06:36.390> whole

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
its implementation so I think the whole

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.900 
its implementation so I think the whole
intellectual<00:06:37.020> property<00:06:37.700> industry<00:06:38.700> will<00:06:38.880> have

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
intellectual property industry will have

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.610 
intellectual property industry will have
to<00:06:39.060> adapt<00:06:39.960> their<00:06:41.000> models<00:06:42.000> to<00:06:42.420> take<00:06:43.410> into

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
to adapt their models to take into

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:50.510 
to adapt their models to take into
account<00:06:43.830> that<00:06:44.040> it's<00:06:44.310> going<00:06:44.460> to<00:06:44.580> happen<00:06:49.520> sort

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
account that it's going to happen sort

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.760 
account that it's going to happen sort
of<00:06:50.580> like<00:06:50.760> being<00:06:51.240> in<00:06:51.330> the<00:06:51.450> 70s<00:06:52.020> and<00:06:52.260> computers

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
of like being in the 70s and computers

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.560 
of like being in the 70s and computers
certain<00:06:53.250> things<00:06:53.460> are<00:06:53.640> going<00:06:53.820> to<00:06:53.910> be<00:06:54.000> disrupted

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
certain things are going to be disrupted

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.630 
certain things are going to be disrupted
but<00:06:55.170> you<00:06:55.380> have<00:06:55.500> a<00:06:55.530> feeling<00:06:55.920> that<00:06:56.070> a<00:06:56.220> lot<00:06:56.340> of

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:56.640 
but you have a feeling that a lot of

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.980 
but you have a feeling that a lot of
other<00:06:56.820> things<00:06:57.060> that<00:06:57.120> will<00:06:57.240> be<00:06:57.360> disrupted<00:06:57.840> but

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
other things that will be disrupted but

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.900 
other things that will be disrupted but
nobody<00:06:58.260> knows<00:06:58.470> what<00:06:58.650> they<00:06:58.770> are<00:06:58.800> very<00:06:59.580> exciting

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
nobody knows what they are very exciting

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.500 
nobody knows what they are very exciting
times<00:07:01.310> because<00:07:02.310> the<00:07:02.490> price<00:07:02.700> is<00:07:02.880> so<00:07:03.120> affordable

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.510 
times because the price is so affordable

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.300 
times because the price is so affordable
now<00:07:03.870> when<00:07:04.350> the<00:07:04.440> artists<00:07:04.770> get<00:07:04.890> a<00:07:04.920> hold<00:07:05.130> of<00:07:05.250> this

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
now when the artists get a hold of this

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.460 
now when the artists get a hold of this
technology<00:07:05.640> they'll<00:07:06.000> come<00:07:06.300> up<00:07:06.330> with<00:07:06.600> projects

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
technology they'll come up with projects
