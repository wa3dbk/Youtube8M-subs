where<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.510> front<00:00:45.840> load<00:00:46.079> model<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
where it's a front load model now the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
where it's a front load model now the
top<00:00:47.579> load<00:00:47.760> still<00:00:48.059> exists<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.899> this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
top load still exists but this is this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.920 
top load still exists but this is this
is<00:00:49.469> becoming<00:00:49.739> more<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.070> more<00:00:50.100> popular<00:00:50.399> and

the way the technology is going this is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.990 
the way the technology is going this is
really<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.289> great<00:00:55.559> efficient<00:00:56.340> model<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.910> to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
really a great efficient model just to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.270 
really a great efficient model just to
put<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.270> into<00:00:57.480> perspective<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.530> this
