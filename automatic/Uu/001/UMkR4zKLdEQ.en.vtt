messaging<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.610> really<00:00:33.270> intended<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.690> be

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
messaging is really intended to be

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.840 
messaging is really intended to be
essentially<00:00:34.890> an<00:00:34.950> email<00:00:35.280> service<00:00:35.640> between

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
essentially an email service between

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.700 
essentially an email service between
PlayStation<00:00:36.420> Network<00:00:36.450> Accounts<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.530> don't

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
PlayStation Network Accounts so don't

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.170 
PlayStation Network Accounts so don't
think<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.309> live<00:00:38.610> streaming

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
think of this as a live streaming

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.540 
think of this as a live streaming
constantly<00:00:39.840> updating<00:00:40.500> messaging<00:00:41.100> network

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
constantly updating messaging network

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.709 
constantly updating messaging network
that<00:00:41.730> you'll<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.270> your<00:00:42.360> friends<00:00:42.660> over

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
that you'll have with your friends over

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.330 
that you'll have with your friends over
the<00:00:42.899> PlayStation<00:00:43.379> Network<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.129> really

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the PlayStation Network this is really

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.889 
the PlayStation Network this is really
just<00:00:44.489> intended<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.120> something<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.660> you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
just intended to be something that you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.500 
just intended to be something that you
look<00:00:46.110> at<00:00:46.320> every<00:00:46.680> 15<00:00:47.250> minutes<00:00:47.610> 30<00:00:48.030> minutes<00:00:48.210> hour

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
look at every 15 minutes 30 minutes hour

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
look at every 15 minutes 30 minutes hour
or<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:48.930> actually<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:49.649> those<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
or so actually I think those are the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.310 
or so actually I think those are the
exact<00:00:50.789> timings<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.480> go<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> settings<00:00:52.110> you

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
exact timings if you go to settings you

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.619 
exact timings if you go to settings you
can<00:00:52.350> select<00:00:53.100> when<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.730> receive<00:00:54.059> them<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.480> yeah

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
can select when you receive them so yeah

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.209 
can select when you receive them so yeah
there<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.870> go<00:00:54.899> every<00:00:55.230> 15<00:00:55.590> minutes<00:00:55.739> every<00:00:55.920> 30

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
there you go every 15 minutes every 30

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.529 
there you go every 15 minutes every 30
minutes<00:00:56.430> every<00:00:56.640> hour<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.180> turn<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.449> off

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
minutes every hour you can turn it off

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.270 
minutes every hour you can turn it off
if<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.840> want<00:00:58.020> but<00:00:58.440> essentially<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
if you want but essentially what this is

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.950 
if you want but essentially what this is
is<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> compilation<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.270> all<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> messages
