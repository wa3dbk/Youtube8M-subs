couldn't even tell you which mega block

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.200 
couldn't even tell you which mega block
set<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.060> came<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:28.550> just<00:00:29.550> needed<00:00:30.090> to

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
set that came on but I just needed to

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.490 
set that came on but I just needed to
have<00:00:30.330> them<00:00:30.539> because<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.810> knew<00:00:30.929> exactly<00:00:31.199> what<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
have them because I knew exactly what to

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
have them because I knew exactly what to
do<00:00:31.650> with<00:00:31.769> them<00:00:31.800> because<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.610> spacing<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.239> them

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
do with them because the spacing on them

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.540 
do with them because the spacing on them
and<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:34.110> way<00:00:34.200> they<00:00:34.380> connect<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.430> thought

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and the way they connect I just thought

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.450 
and the way they connect I just thought
man<00:00:35.850> that's<00:00:36.180> like<00:00:36.390> perfect<00:00:36.660> for<00:00:36.870> road<00:00:37.460> and

man that's like perfect for road and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.160 
man that's like perfect for road and
what<00:00:38.610> better<00:00:38.790> thing<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.540> road<00:00:39.809> then

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170

in Halo now so other than the two Lego
plates<00:00:52.590> at<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> base<00:00:53.039> here<00:00:54.860> this<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.010> another

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
plates at the base here this is another

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.939 
plates at the base here this is another
big<00:00:56.489> mega<00:00:56.789> bloks<00:00:57.059> creation<00:00:57.600> if<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.870> had<00:00:58.109> mega

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
big mega bloks creation if I had mega

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.810 
big mega bloks creation if I had mega
buck<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.640> mega<00:00:59.940> bloks<00:01:00.300> plates<00:01:01.489> that<00:01:02.489> would<00:01:02.670> be

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
buck or mega bloks plates that would be

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.850 
buck or mega bloks plates that would be
the<00:01:02.969> same<00:01:03.180> Z's<00:01:03.480> basically<00:01:04.049> i<00:01:04.229> would<00:01:04.500> use<00:01:04.619> them

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the same Z's basically i would use them

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.450 
the same Z's basically i would use them
but<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.339> don't<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:07.530> hangar<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.220> two

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
but I don't have the hangar is on two

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
but I don't have the hangar is on two
very<00:01:08.490> large<00:01:08.939> plates<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.479> our<00:01:09.600> mega<00:01:09.869> bloks<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
very large plates at our mega bloks and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.090 
very large plates at our mega bloks and
everything<00:01:11.070> else<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.369> course<00:01:11.400> is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.950 

and<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.270> hard<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.750> this

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and just be really hard to have this

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.100 
and just be really hard to have this
whole<00:01:16.140> setup<00:01:16.500> without<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.869> sturdy<00:01:18.869> base<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.409> it

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
whole setup without a sturdy base on it

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.710 
whole setup without a sturdy base on it
has<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> lot<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.530> support<00:01:23.009> beams<00:01:23.220> holding<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.759> up

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.460 

so

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
so

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.650 
so

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.550 
but just trying to find a spot for that
not<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:14.830> easy<00:02:15.900> but<00:02:16.900> i<00:02:16.959> definitely<00:02:17.200> don't<00:02:17.500> mind

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
not so easy but i definitely don't mind

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.040 
not so easy but i definitely don't mind
setting<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.190> up<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:19.150> take<00:02:19.360> some<00:02:19.570> nice<00:02:19.750> shots

setting it up to take some nice shots

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.290 
setting it up to take some nice shots
take<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.530> quick<00:02:20.830> video<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.940> hopefully<00:02:22.120> this

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
take a quick video and hopefully this

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.280 
take a quick video and hopefully this
video<00:02:22.480> will<00:02:22.630> look<00:02:22.810> better<00:02:23.020> than<00:02:23.170> my<00:02:23.260> last

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.770 
video will look better than my last
couple<00:02:23.860> because<00:02:24.130> i<00:02:24.340> found<00:02:25.120> out<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:25.300> this

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
couple because i found out that this

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.800 
couple because i found out that this
camera<00:02:26.200> actually<00:02:26.350> has<00:02:26.650> an<00:02:26.800> HD<00:02:27.220> setting<00:02:27.810> might

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
camera actually has an HD setting might

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.920 
camera actually has an HD setting might
be<00:02:28.990> rather<00:02:29.140> shaky<00:02:29.650> but<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:31.450> quality<00:02:31.690> should

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
be rather shaky but the quality should

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.920 
be rather shaky but the quality should
be<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.170> lot<00:02:32.350> better

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.720 

so

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.780
