00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
hello we are in shallower City and I've

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.580 
hello we are in shallower City and I've
discovered<00:00:06.930> something<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:08.130> little<00:00:09.050> it's<00:00:10.050> on

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
discovered something a little it's on

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.520 
discovered something a little it's on
the<00:00:10.769> side<00:00:11.099> but<00:00:11.639> it's<00:00:12.259> definitely<00:00:13.259> something

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
the side but it's definitely something

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.000 
the side but it's definitely something
you<00:00:13.740> should<00:00:13.860> look<00:00:14.280> at<00:00:14.490> um<00:00:15.470> here<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.619> reflection

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
you should look at um here in reflection

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.580 
you should look at um here in reflection
cave<00:00:18.350> there's<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.560> little<00:00:19.800> passageway<00:00:20.369> where

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
cave there's a little passageway where

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.820 
cave there's a little passageway where
it's<00:00:22.590> kind<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.010> hard<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.820> spot<00:00:24.180> because<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
it's kind of hard to spot because the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.410 
it's kind of hard to spot because the
only<00:00:26.070> way<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.580> see<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.269> you're

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
only way you can see it is if you're

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.550 
only way you can see it is if you're
looking<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.900> mirror<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:30.050> I'm<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
looking in the mirror so I'm going to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.700 
looking in the mirror so I'm going to
show<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.830> where<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.410> how<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.440> get

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710

to here and you see this dead end you're

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.660 
to here and you see this dead end you're
like<00:01:43.510> wait<00:01:44.560> what<00:01:45.560> is<00:01:45.710> biggest<00:01:46.130> for<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.400> dead

there<00:01:50.360> well<00:01:51.970> here<00:01:52.970> is<00:01:53.119> it<00:01:53.270> just<00:01:53.540> here<00:01:53.720> go

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
there well here is it just here go

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.760 
there well here is it just here go
cheaper<00:01:54.369> as<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:56.479> walk<00:01:56.690> back<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.259> don't<00:01:57.530> see

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
cheaper as I walk back you don't see

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.120 
cheaper as I walk back you don't see
anything<00:01:57.979> do<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:59.290> if<00:02:00.290> you<00:02:00.500> spotted<00:02:00.890> it<00:02:00.979> you

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
anything do you if you spotted it you

anything do you if you spotted it you
have<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.369> dies<00:02:02.560> but<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.680> trick<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.160> is

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
have the dies but the trick to it is

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.199 
have the dies but the trick to it is
that<00:02:04.700> it's<00:02:04.880> actually<00:02:05.030> right<00:02:05.390> here<00:02:09.940> as<00:02:10.940> you

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
that it's actually right here as you

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.000 
that it's actually right here as you
enter<00:02:11.570> you<00:02:13.390> make<00:02:14.390> you'll<00:02:15.260> see<00:02:15.530> you'll<00:02:15.680> find

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
enter you make you'll see you'll find

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.690 
enter you make you'll see you'll find
the<00:02:16.100> TM<00:02:16.459> right<00:02:16.760> here<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.920> think<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.040> was<00:02:19.160> general

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
the TM right here I think it was general

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.699 
the TM right here I think it was general
ball<00:02:19.850> or<00:02:19.970> something<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.510> then<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.989> continue

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
ball or something and then you continue

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:29.140 
ball or something and then you continue
you<00:02:22.040> go<00:02:22.190> through<00:02:22.720> go<00:02:24.910> make<00:02:25.910> another<00:02:26.060> turn<00:02:28.150> you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
you go through go make another turn you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.229 
you go through go make another turn you
go<00:02:29.330> up<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:31.630> there's<00:02:32.630> this<00:02:32.989> blowing<00:02:34.239> this

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
go up and there's this blowing this

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.500 
go up and there's this blowing this
blowing<00:02:35.780> little<00:02:36.080> tile<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:38.269> looks<00:02:38.660> like<00:02:40.510> it

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
blowing little tile it looks like it

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.780 
blowing little tile it looks like it
looks<00:02:41.690> like<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.080> could<00:02:42.350> be<00:02:42.380> flour<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.310> entry

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
looks like it could be flour this entry

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.720 
looks like it could be flour this entry
I<00:02:43.940> don't<00:02:44.360> know<00:02:44.920> but<00:02:45.920> why<00:02:46.070> would<00:02:46.250> they<00:02:46.340> put<00:02:46.549> that

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
I don't know but why would they put that

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.460 
I don't know but why would they put that
in<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.970> cave<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.570> why<00:02:47.660> would<00:02:47.840> they<00:02:47.959> put<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.260> set

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
in a cave and why would they put it set

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.500 
in a cave and why would they put it set
up<00:02:48.590> like<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:49.100> legends<00:02:49.760> next<00:02:50.000> something<00:02:50.180> should

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
up like a legends next something should

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.500 
up like a legends next something should
be<00:02:50.540> here<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.580> put<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.670> set<00:02:52.850> up<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:52.970> something

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
be here I put it set up like something

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.380 
be here I put it set up like something
important<00:02:54.230> should<00:02:54.380> be<00:02:54.590> here

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.490 

I<00:02:57.420> don't<00:02:58.050> know<00:02:58.140> if<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.440> would<00:02:58.590> be<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.770> mega<00:02:59.070> storm

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
I don't know if it would be a mega storm

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.650

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
for me we're not even trying to look for

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.210
