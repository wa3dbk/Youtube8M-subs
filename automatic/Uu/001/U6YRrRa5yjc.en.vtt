 and I decided to put my hand on the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.939
 mass is to create a recipe for our 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.320

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.899
 the whole bean angel we go 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.020
 Make sure cheese and spinach are good 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.079
 whether or not an agent can do 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.110
 they play there playing pk not a 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.540
 People are going to start right now to leave it ready. 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.560
 the clear mist will hit the clear in snow 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.390
 and there and meanwhile we'll let her 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.190
 here we are the first ingredient 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.900
 who has to by the clear in snow or the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.400

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.930
 Uncle, dad, I'm going to leave here. 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.390

 It adds clearly that it 's good. 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.590
 so when the plants are two clear 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:25.360
 two classes up to two clear 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.989
 the next step then we will not mix 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.640
 looks the cottage cottage cheese looks like 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.260
 cool there is a tablespoon of 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.409
 cottage cheese 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.060
 then the ricotta cream light a spoonful of 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.890

 it works out sucks, it 's more expensive but 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.049
 I think it's worth portugal received 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.540
 there we'll put a little 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.239
 nutmeg so much talent with cheese 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.489
 meat oil stuffing in cottage cheese 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.220

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.129
 I go there and go there 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.670
 the ii shows the clear in snow when I 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.520

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.230
 This added is just that 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.570
 gently right light snow is 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.800
 well we add that the person does not 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.890

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.450
 preparing dinner looks that much 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.450
 Then Babi will mix snow and it will 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.460
 That will shorten this cheese with the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:34.500
 clear and if you have now 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.720

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.630
 spinach but can make and sell 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.910
 This can then make chicken said to 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.150
 So this girl is going there. 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.630
