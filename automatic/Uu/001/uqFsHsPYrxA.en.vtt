00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.330
 hello all sly 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:19.029
 I want to show you how we warm the balcony 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:21.310
 and when under the saw part serves as an attack 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.630
 obreshetka old Khrushchev former 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:30.160
 balcony stalinok and not places limited 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:35.579
 for insulation here from the outside done 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.579
 profiled sheathing 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.480
 which is known to be resistant to 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.170
 outdoor environment 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.000
 but by itself does not carry any 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.850
 warming effect and even the opposite from 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.820
 it is made of roof and volume cladding 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.970
 heating up in winter cools a lot and 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.800
 rumbles if the top of the roof falls 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:05.350
 water firm to warm as follows 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.870
 take the foam and blow out all 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:13.330
 part of this line and this is about your cross 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:16.960
 the rain of the frame itself what it gives foam is not 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.050
 occupies a lot of space as others 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.110
 Figley cells by mineral wool and 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.460
 other second she glues 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.670
 completely all professional sheet sticking to 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.460
 railing to the base on which 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.160
 this profile sheet is bolted ie itâ€™s all 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:42.190
 completely glued together and it turns out here 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:45.369
 the price is very dense and the system is so 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.929
 way to make a roof then rain noise 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.929
 decrease significantly 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:59.820
 and this whole part we get 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:02.730
 now almost completely isolated 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.820
 from the street, what if you just shove 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.430
 down here only its insulation even 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.320
 then the significant effect of significant you are not 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.580
 get cold air will still 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.190
 go under the skin 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.490
 under the insulation itself will penetrate 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.120
 balcony and cool if done so 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.740
 here is the image then and then on top 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.950
 put one layer of insulation 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.990
 mineral wool one or two how many 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.880
 space permits, or is there 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:35.040
 styrofoam then the effect will be 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.190
 significant if it is of course social 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.830
 plate yes there in front of you is 380 centimeters 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.810
 thick so you can no longer 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.180
 defend yourself just put insulation 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.210
 all but naturally a hole in the street 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.270
 which is closed just by a professional sheet then this 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.540
 one of the best ways for me 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.360
 and insulate and all this reason to tie 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.020
 and a little railing not what 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.480
 good condition were 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.070
 that you let them restore them or 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.770
 it was necessary to cut off completely 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.770
 or carry out welding work 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.750
 in this way we have many problems 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.750
 balcony we eliminate 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.810
 I do not know who is dishonest styrene 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.910
 uses this method or not if up 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.489
 here something like use write 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.700
 in the comments under this video share 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.940
 your experience how are you doing in 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.709
 similar situations 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.340
 the old one was cunning 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.340
