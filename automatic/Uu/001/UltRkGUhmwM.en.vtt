00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.100 
we're going to do that is we're going to
take<00:02:46.970> out<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.330> turrets<00:02:47.660> on<00:02:47.780> there<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.019> the

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
take out the turrets on there so the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.220 
take out the turrets on there so the
Bombers<00:02:48.860> can<00:02:49.010> go<00:02:49.100> in<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.310> do<00:02:49.430> their<00:02:49.550> thing<00:02:50.230> so

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
Bombers can go in and do their thing so

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.110 
Bombers can go in and do their thing so
here's<00:02:51.380> what<00:02:51.470> we're<00:02:51.560> going<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.739> do<00:02:51.830> after<00:02:52.730> burn

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
here's what we're going to do after burn

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.120 
here's what we're going to do after burn
over<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:56.410> start<00:02:57.410> taking<00:02:57.650> out<00:02:57.680> those<00:02:57.830> turrets

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
over and start taking out those turrets

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:06.220 
over and start taking out those turrets
and<00:02:58.310> once<00:02:58.459> that's<00:02:58.580> done<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:04.989> do<00:03:05.989> like<00:03:06.200> that

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
and once that's done I do like that

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.430 
and once that's done I do like that
Floyd<00:03:06.590> actually<00:03:06.970> okay<00:03:07.970> as<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.780> church<00:03:09.050> shooter

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
Floyd actually okay as a church shooter

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.750 
Floyd actually okay as a church shooter
shooting<00:03:09.830> at<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:10.340> means<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:10.580> can

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
shooting at you that means you can

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.250 
shooting at you that means you can
probably<00:03:11.150> shoot<00:03:11.600> at<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:12.700> come<00:03:13.700> on<00:03:13.819> get<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:14.420> but

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
probably shoot at it come on get it but

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
probably shoot at it come on get it but
yeah<00:03:16.100> just<00:03:16.310> make<00:03:16.459> passes<00:03:16.850> on<00:03:16.940> these<00:03:17.090> turrets

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
yeah just make passes on these turrets

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.590 
yeah just make passes on these turrets
give<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.400> Bombers<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> chance<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.209> move<00:03:20.329> in<00:03:20.480> and

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600
