00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
security which frankly I think it's

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.139 
security which frankly I think it's
cheating<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.309> mean<00:00:44.489> they're<00:00:44.640> tricking<00:00:45.000> their

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
cheating I mean they're tricking their

opponent<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:45.809> dishonest<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.129> taking

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
opponent it's dishonest and so is taking

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.040 
opponent it's dishonest and so is taking
steroids<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.090> human<00:00:48.329> growth<00:00:48.480> hormones<00:00:48.899> so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
steroids and human growth hormones so

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.779 
steroids and human growth hormones so
basically<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.829> Rangers<00:00:50.160> lulling<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> leaves

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
basically the Rangers lulling the leaves

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.369 
basically the Rangers lulling the leaves
into<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.000> false<00:00:51.270> sense<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.570> security<00:00:51.780> by<00:00:52.050> taking

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
into a false sense of security by taking

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.170 
into a false sense of security by taking
the<00:00:52.440> penalty<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.520> taking<00:00:53.789> steroids

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180

they<00:01:39.570> move<00:01:39.780> into<00:01:40.079> third<00:01:40.590> third<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
they move into third third in the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
they move into third third in the
Atlantic<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.030> here's<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.479> means<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
Atlantic so here's what that means the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.700 
Atlantic so here's what that means the
Leafs<00:01:43.290> were<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.399> top<00:01:44.759> wild-card<00:01:45.750> spot<00:01:46.020> so

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
Leafs were in the top wild-card spot so

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.469 
Leafs were in the top wild-card spot so
that<00:01:46.860> means<00:01:47.130> they<00:01:47.399> would<00:01:47.520> play<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.970> division

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that means they would play the division

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.389 
that means they would play the division
leader<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> East<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.890> conference

Bozak<00:03:21.380> a<00:03:21.829> number<00:03:22.280> one<00:03:22.489> center<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.090> course<00:03:23.239> it's

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
Bozak a number one center of course it's

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.270

very<00:03:23.750> easy<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.319> talk<00:03:24.470> about<00:03:24.739> after<00:03:25.069> he<00:03:25.160> has<00:03:25.250> a

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
very easy to talk about after he has a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.039 
very easy to talk about after he has a
two-goal<00:03:25.700> performance<00:03:26.239> like<00:03:26.389> damn<00:03:26.599> I've

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
two-goal performance like damn I've

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.470 
two-goal performance like damn I've
liked<00:03:27.440> him<00:03:27.650> all<00:03:27.919> season<00:03:28.459> long<00:03:28.910> I<00:03:29.150> don't<00:03:29.209> have<00:03:29.450> a

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
liked him all season long I don't have a

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.759 
liked him all season long I don't have a
I<00:03:29.720> don't<00:03:29.840> have<00:03:30.139> a<00:03:30.200> complaint

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
I don't have a complaint

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.080 
I don't have a complaint
I<00:03:30.859> still<00:03:31.129> think<00:03:31.250> Kessel<00:03:31.609> could<00:03:31.760> be<00:03:31.849> playing

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
I still think Kessel could be playing

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.940 
I still think Kessel could be playing
with<00:03:32.359> a<00:03:32.389> better<00:03:32.690> one<00:03:32.930> but<00:03:33.290> with<00:03:33.440> Kessel<00:03:33.859> and

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
with a better one but with Kessel and

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.250 
with a better one but with Kessel and
Jamie<00:03:34.220> are<00:03:34.400> clicking<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.120> way<00:03:35.329> they<00:03:35.599> are<00:03:35.900> and

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
Jamie are clicking the way they are and

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.909 
Jamie are clicking the way they are and
Bozak<00:03:36.829> having<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.430> season<00:03:37.669> he's<00:03:38.120> having

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
Bozak having the season he's having

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.750 
Bozak having the season he's having
there's<00:03:39.919> really<00:03:40.069> not<00:03:40.250> much<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.430> complain

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
there's really not much to complain

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.140 
there's really not much to complain
about

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
about

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.379 
about
Bozak's<00:03:41.629> got<00:03:41.840> 37<00:03:42.829> points<00:03:43.220> in<00:03:43.310> 40<00:03:43.819> games<00:03:44.090> and

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
Bozak's got 37 points in 40 games and

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.059 
Bozak's got 37 points in 40 games and
you<00:03:44.510> know<00:03:44.540> how<00:03:44.840> much<00:03:44.989> I<00:03:45.109> love<00:03:45.319> gravel<00:03:45.829> but<00:03:46.010> I

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
you know how much I love gravel but I

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.240 
you know how much I love gravel but I
will<00:03:46.310> be<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.549> first<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:47.060> point<00:03:47.269> out<00:03:47.449> Grabovski

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
will be the first to point out Grabovski

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.159 
will be the first to point out Grabovski
33<00:03:49.250> points<00:03:49.609> in<00:03:49.699> 50<00:03:50.120> games<00:03:50.329> so<00:03:50.540> he's<00:03:50.660> got<00:03:50.840> fewer

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
33 points in 50 games so he's got fewer

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.229 
33 points in 50 games so he's got fewer
points<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:51.769> more<00:03:52.280> games<00:03:52.639> although<00:03:52.970> in

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
points in more games although in

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.699 
points in more games although in
fairness<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.750> him<00:03:53.870> I<00:03:53.930> think<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.290> caps<00:03:54.500> are

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
fairness to him I think the caps are

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.949 
fairness to him I think the caps are
misusing<00:03:55.190> him<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.579> that<00:03:55.849> entire<00:03:56.150> team<00:03:56.480> defends

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
misusing him to that entire team defends

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.300 
misusing him to that entire team defends
like<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.199> Leafs<00:03:57.379> on<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.650> power<00:03:57.829> play

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
like the Leafs on the power play

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.640 
like the Leafs on the power play
so<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.489> question<00:03:58.970> not<00:03:59.239> so<00:03:59.449> much<00:03:59.599> is<00:03:59.810> Bozak<00:04:00.590> a

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
so the question not so much is Bozak a

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.770 
so the question not so much is Bozak a
number<00:04:01.160> one<00:04:01.310> Center<00:04:01.760> it's<00:04:01.970> quite<00:04:02.329> clear<00:04:02.750> that

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
number one Center it's quite clear that

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.369 
number one Center it's quite clear that
he<00:04:03.349> is<00:04:03.970> because<00:04:04.970> he's<00:04:05.449> been<00:04:05.690> playing<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.230> way

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
he is because he's been playing that way

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.080 
he is because he's been playing that way
for<00:04:06.739> like<00:04:06.889> two<00:04:07.129> years<00:04:07.430> so<00:04:07.489> I'll<00:04:07.669> make<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.849> more

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
for like two years so I'll make it more

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.270 
for like two years so I'll make it more
broad<00:04:08.449> how<00:04:08.870> do<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:09.109> feel<00:04:09.440> about<00:04:09.680> Tyler<00:04:10.129> Bozak

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:36.319 
three although I think I've brought it

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.140

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.409 
least didn't do anything at the deadline
I<00:04:39.860> think<00:04:40.250> it<00:04:40.340> makes<00:04:40.490> sense<00:04:40.610> that's<00:04:41.030> it<00:04:41.270> for

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
I think it makes sense that's it for

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:42.640 
I think it makes sense that's it for
this<00:04:41.509> one<00:04:41.690> thank<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:42.050> very<00:04:42.259> much<00:04:42.440> for
