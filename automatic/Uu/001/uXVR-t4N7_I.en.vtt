00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
others as he was inspired I once read in

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.770 
others as he was inspired I once read in
a<00:06:39.210> book<00:06:39.240> that<00:06:39.750> the<00:06:40.440> earth<00:06:40.590> is<00:06:40.800> not<00:06:40.920> destroyed

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
a book that the earth is not destroyed

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.330 
a book that the earth is not destroyed
as<00:06:42.780> a<00:06:43.020> whole<00:06:43.320> it's<00:06:43.680> not<00:06:43.800> just<00:06:43.980> bloom<00:06:44.190> is

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
as a whole it's not just bloom is

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.550 
as a whole it's not just bloom is
destroyed<00:06:44.700> it's<00:06:45.240> piece<00:06:45.540> by<00:06:45.720> piece<00:06:45.750> and<00:06:46.500> I

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
destroyed it's piece by piece and I

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.380 
destroyed it's piece by piece and I
think<00:06:46.770> that's<00:06:46.920> the<00:06:47.010> same<00:06:47.250> way<00:06:47.550> that<00:06:48.090> it<00:06:48.270> needs

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.390 
think that's the same way that it needs

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.070 
think that's the same way that it needs
to<00:06:48.570> be<00:06:48.660> fixed<00:06:49.550> it<00:06:50.550> could<00:06:50.730> be<00:06:50.880> a<00:06:51.090> tire<00:06:51.570> by<00:06:51.810> tire

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
to be fixed it could be a tire by tire

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.930 
to be fixed it could be a tire by tire

whatever it is little by little it's the

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.070 
whatever it is little by little it's the
