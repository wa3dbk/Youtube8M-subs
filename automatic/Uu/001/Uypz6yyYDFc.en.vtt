00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
everyone asks is how far will one go on

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.880 
everyone asks is how far will one go on
a<00:01:56.970> charge<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.630> clearly<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.560> biggest

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
a charge and clearly this is the biggest

already been made now this little fella
was<00:02:07.619> one<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.950> first<00:02:08.190> all-electric<00:02:08.970> cars

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
was one of the first all-electric cars

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:20.790 
was one of the first all-electric cars
on<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> roads<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.959> UK<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.070> g-wiz

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.880 

well<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.850> say<00:02:22.240> car<00:02:22.600> it's<00:02:22.990> actually<00:02:23.170> classified

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
well I say car it's actually classified

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.860 
well I say car it's actually classified
as<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.100> quadricycle<00:02:25.090> which<00:02:25.390> means<00:02:25.600> it<00:02:25.720> doesn't

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
as a quadricycle which means it doesn't

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.480 
as a quadricycle which means it doesn't
have<00:02:25.960> to<00:02:26.140> meet<00:02:26.260> any<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.800> design<00:02:27.250> and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
have to meet any of the design and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.920 
have to meet any of the design and
safety<00:02:27.970> regulations<00:02:28.570> of<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.810> normal<00:02:29.170> car

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.179 

it<00:02:34.680> also<00:02:34.859> only<00:02:35.219> has<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.549> range<00:02:35.879> of<00:02:36.209> 40<00:02:36.780> miles<00:02:37.189> you

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
it also only has a range of 40 miles you

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.559 
it also only has a range of 40 miles you
know<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.579> said<00:02:39.000> if<00:02:39.209> you're<00:02:39.299> just

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
know but that said if you're just

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.030 
know but that said if you're just
trundling<00:02:39.930> around<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.319> city<00:02:40.530> net<00:02:40.799> as<00:02:40.890> many

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
driving but there is one big difference

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.240
