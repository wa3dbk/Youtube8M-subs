Jason thankfully nobody was seriously

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.320 
Jason thankfully nobody was seriously
injured<00:00:35.470> but<00:00:35.890> you<00:00:36.250> have<00:00:36.490> to<00:00:36.670> imagine<00:00:37.210> that

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
injured but you have to imagine that

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.550 
injured but you have to imagine that
this<00:00:37.450> is<00:00:37.600> only<00:00:37.720> gonna<00:00:37.960> add<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.320> public

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
this is only gonna add to the public

this is only gonna add to the public
debate<00:00:38.680> over<00:00:39.490> the<00:00:39.790> pros<00:00:40.060> and<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.660> cons<00:00:40.690> of

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
debate over the pros and the cons of

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.830 
debate over the pros and the cons of
drones<00:00:41.680> you<00:00:42.340> know<00:00:42.460> for<00:00:42.670> whatever<00:00:42.880> purposes

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
drones you know for whatever purposes

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.260 
drones you know for whatever purposes
they're<00:00:44.050> used<00:00:44.670> yeah<00:00:45.670> it's<00:00:45.850> kind<00:00:46.060> of<00:00:46.090> ironic

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
they're used yeah it's kind of ironic

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.200 
they're used yeah it's kind of ironic
the<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:47.620> deadly<00:00:48.190> drones<00:00:48.520> that<00:00:48.670> we<00:00:48.820> talk<00:00:49.059> about

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
the the deadly drones that we talk about

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.910 
the the deadly drones that we talk about
in<00:00:49.630> terms<00:00:49.900> of<00:00:50.170> unmanned<00:00:50.680> aerial<00:00:51.720> warplanes

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
in terms of unmanned aerial warplanes

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.150 
in terms of unmanned aerial warplanes
these<00:00:53.920> are<00:00:54.100> piloted<00:00:54.580> by<00:00:54.730> experts<00:00:55.210> at<00:00:55.450> least

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
these are piloted by experts at least

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.650 
these are piloted by experts at least
they<00:00:57.160> receive<00:00:57.520> enormous<00:00:58.120> amounts<00:00:58.570> of

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
they receive enormous amounts of

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.200 
they receive enormous amounts of
training<00:00:59.129> because<00:01:00.129> they<00:01:00.340> have<00:01:00.730> deadly

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
training because they have deadly

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.060 
training because they have deadly
missions<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.600> carry<00:01:01.809> out<00:01:01.989> what<00:01:02.710> we<00:01:02.740> saw<00:01:02.950> in

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
missions to carry out what we saw in

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.310 
missions to carry out what we saw in
that<00:01:03.130> example<00:01:03.610> is<00:01:03.990> essentially<00:01:04.990> one<00:01:05.140> of<00:01:05.170> those

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
that example is essentially one of those

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.040 
that example is essentially one of those
little<00:01:05.759> quadcopter<00:01:06.759> drones<00:01:07.090> it's<00:01:07.450> piloted<00:01:07.930> by

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
little quadcopter drones it's piloted by

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.240 
little quadcopter drones it's piloted by
remote<00:01:08.380> control

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
remote control

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.190 
remote control
it<00:01:09.610> probably<00:01:09.790> had<00:01:10.030> cameras<00:01:10.479> mounted<00:01:10.600> on<00:01:10.960> it<00:01:11.110> as

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
it probably had cameras mounted on it as

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.570 
it probably had cameras mounted on it as
probably<00:01:11.410> taking<00:01:11.680> pictures<00:01:12.009> of<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.250> event

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
probably taking pictures of the event

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.630 
probably taking pictures of the event
and<00:01:12.759> it<00:01:13.720> was<00:01:13.840> probably<00:01:14.290> being<00:01:14.619> flown<00:01:15.430> by

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
and it was probably being flown by

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.530 
and it was probably being flown by
someone<00:01:15.940> who<00:01:16.000> didn't<00:01:16.180> know<00:01:16.210> what<00:01:16.300> they<00:01:16.420> were

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
someone who didn't know what they were

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.330 
someone who didn't know what they were
doing<00:01:16.630> it's<00:01:17.320> possible<00:01:17.860> that<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:18.130> thing

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
doing it's possible that that thing

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.650 
doing it's possible that that thing
should<00:01:18.580> never<00:01:18.759> have<00:01:18.880> been<00:01:18.970> over<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.270> crowd<00:01:19.479> in

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
should never have been over a crowd in

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.390 
should never have been over a crowd in
the<00:01:19.720> first<00:01:19.960> place<00:01:20.200> so<00:01:20.830> it's<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:21.009> weird<00:01:21.190> irony

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
the first place so it's a weird irony

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.969 
the first place so it's a weird irony
the<00:01:22.090> drones<00:01:22.390> that<00:01:22.540> don't<00:01:22.840> have<00:01:23.380> missiles

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
the drones that don't have missiles

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.570 
the drones that don't have missiles
mounted<00:01:24.399> on<00:01:24.729> board<00:01:25.030> are<00:01:25.869> piloted<00:01:26.619> by<00:01:26.649> you<00:01:27.460> know

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
mounted on board are piloted by you know

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.260 
mounted on board are piloted by you know
hobbyists<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.800> drones<00:01:30.070> that<00:01:30.220> can<00:01:30.369> kill

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
hobbyists the the drones that can kill

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.999 
hobbyists the the drones that can kill
thousands<00:01:31.720> of<00:01:31.840> people<00:01:32.140> or<00:01:32.380> piloted<00:01:32.979> by

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
thousands of people or piloted by

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.580 
thousands of people or piloted by
professionals<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:34.119> all<00:01:34.300> kind<00:01:34.600> of<00:01:34.660> like<00:01:34.869> plays

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
professionals it all kind of like plays

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.490 
professionals it all kind of like plays
into<00:01:35.979> this<00:01:36.069> weird<00:01:36.369> cloud<00:01:36.700> suspicion<00:01:37.300> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
into this weird cloud suspicion of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.570 
into this weird cloud suspicion of
drones<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.710> makes<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:38.979> impossible<00:01:39.190> to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
drones and makes it impossible to

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.210 
drones and makes it impossible to
separate<00:01:40.020> drones<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.110> are<00:01:41.200> useful<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:42.009> we

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
separate drones that are useful and we

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.889 
separate drones that are useful and we
have<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.670> media<00:01:43.000> uses<00:01:43.360> drones<00:01:43.539> to<00:01:43.660> cover

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
have the media uses drones to cover

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.900 
have the media uses drones to cover
events<00:01:44.170> like<00:01:44.500> that<00:01:44.530> there<00:01:45.490> are<00:01:45.580> drones<00:01:45.759> that

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
events like that there are drones that

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.820 
events like that there are drones that
fly<00:01:46.000> over<00:01:46.420> areas<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.050> take<00:01:47.200> take

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
fly over areas and take take

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.059 
fly over areas and take take
environmental<00:01:48.550> data<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.770> are<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.009> are

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
environmental data that are that are

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.699 
environmental data that are that are
quite<00:01:51.310> useful<00:01:51.569> but<00:01:52.569> it's<00:01:52.810> going<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.289> you<00:01:53.619> know

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
quite useful but it's going to you know

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:54.809 
quite useful but it's going to you know
it's<00:01:53.890> one<00:01:53.979> of<00:01:54.039> those<00:01:54.160> things<00:01:54.399> that<00:01:54.610> you<00:01:54.729> know

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
it's one of those things that you know

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.550 
it's one of those things that you know
we<00:01:54.940> see<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:55.360> kind<00:01:55.720> of<00:01:55.780> robot<00:01:56.110> playing<00:01:56.380> in<00:01:56.500> the

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
we see that kind of robot playing in the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.160 
we see that kind of robot playing in the
sky<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:57.160> we<00:01:57.880> worry<00:01:58.149> about<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.690> this<00:01:59.020> is

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
sky and we worry about it this is

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.559 
sky and we worry about it this is
certainly<00:01:59.440> something<00:01:59.649> that's<00:02:00.069> going<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.280> add

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
certainly something that's going to add

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.120 
certainly something that's going to add
to<00:02:01.569> some<00:02:01.780> people's<00:02:02.110> worries<00:02:02.289> a<00:02:02.470> few<00:02:02.770> people

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
to some people's worries a few people

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.860 
to some people's worries a few people
you<00:02:04.060> know<00:02:04.179> more<00:02:04.840> viscerally<00:02:05.350> than<00:02:05.560> others
