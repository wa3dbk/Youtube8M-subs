Farmall<00:00:04.500> super<00:00:04.980> see<00:00:05.660> the<00:00:06.660> heads<00:00:06.870> off<00:00:07.130> the

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
Farmall super see the heads off the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.169 
Farmall super see the heads off the
valve<00:00:08.370> was<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:10.340> number<00:00:11.340> two<00:00:11.519> cylinder<00:00:11.969> was

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
valve was the number two cylinder was

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.620 
valve was the number two cylinder was
stuck<00:00:13.009> so<00:00:14.009> everything<00:00:14.549> came<00:00:14.759> apart<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.330> tried

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
stuck so everything came apart we tried

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.150 
stuck so everything came apart we tried
to<00:00:16.199> open<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.619> first

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
to open it first

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.070 
to open it first
or<00:00:17.760> they'd<00:00:17.940> do<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.240> without<00:00:18.390> opening<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.960> up

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
or they'd do it without opening it up

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.279 
or they'd do it without opening it up
and<00:00:19.340> couldn't<00:00:20.340> get<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.580> loose<00:00:20.930> so<00:00:21.930> it's

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
and couldn't get it loose so it's

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.509 
and couldn't get it loose so it's
getting<00:00:22.560> some<00:00:22.939> new<00:00:23.939> rings<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.570> number<00:00:24.840> two
