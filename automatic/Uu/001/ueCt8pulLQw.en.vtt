and this of what I love about these
Cleveland<00:02:10.769> -<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.549> only<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.790> couple

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
Cleveland - that it's only a couple

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.880 
Cleveland - that it's only a couple
seconds<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.659> a<00:02:12.780> link<00:02:13.019> there<00:02:13.109> and<00:02:13.769> they

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
seconds we have a link there and they

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:26.880 
seconds we have a link there and they
don't<00:02:14.099> make<00:02:14.189> a<00:02:14.250> really<00:02:14.909> nice

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:44.520

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.230
