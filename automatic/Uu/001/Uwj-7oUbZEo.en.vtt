00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.330
 Hello 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.920
 and that a band also 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:27.330
 it's important for Mexicans because 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.180
 good theories we grew up with the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.730
 eight 'boy series says that 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.320
 many end of melancholy when they speak 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.940
 of the kid since he was in the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.090
 first things that could be the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.580
 Mexican television 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.020
 these days, well, it was not in these 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.660
 newspapers has a little time the 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.730
 News 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.670
 and I can see that there is a game 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.370
 developed by slam teams 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.500
 games that already worked previously 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.739
 in a game of the guy and that also 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.230
 worked left Mexican wrestling that 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.720
 formed game did not have the success that should 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.980
 have was a good game besides me 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.160
 It seemed much better than double-double 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.040
 being this but theoretically good 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.180
 game of the guy now will not be the typical 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.080
 game that came out in wii who was a guy 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.320
 mario parri 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.100
 now what we are seeing what is going to 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.200
 be the game I inspired a skill 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.760
 with a gameplay similar to what it is 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.800
 mario kart 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.650
 the game is available from people from 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.410
 current generation with flex 3 366 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.490
 orbital this game this one was 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.230
 classified by laws and is harvey well 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.450
 that Americans can 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.700
 wait and the vast majority of the world I 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.550

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.730
