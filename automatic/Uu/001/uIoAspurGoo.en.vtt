00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
know that sounds weird because it's a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.660

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
but the main thing has always been the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.130 
but the main thing has always been the
topics<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> discussion<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> voice<00:01:54.840> has

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
I've made the gameplay the main focus

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.020 
I've made the gameplay the main focus
now<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.950> know<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.099> probably<00:02:35.459> noticed<00:02:35.880> this

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
now you know you probably noticed this

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.940 
now you know you probably noticed this
I've<00:02:36.209> had<00:02:36.480> my<00:02:36.690> best<00:02:36.930> like<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.319> strong<00:02:37.590> gameplay

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
I've had my best like a strong gameplay

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.380 
I've had my best like a strong gameplay
I<00:02:37.980> think<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.250> called<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.550> absolute<00:02:38.849> domination

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
I think I called the absolute domination

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.050 
I think I called the absolute domination
and<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.470> main<00:02:40.620> focus<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.190> gameplay<00:02:41.760> or

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
and the main focus of that gameplay or

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.729 
and the main focus of that gameplay or
commentary<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.019> was<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.319> talk<00:02:43.470> about<00:02:43.590> the

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
commentary it was to talk about the

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.259 
commentary it was to talk about the
gameplay<00:02:43.920> at<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.190> start<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.610> discuss<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.180> and

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
gameplay at the start and discuss it and

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.360 
gameplay at the start and discuss it and
stuff<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:45.599> that<00:02:45.900> I've<00:02:46.140> done<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.010> just

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
stuff like that I've done the just

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.839 
stuff like that I've done the just
brutal<00:02:47.880> which<00:02:48.239> was<00:02:48.950> only<00:02:49.950> made<00:02:50.160> because<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:50.640> had

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
brutal which was only made because I had

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.850 
brutal which was only made because I had
two<00:02:51.090> brutal<00:02:51.360> streaks<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.200> really<00:02:52.530> enjoyed

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
two brutal streaks that I really enjoyed

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.680 
two brutal streaks that I really enjoyed
and<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.160> thought<00:02:53.310> I'd<00:02:53.430> throw<00:02:53.459> them<00:02:53.760> together<00:02:53.910> so

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
and I thought I'd throw them together so

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.270 
and I thought I'd throw them together so
just<00:02:54.930> stuff<00:02:55.049> like<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.590> know<00:02:55.620> I've<00:02:55.829> made

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
just stuff like that you know I've made

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.309 
just stuff like that you know I've made
the<00:02:56.430> game<00:02:56.640> played<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.599> main<00:02:57.750> focus<00:02:58.200> of

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
the game played that the main focus of

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.470 
the game played that the main focus of
the<00:02:58.440> video<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.920> that's<00:02:59.069> why<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.549> don't<00:03:00.090> want<00:03:00.420> to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
the video and that's why I don't want to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.819 
the video and that's why I don't want to
do<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> other<00:03:00.959> way<00:03:01.079> around<00:03:01.290> now<00:03:01.620> I'd

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
do it the other way around now I'd

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.589 
do it the other way around now I'd
rather<00:03:02.040> have<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> really<00:03:02.730> sick<00:03:02.940> gameplay<00:03:03.360> and

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
rather have a really sick gameplay and

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.330 
rather have a really sick gameplay and
that'd<00:03:04.079> be<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.290> main<00:03:04.500> focus<00:03:04.920> that'd<00:03:05.130> be<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
that'd be the main focus that'd be the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.949 
that'd be the main focus that'd be the
video<00:03:05.549> title<00:03:05.970> rather<00:03:06.180> than<00:03:06.329> me<00:03:06.450> talking<00:03:06.870> about

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
video title rather than me talking about

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.890 
video title rather than me talking about
certain<00:03:07.709> topics<00:03:07.829> and<00:03:08.310> making<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.329> title<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
certain topics and making the title the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.300 
certain topics and making the title the
topics<00:03:10.349> of<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> video<00:03:10.769> if<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.069> makes<00:03:11.250> sense

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
topics of the video if that makes sense

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.710 
topics of the video if that makes sense
so<00:03:11.549> I<00:03:11.849> thought<00:03:12.209> that's<00:03:12.269> probably<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.599> bit

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
so I thought that's probably a bit

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.150 
so I thought that's probably a bit
random<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.319> guys<00:03:13.620> probably<00:03:13.920> haven't

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
random and you guys probably haven't

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.039 
random and you guys probably haven't
noticed<00:03:14.549> much<00:03:14.730> but<00:03:15.030> I've<00:03:15.540> been<00:03:15.720> really<00:03:15.870> proud

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
noticed much but I've been really proud

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.390 
noticed much but I've been really proud
with<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.349> gameplays<00:03:16.709> I've<00:03:16.890> been<00:03:17.010> putting<00:03:17.280> out

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
with the gameplays I've been putting out

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.770 
with the gameplays I've been putting out
because<00:03:17.670> obviously<00:03:18.090> when<00:03:18.480> you're<00:03:18.569> doing<00:03:18.720> a

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
because obviously when you're doing a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.240 
because obviously when you're doing a
live<00:03:18.930> commentary<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.709> can't<00:03:19.920> get<00:03:20.100> anything

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
live commentary you can't get anything

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.370 
live commentary you can't get anything
same<00:03:20.730> gameplay<00:03:21.000> every<00:03:21.329> time<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.109> what<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.290> do

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
same gameplay every time so what I do

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.430 
same gameplay every time so what I do
these<00:03:22.650> regular<00:03:23.040> commentaries<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:24.290> try<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.350> get

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
these regular commentaries I try and get

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.379 
these regular commentaries I try and get
the<00:03:25.530> best<00:03:25.650> game<00:03:25.829> plays<00:03:26.040> out<00:03:26.250> for<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.489> guys<00:03:26.670> so
