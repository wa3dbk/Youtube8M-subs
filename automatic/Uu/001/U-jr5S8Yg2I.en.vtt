there we go that's a lot and now the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.469 
there we go that's a lot and now the
mutant<00:01:37.409> circuit<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:38.340> he'll<00:01:39.240> just

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
mutant circuit is up there he'll just

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.500 
mutant circuit is up there he'll just
stand<00:01:39.659> still<00:01:40.580> look<00:01:41.580> he's<00:01:41.970> not<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.330> add

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
stand still look he's not going to add

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.960 
stand still look he's not going to add
to<00:01:42.690> all<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.190> normal<00:01:44.400> difficulty

to all and this is a normal difficulty
the<00:01:45.630> point<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.930> being<00:01:46.080> discussing<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.740> that

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the point of being discussing is that

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.980 
the point of being discussing is that
I'm<00:01:47.400> classic<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> impossible<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.690> might<00:01:48.869> not

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
I'm classic and impossible it might not

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.230 
I'm classic and impossible it might not
be<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.200> case<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:50.220> there<00:01:50.400> you<00:01:50.490> go<00:01:50.520> everybody

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
be the case but there you go everybody

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.760 
be the case but there you go everybody
was<00:01:51.390> over<00:01:51.660> watching<00:01:51.840> within<00:01:52.200> range<00:01:52.440> of<00:01:52.590> him

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
was over watching within range of him

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.790 
was over watching within range of him
and<00:01:52.979> he<00:01:53.610> didn't<00:01:53.880> move<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.619> show<00:01:55.680> you

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
and he didn't move and just to show you

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.950 
and he didn't move and just to show you
that<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.100> still<00:01:56.400> the<00:01:56.520> case<00:01:56.550> we<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.840> do

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
that that's still the case we can do

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.440 
that that's still the case we can do
that<00:01:58.080> from<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> return<00:01:58.850> because<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.210> still

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that from the return because we still

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.090 
that from the return because we still
don't<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.659> where<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:00.930> other<00:02:01.140> mutant<00:02:01.470> is<00:02:01.619> so

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
don't know where this other mutant is so

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.300 
don't know where this other mutant is so
what's<00:02:03.020> let's<00:02:04.020> keep<00:02:04.289> moving<00:02:04.619> our<00:02:04.740> people<00:02:05.100> into

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
what's let's keep moving our people into

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.090 
what's let's keep moving our people into
positions<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:06.060> we<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.300> find<00:02:06.600> him<00:02:06.869> that's<00:02:07.740> how

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
positions if we can find him that's how

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.470 
positions if we can find him that's how
you<00:02:09.229> had<00:02:10.229> all<00:02:10.320> I<00:02:10.350> get<00:02:10.560> too<00:02:10.739> close<00:02:11.180> because<00:02:12.180> if

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
you had all I get too close because if

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.880 
you had all I get too close because if
you<00:02:12.600> stood<00:02:12.780> next<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.080> somebody<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.680> over

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
you stood next to somebody and you over

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.340 
you stood next to somebody and you over
watch<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.220> will<00:02:14.430> still<00:02:14.640> attack<00:02:14.970> them<00:02:15.350> he's

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
watch you will still attack them he's

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.550 
watch you will still attack them he's
not<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.709> stupid<00:02:17.570> I'm<00:02:18.570> not<00:02:18.840> sure<00:02:19.080> how<00:02:19.410> it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
not that stupid I'm not sure how it

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.220 
not that stupid I'm not sure how it
works<00:02:19.940> when<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.060> take<00:02:21.300> range<00:02:21.750> into

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
works when you take range into

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.930 
works when you take range into
consideration<00:02:22.950> whether<00:02:23.130> if<00:02:23.400> somebody's<00:02:23.790> like

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
consideration whether if somebody's like

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.370 
consideration whether if somebody's like
within<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.269> square<00:02:24.480> whether<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.989> might<00:02:25.170> still

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
within a square whether you might still

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.790 
within a square whether you might still
move<00:02:25.850> but<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.050> good<00:02:28.230> sap<00:02:28.470> I've<00:02:28.650> got

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
move but this is a good sap I've got

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.199 
move but this is a good sap I've got
here<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.070> again<00:02:29.250> he's<00:02:29.610> not<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.060> move

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
here and again he's not going to move

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.590 
here and again he's not going to move
this<00:02:30.390> turn<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.690> can<00:02:30.840> guarantee<00:02:31.230> here<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.150> grim

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
this turn I can guarantee here so grim

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.870 
this turn I can guarantee here so grim

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
good thing is he'll wait even if even if

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.120 
good thing is he'll wait even if even if
the<00:03:21.900> only<00:03:21.990> person<00:03:22.380> over<00:03:22.590> watching<00:03:22.770> him<00:03:23.010> is

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
the only person over watching him is

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.949 
the only person over watching him is
like<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.310> shotgun<00:03:23.640> assault<00:03:24.300> soldier<00:03:24.720> who's

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
like a shotgun assault soldier who's

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.840 
like a shotgun assault soldier who's
only<00:03:25.080> got<00:03:25.260> one<00:03:25.500> percent<00:03:25.830> chance<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.190> hit<00:03:26.370> as

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
only got one percent chance to hit as

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.370 
only got one percent chance to hit as
long<00:03:27.060> as<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.390> can<00:03:27.540> see<00:03:27.720> him<00:03:27.840> as<00:03:27.959> long<00:03:28.080> as<00:03:28.110> she's

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
long as you can see him as long as she's

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.320 
long as you can see him as long as she's
in<00:03:28.530> range<00:03:28.740> and<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.730> know<00:03:29.820> select<00:03:30.180> him

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
in range and you can you know select him

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.350 
in range and you can you know select him
in<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.510> firing<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.350> won't<00:03:31.770> move<00:03:31.860> at<00:03:32.040> all

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
in the firing you you won't move at all

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.300 
in the firing you you won't move at all
so<00:03:33.360> there<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.810> go<00:03:33.840> that's<00:03:34.230> that's<00:03:35.130> that

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
so there you go that's that's that

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.699 
so there you go that's that's that
technique<00:03:35.700> in<00:03:35.910> action<00:03:36.300> on<00:03:36.870> Normal<00:03:37.290> difficulty

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
technique in action on Normal difficulty
