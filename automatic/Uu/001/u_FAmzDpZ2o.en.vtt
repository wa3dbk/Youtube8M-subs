quickly remove the EVF sled now we've
got<00:00:37.559> three<00:00:37.950> different<00:00:38.100> configurations<00:00:39.200> here

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
got three different configurations here

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.950 
got three different configurations here
we<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> sinner<00:00:40.829> ride<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:42.300> EVF<00:00:42.690> sled

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
we have a sinner ride on the EVF sled

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.160 
we have a sinner ride on the EVF sled
and<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> standard<00:00:43.590> configuration<00:00:45.020> here<00:00:46.020> we

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and the standard configuration here we

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.580 
and the standard configuration here we
have<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> Zacuto<00:00:47.059> with<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> EVF<00:00:48.690> sled<00:00:48.989> flipped

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
have a Zacuto with the EVF sled flipped

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.520 
have a Zacuto with the EVF sled flipped
in<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> upside<00:00:50.370> down<00:00:50.399> position<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.530> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
Zacuto EVF features an image flip so you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.420 
Zacuto EVF features an image flip so you
can<00:00:55.680> still<00:00:55.949> view<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> image<00:00:56.760> upright<00:00:57.149> and

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
can still view the image upright and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.720 
can still view the image upright and
here<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.910> small<00:01:00.180> HD<00:01:00.480> dp4<00:01:01.730> attached

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
here we have the small HD dp4 attached

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.509 
here we have the small HD dp4 attached
with<00:01:03.000> our<00:01:03.379> small<00:01:04.379> HD<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.070> alpha<00:01:05.280> Trion

adapter<00:01:07.850> now<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> give<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> quick<00:01:09.510> idea<00:01:09.659> how

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
adapter now to give you a quick idea how

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:10.700 
adapter now to give you a quick idea how
this<00:01:10.170> works

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
this works

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.280 
this works
just<00:01:11.070> push<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> EVF<00:01:11.909> sled<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> NATO

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
just push the EVF sled on to the NATO

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.870 
just push the EVF sled on to the NATO
pin<00:01:14.000> slide<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> out<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.540> lock<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.409> down<00:01:16.880> now

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
pin slide it out and lock it down now

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.630 
pin slide it out and lock it down now
you<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> knob<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.619> top<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.280> tension

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you have a knob on top here for tension

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.070 
you have a knob on top here for tension
and<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:22.110> viewfinder<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:23.009> move<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.080> minimal

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and the viewfinder can move with minimal

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.929 
and the viewfinder can move with minimal
friction<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.340> want<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.610> increase<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
friction if you want to increase the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.969 
friction if you want to increase the
friction<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.659> turn<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> knob<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.530> tension

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
friction just turn the knob for tension

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.789 
friction just turn the knob for tension
and<00:01:29.329> it'll<00:01:30.329> increase<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.990> friction<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
and it'll increase the friction on the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.340 
and it'll increase the friction on the
viewfinder<00:01:31.979> mount<00:01:32.990> now<00:01:33.990> there<00:01:34.140> are<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> few

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
viewfinder mount now there are a few

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
viewfinder mount now there are a few
optional<00:01:34.829> accessories<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> Universal

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
optional accessories for the Universal

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
optional accessories for the Universal
EVF<00:01:36.659> mount<00:01:36.930> we've<00:01:37.590> got<00:01:37.799> our<00:01:38.070> extension<00:01:38.700> arm

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
EVF mount we've got our extension arm

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.270 
EVF mount we've got our extension arm
here<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.720> adds<00:01:40.049> additional<00:01:40.860> length<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
here and this adds additional length to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.889 
here and this adds additional length to
the<00:01:41.369> NATO<00:01:41.640> rail<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.420> want<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.689> put<00:01:42.810> your

the NATO rail so if you want to put your

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.749 
the NATO rail so if you want to put your
viewfinder<00:01:43.170> further<00:01:43.799> back<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> camera

viewfinder further back on the camera
for<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> studio<00:01:45.240> configuration<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.829> do

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
for a studio configuration you can do

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.190 
for a studio configuration you can do
that<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.399> piece<00:01:47.700> now<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.360> also<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.930> an

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that with this piece now we also have an

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.230 
that with this piece now we also have an
eyepiece<00:01:49.530> leveler<00:01:50.070> attachment<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.060> will

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
eyepiece leveler attachment that will

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.289 
eyepiece leveler attachment that will
attach<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> extension<00:01:53.220> arm<00:01:53.369> or<00:01:54.030> it'll

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
attach to the extension arm or it'll

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.270 
attach to the extension arm or it'll
attach<00:01:54.570> directly<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.320> NATO<00:01:55.680> rail<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
attach directly to the NATO rail on the

attach directly to the NATO rail on the
EVF<00:01:56.729> mat<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.719> great<00:01:58.079> for<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.530> use<00:01:58.590> an

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
EVF mat this is great for if you use an

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.940 
EVF mat this is great for if you use an
airy<00:01:59.460> eyepiece<00:01:59.909> leveler<00:02:00.530> now<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.590> way<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
airy eyepiece leveler now the way the

airy eyepiece leveler now the way the
extension<00:02:02.369> arm<00:02:02.579> attaches<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> same<00:02:03.719> way

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
extension arm attaches it's the same way

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.679 
extension arm attaches it's the same way
that<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.409> EVF<00:02:04.799> sled<00:02:05.070> attaches<00:02:05.579> let's<00:02:06.509> push

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
that the EVF sled attaches let's push
