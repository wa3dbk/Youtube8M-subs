say - which was really quite heavy so

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.640 
say - which was really quite heavy so
Asics<00:00:19.790> set<00:00:20.000> out<00:00:20.150> to<00:00:20.599> take<00:00:20.840> this<00:00:21.140> technically

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
you great cushioning a great ride and is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.110 
you great cushioning a great ride and is
gonna<00:00:36.050> feel<00:00:36.350> like<00:00:36.559> a<00:00:36.739> normal<00:00:37.010> shoe<00:00:37.400> underneath

gonna feel like a normal shoe underneath
the<00:00:38.300> foot<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:39.410> first<00:00:39.649> thing<00:00:39.829> that<00:00:39.860> makes<00:00:40.160> the

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
the foot the first thing that makes the

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.880 
the foot the first thing that makes the
kimse<00:00:40.730> three<00:00:41.000> unique<00:00:41.360> is<00:00:41.630> the<00:00:42.260> guidance<00:00:42.620> line

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
kimse three unique is the guidance line

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.220 
kimse three unique is the guidance line
and<00:00:43.670> what<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:43.940> guidance<00:00:44.149> line<00:00:44.540> is<00:00:44.960> is<00:00:45.200> a

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
and what the guidance line is is a

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.979 
and what the guidance line is is a
manner<00:00:45.590> of<00:00:46.120> developing<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.270> shoe<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:47.960> that

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
manner of developing the shoe so that

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.619 
manner of developing the shoe so that
you<00:00:48.290> have<00:00:48.440> repeatability<00:00:49.100> in<00:00:49.460> foot<00:00:49.670> strike<00:00:49.940> so

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
you have repeatability in foot strike so

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.080 
you have repeatability in foot strike so
that<00:00:50.660> from<00:00:51.320> heel<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:51.559> toe<00:00:51.879> you're<00:00:52.879> going<00:00:53.030> to

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
that from heel to toe you're going to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.420 
that from heel to toe you're going to
have<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.899> same<00:00:54.110> motion<00:00:54.620> with<00:00:54.980> every<00:00:55.280> single

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
have the same motion with every single

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.029 
have the same motion with every single
step<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:56.149> way<00:00:56.930> that<00:00:57.140> this<00:00:57.260> has<00:00:57.410> accomplished

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
step the way that this has accomplished

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.270 
step the way that this has accomplished
is<00:00:58.340> by<00:00:58.789> decoupling<00:00:59.539> the<00:00:59.600> forefoot<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:01.070> now<00:01:01.190> we

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
is by decoupling the forefoot so now we

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.610 
is by decoupling the forefoot so now we
have<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:01.700> deep<00:01:01.910> flexion<00:01:02.239> rule<00:01:02.539> and<00:01:02.899> what

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
have this deep flexion rule and what

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.160 
have this deep flexion rule and what
that<00:01:03.800> does<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:04.580> it<00:01:04.970> allows<00:01:05.000> for<00:01:05.600> much<00:01:05.960> better

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
that does is it allows for much better

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.070 
that does is it allows for much better
lateral<00:01:06.800> release<00:01:07.160> and<00:01:07.600> that's<00:01:08.600> going<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.840> help

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
lateral release and that's going to help

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.919 
lateral release and that's going to help
you<00:01:09.470> toe<00:01:09.770> off<00:01:10.009> towards<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.700> pinky<00:01:11.030> toe<00:01:11.060> which

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:11.929 
you toe off towards the pinky toe which

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.370 
you toe off towards the pinky toe which
is<00:01:12.080> exactly<00:01:12.530> where<00:01:12.740> you<00:01:12.770> want<00:01:13.069> to<00:01:13.190> be

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
is exactly where you want to be

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.050 
is exactly where you want to be
something<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.410> was<00:01:16.009> very<00:01:16.340> unique<00:01:16.550> when<00:01:16.910> the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
something that was very unique when the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.029 
something that was very unique when the
kimse<00:01:17.390> came<00:01:17.600> out<00:01:17.780> originally<00:01:18.350> was<00:01:18.800> this

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
kimse came out originally was this

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.389 
kimse came out originally was this
discreet<00:01:19.780> heel<00:01:20.780> unit<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.860> you've<00:01:22.009> got<00:01:22.220> this

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
discreet heel unit so you've got this

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.210 
discreet heel unit so you've got this
large<00:01:22.789> gel<00:01:23.450> unit<00:01:23.810> all<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.590> way<00:01:24.679> around<00:01:25.009> and

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
large gel unit all the way around and

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.589 
large gel unit all the way around and
you've<00:01:25.340> got<00:01:25.490> two<00:01:25.700> different<00:01:25.819> densities<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:26.569> a

00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:26.599 
you've got two different densities so a

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:28.839 
you've got two different densities so a
lower<00:01:26.869> density<00:01:27.140> gel<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:28.160> a<00:01:28.220> slightly<00:01:28.490> higher

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:28.849 
lower density gel and a slightly higher

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:31.809 
lower density gel and a slightly higher
density<00:01:29.360> gel<00:01:29.630> here<00:01:30.319> on<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.560> medial<00:01:30.890> side<00:01:31.099> and

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
density gel here on the medial side and

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.460 
density gel here on the medial side and
what<00:01:32.000> that's<00:01:32.119> going<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.450> do<00:01:32.599> is<00:01:32.840> just<00:01:33.050> help

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
guide your foot through the foot strike

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.770 
guide your foot through the foot strike
one<00:01:37.190> of<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.399> things<00:01:37.580> was<00:01:37.970> again<00:01:38.390> we<00:01:38.569> talked

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
one of the things was again we talked

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.749 
one of the things was again we talked
about<00:01:38.929> the<00:01:39.140> weight<00:01:39.289> reduction<00:01:39.490> so<00:01:40.490> they<00:01:40.610> got

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
about the weight reduction so they got

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.999 
about the weight reduction so they got
rid<00:01:40.789> of<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.479> lot<00:01:42.050> of<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.289> support<00:01:42.709> structure

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
rid of a lot of the support structure

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.639 
rid of a lot of the support structure
where<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.459> was<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.670> rounded<00:01:44.479> gel<00:01:44.690> unit<00:01:45.229> here

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
where that was a rounded gel unit here

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.790 
where that was a rounded gel unit here
and<00:01:45.830> what<00:01:46.490> that<00:01:46.640> does<00:01:46.849> is<00:01:47.030> allows<00:01:47.330> the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
and what that does is allows the

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.080 
and what that does is allows the
cushioning<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:49.069> feel<00:01:49.429> even<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.789> little<00:01:49.910> bit

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
cushioning to feel even a little bit

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.740 
cushioning to feel even a little bit
softer<00:01:50.479> as<00:01:50.720> well<00:01:51.080> as<00:01:51.380> reduced<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.130> weight

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
softer as well as reduced the weight

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.749 
softer as well as reduced the weight
another<00:01:53.750> great<00:01:54.020> thing<00:01:54.259> on<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:54.590> shoe<00:01:54.860> is<00:01:55.160> what

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
another great thing on this shoe is what

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.419 
another great thing on this shoe is what
is<00:01:56.000> their<00:01:56.360> trust<00:01:57.050> ik<00:01:57.200> propulsion<00:01:57.800> system<00:01:58.190> and

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
is their trust ik propulsion system and
