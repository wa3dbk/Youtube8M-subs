so<00:02:40.549> whether<00:02:41.180> how<00:02:41.600> he<00:02:41.660> goes<00:02:42.080> back<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.650> double<00:02:42.890> of

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
so whether how he goes back in double of

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.070 
so whether how he goes back in double of
memory<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.150> courtroom<00:02:44.569> you'll<00:02:44.930> be<00:02:45.019> able

shops<00:04:22.479> and<00:04:22.660> stuff<00:04:22.750> isn't<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.169> most<00:04:23.320> fun<00:04:23.710> work
