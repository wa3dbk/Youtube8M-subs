hopefully<00:00:01.380> by<00:00:01.650> now<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.010> note<00:00:02.669> names<00:00:02.970> that

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hopefully by now the note names that

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.780 
hopefully by now the note names that
make<00:00:03.419> up<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.780> C<00:00:04.049> major<00:00:04.350> scale<00:00:04.650> should<00:00:05.370> be<00:00:05.580> more

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
make up a C major scale should be more

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.480 
make up a C major scale should be more
familiar<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.799> proof<00:00:08.189> that

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
familiar to you and this is proof that

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.520 
familiar to you and this is proof that
you're<00:00:08.670> developing<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.599> becoming<00:00:10.050> ever<00:00:10.290> more

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
you're developing and becoming ever more

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.190 
you're developing and becoming ever more
comfortable<00:00:11.340> with<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:11.610> scale<00:00:12.200> really

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
comfortable with this scale really

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.709 
comfortable with this scale really
though<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.710> should<00:00:14.250> strive<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.790> achieve<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
though you should strive to achieve the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.680 
though you should strive to achieve the
same<00:00:15.990> level<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.560> confidence<00:00:17.070> with<00:00:17.699> any<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.510> the

other major scales in terms of knowing
the<00:00:21.449> notes<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.990> are<00:00:22.199> used<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.619> construct

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
the notes that are used to construct

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.570 
the notes that are used to construct
them<00:00:23.570> so<00:00:24.570> let's<00:00:25.140> start<00:00:25.470> working<00:00:25.920> towards<00:00:26.400> this

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
them so let's start working towards this

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.700 
them so let's start working towards this
and<00:00:26.880> briefly<00:00:27.480> take<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> look<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.230> some<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.529> these

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
and briefly take a look at some of these

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.810 
and briefly take a look at some of these
other<00:00:29.010> major<00:00:29.580> scales<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:31.250> know<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.520> can

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
other major scales I know you can

other major scales I know you can
already<00:00:33.000> play<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:33.899> let's<00:00:34.170> just<00:00:34.440> take<00:00:34.680> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
already play this but let's just take a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.590 
already play this but let's just take a
look<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> notes<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.730> together<00:00:36.059> make<00:00:36.570> up

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
look at the notes that together make up

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
look at the notes that together make up
the<00:00:36.899> E<00:00:36.930> major<00:00:37.410> scale<00:00:37.680> now<00:00:38.870> just<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.989> quick<00:00:40.200> word

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

to play new major scales both shapes

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.720 
to play new major scales both shapes
we've<00:00:46.379> learned<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.890> play<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.100> major<00:00:47.489> scale

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
we've learned to play the major scale

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.779 
we've learned to play the major scale
need<00:00:48.420> three<00:00:48.960> strings<00:00:49.410> worth<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.950> space<00:00:50.219> across

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
complete scale see there I've just

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.209 
complete scale see there I've just
played<00:00:57.570> notes<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> e<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.789> D<00:01:00.359> strings

note to start another major scale from

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.870 
note to start another major scale from
make<00:01:07.049> sure<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.650> choose<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> root<00:01:08.340> note<00:01:08.610> from

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
make sure you choose a root note from

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.620 
make sure you choose a root note from
either<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.420> E<00:01:09.450> string<00:01:10.049> or<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> string<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
either the E string or the a string that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
either the E string or the a string that
way<00:01:12.930> you'll<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.530> space<00:01:13.860> available<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
way you'll have the space available to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.530 
way you'll have the space available to
complete<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> scale<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.049> down<00:01:17.540> hopefully

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
complete the scale up and down hopefully

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.780 
complete the scale up and down hopefully
you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.070> were<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.340> start<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
you can see that if I were to start the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.609 
you can see that if I were to start the
shape<00:01:21.090> from<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.450> note<00:01:21.659> anywhere<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> D

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.200 
string like this I'd simply run out of
strings<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.890> only<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.310> able<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.640> play<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210

onto<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.700> seventh<00:02:02.210> note<00:02:02.510> is<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.990> d<00:02:03.350> sharp<00:02:03.710> or<00:02:03.920> E

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
onto the seventh note is a d sharp or E

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.220 
onto the seventh note is a d sharp or E
flat<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:05.120> then<00:02:05.780> we're<00:02:06.170> back<00:02:06.200> at<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.620> octave<00:02:06.950> e

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
flat and then we're back at the octave e

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.020 
flat and then we're back at the octave e
from<00:02:09.230> this<00:02:09.470> it's<00:02:09.770> interesting<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.760> see<00:02:11.000> that

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
from this it's interesting to see that

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.180 
from this it's interesting to see that
now<00:02:11.390> we've<00:02:11.600> got<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.810> major<00:02:12.140> scale<00:02:12.590> that

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
now we've got a major scale that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.540 
now we've got a major scale that
contains<00:02:13.670> either<00:02:13.880> sharp<00:02:14.360> or<00:02:14.630> flat<00:02:14.690> notes<00:02:15.590> but

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
contains either sharp or flat notes but

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.020 
contains either sharp or flat notes but
even<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.930> sound<00:02:18.380> created<00:02:19.160> by<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.580> scale

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
even so the sound created by the scale

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.260 
even so the sound created by the scale
is<00:02:20.330> still<00:02:20.660> distinctly<00:02:21.640> recognizable<00:02:22.640> as<00:02:22.880> the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
is still distinctly recognizable as the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.890 
is still distinctly recognizable as the
major<00:02:23.480> scale<00:02:24.580> remember<00:02:25.580> it's<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.300> order<00:02:26.780> of

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
major scale remember it's the order of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.160 
major scale remember it's the order of
notes<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.620> more<00:02:28.130> importantly<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.420> intervals

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
notes and more importantly the intervals

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.620 
notes and more importantly the intervals
between<00:02:30.440> those<00:02:31.040> individual<00:02:31.730> notes<00:02:32.030> that

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
between those individual notes that

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.410 
between those individual notes that
dictate<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.350> sound<00:02:33.710> or<00:02:34.040> character<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:35.000> any

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
the same note as a G flat okay what I'd

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.600 
the same note as a G flat okay what I'd
like<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.780> do<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:00.320> your<00:03:00.470> own<00:03:00.709> practice<00:03:01.100> is

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
like you to do in your own practice is

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.090 
like you to do in your own practice is
work<00:03:02.120> towards<00:03:02.660> figuring<00:03:02.900> out<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.500> note<00:03:03.800> names

major<00:03:06.470> scales<00:03:07.480> before<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.630> start<00:03:09.080> I

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
major scales before you start I

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.860 
major scales before you start I
recommend<00:03:10.010> writing<00:03:10.640> out<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.790> list<00:03:11.270> of<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.690> 12

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
recommend writing out a list of the 12

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.410 
recommend writing out a list of the 12
semitones<00:03:12.530> contained<00:03:13.489> in<00:03:13.700> an<00:03:13.820> octave<00:03:14.180> and

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
semitones contained in an octave and

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.560 
semitones contained in an octave and
then<00:03:15.140> using<00:03:15.800> those<00:03:15.980> notes<00:03:16.220> as<00:03:16.550> root<00:03:16.910> notes<00:03:17.239> to

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
then using those notes as root notes to

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.710 
then using those notes as root notes to
begin<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.200> other<00:03:18.380> major<00:03:18.650> scales<00:03:19.070> from<00:03:19.450> as<00:03:20.450> you

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
begin the other major scales from as you

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.229 
begin the other major scales from as you
do<00:03:20.959> this<00:03:21.230> try<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:21.860> use<00:03:22.220> both<00:03:22.520> major<00:03:22.850> scale

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
do this try to use both major scale

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.490 
do this try to use both major scale
