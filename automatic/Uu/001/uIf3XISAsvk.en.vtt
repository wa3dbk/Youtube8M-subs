00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.959
 Little girls or all the icons 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.270
 needy and this here is very big 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.700
 we found there was inbox and the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.380
 true that we have a bot that is curious 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.990
 which is curious is very curious because no 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.810
 generally the sheep that are hash that 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.900
 eat us eat on grass grass 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.120
 this rich rich sheep ewe grass no 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.710
 they do more and with a little bit of wheat they 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.220
 can count on each other and they give you 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.320
 digit you know is that I think not that this one 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.030
 have a problem let's make the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.289
 sheep in the hand if they do not know it 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.300
 but we're going to teach them how to eat 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.650
 stone I think the stone is adorable 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.050
 you will like them we are going to give them 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.760
 very much and let's go to it we 're going to 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.050
 they will explain a little bit of what 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.190
 goes the multi motel what he's going to do is 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.250
 that we will be able to generate 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.629
 worst sheep is worth and how is this good 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.570
 first we have to teach the sheep 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.059
 to which the stone is rich that the stone 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.440
 is very rich with the iron fuck uncle is 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.789
 how to drink milk is great and 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.129
 wonderful so that's what we're going to 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.870
 to do ok we have to get 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.969
 good as you have to get a 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.839
 position of weakness that is around here 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:08.710
 is a diamond a diamond can be 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.520
 this with this we are already running, that is to say 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.560
 well it's with your portion and you say 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.840
 let's spread a little bit of weakness 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.520
 to all the sheep to be a 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.920
 Grated little mentally say that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.229
 I can do with my life and now 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.329
 we will calmly feed them 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.939
 a diamond then they go 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.770
 transforming this one has no option 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.369
 they will be transforming for free 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.219
 as in stone sheep it is worth classes that 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.869
 ye you are seeing right now and already there 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.250
 we have all our girls that 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.100
 now and I'm going to take this away from me because 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.280
 I do not like this 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.799
 but it's fine for me not 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.479
 very well there we have them obviously 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.850
 its effect is over now they are sheep 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.060
 of stone how this stone is removed 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.119
 well before a peak is like a peak click 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.400
 right and the stone comes out you see it to the 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.170
 stone comes out the stone and then grows them 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.790
 the stone like in stone is worth going out there 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.399
 like in stone and it grows back to the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.530
 Next day it is worth adding courageous joy 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.360
 it's over having to mine already you have 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.100
 your own stone farm your own 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.860
 iron farm and your own farm 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.260
 whatever if you come here I'm going to 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.959
 give them gold it's true that 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.890
 rich for example you have visited me 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.840
 running here you have wheat or everything there 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.290
 we have gold and gold and you can there 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.630
 flirt with each other and make you one 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.280
 mini gold sheep is a mattress 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.250
 is coña vale 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.020
 carbon coal coal come here 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.290
 you're like cows when cows appear 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.620
 really and there is that is your baby coal 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.840
 iron iron fell boom boom boom boom 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.630
 boom and iron is already and then to 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.880
 generate so you are infinite of materials 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.690
 valen also worked with entities we are going to 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.410
 go testing it diamond rest 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.080
 diamond is distant eyes and you make me 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.440
 a diamond baby there is there is the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.440
 rest 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.530
 and ready I do not know what would happen peak that does not go 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.560
 to work if together it does not stop 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.360
 diamond with a d 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.180
 of iron are worth as species 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.459
 totally different according as 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.400
 You see, it's a damn joy 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.890
 it's very good 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.510
 there is the generator there is power 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.180
 we can change them as you can see 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.510
 change them worth there is 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.730
 the rest of sack and let's try to wing 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.250
 with emeralds and quartz with quartz 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.709
 things and it's going to work we try it or so 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.209
 that works with quartz is worth how rare 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.069
 they are in fact lying with each other 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.530
 what weird things and emeralds 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.989
 I consider it the best in the world 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.359
 because after all this possible 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.829
 but they do not catch either has that 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.540
 because there are children made recently that's 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.209
 true that's true there are between digits 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.859
 recently and that's why they do not catch but good 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.670
 this is the teacher's trick is bread 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.109
 today the truth that is super 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.480
 interesting and super super fun 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.540
 funny and the truth that you see here with 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.140
 a peak and is that you observe me 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.510
 Extend the gold 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.650
 the man so that later you come with your 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.410
 peak of fortune and get yourself out even more 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.180
 because this is a joke you have here 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.579
 that in your 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:24.650
 to see 336 9 and 10 up here all happy 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.650
 with you let's read 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.330
 with your piquito, we're going to do it 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.680
 so you can see that this is the wonder 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.840
 of wonders in this way that what 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.700
 combine with this peak a little bit of 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.620
 luck 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.380
 give me a mold of zero 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.870
 let's leave 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.150
 give me emeralds of 10 blocks of 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.390
 emeralds come here and picasso a 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.120
 little to start you get about 5 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.860
 levels approximately and we got 23 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.270
 double emeralds 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.920
 that's a wonder this way of that 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.600
 wonder among all the wonders if
