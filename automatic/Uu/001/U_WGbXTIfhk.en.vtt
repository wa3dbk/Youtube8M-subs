00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
let's say that we want to do the text so

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.180 
let's say that we want to do the text so
we<00:02:10.890> hit<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> text<00:02:11.489> box

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
we hit the text box

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.610 
we hit the text box
so<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.760> opens<00:02:13.120> up<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:13.960> type<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.410> few

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
so this opens up so you type a few

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.860 
so this opens up so you type a few
things<00:02:14.890> here<00:02:15.310> use<00:02:15.970> your<00:02:16.150> hand<00:02:16.420> or<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:16.660> can<00:02:16.840> use

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
things here use your hand or you can use

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.210 
things here use your hand or you can use
a<00:02:16.990> pen<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.770> then<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.760> hit<00:02:19.000> done<00:02:19.620> now<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.680> have

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
a pen and then you hit done now you have

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.030 
a pen and then you hit done now you have
the<00:02:21.430> wording<00:02:21.910> it's<00:02:22.180> right<00:02:22.450> here<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:23.230> let's

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
the wording it's right here and let's

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.160 
the wording it's right here and let's
say<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.370> we<00:02:24.460> want<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.700> put<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:24.970> here<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.870> then

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
say that we want to put it here and then

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.870 
say that we want to put it here and then
let's<00:02:26.410> say<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.800> it's<00:02:26.980> not<00:02:27.070> big<00:02:27.520> enough<00:02:27.550> that

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
let's say that it's not big enough that

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.760 
let's say that it's not big enough that
you<00:02:28.240> want<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.510> stretch<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.930> out<00:02:29.050> more<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:29.650> if

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
you want to stretch it out more so if

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.380 
you want to stretch it out more so if
you<00:02:29.860> get<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.250> second<00:02:30.610> time<00:02:30.640> this<00:02:31.030> will<00:02:31.240> open

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
you get it a second time this will open

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.570 
you get it a second time this will open
up<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:32.290> there's<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.620> bar<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:33.340> make<00:02:33.430> it

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
up so there's a bar that can make it

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.450 
up so there's a bar that can make it
larger<00:02:34.090> or<00:02:34.420> smaller<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:35.920> do<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.310> and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
larger or smaller so you do that and

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.970 
larger or smaller so you do that and
then<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:37.330> hit<00:02:37.510> done<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:37.810> then<00:02:38.590> like<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:38.920> said

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
then you hit done and then like I said

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.740 
then you hit done and then like I said
you<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.250> move<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.670> around<00:02:39.760> wherever<00:02:40.210> you<00:02:40.510> want

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
you can move it around wherever you want

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.790 
you can move it around wherever you want
it<00:02:40.870> let's<00:02:41.740> say<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.310> there<00:02:42.550> was<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:43.800> checkbox

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
it let's say that there was a checkbox

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.690 
it let's say that there was a checkbox
that<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:45.250> needed<00:02:45.580> an<00:02:45.730> X<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:47.260> um<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:48.400> hit<00:02:48.550> that

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
that you needed an X so um you hit that

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.460 
that you needed an X so um you hit that
box<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.420> then<00:02:49.570> let's<00:02:49.780> say<00:02:49.960> that<00:02:50.140> that's<00:02:50.320> why

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
box and then let's say that that's why

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.160 
box and then let's say that that's why
you<00:02:50.530> wanted<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.860> checkbox<00:02:51.400> or<00:02:51.900> let's<00:02:52.900> say

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
you wanted the checkbox or let's say

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.050 
you wanted the checkbox or let's say
that<00:02:53.410> we<00:02:53.560> need<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:54.010> have<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.220> date<00:02:54.610> which<00:02:54.910> we

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
that we need to have a date which we

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.270 
that we need to have a date which we
have<00:02:55.240> a<00:02:55.270> date<00:02:55.540> down<00:02:55.780> here<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.500> then<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.130> can

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
have a date down here so then you can

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.890 
have a date down here so then you can
move<00:02:57.460> it<00:02:57.610> all<00:02:57.760> around<00:02:57.790> let's<00:02:58.390> say<00:02:58.600> that<00:02:58.750> it's

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
move it all around let's say that it's

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.890 
move it all around let's say that it's
tomorrow<00:02:59.380> we<00:03:00.280> had<00:03:00.460> done<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:01.420> now<00:03:01.570> we<00:03:01.630> have<00:03:01.750> a

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
tomorrow we had done so now we have a

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.860 
tomorrow we had done so now we have a
date<00:03:02.230> whoops<00:03:02.830> there's<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.700> date<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.660> we<00:03:04.690> can

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
date whoops there's the date so we can

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.480 
date whoops there's the date so we can
move<00:03:05.020> that<00:03:05.230> here<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.310> again<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.450> can<00:03:08.490> hit

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
move that here and again you can hit

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.100 
move that here and again you can hit
that<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.880> second<00:03:10.330> time<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:10.540> can<00:03:10.840> make<00:03:10.960> it

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
that a second time you can make it

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.360 
that a second time you can make it
larger<00:03:11.530> whatever<00:03:12.570> hit<00:03:13.570> done<00:03:13.840> moves<00:03:14.590> there<00:03:14.890> so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
larger whatever hit done moves there so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.400 
larger whatever hit done moves there so
let's<00:03:15.580> say<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:15.760> we're<00:03:16.000> finished<00:03:16.270> oh<00:03:16.720> I'm
