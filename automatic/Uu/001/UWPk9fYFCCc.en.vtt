00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.070
 ae 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.699
 ae 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.260
 Talk to the tents talking again 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.300
 but a video for you this time I 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.820
 I decided to focus a little on the staff who 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.280
 is learning is starting now 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.870
 so I made a video of tips 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.450
 very basic for those starting 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.239
 now you do not know the terms you will hear 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.160
 talking a lot will have a lot of acronyms and I'll go 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.330
 do a series of years I believe that in 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.190
 three videos 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.140
 This is just the first one I'm going to pass. 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.570
 for you a little bit there than we 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.660
 talk during the game as they are 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.540
 activities to strategies 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.070
 some softer stuff to who's just 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.899
 in this first stage 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.200
 so together with my friends here 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.240
 We made a video for you guys. 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.170
 understand how these 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.080
 mechanical 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.080
 I hope you like follow the steps 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.470
 ras the English word says molesting 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.060
 to disturb 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.950
 So when you hear that game? 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.620
 means that as you can see in this 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.990
 moment of weakness of mine . 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.740
 The enemy takes advantage of the law n 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.740
 and it bothers me 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.420
 the consumables they are extremely 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.860
 important if you observe on the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.170
 My skills you will see a 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.880
 red icon and means that I used 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.840
 a few health I am recovering from my 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.360
 health 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.790
 from the moment I suffered that 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.040
 will you see it then initially 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.930
 to keep me apart I use some 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.819
 in this case a portion of 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.160
 healing so I can stay longer 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.650
 there to not lose too much nor too xp 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.540
 then clips gold farm 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.160
 especially at the beginning of the game is very 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.290
 important that you carry some with 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.980
 You're not afraid to use it. 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.140
 expensive 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.140
 initially but then you compensate 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:49.299
 maybe df is the name of the motion given in 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.940
 when you decided to risk a 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.650
 a little more that you too 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.349
 because of this, it ends up going under 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.560
 from the enemy's tower to try 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.750
 take some advantage of this gold as 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.430
 here maybe something like 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.680
 was an extremely risky new 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.959
 who is starting is a little more 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.060
 advanced so the negative alert 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.410
 do not do it often because you 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.970
 can see what exactly what is 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.620
 happening now you will realize that 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.670
 my opponent under the tower to 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.370
 to kill me 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.680
 with this he ends up staying there and he 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.209
 dies together this may have been good for 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.609
 have been bad this varies greatly from 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.200
 strategy and other things a bit 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.730
 more advanced than I speak in another 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.730
 video but avoid 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.650
 pull the tracks or pull the lenses 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.650
 means you 're going to push your 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.439
 opponent down the tower itself d 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.200
 So that you could do this for what? 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.519
 keep him from forming in peace 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.170
 killing the clips and to keep it under 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.269
 pressure all the time 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.739
 as you can observe pulling it 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.319
 normally used if large 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.319
 skills spent week to be able to kill 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.299
 the clips are fast and this is positive 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.670
 from what I said when the farm however 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.129
 it is negative if badly done because you 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.629
 is free with his back to the river 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.400
 so you can receive a hook from the 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.259
 very easy opponent team 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.410
 so you have to be very careful with 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.410
 that 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.950
 keep track of the tracks or enforce the laws 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.240
 means that you are talking about a 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.880
 safe way 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.400
 this is you can observe in the video that 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.830
 at the moment the clips are finished 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.210
 and they go out of line I eat 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.950
 support came in front of my 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.390
 companion and does not leave the clubs 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.970
 arrive near the tower so that the tower 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.340
 do not kill enrolled with speed like this 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.870
 it can stay in place forming the emi 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.870
 This you can do alone, too. 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.300
 how are you going to see it in the sequence? 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.250
 is an interesting maneuver and ensures the 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.670
 you enough money and enough 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.670
 tranquility
