this rank me all players will be ranked

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.990 
this rank me all players will be ranked
on<00:01:50.330> a<00:01:50.390> per<00:01:50.690> hopper<00:01:51.110> basis<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:51.739> when<00:01:52.700> they<00:01:52.819> say

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
on a per hopper basis and when they say

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.479 
on a per hopper basis and when they say
hopper<00:01:53.390> I<00:01:53.569> believe<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:53.869> means<00:01:54.229> like<00:01:54.470> a<00:01:54.500> like

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:55.489 
hopper I believe that means like a like

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:57.339 
hopper I believe that means like a like
a<00:01:55.520> game<00:01:55.849> it's<00:01:56.119> like<00:01:56.179> a<00:01:56.239> matchmaking<00:01:56.509> game<00:01:57.050> so

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
a game it's like a matchmaking game so

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.729 
a game it's like a matchmaking game so
on<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.619> per<00:01:58.310> game<00:01:58.670> basis<00:01:59.179> so<00:01:59.840> for<00:02:00.080> example<00:02:00.110> you

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:00.739 
on a per game basis so for example you

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:03.880 
on a per game basis so for example you
will<00:02:00.920> have<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.220> unique<00:02:02.200> CSR<00:02:03.200> for<00:02:03.500> your<00:02:03.619> Slayer

your CSR will go up and down based on

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.890 
your CSR will go up and down based on
match<00:02:15.920> outcomes<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:16.819> if<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.090> win<00:02:17.360> if<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.780> win

list of playlists that will support csr
will<00:02:37.460> be<00:02:37.670> determined<00:02:38.210> when<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.510> system<00:02:38.720> is

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
will be determined when the system is

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.410 
will be determined when the system is
ready<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.440> drop<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:40.280> they'll<00:02:40.910> actually<00:02:41.090> cut

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
ready to drop so they'll actually cut

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.470 
ready to drop so they'll actually cut
down<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.750> playlist<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.320> have<00:02:42.500> like<00:02:42.680> a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
down the playlist and have like a

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.420 
down the playlist and have like a
certain<00:02:44.480> ranking<00:02:45.350> playlist<00:02:45.980> that's<00:02:46.220> like

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
certain ranking playlist that's like

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.360 
certain ranking playlist that's like
only<00:02:46.760> ranked<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:48.140> similar<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.710> halo<00:02:48.830> 3<00:02:49.190> and

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
only ranked so similar to halo 3 and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.060 
only ranked so similar to halo 3 and
Halo<00:02:49.430> 2<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.900> another<00:02:51.290> thing<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:51.800> want

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
Halo 2 and so another thing that I want

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.580 
Halo 2 and so another thing that I want
to<00:02:52.160> point<00:02:52.340> out<00:02:52.520> is<00:02:52.850> that<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.780> ranking<00:02:54.170> system

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
to point out is that this ranking system

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.440 
to point out is that this ranking system
will<00:02:54.800> actually<00:02:55.190> not<00:02:55.340> come<00:02:55.610> out<00:02:55.730> with<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.240> game

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
will actually not come out with the game

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.690 
will actually not come out with the game
it's<00:02:56.690> not<00:02:56.900> going<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.110> be<00:02:57.290> with<00:02:57.890> us<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.280> november

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
it's not going to be with us on november

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.860 
it's not going to be with us on november
six<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.180> it's<00:02:59.270> not<00:02:59.390> going<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.570> be<00:02:59.630> on<00:02:59.720> way

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
six and it's not going to be on way

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.530 
six and it's not going to be on way
point<00:03:00.140> on<00:03:00.350> november<00:03:01.220> six<00:03:01.400> either<00:03:01.700> it's<00:03:02.480> not

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
point on november six either it's not

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.180 
point on november six either it's not
going<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.780> come<00:03:02.900> out<00:03:03.080> until<00:03:03.290> early<00:03:03.860> next<00:03:03.890> year

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
going to come out until early next year

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.700 
going to come out until early next year
and<00:03:04.580> they<00:03:05.390> actually<00:03:05.600> answer<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.170> question

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
and they actually answer the question

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.580 
and they actually answer the question
for<00:03:06.920> as<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.520> why<00:03:07.670> there's<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.000> delay<00:03:08.300> and<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:09.050> we

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
for as to why there's a delay and so we

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.980 
for as to why there's a delay and so we
know<00:03:09.800> how<00:03:10.010> important<00:03:10.640> skill<00:03:11.090> rank<00:03:11.300> is<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.780> we

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
know how important skill rank is and we

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.070 
know how important skill rank is and we
take<00:03:12.260> skill<00:03:12.950> integrity<00:03:13.460> very<00:03:13.910> seriously<00:03:14.390> we

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
take skill integrity very seriously we

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.930 
take skill integrity very seriously we
want<00:03:15.320> to<00:03:15.410> make<00:03:15.440> sure<00:03:15.560> we've<00:03:16.280> taken<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:16.760> time

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
want to make sure we've taken the time

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.590 
want to make sure we've taken the time
to<00:03:17.210> test<00:03:17.480> tune<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.740> balance<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.670> csr<00:03:20.150> system

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
to test tune and balance the csr system

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.780 
to test tune and balance the csr system
in<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.870> live<00:03:21.170> environment<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:22.010> identify

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
in a live environment and identify

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.390 
in a live environment and identify
problems<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.630> potential<00:03:24.230> exploits<00:03:24.800> before

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
problems and potential exploits before

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.820 
problems and potential exploits before
launching<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:25.940> system<00:03:26.360> publicly<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:27.320> that's

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
launching the system publicly so that's

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.140 
launching the system publicly so that's
really<00:03:28.100> good<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.280> hear<00:03:28.370> i<00:03:28.580> like<00:03:28.850> how<00:03:28.970> they're
