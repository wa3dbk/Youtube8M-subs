00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.410
 Hi, so different video here on the channel 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.650
 see how long they ask me to 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.109
 talk on foot and I never came here to talk 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.119
 can not wait china will always stay 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.140
 bad for a routine of standing for you 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.240
 they talk about my care mainly 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.470
 in recent times because I think that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.810
 often accompanying me to a 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.869
 a little more time they realized this way 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.320
 that my skin has improved a lot 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.420
 so from 2014 to here I often 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.850
 had pimples on my skin I had not 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.829
 that skin and super pimply 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.620
 but there were always several people here in the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.840
 cheek in the 4 the victim in the forehead and in the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.309
 chin knows I always had problems 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.739
 with pimples and it did not matter what I 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.170
 I used it did not help me much 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.719
 in relation to this had already gone to 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.699
 meteorologist everything unresolved 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.770
 so that's why I did not have one 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.239
 skin routine because I do not have no 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.250
 had many production had discovered 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.719
 many products that really did 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.270
 difference to my skin that really 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.970
 Yummy, this I never found interesting 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.799
 I came here to talk about skin for you more. 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.869
 last year it changed and one of 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.479
 The best things that ever happened to 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.390
 my skin was the use of clays I did not 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.700
 I have oily skin but in summer I 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.830
 I think most of the majority of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.750
 population ends up getting the skin 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.970
 in summer this happens a lot 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.259
 with me but this problem with 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.909
 spine gave me winter summer 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.409
 independent of the station today I can 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.640
 tell you that yes I have one 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.380
 skin routine 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.270
 I'll show you guys soon if 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.729
 you want to leave me in the comments 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.770
 whoever you want a video talking 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.600
 about this do not make a post I do not know something there 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.579
 type but I can say with 100% of 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.340
 sure that one of the things that most 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.590
 helped in the treatment of my pimples 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.470
 and oiliness of the face now in summer 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.990
 was the agile to see in several types of 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.670
 Clays, but in summer it's just me. 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.800
 more aid because of the problem of 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.780
 excessive oiliness 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.790
 because of the heat and because of 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.380
 pimples year round is the clay 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.210
 time I'll stop talking I want 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.860
 show it to you application you go 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.200
 see me and face washed for you to see 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.730
 even as the skin is super clean 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.950
 have a lot of redness on the face and 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.900
 but this is normal for my 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.240
 pigmentation of my skin months will see 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.710
 with respect to the spine yes it has almost nothing 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.960
 from time to time a thorn of 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.210
 one relaxed in the clay appears about 15 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.730
 or scroll the new help does not appear anymore 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.350
 use twice does not appear anymore know one 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.000
 awesome thing is so much more 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.680
 simple, surely many of you already 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.630
 must know but for those who do not know 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.860
 it's a super tip worth doing if 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.360
 let's see how we do with 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.920
 clay mask and to get rid of 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.820
 pimples and that controlled in the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.590
 university 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.080
 So, to start, we need to 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.300
 a can any one a clay spoon 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.160
 green of course and there on the blog I'll leave the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.570
 link where I buy more clays where 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.340
 You can find when people 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.890
 passes there to check and mineral water 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.390
 filtered or if you prefer you can use direct 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.400
 the same tap with measures 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.080
 there are no certain measures and 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.180
 yields a lot then it has a bit of 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.830
 caution in the time to prepare your 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.500
 I put more or less of 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.110
 one to two tablespoons and I go 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.330
 triggering water a little until you get 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.400
 The consistency I need it does not 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.450
 can be neither very consistent nor 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.310
 very much to guard 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.930
 if you need to add more rigid 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.030
 but water will do this until it has a 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.370
 consistency similar to this work is 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.459
 type a clay and go for application 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.190
 to wash washed with nothing on your face to 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.720
 show you my real skin without 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.970
 no makeup on face same time 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.489
 neither is the spirit very incredible but there 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.770
 in the jaw I have a good spine 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.750
 ugly and inflamed neck are also 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.730
 Wanna give birth to something? Let's go and attack. 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.500
 dilma she picks up the mix and starts to 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.630
 apply with the brush any that I just 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.730
 use to place the brush he did not 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.170
 It's going to ruin but I'd rather leave one. 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.030
 To do this, and I'm trying. 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.350
 make a more uniform layer possible 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.350
 I do not apply so close to my eyes either. 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.970
 and triggers and after it starts to 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.650
 to be a case is to realize that it gets very difficult 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.030
 to move the steering wheel is the pause time I 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.130
 I'll let emerge away from my face 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.930
 30 minutes to an hour that too 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.640
 depends on the time I have on the day I 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.860
 I like to do this mask normally 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:08.650
 before going to sleep until you wiggle your eyebrow 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.600
 gets hard and off the break time 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.220
 clay dried up and realizes it when I 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.440
 I'll stay completely shift not 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.910
 can not even open his mouth and he 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.609
 already begins to present these cracks 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.620
 Okay, now I'm going to see the face with 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.540
 Water can even use cotton and uses 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.690
 hands swollen in the sink even without a secret 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.690
 none 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.720
 and then call the country and we will not 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.690
 I know if you realize that she has a 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.610
 different goal is with sight so knows 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.690
 beautiful skin and redness that zinho 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.910
 It's normal because we work 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.740
 enough on the skin so it's not strange it's on 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.740
 especially for me as white as me 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:51.330
 and even the nose people get super cute 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.439
 smaller and full of weevils after 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.930
 pass this mask 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:56.520
 he gets very soft and super secretive 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.780
 to help you and not 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.639
