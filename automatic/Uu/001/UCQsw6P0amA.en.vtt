00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
just saying here here's the seed so I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.200 
just saying here here's the seed so I
decided<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.310> check<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.609> out<00:00:23.699> cuz<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:23.939> sounded

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.450 
for quite a while I did not fully
explore<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.850> seems<00:01:03.090> too<00:01:03.420> big<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
would get i spawned on i just the island

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.219 
would get i spawned on i just the island
with<00:01:09.180> no<00:01:09.330> trees<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.900> was<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.140> agreeing

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
