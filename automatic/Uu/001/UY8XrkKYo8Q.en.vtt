00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
recipe today we need equal parts of

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.140 
recipe today we need equal parts of
cream<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:16.199> chocolate<00:00:16.640> this<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> half<00:00:18.119> cup

so<00:00:23.430> before<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.789> filled<00:00:24.119> my<00:00:24.449> cup<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:24.869> chocolate

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
so before I filled my cup with chocolate

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.160 
so before I filled my cup with chocolate
I<00:00:25.470> filled<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.789> cream<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.420> then<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.840> poured

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
I filled it with cream and then I poured

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.169 
I filled it with cream and then I poured
it<00:00:28.289> into<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> bowl<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.130> what<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.640> see<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
it into the bowl so what you see in the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.990 
it into the bowl so what you see in the
bowl<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.660> exactly<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.800> amount<00:00:32.160> there<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.880> it

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
bowl is exactly that amount there so it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.819 
bowl is exactly that amount there so it
doesn't<00:00:33.300> matter<00:00:33.420> what<00:00:33.809> measure<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.350> use<00:00:34.380> as

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
doesn't matter what measure you use as

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.069 
doesn't matter what measure you use as
long<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.399> equal<00:00:35.880> parts<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.870> fun

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
long as you have equal parts and the fun

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.990 
long as you have equal parts and the fun
part<00:00:37.110> about<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.530> recipe<00:00:38.129> because<00:00:38.640> my

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
part about this recipe because my

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.090 
part about this recipe because my
chocolate<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.660> already<00:00:40.260> warm<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:40.980> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
chocolate is already warm and in a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.700 
chocolate is already warm and in a
liquid<00:00:41.460> form<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.390> directly<00:00:42.840> add<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
liquid form we can directly add it to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.040 
liquid form we can directly add it to
our<00:00:43.739> cold<00:00:44.129> cream<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.770> we've<00:00:46.920> got<00:00:47.100> our<00:00:47.370> cold

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
our cold cream so we've got our cold

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.959 
our cold cream so we've got our cold
whipping<00:00:49.050> cream<00:00:49.250> we've<00:00:50.250> got<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> chocolate

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
whipping cream we've got the chocolate

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.580 
whipping cream we've got the chocolate
I'm<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.440> there

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
I'm just going to get that all in there

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.310 
I'm just going to get that all in there
and<00:00:52.969> just<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.210> you've<00:00:54.420> seen<00:00:54.660> me<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:54.989> many

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and just like you've seen me do many

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.350 
and just like you've seen me do many
many<00:00:55.559> times<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.129> I'm<00:00:56.250> doing<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.640> chocolate

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
many times when I'm doing a chocolate

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360 
many times when I'm doing a chocolate
ganache<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.079> exactly<00:00:58.710> what<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
ganache this is exactly what I do and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.520 
ganache this is exactly what I do and
then<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> would<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.660> simply<00:01:00.870> start<00:01:01.289> mixing

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
then I would just simply start mixing

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.470 
then I would just simply start mixing
this<00:01:01.800> together<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.850> today<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.270> we're<00:01:03.390> going

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
this together but today what we're going

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.119 
this together but today what we're going
to<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.140> we're<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> do<00:01:04.619> one<00:01:04.830> more<00:01:04.860> step

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
to do is we're going to do one more step

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.510 
to do is we're going to do one more step
and<00:01:05.519> we're<00:01:05.640> actually<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> whip<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
and we're actually going to whip this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.289 
and we're actually going to whip this
because<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.610> want<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
because I want to get all of that

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.310 
because I want to get all of that
chocolate<00:01:09.570> out<00:01:13.400> it's<00:01:14.400> good<00:01:14.960> I'm<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.140> going

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
chocolate out it's good I'm just going

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
chocolate out it's good I'm just going
to<00:01:16.350> grab<00:01:16.619> my<00:01:16.890> hand<00:01:17.369> mixer<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:21.420> I'm<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:21.750> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
to grab my hand mixer and I'm going to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.640 
to grab my hand mixer and I'm going to
start<00:01:22.049> mixing<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.590> together

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.620 

and<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.920> already<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.340> how<00:01:33.270> thick<00:01:33.600> this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and you can already see how thick this

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.220 
and you can already see how thick this
is<00:01:35.090> usually<00:01:36.090> want<00:01:36.480> to<00:01:36.570> make<00:01:36.720> chocolate

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
is usually want to make chocolate

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.999 
is usually want to make chocolate
ganache

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
ganache

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.539 
ganache
the<00:01:39.280> cream<00:01:39.700> is<00:01:40.229> much<00:01:41.229> warmer<00:01:41.770> or<00:01:41.950> hotter<00:01:42.280> and

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
the cream is much warmer or hotter and

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.420 
the cream is much warmer or hotter and
so<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.539> really<00:01:43.840> melts<00:01:44.469> everything<00:01:44.950> down<00:01:45.189> but

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
so it really melts everything down but

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.920 
so it really melts everything down but
right<00:01:45.610> now<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:45.909> can<00:01:46.270> see<00:01:46.479> that<00:01:46.689> this<00:01:46.780> is

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
right now you can see that this is

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.490 
right now you can see that this is
already<00:01:47.229> turning<00:01:47.590> into<00:01:48.719> like<00:01:49.719> a<00:01:49.750> frosting

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
already turning into like a frosting

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.520 
already turning into like a frosting
type<00:01:51.189> of<00:01:51.369> texture<00:01:51.820> here<00:01:51.969> look<00:01:52.149> at<00:01:52.240> this<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
type of texture here look at this and

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.160 
type of texture here look at this and
we've<00:01:54.399> just<00:01:54.429> started<00:01:55.119> mixing<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:55.929> I'm<00:01:56.020> going

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
we've just started mixing so I'm going

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.160 
we've just started mixing so I'm going
to<00:01:56.200> start<00:01:56.470> going<00:01:57.009> a<00:01:57.250> little<00:01:57.369> faster<00:01:58.170> I'm

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
to start going a little faster I'm

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.190 
to start going a little faster I'm
actually<00:01:59.350> going<00:01:59.649> to<00:01:59.740> rip<00:01:59.950> some<00:02:00.250> air<00:02:00.490> into<00:02:00.759> this

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
actually going to rip some air into this

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.990 
actually going to rip some air into this
so<00:02:02.200> I'm<00:02:02.289> going<00:02:02.469> to<00:02:02.500> go<00:02:02.649> for<00:02:02.920> maybe<00:02:03.520> two<00:02:03.819> minutes

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
so I'm going to go for maybe two minutes

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.410 
so I'm going to go for maybe two minutes
and<00:02:04.270> then<00:02:04.390> I'll<00:02:04.509> come<00:02:04.689> back

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.600
