00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.799
 abdominal is the daily diet 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.220
 It is necessary to carry out a balanced diet that includes all 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.989
 nutrients needed for the body 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:26.689

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.880
 sweets and the exaggerated consumption of red meat 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.149
 whole grains dairy nonfat fruits vegetable vegetables and a limited 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.170
 consumption of chicken and fish should be the basis of the daily diet 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.770
 also nothing of excesses or binge eating and alcohol as always 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.240
 empty into abdominal fat 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.580
 two 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.149
 regular aerobic physical activity 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.730
 Many believe that only with abdominal exercises can you eliminate 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.310
 the accumulated fat in this area 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.590
 this is a mistake since only with a supplementary aerobic activity is 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.510
 will burn the fat that forms the belly that is located between the muscles and 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.460
 the skin with 25 minutes three times a week is sufficient although you can 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.540
 get up to 40 minutes the ideal activities are cycling fu 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.550

 get muscle tone and firmness 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.720
 It is not necessary to dedicate long hours of training since a few minutes 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.760
 distributed among 5 7 exercises is more than enough 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.250
 It is advisable to perform the abdominals every day - Sunday is used 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.980
 as a rest day 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.130
 The key is continuity rather than quantity 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.530
 with eight weeks of continuous training the tummy will be just a mere 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.260
 Memory of the past 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.120
 to keep the act mind the training must always be constant 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.760
 beyond eight weeks 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.040

 two liters per day about eight glasses are recommended to eliminate toxins and 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.709
 purify the organism 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.479

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:26.090
 that yes there is a suitable way to drink water away from meals at least 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:30.869
