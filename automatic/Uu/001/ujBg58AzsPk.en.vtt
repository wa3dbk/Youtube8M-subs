00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
just because it falls in that same

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.039 
just because it falls in that same
series<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:14.400> bicycle<00:00:14.820> masters<00:00:15.179> are<00:00:15.389> pretty

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
series the bicycle masters are pretty

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.480 
series the bicycle masters are pretty
much<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.730> red<00:00:18.140> standard<00:00:19.140> bicycle<00:00:19.740> deck<00:00:20.189> there's

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
much a red standard bicycle deck there's

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.019 
much a red standard bicycle deck there's
nothing<00:00:20.939> really<00:00:21.900> too<00:00:22.410> different<00:00:23.160> other<00:00:23.369> than

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
nothing really too different other than

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.599 
nothing really too different other than
the<00:00:24.269> fact<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.720> these<00:00:25.080> decks<00:00:25.529> last<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
the fact that these decks last up to

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.390 
the fact that these decks last up to
seven<00:00:26.970> times<00:00:27.300> longer<00:00:27.720> than<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.650> standard<00:00:29.130> deck

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
seven times longer than a standard deck

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.730 
seven times longer than a standard deck
and<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:29.849> if<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.539> red<00:00:30.779> back<00:00:30.960> deck<00:00:31.230> or<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> blue

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
and so if the red back deck or the blue

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.220 
and so if the red back deck or the blue
back<00:00:31.920> rider<00:00:32.579> back<00:00:32.850> deck<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.079> your
