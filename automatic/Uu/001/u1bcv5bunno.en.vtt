00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
much J's and then we have this printed

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.259 
much J's and then we have this printed
piece<00:03:07.250> here<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.480> course<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.900> rip<00:03:09.050> cord

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269

rips it well and it goes fast enough it
will<00:03:13.730> fly<00:03:14.239> off<00:03:14.769> so<00:03:15.769> we'll<00:03:16.250> start<00:03:16.459> off<00:03:16.579> on<00:03:16.820> this

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
will fly off so we'll start off on this

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.270 
will fly off so we'll start off on this
spinning<00:03:17.390> on<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.660> table<00:03:18.079> since<00:03:18.739> as<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.040> know

you<00:03:20.120> can<00:03:20.360> spin<00:03:21.079> them<00:03:21.170> on<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.380> table<00:03:21.739> or

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
you can spin them on the table or

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.900 
you can spin them on the table or
wherever<00:03:23.600> you<00:03:23.870> are<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:24.920> it's<00:03:25.370> just<00:03:25.549> in<00:03:25.760> case

and then as soon as it runs continues
Ben<00:04:15.370> around<00:04:15.550> of<00:04:15.760> course<00:04:16.049> but<00:04:17.049> that's<00:04:17.290> pretty

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
Ben around of course but that's pretty

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.470 
Ben around of course but that's pretty
much<00:04:17.680> it<00:04:17.950> for<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.250> edge<00:04:18.400> its<00:04:18.609> agenda<00:04:19.060> fire

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
much it for the edge its agenda fire

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.780 
much it for the edge its agenda fire
overall<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.739> recommendations<00:04:21.430> for<00:04:21.700> the

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
overall to the recommendations for the

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.820 
overall to the recommendations for the
set<00:04:22.120> I<00:04:22.419> definitely<00:04:23.169> think<00:04:23.320> this<00:04:23.470> is<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.650> good

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
set I definitely think this is a good

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.700 
set I definitely think this is a good
set<00:04:24.100> to<00:04:24.310> get<00:04:24.580> because<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:26.020> feeling<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.590> get

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
set to get because the feeling you get

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.310 
set to get because the feeling you get
in<00:04:26.889> this<00:04:27.070> is<00:04:27.310> very<00:04:28.150> nice<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:28.810> since<00:04:29.110> he's

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
in this is very nice and since he's

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.409 
in this is very nice and since he's
exclusive<00:04:30.040> and<00:04:30.250> it<00:04:30.490> is<00:04:30.610> kind<00:04:30.910> of<00:04:30.970> an<00:04:31.090> MLG

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
exclusive and it is kind of an MLG

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.640 
exclusive and it is kind of an MLG
version<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:32.010> good<00:04:33.010> F<00:04:33.190> it's<00:04:33.850> definitely<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.810> good

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
version a good F it's definitely a good

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.110 
version a good F it's definitely a good
value<00:04:36.510> get<00:04:37.510> it's<00:04:37.660> nice<00:04:37.840> exclusive<00:04:38.200> energy

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
value get it's nice exclusive energy

value get it's nice exclusive energy
Joey<00:04:40.120> kinda<00:04:40.540> mini<00:04:40.720> further<00:04:40.990> alright<00:04:41.979> yeah

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
Joey kinda mini further alright yeah

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.070 
Joey kinda mini further alright yeah
basically<00:04:42.669> that's<00:04:43.240> pretty<00:04:43.570> much<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:43.870> this

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
basically that's pretty much it this

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.530 
basically that's pretty much it this
move<00:04:44.380> over<00:04:44.919> alternatives<00:04:45.669> for<00:04:45.850> this<00:04:46.030> set<00:04:46.300> will

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
move over alternatives for this set will

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.020 
move over alternatives for this set will
