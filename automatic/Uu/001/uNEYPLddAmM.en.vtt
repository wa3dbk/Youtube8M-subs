00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 when the yopal aqueduct worked 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.700
 his manager was paid a salary of 4 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.649
 million and a half pesos but now that 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.599
 does not work has a manager of 15 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.260
 millions and three consultants with a salary 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.470
 similar that is ready 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.940
 in May 2011 a heavy downpour caused 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.590
 a landslide that destroyed the plant 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.080
 water treatment yopal the 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.170
 structure collapsed because it was also 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.230
 about a geological fault 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.770
 the 150,000 inhabitants of yopal carry 2 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.290
 years and 4 months without water but I received 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.450
 the situation and had about 8 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.640
 months without having done absolutely nothing 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.160
 two weeks ago Water Company 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.949
 tried to supply the municipality with water 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.750
 of gorges in mountainous areas but 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.280
 the rains filled the sources of 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.559
 sediments and the company had to 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.809
 suspend the pumping again to avoid 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.930
 damage to the networks and add more than 12 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.720
 days in water we have dry tanks 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.699
 have passed 28 trials without water the little 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.949
 that the company supplies is not suitable 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.600
 for consumption and water that particular 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.239
 they extract from other parts to sell 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.330
 few can buy it buy a car 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.370
 tank is already worth 200 thousand pesos and that's not 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.229
 reaches for nothing by the crisis the 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.060
 last month of May the superintendence 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.650
 of public services intervened the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.170
 water and sewage company of 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.659
 yopal and appointed as special agent the 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.130
 economist constantino tamÃ­ jaimes esta 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.140
 It is a company that has been registering 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.549
 losses since 2008 officials from 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.200
 the mayor says that in addition to 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.600
 face the water crisis also 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.650
 has to draw more expenses for the 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.410
 arrival of the new 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.540
 of the aqueduct because apparently it wins 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.790
 twice as much as his predecessor the 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.130
 previously he earned 4 million 500 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.960
 thousand pesos the current manager wins 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.480
 about 16 million pesos the 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.400
 remunerations for fees and are 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.920
 15 million pesos the new manager 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.050
 says they are just figures because the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.760
 reality is another one up and all the 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.980
 decisions that I have social security 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.230
 apparently not the new manager as 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.480
 natural person has assimilated employee 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.610
 would provide social security on the 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.820
 40 percent of their salaries on 2 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.280
 cent to the fund of solidarity 12.5 a 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.750
 health 16 percent to pension and the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.320
 1.0 44 aarp with all this to the official 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.720
 it would reach 11 million 184 thousand 360 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.810
 monthly pesos instead to his predecessor 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.900
 with contributions would be 4 million 100 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.540
 thousand pesos let's say that in net terms 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.310
 I get the same as what comes to the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.709
 previous manager but according to the accounts 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.350
 I would be receiving monthly 6 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.019
 million 518 thousand pesos more than his 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.440
 predecessor besides the official we 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.380
 I arrive 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.790
 it is good to notice that the 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.370
 superintendence of public services 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.650
 domiciliary has also facilitated three 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.630
 high quality professionals with the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.030
 purpose of advising and accompanying me 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.940
 in let's say in the work that we come for 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.890
 rescue and maintain the company in 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.540
 operation is the assigned municipality 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.550
 to four million five hundred thousand pesos a 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.770
 product management today has to 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.750
 duplicate it to the new manager and 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.900
 assign new resources to three consultants 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.200
 rarely have the oversight 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.070
 intervened we know that your fees are 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.810
 high but there is already a technical table of the 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.020
 citizenship is doing 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.690
 follow-up to the intervention and they already 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.790
 they have notified that situation to 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.170
 control organisms the annoyance is 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.120
 Mayor for City Hall Officials 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.040
 because they assure that the new 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.230
 responsible for the aqueduct have not 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.760
 brought nothing new to what was already 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.520
 advancing the administration we have 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.590
 come doing the follow-up to the 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.240
 construction of the treatment plant 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.250
 of drinking water when the 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.780
 solutions then the superintendence 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.140
 assumes the management of dams and parents 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.930
 what 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.580
 that is not correct but good is 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.160
 a decision that we have respected the 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.209
 previous administration of the aqueduct 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.550
 started the construction of this plant 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.650
 modular that will partially supply 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.550
 water to citizens but will deliver it 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.380
 the new manager 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.690
 and meanwhile yopal will continue paying 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.690
 for the aqueduct that does not supply it with water
