under all this ash huh whoa hey its
pocket<00:00:52.110> gopher<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:52.920> she<00:00:53.309> survived<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
pocket gopher if she survived the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.790 
pocket gopher if she survived the
blasters<00:00:54.480> hope<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.899> others<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.559> well

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
blasters hope that others have as well

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.099 
blasters hope that others have as well
that<00:00:56.699> means<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.210> forest<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.719> start<00:00:57.989> its

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that means the forest can start its

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.830 
that means the forest can start its
natural<00:00:58.680> succession<00:00:59.210> it'll<00:01:00.210> take<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> while<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
natural succession it'll take a while to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.299 
natural succession it'll take a while to
grow<00:01:00.960> back<00:01:01.230> but<00:01:01.500> I've<00:01:01.620> seen<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.010> sort<00:01:02.190> of

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
grow back but I've seen this sort of

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.490

as<00:01:36.360> well

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
as well

recolonizing<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.060> area<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.600> appear<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.080> be

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
recolonizing the area and appear to be

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.620 
recolonizing the area and appear to be
thriving<00:01:43.500> off<00:01:43.830> these<00:01:44.040> plants<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.700> also<00:01:45.299> see

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
thriving off these plants I also see

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.870 
thriving off these plants I also see
some<00:01:45.659> traces<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.380> deer<00:01:46.800> mice<00:01:46.979> each<00:01:47.580> one<00:01:47.850> of

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
some traces of deer mice each one of

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.790 
some traces of deer mice each one of
these<00:01:48.030> small<00:01:48.360> species<00:01:48.720> helps<00:01:49.229> another<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
these small species helps another to

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.690 
these small species helps another to
return<00:01:51.350> all<00:01:52.350> these<00:01:52.920> bugs<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.369> kind<00:01:53.580> of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
return all these bugs are kind of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.880 
return all these bugs are kind of
creeping<00:01:54.090> me<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.990> their<00:01:55.259> food<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:55.800> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
creeping me out but their food for the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:07.969 
creeping me out but their food for the
animals<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.550> that's<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.030> good<00:01:57.210> thing<00:02:06.470> dad<00:02:07.470> dad

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
animals and that's a good thing dad dad

hey<00:02:08.300> watch<00:02:09.300> where<00:02:09.569> you're<00:02:09.750> stepping<00:02:10.320> kid<00:02:10.649> did

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
hey watch where you're stepping kid did

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.580 
hey watch where you're stepping kid did
you<00:02:11.430> see<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.510> took<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.780> lot<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:12.989> years<00:02:13.320> for

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
you see that it took a lot of years for

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.199 
you see that it took a lot of years for
this<00:02:13.680> ecosystem<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.430> build<00:02:14.730> support<00:02:14.940> for

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
this ecosystem to build support for

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.810 
this ecosystem to build support for
animals<00:02:15.810> as<00:02:15.989> large<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.650> elk<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.280> didn't

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
animals as large as that elk I didn't

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.970 
animals as large as that elk I didn't
think<00:02:17.970> anything<00:02:18.540> survived<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.410> volcano

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
think anything survived the volcano

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.520 
think anything survived the volcano
actually<00:02:20.850> in<00:02:21.060> some<00:02:21.300> areas<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> small<00:02:22.170> number<00:02:22.500> of

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
actually in some areas a small number of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.470 
actually in some areas a small number of
plants<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.160> animals<00:02:23.250> did<00:02:23.700> survive<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.269> blast

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
plants and animals did survive the blast

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.199 
plants and animals did survive the blast
and<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.530> because<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.010> those<00:02:26.250> survivors<00:02:26.790> that

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
and it's because of those survivors that

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.090 
and it's because of those survivors that
this<00:02:27.540> forest<00:02:27.930> has<00:02:28.110> grown<00:02:28.170> back<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.800> what<00:02:28.950> we

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
this forest has grown back to what we

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.170 
this forest has grown back to what we
see<00:02:29.310> now<00:02:29.519> what<00:02:30.330> about<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.720> rock<00:02:31.040> hey<00:02:32.040> did<00:02:33.030> it

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
see now what about this rock hey did it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.880 
see now what about this rock hey did it
survive<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.630> blast<00:02:35.390> definitely<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:37.200> course<00:02:37.620> I

never<00:02:53.610> seen<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> rock<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.690> glass<00:02:54.900> bowl

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
never seen a rock and a glass bowl

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.590 
never seen a rock and a glass bowl
before<00:02:57.980> natural<00:02:58.980> succession<00:02:59.489> is<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.030> process

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
before natural succession is the process

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600 
before natural succession is the process
of<00:03:00.750> disturbed<00:03:01.230> land<00:03:01.590> returning<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.579> a

there were some regions where plants and

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.400 
there were some regions where plants and

called land reclamation just like the

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.100 
called land reclamation just like the
forests<00:04:03.400> at<00:04:03.490> Mount<00:04:03.700> st.<00:04:03.910> Helens<00:04:03.940> but<00:04:04.930> with

reclamation<00:04:10.000> stuff<00:04:10.930> I<00:04:11.230> wouldn't<00:04:11.980> be

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
reclamation stuff I wouldn't be

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.260 
reclamation stuff I wouldn't be
surprised<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.940> see<00:04:12.970> him<00:04:13.800> whoa<00:04:14.800> Kevin<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:16.060> looks

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.390 
surprised to see him whoa Kevin it looks
like<00:04:16.360> 10<00:04:16.720> years<00:04:17.080> is<00:04:17.290> a<00:04:17.320> lot<00:04:17.530> more<00:04:17.590> time<00:04:18.100> for<00:04:18.370> a

soil vegetation water and Wildlife at
the<00:04:28.060> site<00:04:28.300> we<00:04:28.660> can<00:04:28.840> start<00:04:29.050> writing<00:04:29.290> the

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
the site we can start writing the

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.160 
the site we can start writing the
reclamation<00:04:29.770> plan<00:04:30.280> well<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.420> first<00:04:31.690> step<00:04:31.810> is

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
reclamation plan well the first step is

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.590 
reclamation plan well the first step is
saving<00:04:32.590> all<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:33.010> topsoil<00:04:33.280> so<00:04:34.000> we<00:04:34.120> can<00:04:34.270> reuse

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
saving all the topsoil so we can reuse

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.990 
saving all the topsoil so we can reuse
it<00:04:34.630> it's<00:04:35.170> chock<00:04:35.500> full<00:04:35.770> of<00:04:35.800> seeds<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.610> rootlets

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
it it's chock full of seeds and rootlets

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.120 
it it's chock full of seeds and rootlets
that'll<00:04:37.450> help<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.810> area<00:04:38.110> grow<00:04:38.350> back<00:04:38.530> faster

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
that'll help the area grow back faster

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.040 
that'll help the area grow back faster
and<00:04:39.340> in<00:04:39.790> two<00:04:39.970> years<00:04:40.000> once<00:04:40.750> they're<00:04:40.930> done

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
and in two years once they're done

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.410 
and in two years once they're done
mining<00:04:41.500> we'll<00:04:41.830> put<00:04:42.070> that<00:04:42.100> top<00:04:42.490> soil<00:04:42.790> back<00:04:43.090> to

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
mining we'll put that top soil back to

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.870 
mining we'll put that top soil back to
