00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
really do want this device but let me

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.049 
really do want this device but let me
just<00:00:40.710> go<00:00:41.040> ahead<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.280> talk<00:00:41.489> about<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.850> specs

just go ahead and talk about the specs

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.479 
just go ahead and talk about the specs
and<00:00:42.270> features<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.750> advice<00:00:43.050> anyways<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.190> it

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
and features as advice anyways so it

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.630 
and features as advice anyways so it
will<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:45.200> it's<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.829> LG<00:00:47.100> optimus<00:00:47.129> g

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
will be it's it's like the LG optimus g

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.130 
will be it's it's like the LG optimus g
pro<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:48.090> pretty<00:00:48.360> much<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.570> exact<00:00:48.960> same

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
pro it's pretty much the exact same

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.139 
pro it's pretty much the exact same
thing<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.530> has<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> bit<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.160> spec<00:00:50.489> changes<00:00:50.969> here

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
thing it has a bit of spec changes here

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.299 
thing it has a bit of spec changes here
and<00:00:51.180> there<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.930> one<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> biggest<00:00:53.010> things

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and there so one of the biggest things

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
and there so one of the biggest things
it's<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.760> now<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.660> 5<00:00:54.930> inch<00:00:54.960> frame<00:00:55.440> so

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
it's that now it's in a 5 inch frame so

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680 
it's that now it's in a 5 inch frame so
smaller<00:00:56.100> screen<00:00:56.489> size<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> screen<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
smaller screen size but the screen is

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.689 
smaller screen size but the screen is
still<00:00:57.960> 1080p<00:00:58.649> screen<00:00:58.980> actually<00:00:59.190> its<00:00:59.430> exact

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
still 1080p screen actually its exact

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.420 
still 1080p screen actually its exact
same<00:00:59.850> screen<00:01:00.180> size<00:01:00.379> just<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.620> smaller<00:01:01.980> frame

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
same screen size just in a smaller frame

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.710 
same screen size just in a smaller frame
basically<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.739> 1080p<00:01:05.400> screen<00:01:05.820> 440

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
basically and it's a 1080p screen 440

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.530 
basically and it's a 1080p screen 440
PPI<00:01:07.020> full<00:01:07.530> HD<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.159> an<00:01:08.310> IPS<00:01:08.820> panel<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
PPI full HD it's an IPS panel so it's a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.810 
PPI full HD it's an IPS panel so it's a
pretty<00:01:09.689> good<00:01:09.930> screen<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.490> there

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
pretty good screen that you have there

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.149 
pretty good screen that you have there
but<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.540> does<00:01:12.750> not<00:01:12.990> compare<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.830> samsung

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
but it does not compare to the samsung

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.160 
but it does not compare to the samsung
galaxy<00:01:14.369> s4<00:01:15.119> screen<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.659> course<00:01:15.930> i'm<00:01:16.049> going

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
galaxy s4 screen and of course i'm going

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.450 
galaxy s4 screen and of course i'm going
to<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.320> comparing<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.040> because<00:01:17.189> that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
to be comparing it to that because that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.870 
to be comparing it to that because that
is<00:01:17.640> kind<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.570> korea<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.700> samsung<00:01:20.700> is

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
is kind of this is korea and samsung is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.210 
is kind of this is korea and samsung is
pretty<00:01:21.119> much<00:01:21.240> most<00:01:21.540> dominant<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.380> korea<00:01:22.950> there

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
pretty much most dominant in korea there

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.240 
pretty much most dominant in korea there
so<00:01:23.759> i<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.439> guys<00:01:25.619> would<00:01:25.920> even

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
so i don't know if you guys would even

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.219 
so i don't know if you guys would even
think<00:01:26.520> about<00:01:26.820> purchasing<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.420> Optimus<00:01:27.960> GK

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
think about purchasing the Optimus GK

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.160 
think about purchasing the Optimus GK
over<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> galaxy<00:01:29.220> s4<00:01:29.759> maybe<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.630> aspect

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
over the galaxy s4 maybe one aspect

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.140 
over the galaxy s4 maybe one aspect
would<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.530> designed<00:01:31.890> because<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.820> design<00:01:33.119> of

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
would be designed because the design of

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.980 
would be designed because the design of
the<00:01:33.450> GK<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.610> arguably<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.820> some<00:01:36.030> people's<00:01:36.360> mind

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the GK is arguably in some people's mind

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.410 
the GK is arguably in some people's mind
better<00:01:37.470> than<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.920> galaxy<00:01:38.280> s4's<00:01:38.430> anyways

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
better than the galaxy s4's anyways

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.350 
better than the galaxy s4's anyways
there's<00:01:39.659> also<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.439> 1.7<00:01:41.369> gigahertz<00:01:41.610> Snapdragon

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
there's also a 1.7 gigahertz Snapdragon

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.319 
there's also a 1.7 gigahertz Snapdragon
600<00:01:42.899> CPU<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.530> par<00:01:43.890> with<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.130> galaxy<00:01:44.610> s4's<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
600 CPU on par with the galaxy s4's and

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.300 
600 CPU on par with the galaxy s4's and
this<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:45.899> also<00:01:46.049> has<00:01:46.170> two<00:01:46.470> gigabytes<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> RAM

like<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.970> said<00:01:48.030> specs<00:01:48.600> are<00:01:48.840> pretty<00:01:49.229> much

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
like I said specs are pretty much

similar<00:01:49.710> all<00:01:50.220> around<00:01:51.590> just<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.710> screen<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.130> the

similar all around just a screen of the
galaxy<00:01:53.820> s4<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> bit<00:01:54.720> better<00:01:54.930> because<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.530> is

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
galaxy s4 is a bit better because it is

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.039 
galaxy s4 is a bit better because it is
super<00:01:55.920> amoled<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.149> again<00:01:57.450> comes<00:01:57.750> out<00:01:57.899> to

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
super amoled but that again comes out to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.660 
super amoled but that again comes out to
personal<00:01:58.500> preference<00:01:58.710> because<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.250> AMOLED

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
personal preference because the AMOLED

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.780 
personal preference because the AMOLED
gives<00:01:59.969> more<00:02:00.799> vibrant<00:02:01.799> kind<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.340> tweaked

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.270 
gives more vibrant kind of tweaked
artificial<00:02:03.750> looking<00:02:03.869> colors<00:02:04.290> whereas<00:02:04.649> an<00:02:04.799> IPS

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
artificial looking colors whereas an IPS

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.389 
artificial looking colors whereas an IPS
display<00:02:05.670> will<00:02:06.119> give<00:02:06.299> more<00:02:06.540> natural<00:02:07.079> colors<00:02:07.409> so

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
display will give more natural colors so

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.499 
display will give more natural colors so
that's<00:02:08.610> also<00:02:08.910> something<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.239> keep<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.450> mind

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
that's also something to keep in mind

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170
