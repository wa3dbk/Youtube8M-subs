00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.160
 personal hello all right here fÃ¡bio more 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.690
 once of the 10 products and when you 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.580
 It's very well, we always show the 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.030
 best products on the planet 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.640
 good people are always very interesting 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.070
 I speak this and some things 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.140
 There is very important here for you. 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.570
 mainly linked to the best 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.600
 products and it's something that I 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.680
 I would like to talk to you now about 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.770
 the springbooks 22.10 we are very 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.640
 well as the debt life cycle is 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.019
 becoming shorter and shorter. 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.070
 they are always launching models 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.900
 new 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.940
 so always when you go think 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.120
 in asking for some product being Spanish 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.100
 and 2.0 whenever I launch some 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.780
 video and show you guys, do not delay 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.700
 much because many people talk without 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.220
 You've done that video for two or 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.880
 three weeks ago and then I went to ask 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.120
 model and I no longer had this good model 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:30.310
 personnel because with the staff always 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.880
 person always asks enough then is the 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.400
 adidas also makes a recycling come on 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.880
 say so of models so that they do not 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.560
 so be very much the same 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.860
 because like that, that's 65 let's say 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.900
 So it 's being too short so you 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.170
 You have to be quick to apply for 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.570
 I then I'll show these at the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.200
 people who already see this video here 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.150
 now be very attentive because of 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.910
 You'll suddenly see this video and it's over. 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.610
 I'm going to talk to the person you're talking to. 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.099

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.750
 you do not miss the next models to 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.300

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.560
 I'll show you there 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.640

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.970

 the ladies are seeing a lot more 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.640
 is brighter than the previous ones. 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.850
 making the modifications well accented 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.800
 in visual materials and is not a visual 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.709
 well draws a lot of attention on what he 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.440
 called here is quite flash flame quite 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.870
 Attention continues to be a sneaker that 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.500
 seduces everyone, because the 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.660
 finish is exceptional the 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.090
 details and live if you see the 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.190
 alive is still much more beautiful than 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.400
 For the video, the video is pretty. 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.950
 imagine live and I see it here really 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.019

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.769
 There's this model, let me get the 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:27.170

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.790
 Brindle here looks all're rubberized 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:51.650

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.489
 dark orange 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.870
 always remembering the laws made of 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:06.019
 polyurethane stitching super well finished 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.220
 here the rubber was more I do not think 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:12.410
 It would be a good one here. 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.790
 register with two colors reminding that 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.010
 he always comes only with this register 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.560
 do not see how others have two 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.260

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:26.570
