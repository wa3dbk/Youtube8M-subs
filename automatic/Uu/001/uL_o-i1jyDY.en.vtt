00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
alcohol beers you use less malt extract

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.580 
alcohol beers you use less malt extract
for<00:00:45.390> heavier<00:00:45.930> more<00:00:46.770> flavorful<00:00:47.520> beers<00:00:48.379> you<00:00:49.379> use

for heavier more flavorful beers you use

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.229 
for heavier more flavorful beers you use
more<00:00:51.980> for<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.129> step<00:00:53.399> we're<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> bit<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
more for this step we're a bit on the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.650 
more for this step we're a bit on the
high<00:00:54.390> side<00:00:55.579> but<00:00:56.579> that's<00:00:56.730> okay<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.149> we

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
high side but that's okay because we

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.710 
high side but that's okay because we
want<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.020> nice<00:00:58.370> heavy<00:01:00.469> flavorful<00:01:01.469> style<00:01:05.720> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
want a nice heavy flavorful style and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.539 
want a nice heavy flavorful style and
that's<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.590> malt<00:01:07.860> extract<00:01:08.369> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that's what all this malt extract is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.670 
that's what all this malt extract is
going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:08.970> us<00:01:11.810> we've<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.260> more<00:01:13.290> bag

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
going to get us we've got one more bag

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.950 
going to get us we've got one more bag
to<00:01:13.710> add<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.610> we'll<00:01:15.450> go<00:01:15.630> ahead<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
to add in here we'll go ahead and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.910 
to add in here we'll go ahead and
thoroughly<00:01:16.530> stir<00:01:16.950> our<00:01:17.250> malt<00:01:18.240> extract<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:19.049> this

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
thoroughly stir our malt extract in this

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.940 
thoroughly stir our malt extract in this
is<00:01:20.159> dry<00:01:20.490> malt<00:01:20.729> extract<00:01:21.350> you'll<00:01:22.350> also<00:01:22.590> see

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
is dry malt extract you'll also see

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.770 
is dry malt extract you'll also see
another<00:01:23.250> form<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.729> malt<00:01:24.000> extract<00:01:24.509> called

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
another form of malt extract called

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.010 
another form of malt extract called
liquid<00:01:25.200> malt<00:01:25.380> extract<00:01:26.330> there's<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> lot<00:01:27.869> of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
liquid malt extract there's not a lot of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.530 
liquid malt extract there's not a lot of
difference<00:01:28.380> between<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.979> two<00:01:29.329> dry<00:01:30.329> malt

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
difference between the two dry malt

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.590 
difference between the two dry malt
extract<00:01:30.630> has<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.290> tendency<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.829> float<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
extract has a tendency to float on the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
extract has a tendency to float on the
top<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.840> bit<00:01:34.229> more<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.070> when<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.400> add<00:01:35.430> our

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
top a little bit more so when we add our

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.760 
top a little bit more so when we add our
dry<00:01:35.729> malt<00:01:36.180> extract<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.350> stir<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
dry malt extract we just have to stir it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.640 
dry malt extract we just have to stir it
on<00:01:37.920> down<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:38.579> real<00:01:39.270> thoroughly<00:01:39.869> until

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
on down in there real thoroughly until

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.310 
on down in there real thoroughly until
all<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.979> chunks<00:01:41.189> break<00:01:41.610> up<00:01:42.320> traditionally

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
all the chunks break up traditionally

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.310 
all the chunks break up traditionally
any<00:01:43.799> brewer<00:01:44.189> would<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.149> take<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> sugars

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
any brewer would have to take the sugars

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.940 
any brewer would have to take the sugars
that<00:01:46.560> are<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.829> our<00:01:46.860> malt<00:01:47.640> extract<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.950> extract

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that are in our malt extract and extract

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.190 
that are in our malt extract and extract
them<00:01:50.220> from<00:01:50.399> malted<00:01:50.970> barley<00:01:51.180> through<00:01:52.079> a

them from malted barley through a
complicated<00:01:52.439> process<00:01:53.100> called<00:01:53.610> mashing<00:01:54.240> malt

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
complicated process called mashing malt

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.130 
complicated process called mashing malt
extract<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.799> made<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.219> home<00:01:56.399> brewers<00:01:56.790> in

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
extract is made for home brewers in

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.280

small commercial breweries in you the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.130 
small commercial breweries in you the
use<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.500> malt<00:02:01.920> extract<00:02:02.460> allows<00:02:02.820> them<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.329> forgo

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
use of malt extract allows them to forgo

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.039 
use of malt extract allows them to forgo
the<00:02:04.350> mashing<00:02:04.799> process<00:02:05.479> just<00:02:06.479> add<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.719> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
the mashing process just add it and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.249 
the mashing process just add it and
you're<00:02:07.860> done<00:02:08.660> makes<00:02:09.660> things<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.050> lot<00:02:10.200> easier

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
you're done makes things a lot easier

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.610 
you're done makes things a lot easier
