00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
the ones that had the gospel so we had

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.059 
the ones that had the gospel so we had
to<00:00:51.460> trust<00:00:51.819> the<00:00:52.120> priests<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:53.469> was<00:00:53.710> our<00:00:53.829> first

Protestant Reformation

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.899 
Protestant Reformation
we<00:00:59.469> got<00:00:59.679> another<00:00:59.979> standard<00:01:00.429> we<00:01:00.550> could<00:01:00.699> trust

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
we got another standard we could trust

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.029 
we got another standard we could trust
them<00:01:01.089> priests<00:01:01.449> or<00:01:01.870> we<00:01:02.079> could<00:01:02.260> trust<00:01:02.589> the

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
them priests or we could trust the

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.630 
them priests or we could trust the
preachers<00:01:03.609> so<00:01:04.390> there<00:01:04.659> was<00:01:04.930> a<00:01:05.409> transition<00:01:06.250> from

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
preachers so there was a transition from

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.880 
preachers so there was a transition from
just<00:01:07.030> trusting<00:01:07.509> priests<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:08.469> being<00:01:08.680> able<00:01:08.770> to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
just trusting priests to being able to

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.209

trust priests and preachers now of
course<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.670> was<00:01:12.820> a<00:01:12.850> great<00:01:13.360> huge<00:01:13.780> step<00:01:14.259> it<00:01:14.500> was

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
course that was a great huge step it was

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.050 
course that was a great huge step it was
a<00:01:14.649> shattering<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.189> a<00:01:15.219> paradigm<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.820> say<00:01:16.000> you

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
a shattering of a paradigm to say you

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.940 
a shattering of a paradigm to say you
know<00:01:16.270> what<00:01:16.479> we're<00:01:17.079> not<00:01:17.110> gonna<00:01:17.320> trust<00:01:17.590> just<00:01:17.860> the
