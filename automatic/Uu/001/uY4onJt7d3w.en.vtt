00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.869 

all<00:01:01.140> right<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.890> hopefully<00:01:02.430> or<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.699> least

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
all right so hopefully or at least

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.119 
all right so hopefully or at least
somewhat<00:01:03.570> intrigued<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.470> how<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.680> works

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
somewhat intrigued as to how that works

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.510 
somewhat intrigued as to how that works
so<00:01:06.020> here<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.350> our<00:01:07.619> vending<00:01:07.979> machine<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
so here we have our vending machine and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.700 
so here we have our vending machine and
unlike<00:01:09.240> ones<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> past<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.290> actually

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
unlike ones in the past it was actually

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.490 
unlike ones in the past it was actually
made<00:01:10.890> using<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> piston<00:01:11.820> mod<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.299> seem<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.320> be

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
made using the piston mod I seem to be

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.039 
made using the piston mod I seem to be
sort<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.460> fan<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.630> can't<00:01:15.840> tell

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
sort of a fan of that if you can't tell

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.380 
sort of a fan of that if you can't tell
anyway<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.920> can't<00:01:17.490> wait<00:01:17.549> till<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:17.880> actually

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
anyway I can't wait till it's actually

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.320 
anyway I can't wait till it's actually
implemented<00:01:19.170> into<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> vanilla<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.369> that's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
implemented into the vanilla but that's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.480 
implemented into the vanilla but that's
for<00:01:21.539> another<00:01:21.600> day<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.229> now<00:01:22.350> um<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.039> guess<00:01:23.250> I'll

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
for another day for now um I guess I'll

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.999 
for another day for now um I guess I'll
explain<00:01:23.940> how<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.869> actually<00:01:25.049> works<00:01:25.470> starting

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
explain how it actually works starting

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.039 
explain how it actually works starting
from<00:01:26.399> where<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.789> hit<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> button<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.930> I'll

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
from where you hit the button so I'll

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.359 
from where you hit the button so I'll
start<00:01:28.289> off<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.649> bacon<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
start off with the bacon because the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.070 
start off with the bacon because the
bacon<00:01:29.490> actually<00:01:30.030> corresponds<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.840> first

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
bacon actually corresponds to this first

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.980 
bacon actually corresponds to this first
car<00:01:31.380> right<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.270> when<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.420> hit<00:01:33.569> the<00:01:33.690> bacon

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
car right here so when you hit the bacon

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.480 
car right here so when you hit the bacon
button<00:01:34.259> or<00:01:34.409> any<00:01:34.800> of<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> buttons<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.340> that

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
button or any of the buttons for that

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.240 
button or any of the buttons for that
matter<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.479> triggers<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> redstone<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
matter it triggers the redstone on the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.399 
matter it triggers the redstone on the
other<00:01:38.399> side<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.360> basically<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.840> goes<00:01:40.229> on

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
other side and it basically just goes on

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.070 
other side and it basically just goes on
up<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.800> it'll<00:01:41.460> hit<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> piston<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
up and it'll hit the piston and the

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.600 
up and it'll hit the piston and the
piston<00:01:43.259> even<00:01:43.830> though<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.039> a<00:01:44.100> block<00:01:44.310> above

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
piston even though it's a block above

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.370 
piston even though it's a block above
the<00:01:44.729> cart<00:01:44.970> will<00:01:45.240> actually<00:01:45.750> push<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.170> cart

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the cart will actually push the cart

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.889 
the cart will actually push the cart
which<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.580> very<00:01:47.909> handy<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.690> we're

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
which is very very handy because we're

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.899 
which is very very handy because we're
it<00:01:48.990> down<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:50.009> would<00:01:50.190> actually<00:01:50.369> destroy

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
it down here it would actually destroy

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.440 
it down here it would actually destroy
the<00:01:50.940> track<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.960> would<00:01:52.289> not<00:01:52.500> work<00:01:53.450> so

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the track and that would not work so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.990 
the track and that would not work so
let's<00:01:54.600> hit<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.810> button<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.819> then<00:01:56.819> we'll

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
let's hit the button and then we'll

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.609 
let's hit the button and then we'll
watch<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.479> next<00:01:57.659> part<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.289> push<00:01:58.470> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
watch the next part so just push the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.160 
watch the next part so just push the
cart<00:01:58.830> out<00:01:58.979> then<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.030> follows<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.539> path<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
cart out then it follows this path and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.560 
cart out then it follows this path and
it<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.860> drops<00:02:02.069> into<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.580> pickup<00:02:03.299> area<00:02:03.649> cool

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
it just drops into the pickup area cool

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.840 
it just drops into the pickup area cool
and<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.869> pick<00:02:07.289> up<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:07.560> items<00:02:07.890> if<00:02:08.729> we

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
and then you pick up your items if we

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.350 
and then you pick up your items if we
want<00:02:09.030> some<00:02:09.209> pork<00:02:09.420> shop<00:02:10.370> omnomnom<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.820> have<00:02:12.150> full

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
want some pork shop omnomnom I have full

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.110 
want some pork shop omnomnom I have full
health<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:13.410> doesn't<00:02:13.769> matter<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.160> then<00:02:14.880> when

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
health it doesn't matter and then when

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.210 
health it doesn't matter and then when
you<00:02:15.209> hit<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.390> cart<00:02:15.600> return<00:02:15.870> all<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.769> does<00:02:16.980> is

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
you hit the cart return all it does is

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.890 
you hit the cart return all it does is
trigger<00:02:17.640> some<00:02:17.910> redstone<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.480> goes<00:02:18.630> under

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
trigger some redstone that goes under

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.840 
trigger some redstone that goes under
the<00:02:19.019> wall<00:02:19.230> back<00:02:19.799> over<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:20.250> piston<00:02:20.670> over

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
the wall back over to this piston over

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.120 
the wall back over to this piston over
here<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.209> pushes<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.750> back<00:02:22.070> now<00:02:23.070> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
here and that pushes it back now the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.000 
here and that pushes it back now the
first<00:02:23.400> one<00:02:23.609> is<00:02:23.730> easy<00:02:23.850> because<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:25.010> doesn't

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
first one is easy because it doesn't

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.280 
first one is easy because it doesn't
have<00:02:26.130> any<00:02:26.269> track<00:02:27.269> switches<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.079> need<00:02:28.200> to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
have any track switches that you need to

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.620 
have any track switches that you need to
go<00:02:28.380> through<00:02:28.650> however<00:02:29.000> let's<00:02:30.000> take<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.329> second

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
go through however let's take the second

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.690 
go through however let's take the second
one<00:02:30.780> for<00:02:31.170> example<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.859> don't<00:02:32.130> know<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:32.489> want

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
one for example I don't know we want

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.900 
one for example I don't know we want
cookies<00:02:33.329> or<00:02:33.630> we<00:02:34.560> want<00:02:34.739> some<00:02:34.920> bread<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.730> if<00:02:35.790> we

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
cookies or we want some bread so if we

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.599 
cookies or we want some bread so if we
want<00:02:36.090> some<00:02:36.239> bread<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.769> push<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
want some bread we have to push the

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:39.800 
want some bread we have to push the
switch<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.120> initial<00:02:39.420> part<00:02:39.630> works

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
switch the initial part works

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.780 
switch the initial part works
identically<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.950> other<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.370> has<00:02:41.670> a

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
identically to the other it has a

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.060 
identically to the other it has a
booster<00:02:42.269> here<00:02:42.480> however<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:43.230> keep<00:02:43.410> up<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.890> cart

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
booster here however to keep up the cart

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.130 
booster here however to keep up the cart
speed<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.609> that<00:02:44.640> in<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.510> end<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.750> doesn't<00:02:45.900> just

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
speed so that in the end it doesn't just

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.229 
speed so that in the end it doesn't just
stall<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.829> edge<00:02:47.040> it'll<00:02:47.250> always<00:02:47.400> fall<00:02:47.880> into

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
stall on the edge it'll always fall into

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.289 
stall on the edge it'll always fall into
the<00:02:48.359> dispensing<00:02:49.170> area<00:02:49.440> however<00:02:49.890> if<00:02:50.400> we<00:02:51.090> want

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
the dispensing area however if we want

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.470 
the dispensing area however if we want
it<00:02:51.359> to<00:02:51.390> push<00:02:51.660> back<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.890> see<00:02:53.100> we<00:02:53.250> have<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:54.120> little

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
it to push back you see we have a little

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.340 
it to push back you see we have a little
bit<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.690> an<00:02:54.750> issue<00:02:54.930> here

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
bit of an issue here

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.770 
bit of an issue here
because<00:02:55.829> this<00:02:56.010> track<00:02:56.430> curves<00:02:57.060> inward<00:02:57.420> and

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
because this track curves inward and

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.050 
because this track curves inward and
we're<00:02:58.560> we<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.769> push<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.190> right<00:02:59.400> now<00:02:59.549> it

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
we're we to push it in right now it

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.670 
we're we to push it in right now it
would<00:03:00.209> actually<00:03:00.660> go<00:03:00.810> back<00:03:00.989> up<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.440> where<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
would actually go back up to where the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.039 
would actually go back up to where the
bacon<00:03:02.010> was<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.850> we<00:03:02.940> don't<00:03:03.090> want<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.420> clearly

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
bacon was and we don't want that clearly

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.640 
bacon was and we don't want that clearly
so<00:03:05.209> that's<00:03:06.209> what<00:03:06.450> these<00:03:06.600> switches<00:03:06.959> are<00:03:07.079> for<00:03:07.290> so

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
so that's what these switches are for so

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.289 
so that's what these switches are for so
actually<00:03:07.979> the<00:03:08.100> first<00:03:08.220> switch<00:03:08.519> here<00:03:08.760> has<00:03:09.120> no

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
actually the first switch here has no

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.879 
actually the first switch here has no
effect<00:03:09.630> it's<00:03:09.900> just<00:03:10.109> there<00:03:10.290> for<00:03:10.470> aesthetics

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
effect it's just there for aesthetics

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.670 
effect it's just there for aesthetics
however<00:03:11.280> when<00:03:12.150> we<00:03:12.299> switch<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:12.780> one

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
however when we switch this one

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.530 
however when we switch this one
excuse<00:03:14.040> me<00:03:14.159> let<00:03:14.310> me<00:03:14.340> uh<00:03:14.430> stop<00:03:14.909> the<00:03:15.060> time<00:03:15.269> really

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
excuse me let me uh stop the time really

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.369 
excuse me let me uh stop the time really
quick<00:03:15.980> when<00:03:16.980> we<00:03:17.129> flip<00:03:17.609> this<00:03:17.790> switch<00:03:18.109> we<00:03:19.109> can<00:03:19.140> go

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
quick when we flip this switch we can go

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.679 
quick when we flip this switch we can go
back<00:03:19.560> over<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.370> track<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.150> you'll<00:03:21.480> notice

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:21.689 
back over to the track and you'll notice

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.920 
back over to the track and you'll notice
it's<00:03:22.109> actually<00:03:22.709> done<00:03:22.859> a<00:03:22.920> little<00:03:23.189> switcheroo

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
it's actually done a little switcheroo

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.160 
it's actually done a little switcheroo
so<00:03:24.930> we<00:03:25.620> can<00:03:26.099> go<00:03:26.579> in<00:03:26.760> here<00:03:28.219> return<00:03:29.219> the<00:03:29.370> cart<00:03:29.579> and

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
so we can go in here return the cart and

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.080 
so we can go in here return the cart and
it'll<00:03:31.170> actually<00:03:31.349> skip<00:03:32.129> over<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.760> second

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
it'll actually skip over to the second

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.699 
it'll actually skip over to the second
one<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.359> go<00:03:33.810> right<00:03:33.989> back<00:03:34.019> up<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.409> where<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.680> was

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
one and go right back up to where it was

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.750 
one and go right back up to where it was
before<00:03:34.969> fairly<00:03:35.969> simple<00:03:36.980> now<00:03:37.980> actually<00:03:38.489> see

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
before fairly simple now actually see

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.089 
before fairly simple now actually see
how<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.389> little<00:03:39.659> section<00:03:40.170> works<00:03:40.530> down<00:03:40.889> there

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
how that little section works down there

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.670 
how that little section works down there
let<00:03:41.459> me<00:03:41.900> take<00:03:42.900> ourselves<00:03:43.049> into<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
let me take ourselves into the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.659 
let me take ourselves into the
underbelly<00:03:44.099> and<00:03:44.569> it's<00:03:45.569> fairly<00:03:45.959> simple<00:03:46.379> um<00:03:47.069> if

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
underbelly and it's fairly simple um if

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:48.949 
underbelly and it's fairly simple um if
it<00:03:47.819> was<00:03:47.909> a<00:03:47.939> lot<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.209> guessing<00:03:48.510> Czech<00:03:48.750> work

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
it was a lot of guessing Czech work

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.990 
it was a lot of guessing Czech work
because<00:03:49.319> I<00:03:49.530> basically<00:03:50.010> just<00:03:50.310> had<00:03:50.639> to<00:03:50.790> place

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
because I basically just had to place

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.899 
because I basically just had to place
the<00:03:51.209> repeaters<00:03:51.689> in<00:03:52.099> spots<00:03:53.099> so<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.459> it

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
the repeaters in spots so that it

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.940 
the repeaters in spots so that it
wouldn't<00:03:54.209> carry<00:03:54.840> on<00:03:55.019> over<00:03:55.319> to<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.530> next<00:03:55.560> one

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
wouldn't carry on over to the next one

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.619 
wouldn't carry on over to the next one
so<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:57.359> was<00:03:57.590> guessing<00:03:58.590> Czech<00:03:58.950> not<00:03:59.340> not<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.209> super

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
so it was guessing Czech not not a super

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.869 
so it was guessing Czech not not a super
fantastic<00:04:00.900> system<00:04:01.500> however<00:04:01.889> when<00:04:02.549> I<00:04:02.579> flipped

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
fantastic system however when I flipped

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.849 
fantastic system however when I flipped
that<00:04:03.000> switch<00:04:03.060> brings<00:04:04.049> the<00:04:04.169> current<00:04:04.439> down<00:04:04.560> here

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
that switch brings the current down here

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.009 
that switch brings the current down here
and<00:04:05.040> basically<00:04:05.819> it<00:04:06.150> just<00:04:06.180> applies<00:04:06.629> it<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.870> the

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
and basically it just applies it to the

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.190 
and basically it just applies it to the
one<00:04:07.379> switch<00:04:07.769> necessary<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.879> it<00:04:09.780> turns<00:04:10.049> on

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
one switch necessary and it turns on

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.990 
one switch necessary and it turns on
this<00:04:10.319> redstone<00:04:10.620> torch<00:04:11.040> which<00:04:11.280> flips<00:04:11.879> the

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
this redstone torch which flips the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.349 
this redstone torch which flips the
track<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:13.579> that's<00:04:14.579> basically<00:04:15.060> how<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.329> works

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
track and that's basically how it works

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.420 
track and that's basically how it works
then<00:04:15.780> when<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:15.930> hit<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.229> next<00:04:16.530> switch<00:04:17.160> over

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
then when I hit the next switch over

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.819 
then when I hit the next switch over
here<00:04:17.639> it'll<00:04:17.789> just<00:04:17.849> flip<00:04:18.419> two<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:18.720> them<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.139> so

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
here it'll just flip two of them and so

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.399 
here it'll just flip two of them and so
on<00:04:19.949> and<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.280> forth<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:20.669> theoretically<00:04:21.409> had

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
you the time in space you could continue

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.689 
you the time in space you could continue
this<00:04:24.930> on<00:04:25.110> backwards<00:04:25.740> as<00:04:25.979> long<00:04:26.159> as<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.430> wanted
