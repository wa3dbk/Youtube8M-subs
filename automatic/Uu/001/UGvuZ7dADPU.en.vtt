00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
beginning of the game I was worried for

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.740 
beginning of the game I was worried for
eg<00:00:22.859> because<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.580> game<00:00:23.760> was<00:00:23.789> going<00:00:24.180> very<00:00:24.210> slow

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
eg because the game was going very slow

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.130 
eg because the game was going very slow
nobody<00:00:25.680> had<00:00:25.859> made<00:00:26.039> any<00:00:26.310> moves<00:00:26.580> anywhere<00:00:26.939> and

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
nobody had made any moves anywhere and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.689 
nobody had made any moves anywhere and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
is this indecision though is it the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.319 
is this indecision though is it the
indecision<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> lack<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> synergy<00:01:42.299> that

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
indecision and the lack of synergy that

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.999 
indecision and the lack of synergy that
we're<00:01:42.540> seeing<00:01:42.750> bringing<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> two<00:01:43.860> new

we're seeing bringing in the two new

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.550 
we're seeing bringing in the two new
players<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.549> maybe<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:45.149> coming<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.259> ask

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.139 
players and maybe not coming to ask
quick<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.070> conclusion<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.759> needed<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
quick of a conclusion as they needed to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.639 
quick of a conclusion as they needed to
to<00:01:48.270> pick<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.540> fight<00:01:48.720> yeah<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:49.439> they

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
to pick that fight yeah I think they

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.200 
to pick that fight yeah I think they
needed<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.310> ones<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.640> were<00:01:50.820> acting

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
needed to be the ones that were acting

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.300 
needed to be the ones that were acting
on<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.420> they<00:01:51.570> had<00:01:51.780> an<00:01:52.079> advantage<00:01:52.979> in

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
on it they had an advantage in

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.740 
on it they had an advantage in
information<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.240> into<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.600> situation

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
information going into that situation

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.770 
information going into that situation
they<00:01:55.740> re<00:01:56.280> crossed<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.909> pink<00:01:57.149> ward<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.479> she

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
already mention though that pretty much

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.619 
already mention though that pretty much
the<00:02:26.830> entire<00:02:26.920> game<00:02:27.370> came<00:02:27.700> down<00:02:27.909> to<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.299> fight

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
the entire game came down to that fight

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.420 
the entire game came down to that fight
because<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.930> was<00:02:29.019> such<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.319> huge<00:02:29.620> swing<00:02:30.040> in<00:02:30.250> both

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
because it was such a huge swing in both

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.880 
because it was such a huge swing in both
momentum<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.120> gold<00:02:31.540> for<00:02:31.780> eg<00:02:32.110> they<00:02:32.560> pretty

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
momentum and gold for eg they pretty

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.619 
momentum and gold for eg they pretty
systematically<00:02:33.610> closed<00:02:33.879> it<00:02:34.060> out<00:02:34.150> which<00:02:34.420> was

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
systematically closed it out which was

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.509 
systematically closed it out which was
to<00:02:34.840> no<00:02:35.019> surprise<00:02:35.319> so<00:02:36.160> then<00:02:36.900> big<00:02:37.900> question<00:02:38.319> is

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
to no surprise so then big question is

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.740 
to no surprise so then big question is
what<00:02:39.519> is<00:02:39.700> what<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.030> going<00:02:40.269> on<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.569> khost

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
what is what is going on in khost

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.150 
what is what is going on in khost
communication<00:02:41.410> for<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.620> rest<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:41.920> game

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
communication for the rest of that game

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.470 
communication for the rest of that game
because<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.459> feel<00:02:42.760> like<00:02:42.790> they<00:02:43.030> have<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.390> be

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
because I feel like they have to be

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.600 
because I feel like they have to be
aware<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.959> fact<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.069> game<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.400> going

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
aware of the fact that the game is going

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.280 
aware of the fact that the game is going
to<00:02:45.700> be<00:02:45.760> over<00:02:46.120> now<00:02:46.540> they're<00:02:46.720> looking<00:02:46.810> forward

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
to be over now they're looking forward

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.350 
to be over now they're looking forward
into<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.500> next<00:02:47.709> two<00:02:48.280> games<00:02:48.519> I<00:02:48.910> think

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
into the next two games I think

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.640 
into the next two games I think
something<00:02:49.629> that<00:02:49.660> Koston<00:02:50.140> do<00:02:50.290> is<00:02:50.440> actually

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
something that Koston do is actually

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.819 
something that Koston do is actually
play<00:02:51.549> towards<00:02:52.390> if<00:02:53.049> they're<00:02:53.530> not<00:02:53.650> comfortable

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
play towards if they're not comfortable

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.710 
play towards if they're not comfortable
playing<00:02:54.370> situation<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.060> they<00:02:55.120> have<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.510> have

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
playing situation that they have to have

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.509 
playing situation that they have to have
a<00:02:55.780> lot<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.260> teamwork<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.950> communication<00:02:57.069> to

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
a lot of teamwork and communication to

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.339 
a lot of teamwork and communication to
that<00:02:57.640> avoid<00:02:58.299> those<00:02:58.450> situations<00:02:58.660> like<00:02:59.109> for

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
that avoid those situations like for

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.160 
that avoid those situations like for
instance<00:02:59.440> if<00:02:59.769> they're<00:03:00.069> not<00:03:00.220> comfortable<00:03:00.370> when

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
instance if they're not comfortable when

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.050 
instance if they're not comfortable when
EG<00:03:02.170> walks<00:03:02.440> into<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.859> jungle<00:03:03.220> as<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.549> blind<00:03:03.849> if

through the early phase you're gonna get

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.970 
through the early phase you're gonna get
to<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.720> lake<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:35.109> which<00:03:35.290> is<00:03:35.440> what<00:03:35.590> they<00:03:35.709> wanted

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
to the lake in which is what they wanted

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
then it's a lot much easier to be

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.150 
then it's a lot much easier to be
grouped<00:03:40.810> as<00:03:40.989> five<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.500> then<00:03:41.590> you<00:03:41.620> know<00:03:41.889> what

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
grouped as five and then you know what

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.800 
grouped as five and then you know what
what<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.669> decisions<00:03:43.060> are<00:03:43.150> making<00:03:43.419> it<00:03:43.510> in<00:03:43.599> the

laning phase making quick decisions like

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
holding up against all tekken crumpled

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.879 
holding up against all tekken crumpled
that's

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
that's

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.439 
that's
featured<00:04:27.219> matchup<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.699> those<00:04:27.849> are<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.330> know

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
featured matchup and those are you know

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:29.790 
featured matchup and those are you know
that<00:04:28.599> is<00:04:28.749> that's<00:04:29.080> considered<00:04:29.530> one<00:04:29.680> of<00:04:29.710> the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
that is that's considered one of the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.179 
that is that's considered one of the
stronger<00:04:30.099> bot<00:04:30.340> lanes<00:04:30.639> in<00:04:31.020> na<00:04:32.020> at<00:04:32.289> the<00:04:32.800> time<00:04:33.009> and

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:33.189 
stronger bot lanes in na at the time and

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.429 
stronger bot lanes in na at the time and
so<00:04:33.699> we<00:04:34.389> have<00:04:34.539> to<00:04:34.719> give<00:04:34.840> credit<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:35.229> them

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:35.439 
so we have to give credit to them

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.890 
so we have to give credit to them
individually<00:04:35.590> is<00:04:36.219> the<00:04:37.029> solution<00:04:37.210> now<00:04:37.659> as

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
individually is the solution now as

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.399 
individually is the solution now as
crumbs<00:04:38.620> poised<00:04:39.520> to<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.749> go<00:04:40.870> into<00:04:41.020> champions

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
crumbs poised to to go into champions

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:42.510 
crumbs poised to to go into champions
like<00:04:41.529> say<00:04:41.710> hey<00:04:41.830> we're<00:04:42.009> going<00:04:42.129> to<00:04:42.189> choose<00:04:42.370> again

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
like say hey we're going to choose again

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.279 
like say hey we're going to choose again
we're<00:04:42.759> going<00:04:42.849> to<00:04:42.939> choose<00:04:43.090> strongly<00:04:43.569> laners

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
we're going to choose strongly laners

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.379 
we're going to choose strongly laners
maybe<00:04:44.499> late<00:04:44.770> game<00:04:44.979> scalars<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:45.639> hold<00:04:46.210> off<00:04:46.360> on

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
maybe late game scalars and hold off on

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.719 
maybe late game scalars and hold off on
the<00:04:46.629> team<00:04:46.810> fight<00:04:47.020> as<00:04:47.199> long<00:04:47.770> as<00:04:47.800> possible<00:04:48.039> and

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
the team fight as long as possible and

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.670 
the team fight as long as possible and
then<00:04:48.789> and<00:04:49.629> then<00:04:49.779> rely<00:04:50.020> on<00:04:50.110> our<00:04:50.199> individual

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
then and then rely on our individual

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.890 
then and then rely on our individual
mechanics<00:04:51.189> to<00:04:51.759> to<00:04:52.060> outplay<00:04:52.389> them<00:04:52.479> later<00:04:52.779> in

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
mechanics to to outplay them later in

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.300 
mechanics to to outplay them later in
the<00:04:52.990> game<00:04:53.110> yeah<00:04:53.620> I<00:04:53.650> think<00:04:53.770> of<00:04:53.949> that's<00:04:54.069> your

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
the game yeah I think of that's your

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.649 
the game yeah I think of that's your
philosophy<00:04:54.789> then<00:04:54.939> you<00:04:55.029> just<00:04:55.210> don't<00:04:55.389> go<00:04:55.509> for

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:55.659 
philosophy then you just don't go for

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:56.879 
philosophy then you just don't go for
teamfight<00:04:56.020> champions<00:04:56.409> like<00:04:56.529> why<00:04:56.680> are<00:04:56.740> you

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
teamfight champions like why are you

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.050 
teamfight champions like why are you
gonna<00:04:57.009> pick<00:04:57.159> Oriana<00:04:57.550> there<00:04:57.729> when<00:04:57.849> you<00:04:57.939> can

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
gonna pick Oriana there when you can

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.519 
gonna pick Oriana there when you can
just<00:04:58.090> pick<00:04:58.330> syndra<00:04:58.749> and<00:04:58.960> have<00:04:59.080> one<00:04:59.349> child

00:04:59.519 --> 00:04:59.529 
just pick syndra and have one child

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.170 
just pick syndra and have one child
potential<00:05:00.009> by<00:05:00.069> yourself<00:05:00.430> like<00:05:00.610> syndra<00:05:01.029> does

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
potential by yourself like syndra does

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.760 
potential by yourself like syndra does
not<00:05:01.360> need<00:05:01.629> the<00:05:01.840> team<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.199> follow<00:05:02.319> up<00:05:02.620> on

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
not need the team to follow up on

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.350 
not need the team to follow up on
everything<00:05:03.009> she<00:05:03.250> does<00:05:03.370> she<00:05:03.879> can<00:05:04.060> sit<00:05:04.330> there

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
everything she does she can sit there

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.990 
everything she does she can sit there
wafer<00:05:05.139> further<00:05:05.500> re<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:06.009> come<00:05:06.430> into<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.669> jungle

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
wafer further re to come into the jungle

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.899 
wafer further re to come into the jungle
and<00:05:07.090> just<00:05:07.300> one<00:05:07.599> shot<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.259> re<00:05:08.439> and<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:09.460> then

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
and just one shot the re and and then

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.369 
and just one shot the re and and then
the<00:05:10.060> fights<00:05:10.270> easy<00:05:10.479> then<00:05:10.870> everyone<00:05:11.199> will<00:05:11.349> know

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
the fights easy then everyone will know

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:12.480 
the fights easy then everyone will know
what<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:11.620> do<00:05:11.800> it's<00:05:11.949> like<00:05:12.009> oh<00:05:12.189> we're<00:05:12.400> just

to<00:05:18.129> win<00:05:18.250> but<00:05:18.400> when<00:05:18.550> you<00:05:18.699> have<00:05:18.729> to<00:05:18.969> coordinate<00:05:19.120> a

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
to win but when you have to coordinate a

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.369 
to win but when you have to coordinate a

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
tepee and oriana old kazakh sleeping in

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.290 
tepee and oriana old kazakh sleeping in
like<00:05:23.650> it's<00:05:23.860> it's<00:05:24.189> too<00:05:24.669> much<00:05:24.879> for<00:05:25.060> them<00:05:25.180> right

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
cassandra and she already has spells

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.570 
cassandra and she already has spells
used<00:05:35.349> and<00:05:35.560> she<00:05:35.680> just<00:05:35.860> turns<00:05:36.129> around<00:05:36.310> a<00:05:36.430> one

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
used and she just turns around a one

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.249 
used and she just turns around a one
shot<00:05:36.789> to<00:05:36.969> you<00:05:37.089> that's<00:05:37.539> when<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:37.839> start<00:05:38.080> hating

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
shot to you that's when you start hating

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:39.629 
shot to you that's when you start hating
syndrome<00:05:38.860> that's<00:05:39.069> when<00:05:39.189> you<00:05:39.219> start<00:05:39.520> thinking

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
syndrome that's when you start thinking

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.730 
syndrome that's when you start thinking
that<00:05:39.879> center<00:05:40.120> is<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.270> best<00:05:40.419> champion<00:05:40.810> that's

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
that center is the best champion that's

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.980 
that center is the best champion that's
why<00:05:41.919> she<00:05:42.339> might<00:05:42.520> be<00:05:42.759> the<00:05:42.939> answer<00:05:42.969> and<00:05:43.719> now<00:05:43.930> we

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
why she might be the answer and now we

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.110 
why she might be the answer and now we
have<00:05:44.110> we<00:05:44.469> go<00:05:44.649> we've<00:05:45.009> we<00:05:45.460> posed<00:05:45.789> the<00:05:46.089> question

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
have we go we've we posed the question

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.909 
have we go we've we posed the question
let's<00:05:46.839> see<00:05:46.930> if<00:05:47.020> any<00:05:47.229> of<00:05:47.319> the<00:05:47.439> teams<00:05:47.620> follow

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
let's see if any of the teams follow

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.800 
let's see if any of the teams follow
through<00:05:48.339> on<00:05:48.370> it<00:05:48.669> and<00:05:48.789> prove<00:05:49.029> us<00:05:49.210> to<00:05:49.360> be<00:05:49.509> right

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
through on it and prove us to be right

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.189 
through on it and prove us to be right
there<00:05:50.110> in<00:05:50.379> that<00:05:50.439> in<00:05:50.889> that<00:05:51.029> remark<00:05:52.029> we're<00:05:52.990> going

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
there in that in that remark we're going

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.649 
there in that in that remark we're going
into<00:05:53.469> Game<00:05:53.649> two<00:05:53.889> it<00:05:54.669> was<00:05:55.000> a<00:05:55.029> decisive<00:05:55.629> victory

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.110 
into Game two it was a decisive victory
for<00:05:56.169> eg<00:05:56.469> eg<00:05:56.680> is<00:05:57.189> looking<00:05:57.460> very<00:05:57.490> strong<00:05:57.789> so<00:05:58.029> we

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
for eg eg is looking very strong so we

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.369 
for eg eg is looking very strong so we
have<00:05:58.330> to<00:05:58.479> give<00:05:58.599> them<00:05:58.750> credit<00:05:58.930> for<00:05:59.169> the<00:05:59.349> fact

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
have to give them credit for the fact

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.409 
have to give them credit for the fact
that<00:05:59.649> they<00:05:59.860> did<00:06:00.339> they<00:06:00.490> make<00:06:00.639> they<00:06:01.000> made<00:06:01.149> one

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
that they did they make they made one

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.450 
that they did they make they made one
very<00:06:01.990> good<00:06:02.080> team<00:06:02.589> play<00:06:02.830> and<00:06:03.099> then<00:06:03.339> they

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
very good team play and then they

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.119 
very good team play and then they
systematically<00:06:03.939> closed<00:06:04.629> it<00:06:04.810> out<00:06:04.990> so<00:06:05.589> is<00:06:05.889> that

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:06.129 
systematically closed it out so is that

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.959 
systematically closed it out so is that
something<00:06:06.339> that<00:06:06.520> they're<00:06:06.669> going<00:06:06.759> to<00:06:06.819> be<00:06:06.909> able

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
something that they're going to be able

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:10.050 
something that they're going to be able
to<00:06:07.120> continue<00:06:07.360> to<00:06:07.569> do<00:06:07.979> or<00:06:08.979> do<00:06:09.550> we<00:06:09.669> think<00:06:09.969> that

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
to continue to do or do we think that

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.760 
to continue to do or do we think that
there<00:06:10.360> will<00:06:10.509> be<00:06:10.539> an<00:06:10.779> option<00:06:10.960> for<00:06:11.229> coast<00:06:11.620> to

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
there will be an option for coast to

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.200 
there will be an option for coast to
disrupt<00:06:12.219> that<00:06:12.370> maybe<00:06:12.580> through<00:06:12.819> champions

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
disrupt that maybe through champions

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.719 
disrupt that maybe through champions

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
like bias by taking away Helios is lee

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.700 
like bias by taking away Helios is lee

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
vision control when the head is very

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.749 
vision control when the head is very
strong<00:06:31.629> like<00:06:31.960> it<00:06:32.110> is<00:06:32.289> one<00:06:32.469> of<00:06:32.560> the<00:06:32.620> best<00:06:32.830> so<00:06:33.370> if

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
strong like it is one of the best so if

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.939
