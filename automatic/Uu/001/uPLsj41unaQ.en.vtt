00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.089
 find for a new tutorial this time 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.010
 I decided to make you reach or 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.139
 so the evolution of pikachu 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.750
 I hope this tutorial will please you 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.160
 is quite complex I find but with 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.990
 the training you get there 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.090
 worry- free and I'm sure I'll 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.490
 leave with following for this tutorial you 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.750
 yellow orange'll need 2 of 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.170
 black white chocolate of a toothpick 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.599
 of a small nail of a roll and a 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.099
 cutter we will first realize the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.780
 tail of reach or just because 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.940
 we will cook it as soon as we have 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.380
 finished so that we can in the meantime 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.239
 that they cook advance in the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.950
 creation you refine a lot a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.500
 black pudding and it's just going 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.700
 to be there that of reach or and one gets 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.590
 found the ante trace of the dough 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.180
 yellow the clear that there is at the end of the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.700
 tail of reach or as usual 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.500
 take a model on google there will be 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.190
 no worries you simply follow 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.190
 outline 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.960
 then you lead seemed this flash 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.760
 with your skin a black for 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.920
 perfect the arc of a circle 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.540
 and you put that 30 minutes to 110 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.790
 degrees then we will come to take care of 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.920
 the reach head or so I'm going to 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.750
 repeat just like the picchu video 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.550
 it's very very similar to a world 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.830
 utopian is hot so I invite you 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.870
 strongly to go see my utopia yachou 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.460
 to understand a little better what I 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.710
 will not be re- explained in this video 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.630
 you make an orange ball and you 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.360
 go do the same technique as 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.830
 pikachu to form his nose 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.720
 then years to come look after the eyes 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.910
 so the same I invite you to go see 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.950
 my topic is hot to have a little 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.410
 more details on how to achieve 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.630
 eyes to laugh where I decided to 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.490
 cut a little bit to give the effect 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.560
 that he was frowning when 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.210
 even the third evolution so that's it 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.860
 it must be impressive we will 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.150
 say and then you just have to dispose 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.260
 the eyes on the face of reach or 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.420
 then years to come make his cheekbones 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.830
 so you flatten two yellow parts 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.150
 that you just apply simply 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.150
 on the jousters itou 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.280
 so you clap fimo paste 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.650
 black that you form in small triangles 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.150
 and you add a little bit of 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.950
 white film I found this is 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.200
 nice and it gave a glare effect 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.990
 and you arrange it on the face of 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.450
 reach or then you will take 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.800
 a lot of orange movies 1 by 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.480
 report to the head of a first plus 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.860
 because we are going to do the body so 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.060
 again it's the same technique 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.160
 that pikachu 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.230
 I'm sorry to repeat myself and say 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.540
 that's the case every time 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.740
 really if you want some 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.459
 more detailed explanations to see them 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.140
 the pikachu study 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.090
 I decided to make reach or four 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.190
 paws so i cut one of 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.050
 ends of his body so that his 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.130
 rates are hollow and at all times ahead 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.390
 to make the legs 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.430
 I will start with the interiors 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.110
 you take orange filmo and you 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.550
 go flatten his end so that this 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.020
 be as flat as possible 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.640
 so you have one end that is 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.350
 flat and the other or just flatten it 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.390
 between your fingers so that step where one 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.770
 remove the demarcations be simpler 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.450
 when you come to do the tip of the foot 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.640
 from richmond you take some dough 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.620
 chocolate and you're going to do the end in 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.870
 rounded tip if I can say and at 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.120
 the other end you come and pulled to 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.680
 four places the chocolate dough for 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.650
 that when we go to assemble the part 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.420
 orange and the chocolate part and that's good 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.049
 face of kinds of waves at the level where 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.049
 they join 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.810
 but 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.360
 then you assemble the part 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.150
 chocolate and the orange part in 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.299
 tucking the places you've been 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.299
 drawn 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.659
 and in this new role is a little bit 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.230
 this is to really perfect the 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:50.150
 join after that you come dispose 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.610
 your interior on the body and we 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.709
 arrives at the most important step 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.209
 that of removing demarcations so 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.650
 as usual you take your cure 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.459
 Tooth you relay on the demarcations 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.319
 to remove them after that you 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.260
 flatten white paw shaped 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:10.579
 oval and or come and apply it on the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.829
 reach belly or if you come with 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.989
 your toothpick flatten so that it does not have 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.859
 not too much difference in thickness between 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.859
 white and orange 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.840
 Then we will come and make the 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.550
 later 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.860
 you take an orange pudding and you 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.990
 go flatten one of the ends for 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.210
 that really there is a form of ball 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.250
 flattened the other end you come 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.229
 tilt slightly in one direction 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.520
 way a little bit to a comma 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.150
 I hope the pictures you 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.150
 become clear 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.570
 after that we will come to form the part 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.490
 chocolate from the hinds you take a 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.380
 chocolate pudding that you are going to fine 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.240
 slightly at one end you go 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.070
 flatten the whole thing is using your 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.690
 toothpick you pressed twice and 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.730
 then you assemble the orange part 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.650
 and the chocolate part you put the 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.450
 end of the comma above the foot and 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.540
 then support you so that both 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.560
 come together perfectly and after that 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.750
 you just put a yellow pellet 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.750
 under the foot she rather oval 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.880
 then you lead seemed to you 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.419
 posterior remove yourself obviously 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.610
 the demarcations after that we will come 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.410
 do the two traits chocolate curie 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.449
 all in the back I did the features 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.139
 way too thick you can 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.669
 realize 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.500
 so the press I modified a little the 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.330
 thing but it was difficult to me 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.250
 catch up so that's a bit of this 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.139
 part there really does the many 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.479
 finer than me and it will go perfectly 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:41.460
 in that you just hung with a 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.460
 nail the rites head or on the body 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.389
 and now to come to tackle the 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.189
 ears time we take the dough 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.779
 chocolate that you're going to fine-tuned 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:58.759
 end then placed you all 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:01.039
 is between your fingers you come and shoot 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.719
 so really it's not very thick 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.440
 and the pointed ends of the ear 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:07.669
 you try to tilt it slightly 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.750
 you do the same thing with the dough 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.750
 yellow but smaller 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.440
 you have the yellow on the part 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.880
 brown and then you come a little 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.890
 little perfect do you have to 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.310
 press lightly so that both do not 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.310
 make sure that 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.960
 and after that we'll just come 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.950
 put the kind of small ends yellow 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.170
 rounded with your toothpick 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.880
 you just twisted on himself and 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.880
 you remove the demarcations of course 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.980
 you come to take a toothpick and to 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.960
 using scissors you will cut the 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.730
 tip to simply set the 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.260
 ears in the head of reach or not 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.540
 do not worry about the toothpick 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.690
 it goes very well at the bottom so no 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.690
 panic 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.180
 after fixing the ears or come 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.220
 make a hole in the back of reach or 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.510
 to simply plant there that 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.280
 cooked you can put it in 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.780
 several different positions it's 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.880
 really like you want I decided 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.310
 then leave it on the side 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.170
 here is this tutorial is over I hope 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.660
 Sincerely they pleased you especially

 pleasure for all those who 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.680
 asked me if I will make a model 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.390
