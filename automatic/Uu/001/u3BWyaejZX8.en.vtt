top of this of course and then the song
gives<00:03:24.579> away<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.820> some<00:03:25.030> wailing<00:03:25.600> guitars<00:03:26.019> on

combination and then it just settles
down<00:03:30.670> into<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:31.030> rock<00:03:31.359> groove<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:32.109> is<00:03:32.140> no<00:03:32.769> less

chilling and sort of reminds me of
something<00:03:35.350> from<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.799> 28<00:03:36.579> days<00:03:36.850> later

something from the 28 days later

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
rollercoaster esque songwriting that I

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.340 
rollercoaster esque songwriting that I

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
on this LP go there is or an insula

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.410 
on this LP go there is or an insula
which<00:03:53.560> starts<00:03:54.280> off<00:03:54.400> with<00:03:54.579> a<00:03:54.640> booming<00:03:55.150> riff

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
which starts off with a booming riff

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.660 
which starts off with a booming riff
that<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.750> think<00:03:56.049> would<00:03:56.170> be<00:03:56.319> a<00:03:56.350> fantastic<00:03:56.799> start

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
that I think would be a fantastic start

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.509 
that I think would be a fantastic start
for<00:03:58.239> just<00:03:58.780> about<00:03:58.900> any<00:03:59.260> metal<00:03:59.680> track<00:04:00.010> but<00:04:00.370> then

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
for just about any metal track but then

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.880 
for just about any metal track but then
the<00:04:00.670> song<00:04:00.880> begins<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.450> drag<00:04:01.840> as<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.590> becomes

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
the song begins to drag as it becomes

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.699 
the song begins to drag as it becomes
apparent<00:04:03.280> that<00:04:03.670> these<00:04:04.299> awesome<00:04:05.079> crushing

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
apparent that these awesome crushing

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.849 
apparent that these awesome crushing
riffs<00:04:06.040> have<00:04:06.700> only<00:04:07.000> become<00:04:07.329> a<00:04:07.780> music<00:04:08.260> bed<00:04:08.470> for

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
riffs have only become a music bed for

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.940 
riffs have only become a music bed for
some<00:04:09.250> decent<00:04:09.700> vocals<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.359> guitar<00:04:11.319> soloing

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
some decent vocals and guitar soloing

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.789 
some decent vocals and guitar soloing
that<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:12.819> only<00:04:13.260> interesting<00:04:14.260> about<00:04:14.440> half<00:04:14.620> the

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
that is only interesting about half the

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.650 
that is only interesting about half the
time<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.370> best<00:04:15.549> parts<00:04:15.850> of<00:04:15.940> this<00:04:16.090> track<00:04:16.329> really

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
time the best parts of this track really

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.080 
time the best parts of this track really
are<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.959> beginning<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:18.340> think<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.820> last

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
are the beginning and I think the last

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.479 
are the beginning and I think the last
four<00:04:19.600> or<00:04:19.900> five<00:04:20.229> minutes<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:20.859> song<00:04:21.099> where

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
four or five minutes of this song where

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.339 
four or five minutes of this song where
all<00:04:21.700> of<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:21.909> sudden<00:04:22.150> we<00:04:22.210> have<00:04:22.330> a<00:04:22.360> huge<00:04:22.780> explosion

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
all of a sudden we have a huge explosion

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.770 
all of a sudden we have a huge explosion
of<00:04:24.070> guitars

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
of guitars

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.540 
of guitars
and<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.230> band<00:04:26.410> suddenly<00:04:26.920> kicks<00:04:27.190> into<00:04:27.430> this

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
and the band suddenly kicks into this

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.670 
and the band suddenly kicks into this
odd<00:04:27.820> timed<00:04:28.270> riff<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.930> even<00:04:29.260> though<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.470> is

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
odd timed riff and even though it is

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.040 
odd timed riff and even though it is
incredibly<00:04:30.190> off-kilter<00:04:30.700> they<00:04:31.389> play<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.930> in

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
incredibly off-kilter they play it in

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.950 
incredibly off-kilter they play it in
this<00:04:32.530> really<00:04:33.010> visceral<00:04:33.730> way<00:04:34.060> where<00:04:34.780> the

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
this really visceral way where the

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.470 
this really visceral way where the
groove<00:04:35.290> is<00:04:35.560> just<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:35.919> primal<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.700> fluid<00:04:37.330> and

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
groove is just so primal and fluid and

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.050 
groove is just so primal and fluid and
free<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:38.500> as<00:04:38.740> far<00:04:38.889> as<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.130> monstrous<00:04:39.669> closer

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
free and as far as the monstrous closer

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.360 
free and as far as the monstrous closer
on<00:04:40.330> this<00:04:40.450> LP<00:04:40.690> goes<00:04:41.110> not<00:04:41.350> a<00:04:41.380> bad<00:04:41.650> track<00:04:41.980> either

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
on this LP goes not a bad track either

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.810 
on this LP goes not a bad track either
it's<00:04:42.970> got<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.540> very<00:04:44.050> quiet<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.100> an<00:04:45.340> eerie

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
it's got a very quiet and an eerie

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.390 
it's got a very quiet and an eerie
guitar<00:04:46.690> led<00:04:46.990> intro<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:47.740> reminds<00:04:48.100> me<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:48.370> a

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
guitar led intro that reminds me of a

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.520 
guitar led intro that reminds me of a
little<00:04:49.060> bit<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.389> Godspeed<00:04:49.960> and<00:04:50.169> then<00:04:50.350> there's

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
little bit of Godspeed and then there's

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.440 
little bit of Godspeed and then there's
an<00:04:50.680> explosive<00:04:51.250> riff<00:04:51.669> that<00:04:51.850> brings<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.240> song

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
an explosive riff that brings the song

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.830 
an explosive riff that brings the song
to<00:04:52.690> another<00:04:52.990> plateau<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.980> intensity<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.180> even

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
to another plateau of intensity and even

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.050 
to another plateau of intensity and even
though<00:04:56.050> on<00:04:56.320> this<00:04:56.590> track<00:04:56.950> like<00:04:57.400> many<00:04:57.820> other

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
though on this track like many other

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.060 
though on this track like many other
songs<00:04:58.419> here<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.650> playing<00:04:59.950> the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
songs here the the playing the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.580 
songs here the the playing the
performance<00:05:00.700> it's<00:05:00.850> not<00:05:01.590> fantastically

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
performance it's not fantastically

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.850 
performance it's not fantastically
intense<00:05:03.010> or<00:05:03.540> mind-blowing<00:05:04.540> I<00:05:04.720> do<00:05:05.050> like<00:05:05.680> the

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
intense or mind-blowing I do like the

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.650 
intense or mind-blowing I do like the
fact<00:05:06.040> that<00:05:06.190> this<00:05:06.430> song<00:05:06.640> progresses<00:05:06.850> in<00:05:07.419> a<00:05:07.480> much

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
fact that this song progresses in a much

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.510 
fact that this song progresses in a much
more<00:05:07.840> interesting<00:05:08.169> way<00:05:08.560> than<00:05:08.800> other<00:05:08.950> songs<00:05:09.250> on

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
more interesting way than other songs on

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.250 
more interesting way than other songs on
here<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:10.150> band<00:05:10.330> is<00:05:10.450> always<00:05:10.870> looking<00:05:11.200> for

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
here the band is always looking for

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.610 
here the band is always looking for
another<00:05:11.650> level<00:05:12.220> of<00:05:12.400> volume<00:05:12.730> or<00:05:13.180> another<00:05:13.840> layer

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
another level of volume or another layer

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.010 
another level of volume or another layer
to<00:05:15.040> add<00:05:15.160> on<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.730> the<00:05:15.850> mix<00:05:16.150> to<00:05:16.480> sort<00:05:16.690> of<00:05:16.780> keep

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
to add on to the mix to sort of keep

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.930 
to add on to the mix to sort of keep
things<00:05:17.260> engaging<00:05:17.830> there<00:05:18.370> are<00:05:18.460> times<00:05:18.700> when

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
things engaging there are times when

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.880 
things engaging there are times when
synthesizers<00:05:19.660> that<00:05:19.810> that<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.320> there's<00:05:20.830> a

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
synthesizers that that and there's a

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.710 
synthesizers that that and there's a
moment<00:05:21.100> toward<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.520> very<00:05:21.790> end<00:05:22.090> of<00:05:22.240> this<00:05:22.390> track

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
moment toward the very end of this track

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.050 
moment toward the very end of this track
where<00:05:22.960> there<00:05:23.140> is<00:05:23.260> a<00:05:23.290> very<00:05:24.010> thick<00:05:24.580> string

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
where there is a very thick string

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.350 
where there is a very thick string
section<00:05:25.600> that<00:05:26.139> is<00:05:26.560> paired<00:05:27.100> really<00:05:27.520> well<00:05:27.820> with

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
section that is paired really well with

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.930 
section that is paired really well with
the<00:05:28.510> thunderous<00:05:29.080> guitars<00:05:29.590> that<00:05:30.160> are<00:05:30.280> clashing

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
the thunderous guitars that are clashing

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.000 
the thunderous guitars that are clashing
away<00:05:31.150> behind<00:05:31.479> it<00:05:31.750> it's<00:05:32.050> just<00:05:32.350> odd<00:05:32.530> to<00:05:32.560> me<00:05:32.860> that

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
away behind it it's just odd to me that

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.310 
away behind it it's just odd to me that
a<00:05:33.040> band<00:05:33.370> would<00:05:33.520> arrange<00:05:33.970> such<00:05:34.450> a<00:05:34.479> great<00:05:34.960> piece

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
a band would arrange such a great piece

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.020 
a band would arrange such a great piece
of<00:05:35.350> instrumentation<00:05:36.100> around<00:05:36.550> their<00:05:36.700> track

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
of instrumentation around their track

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.210 
of instrumentation around their track
and<00:05:37.330> then<00:05:37.840> just<00:05:38.380> a<00:05:38.470> little<00:05:38.560> bit<00:05:38.710> earlier<00:05:39.160> in

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
and then just a little bit earlier in

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.040 
and then just a little bit earlier in
the<00:05:39.400> song<00:05:39.610> like<00:05:39.820> around<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.150> 930<00:05:40.660> mark<00:05:40.930> we

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
the song like around the 930 mark we

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.140 
the song like around the 930 mark we
have<00:05:41.080> some<00:05:41.440> guitar<00:05:42.190> intervals<00:05:42.729> that<00:05:42.940> don't
