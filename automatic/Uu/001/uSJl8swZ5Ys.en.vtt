00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.320
 lotte 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:19.109
 Here is a small camera test of me 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:23.850
 are of course out there with the canon eos 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.190
 7d focus I have here now manually 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.320
 adjusted 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.000
 yes I wanted to know test and then 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.219
 can you tell me how the quality is so 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.789
 and above all, maybe 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.010
 Microphone quality because the camera makes 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:41.789
 yes synonymous slight noise in the videos 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.199
 I just want to record that 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.460
 watch if you so outside with videos 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.300
 normal micro can open that you 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.769
 you my incredibly long shadow 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.359
 and if that also goes free-hand 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.979
 there remains a Bildstabilisator 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:02.089
 i am now at jo i have 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.089
 would have to be 30 fps 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.289
 in my through a bit off 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.789
 zoom 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.789
 I'll try to get it right 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.980
 after and any close-ups only 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.600
 what about the old foliage here 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.840
 and then I'm looking forward to yours 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.840
 Comments 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:42.650
 I hope one pulls is that should 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.229
 have been 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.950
 changes it but against the summer heat of 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.810
 the canon eos the months and writes 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.180
 purely what yes of the video quality holds 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.800
 from a microphone quality and then 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.100
 Thank you very much to the 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.100
 next time 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.820
 July 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.140
 I'm doing your karl small test 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.989
 here with the canon eos 7d and I look 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.030
 Let's look like pretty of course 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.440
 not but I test the camera quality 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.720
 a bit each manual focus 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.250
 in it 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.900
 yes the camera is a bit hard too 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.049
 hold 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.910
 but I would say it works that way 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.640
 now 64 times 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.680
 I can not leave otherwise 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.530
 I would kill myself, I think so 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.000
 Now you have to go the other ten years 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.030
 They cleaned up as always 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.200
 as I said, such a test you see 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.130
 you probably following that 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.230
 video from outside and now in there 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.360
 ta from yesterday one time look like that in the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.440
 Room with a little tight is here 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.350
 not so much light in that 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.820
 is a window but yes it is now 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.290
 also again a little later 16 clock 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.730
 I think and you know that 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.600
 sun is already pretty much again 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.170
 far below 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.510
 my keyboard is on you here 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.459
 the village is i can not really 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.709
 Good macro shots mean that is 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.120
 Here you can see even sharper than this 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.850
 it does not mean this distance 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.070
 Here's the maximum what's still sharp 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.890
 looks 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.990
 yes you do not go then but not 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.220
 now say that it is quite enough 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:29.550
 my microphone the blue yeti you can 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.410
 also look there and I'm happy 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.550
 really 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.780

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.450

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:52.800

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.100

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.790
