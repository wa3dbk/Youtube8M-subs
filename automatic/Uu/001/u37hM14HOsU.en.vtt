00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
fat deposition around the body and then

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.110 
fat deposition around the body and then
it<00:01:05.560> can<00:01:05.650> shift<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.100> body<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.460> my<00:01:06.580> pollicis

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
it can shift the body of my pollicis

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.610 
it can shift the body of my pollicis
where<00:01:07.570> you're<00:01:07.780> burning<00:01:08.080> up<00:01:08.140> fat<00:01:08.409> for<00:01:08.560> energy

so<00:03:45.900> then<00:03:46.049> you<00:03:46.170> won't<00:03:46.380> have<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.760> stress

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
so then you won't have that stress

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.380 
so then you won't have that stress
induced<00:03:48.180> eating<00:03:48.630> of<00:03:49.440> fatty<00:03:49.739> sugary<00:03:50.220> foods<00:03:50.760> so

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
induced eating of fatty sugary foods so

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.789 
induced eating of fatty sugary foods so

which<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.519> pretty<00:03:59.730> interesting<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.269> did<00:04:00.420> some

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
which is pretty interesting I did some

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.420 
which is pretty interesting I did some
research<00:04:00.690> on<00:04:01.049> it<00:04:01.200> it's<00:04:01.620> actually<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:02.010> super

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
research on it it's actually a super

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.210 
research on it it's actually a super
fruit<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.230> know<00:04:04.350> super<00:04:04.680> foods<00:04:04.950> are

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
fruit and this you know super foods are

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.870 
fruit and this you know super foods are
foods<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.730> are<00:04:05.880> nutrient<00:04:06.360> dense

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
foods that are nutrient dense

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.430 
foods that are nutrient dense
nutrient<00:04:07.330> diversity<00:04:07.840> so<00:04:07.960> they<00:04:08.080> can<00:04:08.230> supply

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
nutrient diversity so they can supply

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.130 
nutrient diversity so they can supply
the<00:04:08.560> body<00:04:08.740> with<00:04:08.890> vitamins<00:04:09.300> minerals<00:04:10.300> so<00:04:10.720> this

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
the body with vitamins minerals so this

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.710 
the body with vitamins minerals so this
one<00:04:11.350> will<00:04:11.470> only<00:04:11.830> give<00:04:12.070> you<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.430> amino<00:04:13.210> acids

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
one will only give you the amino acids

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.210 
one will only give you the amino acids
and<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.930> branch<00:04:14.170> chain<00:04:14.410> amino<00:04:14.440> acids<00:04:15.040> which

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
and the branch chain amino acids which

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.340 
and the branch chain amino acids which
make<00:04:15.400> up<00:04:15.550> 130<00:04:15.940> years<00:04:16.150> l2<00:04:16.480> muscle<00:04:16.810> tissue<00:04:16.989> but

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
make up 130 years l2 muscle tissue but

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.410 
make up 130 years l2 muscle tissue but
it<00:04:17.770> can<00:04:17.860> give<00:04:17.980> your<00:04:18.070> body<00:04:18.220> vitamins<00:04:18.820> minerals

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
it can give your body vitamins minerals

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.600 
it can give your body vitamins minerals
so<00:04:19.840> this<00:04:20.080> can<00:04:20.290> definitely<00:04:20.530> replace<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.190> meal

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
so this can definitely replace a meal

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.820 
so this can definitely replace a meal
and<00:04:21.820> then<00:04:22.210> give<00:04:22.630> you<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.930> ashkelon<00:04:23.440> dough<00:04:23.710> and

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
and then give you the ashkelon dough and

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.010 
and then give you the ashkelon dough and
lower<00:04:23.950> cortisol<00:04:24.580> levels<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.480> help<00:04:25.630> you<00:04:25.780> adapt

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
lower cortisol levels and help you adapt

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.630 
lower cortisol levels and help you adapt
better<00:04:26.170> to<00:04:26.320> physical<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:27.130> emotional<00:04:27.280> stress

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
better to physical and emotional stress

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.460 
better to physical and emotional stress
to<00:04:27.910> put<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.150> in<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.300> good<00:04:28.450> mood<00:04:28.480> and<00:04:28.900> then<00:04:29.380> the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
to put you in a good mood and then the

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.440 
to put you in a good mood and then the
green<00:04:29.650> coffee<00:04:29.950> bean<00:04:30.310> extract<00:04:30.490> which<00:04:31.000> inhibits
