00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.830
 in my name is ilich ramÃ­rez vargas 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.380
 I am 25 years old , the corporation is entered 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.269
 to the corporation at 19 years later 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.519
 of having finished my high school my 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.590
 idea was to go to work to pay 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.860
 a university but I entered the 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.080
 corporation dies my mom then 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.740
 I also had to be in charge of my 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.740
 two little brothers 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.860
 I met my husband in the course this 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.080
 year we got married in my oldest son has 4 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.170
 years and the smallest one has a year and 8 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.790
 months since the baby was born with a 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.790
 malformation in special 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.489
 this work if it requires certain 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.289
 adrenaline sometimes one is not explained 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.210
 like this when all the people are going 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.170
 we are running out 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.660
 those who run inwards 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.120
 it becomes a character I feel a little 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.370
 more noble do not feel that is more 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.500
 attached to the citizenship you learn to 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.740
 value things that maybe citizens 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.689
 they do not value what life is like 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.360
 witnessing so many situations 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.850
 so many cases where we see that 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.100
 they lose their lives and we go to rescues to 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.899
 remove corpses that if rossi their 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.560
 you always start to have a bit of 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.560
 more of conscience 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.620
 but on one occasion 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.870
 a fire at the mercy 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.780
 and in that service my husband was older 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.810
 with and being very big they burned three 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.610
 local and my husband this one was whistling 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.380
 black then the black dick is the one that 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.870
 He will charge the line and is the one 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.000
 he has to enter the fire 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.950
 this time it was my turn to charge 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.630
 I stayed in the unit and it was a 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.610
 difficult experience because you're 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.010
 used to knowing that your husband is 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.200
 fireman but the fact of seeing what is 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.290
 goal and that you know if the structure 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.760
 is about to fall you see the flames 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.460
 you see how the comrades come out and you 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.770
 husband does not come out 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.380
 all of these arrive first at 14 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.770
 that a single clamp arrives because of 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.770
 post it 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.330
 or a rescue of a person was left 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.220
 pressed inside your vehicle was a 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.050
 woman and when she saw that the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.550
 teammates she did not want 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.500
 that no partner touched her 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.010
 a woman was asking to be taken down by a woman 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.320
 so I had to rescue it myself 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.820
 I had to take care of it so that it was 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.740
 transferred to the hospital because if he was 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.240
 in a very critical state this was one of 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.920
 the services maybe more difficult than 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.200
 He touched me because he had to do it 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.560
 alone but this was one of the most 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.560
 satisfactory 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.620
 I can not get to work 24 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.330
 sleepless hours and get to sleep I have 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.420
 that I get to take care of my children to 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.110
 prepare the food 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.989
 to my tasks as a housewife this 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.420
 difference of maybe my husband that he 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.950
 he arrives tired and then he rests like this 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.720
 as a woman if it's a little bit more difficult 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.640
 especially responsibility 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.640
 you have as a mother and as a housewife 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.810
 maybe a lot of people will think it's easy 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.480
 that must be easy but in reality it 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.910
 requires quite capable of training 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.630
 enough strength and especially have a 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:34.200
 attitude an attitude to face 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:38.480
 to services that require strength 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.480
 this knowledge and techniques
