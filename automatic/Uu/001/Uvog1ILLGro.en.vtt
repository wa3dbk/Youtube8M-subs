whole lot of money to pour this slab on
topics<00:03:46.380> we<00:03:46.440> thought<00:03:46.650> it'd<00:03:46.739> be<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.860> easiest

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
start re putting some of the ramps back

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.440 
start re putting some of the ramps back
but<00:04:04.200> at<00:04:04.349> the<00:04:04.709> same<00:04:04.950> time<00:04:05.159> rebuilding<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:06.299> and

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
but at the same time rebuilding it and

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.929 
but at the same time rebuilding it and
then<00:04:06.599> we're<00:04:06.780> also<00:04:06.930> building<00:04:07.260> an<00:04:07.530> office<00:04:08.099> over

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
then we're also building an office over

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.910 
then we're also building an office over
in<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.150> corner<00:04:09.450> there<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.810> two-story<00:04:10.439> office

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
in the corner there a two-story office

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.699 
in the corner there a two-story office
so<00:04:11.099> that<00:04:11.129> when<00:04:11.459> we<00:04:11.579> film<00:04:11.879> here<00:04:12.269> we<00:04:12.810> can<00:04:13.109> just

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
so that when we film here we can just

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.069 
so that when we film here we can just
edit<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.280> stuff<00:04:14.579> you<00:04:15.269> know<00:04:15.359> can<00:04:15.629> get<00:04:15.750> logged

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
edit the stuff you know can get logged

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.020 
edit the stuff you know can get logged
into<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.500> computer<00:04:16.709> right<00:04:17.250> after<00:04:17.549> we<00:04:17.639> film<00:04:17.910> it

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
into the computer right after we film it

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.459 
into the computer right after we film it
so<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.449> just<00:04:18.509> never<00:04:19.139> leaves<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:20.009> barracks
