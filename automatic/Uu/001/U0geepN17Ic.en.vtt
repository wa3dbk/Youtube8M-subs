00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.210 
that's a good thing that's not me giving
out<00:02:11.840> that's<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.410> way<00:02:12.500> we<00:02:12.739> all<00:02:12.860> feel<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.160> the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
out that's the way we all feel that the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.130 
out that's the way we all feel that the
club<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.519> we<00:02:13.610> all<00:02:13.700> have<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:13.850> put<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.140> shoulder

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
club that we all have to put a shoulder

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.300 
club that we all have to put a shoulder
to<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.260> wheel<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.470> bit<00:02:15.680> harder<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.040> year<00:02:16.100> I

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
to the wheel a bit harder this year I

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.550 
to the wheel a bit harder this year I
think<00:02:16.400> Steve<00:02:16.850> biggest<00:02:17.630> concern<00:02:18.140> people<00:02:18.290> talk

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
think Steve biggest concern people talk

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.750 
think Steve biggest concern people talk
about<00:02:18.590> transfers<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.310> being<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.550> all<00:02:19.610> in

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
about transfers and being that all in

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.430 
about transfers and being that all in
being<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.090> yet<00:02:20.269> we've<00:02:20.600> made<00:02:20.780> transfers<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.380> the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
being it yet we've made transfers in the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.170 
being it yet we've made transfers in the
past<00:02:21.650> we've<00:02:22.190> done<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.340> lot<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.519> a<00:02:22.850> lot<00:02:23.090> of

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
past we've done a lot of a lot of

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.090 
past we've done a lot of a lot of
activity<00:02:23.569> but<00:02:24.140> I<00:02:24.170> think<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.470> biggest<00:02:24.650> concern

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
activity but I think the biggest concern

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.460 
activity but I think the biggest concern
to<00:02:25.550> Steve<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.450> talking<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.050> him<00:02:27.170> at<00:02:27.440> dinner
