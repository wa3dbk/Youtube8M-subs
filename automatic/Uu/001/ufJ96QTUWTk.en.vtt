you guess using you know the questions I
thought<00:03:04.870> there<00:03:05.200> was<00:03:05.320> four<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.980> thought<00:03:06.100> there'd

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
thought there was four I thought there'd

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.950 
thought there was four I thought there'd
be for<00:03:06.670> multiple<00:03:07.120> choice<00:03:07.300> questions<00:03:07.750> about

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
be for multiple choice questions about

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.110 
be for multiple choice questions about
apparently<00:03:08.290> it's<00:03:08.380> only<00:03:08.560> three<00:03:08.830> I<00:03:09.060> think<00:03:10.060> it

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
apparently it's only three I think it

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.860 
apparently it's only three I think it
would<00:03:10.210> be<00:03:10.240> harder<00:03:10.720> for<00:03:10.750> me<00:03:11.740> should<00:03:12.040> add<00:03:12.250> that

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
would be harder for me should add that

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.810 
would be harder for me should add that
they<00:03:13.870> went<00:03:14.080> smoothly<00:03:14.470> there<00:03:14.860> was<00:03:14.980> no<00:03:15.130> lying<00:03:15.460> I

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
they went smoothly there was no lying I

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.810 
they went smoothly there was no lying I
had<00:03:16.000> no<00:03:16.150> problems<00:03:17.050> getting<00:03:17.140> in<00:03:17.560> so<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.700> was

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
had no problems getting in so it was

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.430 
had no problems getting in so it was
pretty<00:03:18.970> easy<00:03:19.090> I'm<00:03:19.660> surprised<00:03:20.020> I<00:03:20.050> got<00:03:20.260> in

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
pretty easy I'm surprised I got in

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.570 
pretty easy I'm surprised I got in
though<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.800> thought<00:03:21.040> they<00:03:21.160> would<00:03:21.310> have<00:03:21.400> like

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
though I thought they would have like

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.420 
though I thought they would have like
you<00:03:21.700> know<00:03:21.820> an<00:03:21.940> IP<00:03:22.090> lock<00:03:22.890> Canadians<00:03:23.890> only<00:03:24.190> but<00:03:24.400> I

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
you know an IP lock Canadians only but I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.430 
you know an IP lock Canadians only but I
guess<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:25.360> only<00:03:25.450> requirement<00:03:26.050> is<00:03:26.110> to<00:03:26.170> have<00:03:26.380> a

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440
