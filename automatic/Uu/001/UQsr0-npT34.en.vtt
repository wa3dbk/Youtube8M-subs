00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.449
 in the first season and after the sale 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:10.719
 the lack 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.139
 Andalusian to which we referred to before 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:19.519
 was performed on two main chords on the wicker who 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.919
 and on the 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.449
 bush 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.939
 ferrari so much to say na also about it 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.270
 roma min 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.480
 and on the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.090
 is what was left in that is called to play upstairs soon started in the 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.710
 min 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.310
 it goes up because the fingers been 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.530
 on the top of the fingerboard 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 and play through no means 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.940
 on 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.240
 because the inmates are 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.530
 in the middle the day passed 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.010
 this will be according to the one that is added in the past 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.210
 the patía was saying you play the guitar 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.210
 I play from Pakistan 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.350
 the outgoing 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.160
 we have 2 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.610
 all the principals the touch on the top and the touch in half 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.800
 and that's how flamenco was for many years 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.060
 from there that the gaditanos will invent 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.140
 the tragedy 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.400
 is attributed to the master patiño others from the blow 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.990
 Garitano guitarists of 19 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.790
 they were queuing cecilia power 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.730
 so he put the third setback spoke to 3 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.420
 3 above the 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.960
 I would set up a higher position to accompany a cantaor who had 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.160
 a higher tone of voice 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.630
 opal 3 for half a minute ie the flamingos do not speak finger 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.170
 the gallant of 3% min 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.740
 when they talk about sun 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.810
 but they talk about 3 at the top 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.810
 Sun 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:14.209
 miguel go rühl and ramón montoya two of the most important guitarists of the 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.829
 history of flamenco 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.929
 they designed they invented they developed 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.869
 positions to perform the Andalusian cadence 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.389
 but not only in the touch above 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.919
 and by means that limits them goes a lot 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:33.819
 what did you do 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.189
 they developed that same Andalusian cadence 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.260
 but other tones for example about the sharp na 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.489
 the bad tone of caranta 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.489
 how the cadence is performed 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.939
 they did not have the lack of sunlight 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.949
 al 2 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:02.649
 without cesc and villa 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.409
 they did the same thing 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.609
 developed 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.209
 the Andalusian cadet roll 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.119
 p 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.539
 ma 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.559
 nor would it be like being 2 at half 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.419
 yes no algeria 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.979
 animated by the success of taranta's tone 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.299
 and power to age 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.669
 they should say 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.679
 let's also do it to 4 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:36.379
 and will develop from 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.379
 ansa 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.839
 we hope that this should not 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:49.009
 what is a hard four? 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.499
 Min Perez in tragedy 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:58.319
 min 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.230
 they did the same thing 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.809
 any 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.809
 uma 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.979
 is what is called the perrone tone 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.429
 we have then 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:15.499
 six bulls 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:16.440
 from above 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.049
 min 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.550
 by means of min wind peralta 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.149
 min the idea min 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.360
 in it min 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.219
 and in a comedy tone 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.749
 six volumes to accompany flamenco cantes 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.419
 without cecilia 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.409
 this is not an obstacle for 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:48.659
 touches 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.629
 with the nut to 2 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.969
 in all of taranta 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:55.990
 what would it mean? 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.100
 at 4 min hamburg 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.129
 min p will now be patent has resources to spare 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:07.550
 to express yourself 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.979
 in any thesis
