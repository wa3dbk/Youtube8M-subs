a<00:00:58.269> synthetic<00:00:59.079> upper<00:00:59.409> it's<00:00:59.829> fairly<00:01:00.129> thin<00:01:00.399> in

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
a synthetic upper it's fairly thin in

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.639 
a synthetic upper it's fairly thin in
the<00:01:00.639> quality<00:01:01.030> is<00:01:01.179> okay<00:01:01.839> it's<00:01:02.019> nothing<00:01:02.170> special

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
the quality is okay it's nothing special

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.619 
the quality is okay it's nothing special
but<00:01:03.219> for<00:01:03.459> an<00:01:03.579> indoor<00:01:03.909> soccer<00:01:04.119> shoe<00:01:04.449> it's

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
but for an indoor soccer shoe it's

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.380 
but for an indoor soccer shoe it's
honestly<00:01:04.989> above<00:01:05.290> par<00:01:05.620> and<00:01:05.890> I<00:01:06.670> like<00:01:07.000> how<00:01:07.150> thin

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
honestly above par and I like how thin

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.300 
honestly above par and I like how thin
is<00:01:07.600> and<00:01:07.780> how<00:01:07.840> soft<00:01:08.170> it<00:01:08.350> actually<00:01:08.650> is<00:01:08.740> you<00:01:09.160> can

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
is and how soft it actually is you can

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.260 
is and how soft it actually is you can
see<00:01:09.400> you<00:01:09.490> have<00:01:09.610> these<00:01:09.730> little<00:01:09.910> ventilation

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
see you have these little ventilation

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.970 
see you have these little ventilation
holes<00:01:10.810> running<00:01:11.020> through<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.500> entirety<00:01:11.800> of

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
holes running through the entirety of

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.130 
holes running through the entirety of
the<00:01:12.130> upper<00:01:12.460> in<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:13.090> forefoot<00:01:13.510> on<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.780> outside

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
the upper in the forefoot on the outside

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.690 
the upper in the forefoot on the outside
and<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.380> little<00:01:14.680> bit<00:01:14.800> here<00:01:15.010> at<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.190> ankle<00:01:15.490> area

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
and a little bit here at the ankle area

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.490 
and a little bit here at the ankle area
on<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.150> instep<00:01:16.510> of<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.690> shoe<00:01:16.870> and<00:01:17.200> that's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
on the instep of the shoe and that's

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.780 
on the instep of the shoe and that's
just<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.830> allow<00:01:18.010> for<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:18.250> little<00:01:18.430> bit<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.580> extra

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
just to allow for a little bit of extra

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.640 
just to allow for a little bit of extra
breathability<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.780> tongue<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.140> also<00:01:20.290> pretty

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
breathability the tongue is also pretty

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.920 
breathability the tongue is also pretty
much<00:01:20.800> full<00:01:21.100> mesh<00:01:21.340> so<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:22.450> shoe<00:01:22.600> should<00:01:22.660> offer

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
much full mesh so the shoe should offer

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.600 
much full mesh so the shoe should offer
some<00:01:23.200> pretty<00:01:23.320> good<00:01:23.440> breathability<00:01:23.800> when

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
some pretty good breathability when

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.670 
some pretty good breathability when
playing<00:01:24.880> on<00:01:25.030> indoor<00:01:25.300> court<00:01:25.510> surfaces<00:01:25.900> the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
playing on indoor court surfaces the

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.990 
playing on indoor court surfaces the
upper<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:27.010> can<00:01:27.130> see<00:01:27.250> it<00:01:27.430> has<00:01:27.640> this<00:01:27.760> kind<00:01:27.970> of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
upper you can see it has this kind of

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.550 
upper you can see it has this kind of
dimpling<00:01:28.270> pattern<00:01:28.870> running<00:01:29.080> through<00:01:29.260> it<00:01:29.380> just

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
dimpling pattern running through it just

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.860 
dimpling pattern running through it just
like<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.830> top-end<00:01:30.310> Evo<00:01:30.760> speed<00:01:30.940> would<00:01:31.120> have<00:01:31.390> so

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
like the top-end Evo speed would have so

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.030 
like the top-end Evo speed would have so
shoot<00:01:32.050> out<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.200> little<00:01:32.350> bit<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.620> textured

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
shoot out a little bit of a textured

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.460 
shoot out a little bit of a textured
slightly<00:01:33.660> grippy<00:01:34.660> feel<00:01:34.870> on<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.260> ball<00:01:35.410> so

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
slightly grippy feel on the ball so

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.290 
slightly grippy feel on the ball so
we'll<00:01:35.680> see<00:01:35.800> how<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:36.040> does<00:01:36.190> perform<00:01:36.640> when<00:01:36.880> I

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
we'll see how that does perform when I

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.060 
we'll see how that does perform when I
do<00:01:37.720> get<00:01:37.960> some<00:01:38.050> testing<00:01:38.500> time<00:01:38.680> into<00:01:38.950> these

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
do get some testing time into these

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.250 
do get some testing time into these
shoes<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.550> do<00:01:40.150> also<00:01:40.360> have<00:01:40.690> this<00:01:40.930> kind<00:01:41.140> of

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
shoes you do also have this kind of

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.990 
shoes you do also have this kind of
sandpaper<00:01:41.890> finish<00:01:42.340> around<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.640> toe<00:01:42.820> area

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
sandpaper finish around the toe area

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.610 
sandpaper finish around the toe area
which<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.720> not<00:01:43.780> only<00:01:43.900> gonna<00:01:44.080> add<00:01:44.290> a<00:01:44.320> little<00:01:44.500> bit

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
which is not only gonna add a little bit

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.140 
which is not only gonna add a little bit
of<00:01:44.710> grip<00:01:44.950> on<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.130> ball<00:01:45.340> but<00:01:45.790> it's<00:01:45.909> also<00:01:46.000> gonna

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
of grip on the ball but it's also gonna

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.240 
of grip on the ball but it's also gonna
add<00:01:46.720> to<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.080> durability<00:01:47.320> in<00:01:47.740> lounge<00:01:48.010> for<00:01:48.190> a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
add to the durability in lounge for a

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.830 
add to the durability in lounge for a
little<00:01:48.400> bit<00:01:48.490> better<00:01:48.610> bond<00:01:48.820> between<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.360> upper

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
little bit better bond between the upper

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.600 
little bit better bond between the upper
and<00:01:49.870> the<00:01:50.140> sole<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.680> shoe<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:51.370> you<00:01:51.430> don't

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
and the sole of the shoe so you don't

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.460 
and the sole of the shoe so you don't
have<00:01:51.700> any<00:01:51.850> issues<00:01:51.940> with<00:01:52.120> durability<00:01:52.540> as<00:01:53.200> far

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
have any issues with durability as far

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.020 
have any issues with durability as far
as<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.830> liner<00:01:54.010> is<00:01:54.190> concerned<00:01:54.550> you<00:01:54.670> do<00:01:54.820> have<00:01:55.000> a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
as the liner is concerned you do have a

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.120 
as the liner is concerned you do have a
full<00:01:55.540> mesh<00:01:55.780> liner<00:01:56.080> in<00:01:56.290> here<00:01:56.320> which<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.010> gonna

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
full mesh liner in here which is gonna

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.710 
full mesh liner in here which is gonna
allow<00:01:57.190> for<00:01:57.460> pretty<00:01:57.610> good<00:01:57.790> step<00:01:58.060> in<00:01:58.240> comfort

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
allow for pretty good step in comfort

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.990 
allow for pretty good step in comfort
and<00:01:58.870> of<00:01:59.800> course<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.190> insole<00:02:00.520> is<00:02:00.610> actually

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
and of course the insole is actually

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.399 
and of course the insole is actually
removable<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.720> shoe<00:02:01.900> which<00:02:02.020> is<00:02:02.050> a<00:02:02.170> feature

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.810 
itself most indoor and turf soccer shoes
don't<00:02:05.200> have<00:02:05.440> removable<00:02:05.740> insoles<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.670> it's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
don't have removable insoles so it's

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.980 
don't have removable insoles so it's
really<00:02:06.940> nice<00:02:07.120> that<00:02:07.300> they<00:02:07.390> did<00:02:07.510> include<00:02:07.720> that
