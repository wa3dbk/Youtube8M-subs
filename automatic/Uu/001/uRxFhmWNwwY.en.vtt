00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
hey everybody I've been looking at this

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.740 
hey everybody I've been looking at this
model<00:00:04.740> for<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:04.980> while<00:00:05.250> when<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.240> would<00:00:06.420> go<00:00:06.569> into

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
model for a while when I would go into

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.720 
model for a while when I would go into
like<00:00:06.960> Hobby<00:00:07.890> Lobby<00:00:08.010> or<00:00:08.370> Michaels<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.420> it's<00:00:10.320> a

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
like Hobby Lobby or Michaels and it's a

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.249 
like Hobby Lobby or Michaels and it's a
scale<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.880> don't<00:00:12.059> see<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> lot<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.570> that's

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
scale you don't see a lot of that's

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.700 
scale you don't see a lot of that's
pretty<00:00:13.559> close<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:14.009> what<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.190> do<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.690> 12<00:00:16.410> 50

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
pretty close to what we do it's a 12 50

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.390 
pretty close to what we do it's a 12 50
scale<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.810> obviously<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.439> Viking<00:00:19.920> vessel

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
scale and so obviously a Viking vessel

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.000 
scale and so obviously a Viking vessel
and<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.570> want<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:22.230> something<00:00:22.560> for<00:00:22.920> my

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
wife's door farming and I thought this

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.490 
wife's door farming and I thought this
would<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> trick<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.390> let<00:00:28.140> me<00:00:28.199> just<00:00:28.349> give

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
incredible deal i am still also jealous

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.369 
incredible deal i am still also jealous
but<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.960> look<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.410> shield<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:45.379> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
but if you look at the shield in the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.750 
but if you look at the shield in the
size<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> shields<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> side<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
size of the shields on the side of the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.049 
size of the shields on the side of the
boat<00:00:48.379> they're<00:00:49.379> very<00:00:49.860> close<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.399> identical<00:00:50.789> if

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
boat they're very close to identical if

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.950 
boat they're very close to identical if
not<00:00:51.239> identical<00:00:52.160> also<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.430> look<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
not identical also if you look at the

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.630 
not identical also if you look at the
oars<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:56.280> look<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> haft<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> axe

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
oars and you look at the haft of the axe

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.510 
oars and you look at the haft of the axe
they're<00:00:59.640> very<00:01:00.030> very<00:01:00.539> close<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.140> being<00:01:01.520> again

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
they're very very close to being again

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.109 
they're very very close to being again
identical<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.460> pretty<00:01:05.760> good

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
identical so it's a it's a pretty good

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.000 
identical so it's a it's a pretty good
fit<00:01:07.490> obviously<00:01:08.490> haven't<00:01:08.700> built<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.150> yet<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
fit obviously haven't built it yet and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.260 
fit obviously haven't built it yet and
the<00:01:11.010> proof<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> pudding<00:01:11.880> we'll<00:01:12.030> see

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the proof is in the pudding we'll see

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.590 
the proof is in the pudding we'll see
what's<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.720> what's<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:13.619> i'll

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
up some waves and fitting it to the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.380 
up some waves and fitting it to the
bottom<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.680> have<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.370> riding<00:03:04.730> waves<00:03:04.880> but<00:03:05.209> then

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
bottom and have it riding waves but then

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.979 
bottom and have it riding waves but then
I'm<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.260> really<00:03:06.770> weird<00:03:07.160> gamer<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.970> like<00:03:08.180> weird<00:03:08.720> ah

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.790 
isn't I don't know if you could put 50
dwarves<00:03:47.600> on<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:50.799> but

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.050 

it<00:03:55.800> gives<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.160> an<00:03:56.220> idea<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.390> space<00:03:57.990> I

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
it gives you an idea of the space I

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.340 
it gives you an idea of the space I
really<00:04:00.060> don't<00:04:00.270> know<00:04:00.450> how<00:04:00.780> many<00:04:00.930> dorms<00:04:01.230> you

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
really don't know how many dorms you

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.440 
really don't know how many dorms you
could<00:04:01.470> fit<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:01.770> here<00:04:01.980> I'm<00:04:02.190> guessing<00:04:03.030> somewhere

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
could fit on here I'm guessing somewhere

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.630 
could fit on here I'm guessing somewhere
in<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.600> vicinity<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:06.140> 15<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.290> 25<00:04:07.770> maybe<00:04:08.310> 30

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
in the vicinity of 15 to 25 maybe 30

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.520 
in the vicinity of 15 to 25 maybe 30
tops<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:10.460> but<00:04:11.540> it's<00:04:12.540> just<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.930> really<00:04:13.140> neat

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
tops so but it's just a really neat

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.310 
tops so but it's just a really neat
model<00:04:14.070> um<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:15.000> if<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.210> get<00:04:15.570> your<00:04:15.600> fifty

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
model um and if you get your fifty

model um and if you get your fifty
percent<00:04:16.680> off<00:04:16.890> coupon<00:04:18.200> vomit<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.860> becomes<00:04:20.310> very

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
percent off coupon vomit it becomes very

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.700 
percent off coupon vomit it becomes very

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
reasonable I want to say I picked this

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.320 
reasonable I want to say I picked this
model<00:04:23.160> up<00:04:23.340> for<00:04:23.670> around<00:04:24.920> 15<00:04:25.920> bucks<00:04:26.330> probably

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
less um if I had to throw a guess i was

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.270 
less um if I had to throw a guess i was
probably<00:04:32.960> 24<00:04:33.960> bucks<00:04:34.260> I<00:04:34.530> probably<00:04:34.860> picked<00:04:35.160> it

probably 24 bucks I probably picked it
up<00:04:35.400> for<00:04:35.580> about<00:04:35.700> 12<00:04:36.530> so<00:04:37.700> um<00:04:39.620> look<00:04:40.620> around<00:04:40.980> for

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
up for about 12 so um look around for

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.920 
up for about 12 so um look around for
and<00:04:41.940> i'm<00:04:42.060> not<00:04:42.210> saying<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.510> this<00:04:42.690> is<00:04:42.720> the

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
and i'm not saying that this is the

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.490 
and i'm not saying that this is the
proper<00:04:43.260> scale<00:04:43.590> for<00:04:44.130> humans<00:04:45.060> necessarily<00:04:45.930> but

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
proper scale for humans necessarily but

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.750 
proper scale for humans necessarily but
for<00:04:46.800> dwarfs<00:04:47.490> I<00:04:47.730> really<00:04:48.720> think<00:04:48.960> 1<00:04:49.680> 250<00:04:50.190> scale<00:04:50.550> is

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
for dwarfs I really think 1 250 scale is

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.020 
for dwarfs I really think 1 250 scale is
pretty<00:04:51.120> much<00:04:51.240> dead<00:04:51.630> on<00:04:51.870> so<00:04:52.790> let<00:04:53.790> me<00:04:53.850> know<00:04:53.970> what
