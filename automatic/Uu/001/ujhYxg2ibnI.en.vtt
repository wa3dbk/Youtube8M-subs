tonight<00:00:12.980> we<00:00:13.160> are<00:00:13.250> doing<00:00:13.490> a<00:00:13.879> live

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
tonight we are doing a live

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.080 
tonight we are doing a live
demonstration<00:00:14.629> of<00:00:15.349> a<00:00:15.469> BCI<00:00:16.129> that<00:00:16.610> is<00:00:16.730> a<00:00:16.759> brain

demonstration of a BCI that is a brain

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.720 
demonstration of a BCI that is a brain
computer<00:00:17.599> interface<00:00:18.140> system<00:00:18.619> in<00:00:19.490> which

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
computer interface system in which

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.290 
computer interface system in which
volunteers<00:00:20.539> from<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:20.840> audience<00:00:21.789> are<00:00:22.789> trying

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
volunteers from the audience are trying

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.410 
volunteers from the audience are trying
to<00:00:23.599> play<00:00:23.779> a<00:00:23.810> computer<00:00:24.259> game<00:00:24.939> using<00:00:25.939> a<00:00:26.060> VCI

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
to play a computer game using a VCI

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.579 
to play a computer game using a VCI
system<00:00:27.019> with<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.009> dry<00:00:28.910> electoral<00:00:29.599> EEG<00:00:30.170> cap<00:00:30.380> that

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
system with a dry electoral EEG cap that

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:44.069 
system with a dry electoral EEG cap that
we've<00:00:30.740> developed<00:00:31.039> here<00:00:31.250> at<00:00:31.519> the<00:00:31.580> Institute

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.860 

the<00:00:45.079> steps<00:00:45.350> are<00:00:46.089> first<00:00:47.089> we<00:00:47.329> could<00:00:47.480> have<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.750> put

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
the steps are first we could have to put

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.220 
the steps are first we could have to put
the<00:00:47.899> cattle<00:00:48.230> cap<00:00:48.589> on<00:00:49.180> that<00:00:50.180> with<00:00:50.870> this<00:00:51.019> type<00:00:51.170> of

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
the cattle cap on that with this type of

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.959 
the cattle cap on that with this type of
cap<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:51.649> we've<00:00:51.800> developed<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:52.789> it<00:00:52.879> only

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
cap that we've developed and it only

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:01.779 
cap that we've developed and it only
takes<00:00:53.210> five<00:00:53.480> minutes<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.930> actually<00:00:54.530> do<00:01:00.789> you

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
takes five minutes to actually do you

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.689 
takes five minutes to actually do you
see<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.059> signals<00:01:02.390> are<00:01:02.539> okay<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.799> then<00:01:04.159> starts

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
see the signals are okay and then starts

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.539 
see the signals are okay and then starts
the<00:01:04.789> calibration<00:01:05.750> phase<00:01:06.130> which<00:01:07.130> lasts<00:01:07.490> about

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
the calibration phase which lasts about

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.420 
the calibration phase which lasts about
eight<00:01:07.850> minutes<00:01:08.240> per<00:01:08.600> calibration<00:01:09.409> which<00:01:10.250> is

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
eight minutes per calibration which is

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.749 
eight minutes per calibration which is
exactly<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.930> computer<00:01:12.560> tells<00:01:13.429> the

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
exactly that the computer tells the

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.660 
exactly that the computer tells the
person<00:01:13.940> what<00:01:14.690> type<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.350> mental<00:01:16.009> activity<00:01:16.490> to

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
person what type of mental activity to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.690 
person what type of mental activity to
make<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:20.690> activity<00:01:21.080> here<00:01:21.319> is<00:01:21.440> to<00:01:21.700> either

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
make the activity here is to either

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.230 
make the activity here is to either
first<00:01:23.539> actually<00:01:24.470> move<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.280> fingers<00:01:25.940> of<00:01:25.970> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
first actually move the fingers of the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.219 
first actually move the fingers of the
West<00:01:26.420> hand<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.350> sort<00:01:27.560> of<00:01:27.619> randomly<00:01:28.130> or<00:01:29.110> in<00:01:30.110> the

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
West hand and sort of randomly or in the

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.289 
West hand and sort of randomly or in the
second<00:01:30.560> phase<00:01:30.740> just<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.729> imagine<00:01:32.179> these

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
second phase just to imagine these

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.779 
second phase just to imagine these
movements<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:33.619> other<00:01:33.830> command<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:34.460> we<00:01:34.580> have

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
movements the other command that we have

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.580 
movements the other command that we have
is<00:01:35.030> simply<00:01:35.390> relaxing<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.200> relaxation<00:01:37.069> and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
is simply relaxing and relaxation and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.130 
is simply relaxing and relaxation and
using<00:01:39.590> these<00:01:40.030> combinations<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:41.450> commands<00:01:41.990> in

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
using these combinations of commands in

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.060 
using these combinations of commands in
the<00:01:42.530> end<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.039> goal<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.429> that<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.759> person<00:01:44.240> will

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
the end the goal is that the person will

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.010 
the end the goal is that the person will
control<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.549> computer<00:01:46.939> game<00:01:47.149> just<00:01:47.840> by

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
control the computer game just by

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.410 
control the computer game just by
imaginations<00:01:48.799> of<00:01:48.920> their<00:01:49.149> after<00:01:50.149> finger

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
imaginations of their after finger

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.260 
imaginations of their after finger
movements<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.020> by<00:01:51.770> relaxation<00:01:52.310> giving<00:01:53.119> it<00:01:53.240> a

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
movements and by relaxation giving it a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.120 
movements and by relaxation giving it a
one<00:01:53.630> dimensional<00:01:53.780> control<00:01:54.289> but<00:01:54.649> in<00:01:54.860> two

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
one dimensional control but in two

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:20.640 
one dimensional control but in two
directions

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.600 

is<00:02:21.519> also<00:02:22.739> demonstration<00:02:23.739> of<00:02:23.860> what<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.129> can<00:02:24.340> do

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
is also demonstration of what you can do

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.750 
is also demonstration of what you can do
with<00:02:25.569> an<00:02:25.870> advanced<00:02:26.260> analysis<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.129> these<00:02:27.489> type

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
with an advanced analysis of these type

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.440 
with an advanced analysis of these type
of<00:02:27.989> little<00:02:28.989> tiny<00:02:29.939> currents<00:02:30.939> that<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.269> can

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
of little tiny currents that you can

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.160 
of little tiny currents that you can
measure<00:02:31.959> on<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:33.310> surface<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.959> the
