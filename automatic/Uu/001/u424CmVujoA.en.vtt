00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
because it just it just seems to be the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.420 
because it just it just seems to be the
overall<00:02:36.840> quickest<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.070> have<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.310> wait

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
overall quickest is you have to wait

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.860 
overall quickest is you have to wait
till<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.700> last<00:02:38.730> person<00:02:39.240> completes<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.660> race

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
till the last person completes the race

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.240 
till the last person completes the race
and<00:02:40.140> there's<00:02:40.290> less<00:02:40.500> chance<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.950> people

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
and there's less chance of people

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.750 
and there's less chance of people
wrecking<00:02:41.610> each<00:02:41.760> other<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.240> such<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.760> another

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
wrecking each other and such so another

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.270 
wrecking each other and such so another
cool<00:02:45.060> thing<00:02:45.090> about<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:46.070> everybody<00:02:47.070> gets

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
cool thing about this is everybody gets

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.070 
cool thing about this is everybody gets
it<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.000> only<00:02:48.150> benefit<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.750> getting<00:02:48.780> in

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
it so the only benefit to getting in

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.980 
it so the only benefit to getting in
first<00:02:49.350> second<00:02:50.010> third<00:02:50.160> or<00:02:50.610> fourth<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.120> the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
first second third or fourth is the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.390 
first second third or fourth is the
amount<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.860> amount<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.070> money<00:02:53.280> you're

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
amount of the amount of money you're

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.440 
amount of the amount of money you're
going<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.610> get<00:02:53.700> everyone's<00:02:54.090> going<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.300> get<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
going to get everyone's going to get the

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.030 
going to get everyone's going to get the
same<00:02:54.480> amount<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.960> experience<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:55.890> doesn't

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
same amount of experience so it doesn't

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.410 
same amount of experience so it doesn't
even<00:02:56.190> matter<00:02:56.370> if<00:02:56.520> you<00:02:56.640> get<00:02:56.820> in<00:02:56.940> dead<00:02:57.210> last

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
even matter if you get in dead last

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.150 
even matter if you get in dead last
you're<00:02:58.230> still<00:02:58.440> going<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.590> be<00:02:58.680> leveling<00:02:59.010> up

up<00:04:32.100> if<00:04:32.790> you're<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.060> lower<00:04:33.240> level<00:04:33.510> it<00:04:34.169> would<00:04:34.320> take

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
up if you're a lower level it would take

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.379 
up if you're a lower level it would take
way<00:04:35.250> wale<00:04:35.580> oh<00:04:35.730> I<00:04:35.760> think<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:36.090> did<00:04:36.210> some

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
way wale oh I think I did some

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.150 
way wale oh I think I did some
calculations<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.139> figured<00:04:37.800> out<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:37.919> if<00:04:38.130> you

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
calculations and figured out that if you

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.370 
calculations and figured out that if you
went<00:04:38.400> from<00:04:38.550> 100<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.450> 200<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.050> would<00:04:40.169> take

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
went from 100 to 200 it would take

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.820 
went from 100 to 200 it would take
roughly<00:04:41.310> 30<00:04:41.700> hours<00:04:42.090> 30<00:04:42.720> hours<00:04:43.139> of<00:04:43.290> just<00:04:43.500> doing

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
roughly 30 hours 30 hours of just doing

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.510 
roughly 30 hours 30 hours of just doing
races<00:04:45.080> so<00:04:46.080> I<00:04:46.380> realize<00:04:46.860> lots<00:04:47.070> of<00:04:47.190> people<00:04:47.400> may

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
races so I realize lots of people may

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.760 
races so I realize lots of people may
not<00:04:47.700> enjoy<00:04:48.080> grinding<00:04:49.080> race<00:04:49.230> is<00:04:49.410> over<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:49.710> over

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
not enjoy grinding race is over and over

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.470 
not enjoy grinding race is over and over
and<00:04:49.919> over<00:04:49.980> but<00:04:50.280> if<00:04:50.520> you<00:04:50.970> want<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.210> get<00:04:51.330> some

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
and over but if you want to get some

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.030 
and over but if you want to get some
levels<00:04:51.780> quick<00:04:51.990> this<00:04:52.139> is<00:04:52.260> definitely<00:04:52.860> the

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
levels quick this is definitely the

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.310 
levels quick this is definitely the
fastest<00:04:53.610> fastest<00:04:54.480> method<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.900> get<00:04:55.020> levels<00:04:55.350> so

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
fastest fastest method to get levels so

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.140 
fastest fastest method to get levels so
you<00:04:58.320> do<00:04:58.440> race<00:04:58.680> is<00:04:58.830> going<00:04:58.950> to<00:04:59.010> start<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:02.610> I'll

second place here and they'll prove that

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.770 
second place here and they'll prove that
doesn't<00:05:08.220> even<00:05:08.310> matter<00:05:08.580> what<00:05:09.180> position<00:05:09.360> you're

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
doesn't even matter what position you're

doesn't even matter what position you're
in<00:05:10.340> you<00:05:11.340> can<00:05:11.460> see<00:05:11.639> my<00:05:11.820> XP<00:05:12.150> bar<00:05:12.300> I'm<00:05:13.139> a<00:05:13.169> little

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
in you can see my XP bar I'm a little

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.280 
in you can see my XP bar I'm a little
bit<00:05:13.590> away<00:05:13.680> from<00:05:13.800> two<00:05:14.100> bars<00:05:14.510> so<00:05:15.510> I<00:05:15.540> should<00:05:15.960> go<00:05:16.110> up

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
bit away from two bars so I should go up

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.890 
bit away from two bars so I should go up
to<00:05:16.500> alright<00:05:17.070> we'll<00:05:17.280> go<00:05:17.310> up<00:05:17.639> to<00:05:17.850> a<00:05:18.090> little<00:05:18.690> bit

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
to alright we'll go up to a little bit

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.960 
to alright we'll go up to a little bit
under<00:05:19.260> three<00:05:19.530> bars<00:05:19.740> after<00:05:20.280> this<00:05:20.400> first<00:05:20.669> lap

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
under three bars after this first lap

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.159 
under three bars after this first lap
here<00:05:22.070> we'll<00:05:23.070> just<00:05:23.280> draft

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.300 

another<00:05:28.169> another<00:05:28.530> important<00:05:28.979> thing<00:05:29.070> to<00:05:29.190> know

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
another another important thing to know

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.300 
another another important thing to know
while<00:05:29.520> super<00:05:29.880> cars<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:30.330> bikes<00:05:30.570> are<00:05:31.310> similar

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
while super cars and bikes are similar

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.640 
while super cars and bikes are similar
in<00:05:32.490> speed<00:05:32.820> if<00:05:33.030> you<00:05:33.479> have<00:05:33.660> more<00:05:33.990> people<00:05:34.289> it's

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
in speed if you have more people it's

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.529 
in speed if you have more people it's
definitely<00:05:35.220> going<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.430> be<00:05:35.490> better<00:05:35.729> to<00:05:36.030> do

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
definitely going to be better to do

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.810 
definitely going to be better to do
bikes<00:05:36.810> so<00:05:37.320> there's<00:05:37.500> that<00:05:37.680> huge<00:05:37.979> chunk<00:05:38.400> of<00:05:38.490> XP

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
bikes so there's that huge chunk of XP

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.340 
bikes so there's that huge chunk of XP
OS<00:05:38.910> talking<00:05:39.270> elbowed<00:05:39.539> in<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:39.780> bottom<00:05:40.139> left

OS talking elbowed in the bottom left

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.870 
OS talking elbowed in the bottom left
you<00:05:40.470> can<00:05:40.530> see<00:05:40.620> you've<00:05:41.310> reached<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.639> maximum

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
you can see you've reached the maximum

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.650 
you can see you've reached the maximum
RP<00:05:42.509> for<00:05:42.780> this<00:05:42.930> activity<00:05:43.820> so<00:05:44.820> if<00:05:45.030> you're<00:05:45.389> doing

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
RP for this activity so if you're doing

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.540 
RP for this activity so if you're doing
it<00:05:45.750> with<00:05:45.870> four<00:05:46.080> people<00:05:46.470> I<00:05:46.710> would<00:05:46.770> probably

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
it with four people I would probably

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.700 
it with four people I would probably
stay<00:05:48.030> away<00:05:48.240> from<00:05:48.300> supercars<00:05:49.020> just<00:05:49.350> because

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
stay away from supercars just because

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.670 
stay away from supercars just because
it's<00:05:50.639> going<00:05:50.880> to<00:05:50.940> lead<00:05:51.120> to<00:05:51.150> people<00:05:51.680> crashing

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
it's going to lead to people crashing

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.710 
it's going to lead to people crashing
and<00:05:52.889> people<00:05:53.729> crashing<00:05:54.210> just<00:05:54.389> ultimately

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
and people crashing just ultimately

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.870 
and people crashing just ultimately
makes<00:05:55.560> it<00:05:55.770> slower<00:05:56.220> because<00:05:56.400> you<00:05:56.550> have<00:05:56.669> to<00:05:56.759> wait

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
makes it slower because you have to wait

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.189 
makes it slower because you have to wait
till<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.090> last<00:05:57.120> person<00:05:57.600> to<00:05:57.690> finish<00:05:57.840> the<00:05:58.080> race

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
till the last person to finish the race

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.870 
till the last person to finish the race
before<00:05:58.380> you<00:05:58.590> can<00:05:58.710> continue<00:05:59.190> on<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.610> the<00:05:59.639> next

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
before you can continue on to the next

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.140 
before you can continue on to the next
race<00:06:00.060> and<00:06:00.650> so<00:06:01.650> there<00:06:01.830> you<00:06:01.919> go<00:06:01.949> I<00:06:02.250> was<00:06:02.910> able<00:06:03.030> to

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
race and so there you go I was able to

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.820 
race and so there you go I was able to
get<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.330> XP<00:06:03.660> boost<00:06:03.870> I<00:06:04.080> wasn't<00:06:04.500> even<00:06:04.620> then

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
get the XP boost I wasn't even then

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.980
