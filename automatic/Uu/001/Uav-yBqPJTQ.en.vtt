 this same act of cowardice and freshness 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.339
 but I do not know what 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:15.190
 the coolness is to say 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.869
 we are able to test 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:18.800
 to do 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.279
 to create situations 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.230
 to the extent that we believe that everything is lost 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.489
 and so we manage to turn things around with that 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.729
 while six real weather ponds is not really even why not 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.210

 I bought this breakdown 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.520
 not yet 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.090
 a real sense of the word 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.320
 but I think at the time of the facts the coolness is good 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.620
 people are having fun with their eyes closed 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.000
 it's only that the rubicon is forgetting that people otherwise 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.780
 fatherhood and commanding 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.430
 110 m hurdles address which consists of a flash 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.430

 the radio 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.930
 in the end that what I had to make pale not much even though 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.330
 this is the case of the actions 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.450
 you have to run when you have to sink pamart to almost 100 meters but 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.260
 I'm going to the opposite a real dead end
