bit silky not too much but this grave is
good<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.660> think<00:03:31.050> I'm<00:03:31.290> going<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.470> add<00:03:31.590> some<00:03:31.860> of

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
good I think I'm going to add some of

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.530 
good I think I'm going to add some of
water<00:03:32.220> in<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.520> that<00:03:33.120> should<00:03:33.300> be<00:03:33.420> good

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
water in this that should be good

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.660 
water in this that should be good
because<00:03:34.230> once<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.590> add<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.739> potatoes<00:03:35.250> some

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
because once you add the potatoes some

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.970 
because once you add the potatoes some
of<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.910> moisture<00:03:36.239> will<00:03:36.270> be<00:03:36.510> sucked<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.739> by<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
of the moisture will be sucked in by the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.790 
of the moisture will be sucked in by the
potatoes<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:41.390> now<00:03:42.390> once<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.410> add<00:03:43.560> these

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
potatoes and now once you add these

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.940 
potatoes and now once you add these
potatoes<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.700> eggs<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:46.050> know<00:03:46.170> already<00:03:46.500> eggs

minutes
they're<00:03:50.730> going<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.910> become<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.720> know<00:03:51.810> the
