can kind of see glimpses of it while I'm
jumping<00:00:55.559> around<00:00:56.000> where<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.420> step<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.840> it

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
jumping around where if you step in it

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.470 
jumping around where if you step in it
you<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.199> instantly<00:00:58.800> die<00:00:59.100> which<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.030> don't

you like instantly die which I don't
like<00:01:00.660> these<00:01:00.809> I've<00:01:01.020> accidentally<00:01:01.949> stepped<00:01:02.280> in

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
like these I've accidentally stepped in

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.210 
like these I've accidentally stepped in
it<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> few<00:01:02.879> times<00:01:02.940> over<00:01:03.449> some<00:01:04.220> failed

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it a few times over some failed

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.730 
it a few times over some failed
recordings<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.090> trying<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.330> get<00:01:06.740> so

recordings that I was trying to get so
it<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.490> annoying<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.860> guess<00:01:10.860> it's

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it is kind of annoying and I guess it's

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.990 
it is kind of annoying and I guess it's
just<00:01:11.100> something<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:11.820> used

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
just something that we have to get used

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.050 
just something that we have to get used
to<00:01:12.240> specifically<00:01:13.080> me<00:01:13.350> because<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:14.010> not<00:01:14.909> good

so yeah to the next map so the next map

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.249 
so yeah to the next map so the next map
is<00:01:28.409> called<00:01:29.040> extinction<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:30.000> as<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:31.110> name

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
everywhere you can see their skeletal

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.760 
everywhere you can see their skeletal
remains<00:01:35.970> which<00:01:36.540> are<00:01:36.960> phone<00:01:37.140> around<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.530> dance

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
remains which are phone around to dance

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.760 
remains which are phone around to dance
on<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.280> kill<00:01:39.240> other<00:01:39.450> people<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.619> is

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
on and kill other people in so this is

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.350 
on and kill other people in so this is
basically<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.369> one<00:01:41.670> big<00:01:41.820> island<00:01:42.210> surrounded

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
basically like one big island surrounded

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.840 
basically like one big island surrounded
by<00:01:42.689> other<00:01:42.960> islands<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.250> big<00:01:44.430> island<00:01:44.759> in

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
by other islands but the big island in

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.749 
by other islands but the big island in
the<00:01:44.909> middle<00:01:45.060> has<00:01:45.630> an<00:01:45.840> island<00:01:46.200> inside<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.920> so

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the middle has an island inside it so

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.899 
the middle has an island inside it so
I'll<00:01:48.119> inception<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.159> I<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.460> these<00:01:50.610> wide

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
I'll inception and I like these wide

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.060 
I'll inception and I like these wide
open<00:01:51.299> areas<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.810> sky<00:01:52.140> lands<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.619> example

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
open areas like sky lands for example

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.429 
open areas like sky lands for example
like<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:53.970> run<00:01:54.299> around<00:01:54.420> freely<00:01:55.079> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439

they had even more flowers so it could

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.280 
they had even more flowers so it could
be<00:02:35.580> like<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.910> little<00:02:36.570> more<00:02:36.630> obvious<00:02:36.870> there<00:02:37.170> was

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
be like a little more obvious there was

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.160 
be like a little more obvious there was
a<00:02:37.320> garden<00:02:37.650> but<00:02:37.890> yeah<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.630> pretty<00:02:39.780> cool

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
a garden but yeah this is a pretty cool

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.750 
a garden but yeah this is a pretty cool
nap<00:02:40.440> not<00:02:40.650> my<00:02:41.220> most<00:02:42.000> favorite<00:02:42.570> but<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.250> do<00:02:44.250> like

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
nap not my most favorite but I do like

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.970 
nap not my most favorite but I do like
the<00:02:45.060> mushrooms<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.780> they<00:02:45.930> added<00:02:46.080> in<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.590> don't

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
the mushrooms that they added in I don't

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.170 
the mushrooms that they added in I don't
know<00:02:47.040> if<00:02:47.130> it's<00:02:47.220> because<00:02:47.370> I'm<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.610> mooshroom<00:02:47.970> or

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
know if it's because I'm a mooshroom or

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.240 
know if it's because I'm a mooshroom or
something<00:02:48.510> but<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.840> just<00:02:49.260> really<00:02:49.350> like<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.190> a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
something but I just really like that a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.400 
something but I just really like that a
little<00:02:50.400> extra<00:02:50.880> thing<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.780> they<00:02:51.900> did<00:02:51.959> there<00:02:52.260> I

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
little extra thing that they did there I

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.500 
little extra thing that they did there I
think<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.400> would<00:02:53.519> like<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:53.790> map<00:02:54.000> more<00:02:54.269> if

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
think I would like this map more if

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.180 
think I would like this map more if
there<00:02:54.780> were<00:02:54.870> like<00:02:55.050> less<00:02:55.350> trees<00:02:55.739> in<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.040> way

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
there were like less trees in the way

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.790 
there were like less trees in the way
and<00:02:56.430> more<00:02:56.850> flowers<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:58.170> way<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.410> would<00:02:58.500> be

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
and more flowers that way it would be

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.500 
and more flowers that way it would be
more<00:02:59.040> like<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.610> garden<00:02:59.970> like<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.209> stereotypical

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
more like a garden like a stereotypical

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.229 
more like a garden like a stereotypical
garden<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:02.640> way<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.760> could<00:03:02.880> run<00:03:03.120> around

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
garden and that way I could run around

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.930 
garden and that way I could run around
more<00:03:03.630> freely<00:03:04.110> which<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.920> do<00:03:05.190> like<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.519> do<00:03:05.760> in

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
more freely which I do like to do in

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.530 
more freely which I do like to do in
these<00:03:06.060> maps<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.860> yeah<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:08.760> map<00:03:09.000> basically<00:03:09.480> is

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
these maps so yeah this map basically is

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.440 
these maps so yeah this map basically is
like<00:03:09.630> one<00:03:10.170> giant<00:03:10.200> weird<00:03:11.070> oddly<00:03:11.670> shaped<00:03:11.700> island

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
like one giant weird oddly shaped island

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.449 
like one giant weird oddly shaped island
in<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.630> middle<00:03:12.750> with<00:03:13.500> like<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.830> few<00:03:14.130> holes<00:03:14.310> in
