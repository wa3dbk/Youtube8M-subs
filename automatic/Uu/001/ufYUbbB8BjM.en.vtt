00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
rolling so you want to start on the edge

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.499 
rolling so you want to start on the edge
and<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> nice<00:01:28.200> good<00:01:28.890> cut<00:01:29.280> there<00:01:29.549> we're

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and get a nice good cut there we're

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.249 
and get a nice good cut there we're
going<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.200> couple<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.869> want<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.170> get

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
going to do a couple and you want to get

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.679 
going to do a couple and you want to get
them<00:01:34.470> close<00:01:34.860> together<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.360> you're<00:01:36.509> not

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
them close together so that you're not

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.990 
them close together so that you're not
having<00:01:37.170> lots<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.770> wasted<00:01:38.310> dough<00:01:38.520> around<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
having lots of wasted dough around the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.080 
having lots of wasted dough around the
edges<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> easiest<00:01:40.770> way<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.040> take<00:01:41.850> them

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
edges so the easiest way to take them

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.170 
edges so the easiest way to take them
off<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:43.770> pull<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.280> dough<00:01:44.460> away<00:01:44.790> from<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
off is to pull the dough away from the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.870 
off is to pull the dough away from the
cutting<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.189> put<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.460> back<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.790> your
