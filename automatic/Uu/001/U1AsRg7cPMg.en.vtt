right here ok and I've got two receivers
the<00:03:03.610> number<00:03:03.850> 2<00:03:04.030> engine

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
the number 2 engine

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.640 
the number 2 engine
the<00:03:05.380> number<00:03:05.650> 2<00:03:05.830> engine<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.370> being<00:03:06.580> fed<00:03:07.440> by<00:03:08.440> one

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
the number 2 engine is being fed by one

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.250 
the number 2 engine is being fed by one
receiver<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.340> dealing<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.030> then<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.300> one<00:03:11.110> in

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
receiver is dealing and then the one in

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.040 
receiver is dealing and then the one in
three<00:03:11.590> engines<00:03:12.010> are<00:03:12.280> by<00:03:12.610> another<00:03:12.880> receiver<00:03:13.270> so

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
three engines are by another receiver so

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.229 
three engines are by another receiver so
and<00:03:14.320> I've<00:03:14.410> got<00:03:14.620> our<00:03:14.800> weighted<00:03:15.580> down<00:03:15.730> with<00:03:16.000> two

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
and I've got our weighted down with two

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.420 
and I've got our weighted down with two
two<00:03:16.870> bricks<00:03:17.170> right<00:03:17.440> here

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.530 

alright<00:03:24.430> let's<00:03:24.640> light<00:03:24.879> her<00:03:24.970> up<00:03:25.000> let's<00:03:25.390> see

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
alright let's light her up let's see

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.490 
alright let's light her up let's see
what<00:03:25.659> she's<00:03:25.810> got<00:03:27.540> I'm<00:03:28.540> mainly<00:03:28.810> looking<00:03:29.200> for<00:03:29.470> a

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
what she's got I'm mainly looking for a

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.680 
what she's got I'm mainly looking for a
synchronization<00:03:30.040> I'm<00:03:30.610> looking<00:03:31.030> for<00:03:31.239> heat

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.830 

making<00:03:34.380> sure<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.680> batteries<00:03:35.070> don't<00:03:35.220> heat<00:03:35.460> up

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
making sure the batteries don't heat up

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.510 
making sure the batteries don't heat up
this<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:37.020> the<00:03:37.140> test<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:37.860> is<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.040> test<00:03:38.130> you

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789 
tests I know that sometimes you guys

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.149 
tests I know that sometimes you guys
want<00:06:59.509> to<00:06:59.599> see<00:06:59.749> flying<00:07:00.050> and<00:07:00.680> you<00:07:00.740> want<00:07:00.949> to<00:07:01.039> see

maybes<00:07:01.550> I<00:07:01.819> do<00:07:02.149> too<00:07:02.479> but<00:07:03.169> this<00:07:03.379> is<00:07:03.709> the<00:07:04.009> number

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:04.339 
maybes I do too but this is the number

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:05.920 
maybes I do too but this is the number
one<00:07:04.550> thing<00:07:04.819> that<00:07:04.969> you<00:07:05.029> have<00:07:05.209> to<00:07:05.389> do<00:07:05.479> you<00:07:05.899> have
