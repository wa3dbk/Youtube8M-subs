00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
and that really seems weird to me I mean

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.020 
and that really seems weird to me I mean
let's<00:00:13.500> start<00:00:13.799> as<00:00:13.950> basic<00:00:14.280> as<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:14.519> can<00:00:14.670> get

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
let's start as basic as we can get

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.210 
let's start as basic as we can get
what<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.389> Secret<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.900> Mana<00:00:16.020> at<00:00:16.320> its<00:00:16.500> core<00:00:16.800> well

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
what is Secret of Mana at its core well

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.760 
what is Secret of Mana at its core well
it's<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.789> nonlinear<00:00:18.390> beat-em-up<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.410> wander

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
it's a nonlinear beat-em-up you wander

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.590 
it's a nonlinear beat-em-up you wander
around<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.160> huge<00:00:20.400> map<00:00:20.670> using<00:00:21.060> all<00:00:21.210> sorts<00:00:21.539> of

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
around a huge map using all sorts of

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.090 
around a huge map using all sorts of
different<00:00:21.779> weapons<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.320> destroy<00:00:22.470> enemies

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
different weapons to destroy enemies

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.920 
different weapons to destroy enemies
from<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.550> top-down<00:00:23.910> perspective<00:00:23.970> much<00:00:24.750> like

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
from a top-down perspective much like

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.660 
from a top-down perspective much like
link<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> past<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.680> illusion<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.130> Gaia

link to the past and illusion of Gaia

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.400 
link to the past and illusion of Gaia
so<00:00:26.970> how<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:27.510> overrated<00:00:27.869> seems

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
so how can that be overrated seems

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.109 
so how can that be overrated seems
pretty<00:00:28.560> simple<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.130> pretty<00:00:29.160> satisfying<00:00:29.849> it

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
pretty simple and pretty satisfying it

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.580 
pretty simple and pretty satisfying it
does<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> fundamental<00:00:30.900> things<00:00:31.109> really<00:00:31.410> well

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
does the fundamental things really well

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
does the fundamental things really well
like<00:00:31.859> hit<00:00:32.040> detection<00:00:32.309> sound<00:00:32.940> colourful

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
like hit detection sound colourful

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.630 
like hit detection sound colourful
graphics<00:00:33.710> variety<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.739> enemies<00:00:34.980> huge

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
graphics variety of enemies huge

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.430 
graphics variety of enemies huge
challenging<00:00:36.239> bosses<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> sheer<00:00:37.290> amount

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
challenging bosses and the sheer amount

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440 
challenging bosses and the sheer amount
of<00:00:37.559> weapons<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.520> use<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
of weapons that you can use I think the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.600 
of weapons that you can use I think the
problem<00:00:39.780> comes<00:00:40.020> from<00:00:40.079> skewed<00:00:40.620> expectations

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
problem comes from skewed expectations

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.310 
problem comes from skewed expectations
it<00:00:41.850> would<00:00:41.969> seem<00:00:42.149> people<00:00:42.510> are<00:00:42.629> expecting<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.170> big

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
it would seem people are expecting a big

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.350 
it would seem people are expecting a big
ginormous<00:00:43.620> sweeping<00:00:44.399> story<00:00:44.730> along<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> same

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
ginormous sweeping story along the same

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.270 
ginormous sweeping story along the same
lines<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:46.050> Chrono<00:00:46.350> Trigger<00:00:46.410> or<00:00:46.920> Final

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
lines as like Chrono Trigger or Final

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.639 
lines as like Chrono Trigger or Final
Fantasy<00:00:47.640> 6<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> case

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
Fantasy 6 but that's really not the case

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.709 
Fantasy 6 but that's really not the case
in<00:00:50.399> other<00:00:50.489> words<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.910> think<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.329> game<00:00:51.480> suffers

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
in other words I think this game suffers

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.330 
in other words I think this game suffers
from<00:00:51.960> hype<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.530> same<00:00:52.710> way<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.980> Super<00:00:53.309> Mario

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
from hype the same way that Super Mario

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.729 
from hype the same way that Super Mario
RPG<00:00:53.699> does<00:00:54.300> those<00:00:54.719> two<00:00:54.899> games<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.289> lumped<00:00:55.649> in

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
RPG does those two games get lumped in

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.860 
RPG does those two games get lumped in
alongside<00:00:56.070> all<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> big-name<00:00:56.940> heavy-hitting

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
until the last hour or so when it really

you<00:01:22.560> got<00:01:22.680> your<00:01:22.830> token<00:01:23.130> female<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.850> you've<00:01:24.000> got

you got your token female and you've got

you got your token female and you've got
the<00:01:24.299> sprite<00:01:24.720> who's<00:01:24.990> kind<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.590> smartass<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the sprite who's kind of a smartass I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.219 
the sprite who's kind of a smartass I
guess<00:01:26.580> that's<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.330> about<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.570> while<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
guess that's really about it while the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.660 
guess that's really about it while the
characters<00:01:28.590> aren't<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.829> most<00:01:28.979> dynamic<00:01:29.220> what
