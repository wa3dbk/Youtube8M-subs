 santa fe la hyundai santa fe a vehicle 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.090
 that if you allow me before they 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.120
 explain how the car says I them 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.390
 I give my driving impressions to me 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.480
 It's surprising because it's an all- road vehicle 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.910
 show road are not off-road however yes 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.720
 that behaves practically with some 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.420
 road in conditions or we made almost 200 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.910
 kilometers in very difficult conditions 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.020
 mud snow stones earrings climbs 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.489
 descents 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.010
 the version commented as I said does a 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.570
 with automatic box that for a matter 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.629
 of caution I put it in a manual 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.120
 first and second and sincerely with a 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.190
 system of passages of changes that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.619
 practically does not realize what it gives 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.899
 a lot of security called me a lot 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.119
 Attention also the soundproofing of the 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.590
 vehicle vehicle that within itself and 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.420
 another grant that I'm a fan of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.100
 diesel I always have a bit of the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.659
 prohibition of getting into rare lands 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.939
 as gasoline engines 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.429
 embargo of 2.4 this truck will 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.319
 involves a very natural circumstance that 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.789
 has an excellent torque from below now 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:32.130
 yes I wish you the word good to all 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:34.619
 you want good not what I wanted 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.030
 highlight the new holy faith with the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.209
 holy old faith with holy faith a 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.299
 until this new hyundai model had 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:44.369
 much success has been sold very well and the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.020
 model to good is very is very successful and 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.060
 people are very happy then the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.700
 mark what I try to do is try to 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.610
 further improve what was already good and 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.069
 work in certain aspects on the one hand 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.719
 functional on the other hand aesthetic for 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.030
 that the model can offer much more than 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.979
 what he was already offering is very 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.140
 comfortable inside is not a vehicle 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.049
 for all terrain the comfort that has 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.629
 if we say that the concept of this 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.420
 vehicle is based on it being a 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.609
 truck with the functionality of a 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.310
 fool and with the possibility of driving 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:19.620
 off-road from let's say up to a certain level 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.480
 as you have expressed very well but for 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.489
 another side with comfort 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
 and driving and the inner comfort of a 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.459
 sedan 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.190
 that is the concept that was sought then 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.780
 it's trying not to be a tank 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.819
 of war 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.890
 and that for the daily use that the 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.440
 most people most of the 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.450
 time is a very comfortable car and a 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.000
 car that does not spend too much fuel 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.620
 that is well soundproofed and that we are 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.810
 gains are the pillars more 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.430
 important investments good we have 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.800
 two versions as in the version 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.170
 that in the previous model we started with 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.940
 four- by- two versions with a box 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.160
 six - speed manual and a box 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.430
 Six-speed automatic after 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.770
 4x4 went through five versions and 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.050
 seven seats all these with the engine 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.300
 naphtero you were mentioning 2.4 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.540
 then we have an aberration they say with 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.989
 a 200 horsepower 2.2 engine that is 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.670
 automatic 7 seats and 4x4 all this 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.880
 accompanied with a box also 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.230
 possibility of 6 automatic gears 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.150
 Traction control direct connection 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.030
 so that it fits on all four wheels 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.190
 block counts I tell you that this 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.110
 vehicle has a traction system 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.690
 Smart usually has traction 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.730
 front when you really need it 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.769
 It is smart enough to realize 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.040
 it by questioning and transferring 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.330
 part of the traction back 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.630
 mean something is that it makes the 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.550
 handling is easy maybe too easy 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.350
 and can not get confused but 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.750
 I really congratulate you in meters 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.450

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.310
