00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
egg trays they're really stout and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.590 
egg trays they're really stout and
they're<00:02:00.240> tough<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:01.399> it<00:02:02.399> holds<00:02:02.579> 30<00:02:02.909> eggs<00:02:03.240> on

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
they're tough but it holds 30 eggs on

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.370 
they're tough but it holds 30 eggs on
the<00:02:03.780> tray<00:02:04.079> inch-and-a-half<00:02:04.740> PBC<00:02:06.380> measure

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the tray inch-and-a-half PBC measure

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.320 
the tray inch-and-a-half PBC measure
about<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.160> width<00:02:08.399> these<00:02:08.789> things<00:02:09.060> are

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
about this width these things are

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.210 
about this width these things are
they're<00:02:09.750> concave<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.500> right<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:10.890> like<00:02:11.039> this

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
they're concave in right here like this

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.640 
they're concave in right here like this
so

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
so

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.210 
so
this<00:02:11.739> pipe<00:02:12.010> sits<00:02:12.040> in<00:02:12.519> here<00:02:12.720> really<00:02:13.720> good<00:02:14.010> as<00:02:15.010> an

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
this pipe sits in here really good as an

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.789 
this pipe sits in here really good as an
example<00:02:15.549> inside<00:02:16.120> your<00:02:16.360> incubator<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:17.680> is

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
example inside your incubator this is

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:18.720 
example inside your incubator this is
going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.040> sit<00:02:18.159> on<00:02:18.189> the<00:02:18.340> bottom<00:02:18.549> of<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
going to sit on the bottom of the

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.009 
going to sit on the bottom of the
incubator<00:02:19.120> just<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.569> this<00:02:19.659> right<00:02:19.840> here

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
incubator just like this right here

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.410 
incubator just like this right here
works<00:02:20.739> like<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.920> seesaw<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.970> put<00:02:22.120> your<00:02:22.239> thirty

works like a seesaw you put your thirty
eggs<00:02:22.599> on<00:02:22.900> here<00:02:23.170> then<00:02:24.040> whenever<00:02:24.189> it<00:02:24.340> comes<00:02:24.459> time

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
eggs on here then whenever it comes time

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.509 
eggs on here then whenever it comes time
to<00:02:24.760> turn<00:02:25.060> them<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.720> just<00:02:25.959> push<00:02:26.829> down<00:02:26.860> one<00:02:27.280> side

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
to turn them you just push down one side

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.929 
to turn them you just push down one side
thirty<00:02:28.120> eggs<00:02:28.329> turned<00:02:28.950> reverse<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.159> later<00:02:30.849> on

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
thirty eggs turned reverse it later on

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:36.270 
thirty eggs turned reverse it later on
boom<00:02:31.900> thirty<00:02:32.890> eggs<00:02:33.099> turned<00:02:33.930> okay<00:02:35.189> very<00:02:36.189> simple

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
boom thirty eggs turned okay very simple

boom thirty eggs turned okay very simple
whenever<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.909> comes<00:02:37.060> time<00:02:37.359> to<00:02:37.420> hatch

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
whenever it comes time to hatch

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.069 
whenever it comes time to hatch

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
you just pull your eggs up slide your

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.170 
you just pull your eggs up slide your
pivot<00:02:41.349> out<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.739> PVC<00:02:42.159> out<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.519> lay<00:02:42.819> these<00:02:43.000> in

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
the bottom of your incubator and in

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.610 
the bottom of your incubator and in
hatch<00:02:45.220> in<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:46.060> tray<00:02:46.299> that's<00:02:46.540> what<00:02:46.659> we<00:02:46.750> do<00:02:46.959> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
hatch in the tray that's what we do the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.020 
hatch in the tray that's what we do the
chicks<00:02:47.889> seem<00:02:48.129> to<00:02:48.250> fare<00:02:48.400> better<00:02:48.459> whenever<00:02:48.970> we

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
chicks seem to fare better whenever we

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.460 
chicks seem to fare better whenever we
do<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.329> that's<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.810> way<00:02:49.900> we<00:02:50.079> do<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.379> and

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
do that that's just the way we do it and

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.229 
do that that's just the way we do it and

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
you can leave all 30 of them in the tray

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.490 
you can leave all 30 of them in the tray
and<00:02:52.359> let's<00:02:52.480> let<00:02:52.599> them<00:02:52.690> hatch<00:02:52.870> out<00:02:53.049> of<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.260> tray

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
and let's let them hatch out of the tray

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.759 
and let's let them hatch out of the tray
if<00:02:54.159> fall<00:02:54.900> we're<00:02:55.900> gonna<00:02:56.049> wrap<00:02:56.230> this<00:02:56.379> thing<00:02:56.439> up

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
if fall we're gonna wrap this thing up

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.569 
if fall we're gonna wrap this thing up
here<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.389> way<00:02:58.510> we<00:02:58.689> do<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.019> so<00:02:59.980> on<00:03:00.250> this

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
here this is the way we do it so on this

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.970 
here this is the way we do it so on this
this<00:03:01.030> size<00:03:01.269> incubator<00:03:01.780> these<00:03:01.959> will<00:03:02.200> stack<00:03:02.590> but

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
this size incubator these will stack but

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.640 
this size incubator these will stack but
for<00:03:03.609> this<00:03:03.730> size<00:03:03.970> box<00:03:04.359> you<00:03:05.319> don't<00:03:05.379> need<00:03:05.560> to

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
for this size box you don't need to

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.509 
for this size box you don't need to
stack<00:03:05.829> them<00:03:05.980> any<00:03:06.099> higher<00:03:06.280> then<00:03:07.560> than<00:03:08.560> just<00:03:08.799> one

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
stack them any higher then than just one

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.809 
stack them any higher then than just one
one<00:03:10.209> tray<00:03:10.450> high<00:03:10.659> which<00:03:10.989> is<00:03:11.139> thirty<00:03:11.379> and<00:03:11.819> I've

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
one tray high which is thirty and I've

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.449 
one tray high which is thirty and I've
got<00:03:13.060> some<00:03:13.329> that<00:03:13.629> will<00:03:13.780> stack<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.319> top<00:03:15.129> which

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
got some that will stack to top which

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.280 
got some that will stack to top which
would<00:03:15.639> be<00:03:15.790> sixty<00:03:16.510> eggs<00:03:16.690> in<00:03:17.139> each<00:03:17.859> tray<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:19.290> so

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
would be sixty eggs in each tray and so

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.069 
would be sixty eggs in each tray and so
we<00:03:21.220> got<00:03:21.459> our<00:03:21.699> on<00:03:21.910> let<00:03:22.389> me<00:03:22.419> see<00:03:22.510> with<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.930> light
