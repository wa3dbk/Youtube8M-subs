00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello I have nautas although many of 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.460
 you already know him on the day of 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.379
 today we are going to present you playstation plus 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.389
 a service for playstation 3 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.639
 playstation 4 and playstation vita that we 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.639
 offers interesting options we started 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.320
 well what is playstation plus what 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.090
 that you see on the screen a service 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.490
 integrated inside the playstation store 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.529
 that will allow us to improve a lot 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.930
 our gaming experience since we 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.610
 offers exclusive functions at the level of 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.680
 game and also other discounts 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.360
 interesting that we can apply in 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.820
 other games but we will only go a little bit 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.320
 later on it is to say that the main 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.910
 playstation plus trump card is that we 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.480
 allows you to create a collection of 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.579
 videogames of up to 45 titles a year and 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.200
 basically roughly highlight 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.720
 which is kind of like a video store 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.579
 virtual in which we can download 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.920
 a series of games that we can 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.050
 play whenever we are subscribed is 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.120
 say they will be installed on the hard drive and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.270
 while we have the subscription 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.280
 activated we can play we can not play 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.259
 when it's finished but in the event that 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.700
 we would have reactivated it we will have 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.710
 available games because as we have 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.710
 said are inside the hard drive 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.550
 good among the main advantages that 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.990
 offers us playstation plus 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.180
 Obviously, it should be noted that 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.670
 offers us great games very games 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.470
 recognized that obviously are not the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 newer ones on the market but yes that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.340
 They have a great reputation among 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.380
 among users as you can see 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.770
 bioshock infinite is a pretty game 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.960
 good and as uncharted 3 or is it one of 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.940
 the great playstation 3 games and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.650
 as you see we would have to enter and give 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.780
 to download you can see that it's free 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.820
 precisely because we are the fucking masters 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.800
 and we have downloaded the playstation 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.410
 plus we have it and so we could 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.420
 download the game on the other hand what 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.990
 advantages also offers us the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.180
 can use or download games 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.400
 exclusive in this case we are talking 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.950
 of developed games unique and 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.560
 exclusively for playstation the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.660
 recognized indies and not only that but 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.180
 also that we could download 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.910
 classic games or playstation games 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.700
 one or the minis as they are called 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.020
 on the other hand playstation us most 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.960
 offers play station 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.450
 the possibility to download see you 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.160
 before other people is to say by 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.990
 example if the fifa leaves a 15 of 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.520
 September normally well maybe 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.470
 We could have it on September 12 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.500
 we could be three days taking advantage 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.750
 plus the demo also offers us the 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.910
 possibility of playing complete games 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.220
 for 60 minutes that is to say it would be a 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.680
 kind of test to be able then what 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.780
 It will be played at the times registered during 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.240
 60 minutes and the good thing about this is that 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.590
 it will also allow us to save the progress 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.300
 and at the moment when we 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.880
 we will buy the game we would have that 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.350
 progress already advanced also we 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.350
 offers the possibility to download the 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.810
 dynamic themes and another set of things 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.300
 to customize the playstation and 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.130
 highlight very important especially the 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.020
 fact that you can share the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.630
 It has other users of its own 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.580
 console is to say if I download the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.580
 playstation plus for a month or 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.930
 for three or twelve months can not only 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.810
 use me but so can 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.819
 use my brother with his own account 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.040
 anyone who may have access to 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.200
 playstation 3 to 4 for you 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.410
 you want you can use the playstation 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.510
 plus 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.430
 good and what disadvantages have 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.350
 playstation plus because the first one is more 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.020
 evident as we said go 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.370
 appearing games on the list but what 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.130
 it can happen then that you can find 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.690
 with games that seem incredible or 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.790
 days later you find games 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.310
 you are a fucking shit that is that 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.540
 those empty ones you can find games 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.220
 as we said as the charter 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.140
 Serbian or with the meter and the day 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.240
 next for not putting names but 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.370
 soccer simulators that you think 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.260
 pretty bad things and say it 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.080
 then it is advisable in this sense 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.120
 go visiting often the page to the 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.100
 list of games that there are then for 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.080
 that you can find the game that you 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.470
 interest and do not miss the opportunity to 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.510
 can play it on the other hand say how 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.430
 we have already commented before that if you 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.620
 finish the subscription because you can not 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.960
 play the games will be installed 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.310
 inside the hard drive but no matter how much 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.930
 you give it to the X, he's going to tell you 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.520
 Nanai from China that you can not play 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.040
 because you are not subscribed and do not try 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.959
 cheat by changing the date because it has 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.360
 an own accountant that is can not be 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.400
 cheat the playstation plus system 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.800
 Finally, also highlight the capacity 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.629
 it can become a problem 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.150
 in playstation plus that is if we have 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:37.379
 a playstation of the old ones with 40 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.300
 gb or even 60 can get to be little 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:41.159
 the ability because I know games 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.659
 as for example the mass effect 3 that 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.520
 has also been on the list in some 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.199
 that another occasion with accessories and 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.569
 others go up to 20 gigabytes is 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.210
 say you have to keep in mind that if you do not 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:54.690
 you have a playstation of minimum ones not 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.370
 I know 120 GB, you will not be able to get all the 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.669
 party to this playstation service 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.669
 plus 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.690
 well we went to talk about price 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.190
 surely if you have been watching me 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.140
 and how I moved around here you will have 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.510
 seen but good anyway highlight 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.580
 that for seven euros we can play 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.680
 for a month for fifteen euros we can 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.180
 play three months and for fifty euros 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.610
 we can play for a year as is 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.520
 evident the longer it is, the more 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.010
 cheap you get in proportion to all 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.510
 the question is is it profitable 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.820
 playstation plus good 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.320
 Obviously it is if you have time if 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.660
 you have capacity on the hard drive and if 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.070
 you are willing to pay this price but 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.170
 anyway, it's also important 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.000
 emphasize that within the price you 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.920
 includes a series of discounts as 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.130
 we have commented before on some games 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.080
 as you can see in this tab discounts 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.570
 additional as we enter a series 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.880
 in another list of games in which 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.070
 we could pay less and you would like them if 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.110
 we wanted to buy them, that is, as 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.030
 You see, if we have the final fantasy 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.060
 7 or 8 because instead of five euros 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.740
 because for 449 hey fifty cents are 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.450
 50 cents gives for a bag of pipes 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.400
 well it 's good to have it in 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.470
 account anyway as we said 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.569
 before it's also important that you go 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.969
 often entering this one 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:10.520
 to see if there are some games that are 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:14.110
 rather more expensive than later you can 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.110
 apply an interesting discount 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.340
 well conclusions that he offers us or that 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.470
 gives us playstation plus as 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.240
 we have discussed the possibility of having 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.250
 at our disposal a wide range 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.230
 of games that although they are not the most 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.030
 new market are still large 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.180
 titles like for example the uncharted the 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.980
 visual or even the metro is important 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.120
 emphasize that perhaps these games 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.550
 you can find in the market of 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.980
 second hand then for 20-25 euros but 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.990
 hey that better than paying the price of two 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.820
 of these second- hand games and have 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.130
 for a year then the possibility of 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.340
 play these and many other games 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.590
 quite recognized anyway if 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.690
 you think the price is expensive if you do not have 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.820
 Time does not have the necessary capacity 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.410
 in your playstation, yes, I would tell you 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.090
 hey, I recommend you buy a 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.310
 60 euros game like for example the 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.320
 fifa that you are going to amortize a lot and that 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.140
 you're going to get more out of it than all 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.880
 these games that you will have to value 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.710
 us in function then that of yours 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.900
 desire to play your time of 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.490
 your money and your capacity in 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.440
 the playstation 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.900
 saying this, it only remains to say goodbye 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.430
 although not without telling you that 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.229
 live to our channel if you do not 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.660
 you have done since you visit our 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:25.250
 tecno nauta dotcom website and that you 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.479
 I like this video obviously 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.479
 until the next video
