00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
example this year corners was just if

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.870 
example this year corners was just if
you<00:01:52.140> did<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> corner<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.220> if<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.399> crossed<00:01:53.700> it

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
you did a corner but if you crossed it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.940 
you did a corner but if you crossed it
you<00:01:54.030> would<00:01:54.149> score<00:01:54.450> every<00:01:54.840> time<00:01:54.869> I'm<00:01:55.470> not<00:01:55.710> sure

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
you would score every time I'm not sure

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.499 
you would score every time I'm not sure
if<00:01:56.520> we're<00:01:56.700> going<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.090> something<00:01:57.270> like

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
if we're going to get something like

whole game it will actually be or it

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.900 
whole game it will actually be or it
will<00:02:10.259> actually<00:02:10.410> be<00:02:10.619> marks<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> grass<00:02:11.489> and

what was it actually I think it's going
to<00:02:20.110> be<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.950> console<00:02:21.340> yet<00:02:21.550> they<00:02:21.730> correspond

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
to be the console yet they correspond

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.030 
to be the console yet they correspond
election<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.600> be<00:02:22.690> shaking<00:02:23.200> right<00:02:23.320> now<00:02:23.380> which

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
election to be shaking right now which

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.280 
election to be shaking right now which
is<00:02:24.070> quite<00:02:24.400> cool<00:02:24.580> thing<00:02:24.850> same<00:02:25.300> with<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.540> sin

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
is quite cool thing same with the sin

is quite cool thing same with the sin
with<00:02:26.470> same<00:02:26.890> with<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.160> corner<00:02:27.460> flag<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:28.120> will

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
with same with the corner flag that will

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.820 
with same with the corner flag that will
actually<00:02:28.420> move<00:02:28.810> if<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.170> bowl<00:02:29.320> touched<00:02:29.620> it

if<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.320> play<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.500> premier<00:03:08.980> league<00:03:09.130> match<00:03:09.220> for

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
if you play a premier league match for

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.490 
if you play a premier league match for
example<00:03:09.850> in<00:03:09.970> this<00:03:10.090> case<00:03:10.150> liberal<00:03:10.780> city<00:03:11.020> it

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
example in this case liberal city it

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.350 
example in this case liberal city it
will<00:03:11.680> actually<00:03:11.830> get<00:03:12.310> like<00:03:12.730> now<00:03:12.910> there's<00:03:13.180> like

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
will actually get like now there's like

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.800 
will actually get like now there's like
different<00:03:13.660> types<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.670> types<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.850> scores<00:03:16.630> and

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
different types of types of scores and

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.760 
different types of types of scores and
stuff<00:03:16.930> i<00:03:17.050> don't<00:03:17.080> think<00:03:17.350> it's<00:03:17.470> been<00:03:17.620> that

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
stuff i don't think it's been that

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.010 
stuff i don't think it's been that
before<00:03:18.100> i<00:03:18.310> think<00:03:18.880> it<00:03:19.060> might<00:03:19.480> have<00:03:19.690> been<00:03:19.810> with

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
before i think it might have been with

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.140 
before i think it might have been with
some<00:03:20.230> leaks<00:03:20.470> but<00:03:20.890> you<00:03:21.070> can<00:03:21.160> see<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.730> now<00:03:21.940> have

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
some leaks but you can see you now have

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.080 
some leaks but you can see you now have
the<00:03:22.180> original<00:03:22.990> Premier<00:03:23.350> League<00:03:23.910> score<00:03:24.910> right

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
game or in my opinion at least this game

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.100 
game or in my opinion at least this game
does<00:04:05.860> not<00:04:06.190> have<00:04:06.430> good<00:04:06.760> colors<00:04:07.630> or<00:04:07.810> whatsoever

does not have good colors or whatsoever
the<00:04:08.500> graphics<00:04:08.950> looks<00:04:09.190> horrible<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:10.030> be<00:04:10.060> honest

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
the graphics looks horrible to be honest

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.449 
the graphics looks horrible to be honest
I<00:04:10.690> mean<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.290> gameplay<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.860> pulsing<00:04:12.370> and

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
I mean the gameplay the pulsing and

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.710 
I mean the gameplay the pulsing and
cross<00:04:12.730> against<00:04:13.030> top<00:04:13.209> looks<00:04:13.450> kind<00:04:13.690> of

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
cross against top looks kind of

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.530 
cross against top looks kind of
realistic<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:14.680> fee<00:04:15.160> 15<00:04:15.550> and<00:04:15.700> also<00:04:16.090> looks

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540

past<00:05:10.490> 2009<00:05:11.180> but<00:05:11.900> basically<00:05:12.380> one<00:05:12.770> past<00:05:13.190> 10<00:05:13.730> came

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
out at Konami took pests I think they

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.670 
out at Konami took pests I think they
took<00:05:16.940> it<00:05:17.000> over<00:05:17.240> and<00:05:17.630> they<00:05:18.170> just<00:05:18.440> started

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
took it over and they just started

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.550 
took it over and they just started
ruining<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.280> games<00:05:19.490> and<00:05:19.730> as<00:05:19.820> you<00:05:19.910> can<00:05:20.000> see

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
ruining the games and as you can see

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.320 
ruining the games and as you can see
when<00:05:21.560> is<00:05:21.860> for<00:05:22.040> example<00:05:22.340> like<00:05:22.430> no<00:05:22.760> no<00:05:23.120> that's

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
when is for example like no no that's

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.120 
when is for example like no no that's
almost<00:05:23.480> 2015<00:05:24.260> they<00:05:24.410> should<00:05:24.590> be<00:05:24.680> able<00:05:24.770> to<00:05:24.950> get<00:05:25.070> a

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
almost 2015 they should be able to get a

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.970 
almost 2015 they should be able to get a
bit<00:05:25.610> better<00:05:26.210> gameplay<00:05:26.600> i<00:05:26.840> would<00:05:26.990> say<00:05:27.170> off<00:05:27.380> this
