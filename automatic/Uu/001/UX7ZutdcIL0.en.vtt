00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
here so it doesn't ring so much although

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.240 
here so it doesn't ring so much although
I<00:01:10.960> could<00:01:11.200> do<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.380> if<00:01:11.590> I<00:01:11.710> want<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:11.979> have<00:01:12.130> that

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.680 
I could do that if I want to have that
sound<00:01:12.550> play<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.000> further<00:01:13.240> back<00:01:13.479> on<00:01:13.510> the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
sound play it further back on the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.740

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
strings ago it's a more nasal sound but

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.940 
strings ago it's a more nasal sound but
often<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.050> would<00:01:20.200> use<00:01:20.350> my<00:01:20.380> palm<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:22.380> put<00:01:23.380> the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950
