that<00:00:38.280> good<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> think<00:00:39.450> since<00:00:39.690> DJ<00:00:40.050> came<00:00:40.320> in

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
that good but I think since DJ came in

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.830 
that good but I think since DJ came in
comment<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.070> think<00:00:41.129> he<00:00:41.489> changed<00:00:41.840> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
comment I think he changed the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.020 
comment I think he changed the
perception<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> people<00:00:43.770> Lord<00:00:44.399> regarding

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
perception of the people Lord regarding

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.459 
perception of the people Lord regarding
the<00:00:45.180> French<00:00:45.420> national<00:00:45.809> team<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the French national team and all the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.440 
the French national team and all the
credit<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.890> him<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.670> right<00:00:47.820> decision<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
credit to him was it right decision to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.229 
credit to him was it right decision to
drop<00:00:48.629> Nasri<00:00:49.079> from<00:00:49.320> their<00:00:49.469> team<00:00:50.000> we<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.689 
drop Nasri from their team we have a
different<00:00:51.629> view<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.079> think<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.680> working<00:00:53.670> with
