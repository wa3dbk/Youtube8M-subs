00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 now curious and curious from youtube today 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.580
 we are going to make delicious sweets 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.540
 Christmas with no oven to surprise 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.540
 to all your relatives 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.090
 and for this the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.220
 need are milk with sugar zest 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.369
 of coconut and butter and the ingredient 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.080
 main bizcochitos the first thing that 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.369
 we have to do is cut each of 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.369
 the two knives in half 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.380
 we put together each of the halves with 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.530
 butter and then we return them to 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.530
 put together 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.440
 then we lay on a plate or in 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.440
 a container milk with sugar 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.930
 and the coconut in another dish 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.070
 the procedure is very simple so 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.110
 we just have to take one of the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.160
 biscuits wet it in the milk and 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.160
 wrap it around the coconut 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.119
 and this would be the result 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.760
 As you can see, they are Christmas sweets 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.350
 very easy to do and they can do it 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.060
 the smallest of the house because no 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.500
 they need an oven if you make them 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.150
