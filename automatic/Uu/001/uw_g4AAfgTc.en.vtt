00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
into the Australian jungle the bush

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.650 
into the Australian jungle the bush
where<00:02:41.980> they<00:02:42.280> have<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.640> compete<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.000> food<00:02:43.390> and

if they don't get food they've basically

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.570 
if they don't get food they've basically
got<00:02:45.010> nothing<00:02:45.400> but<00:02:45.520> rice<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:46.120> eat<00:02:46.300> so<00:02:46.960> I<00:02:47.580> would

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
got nothing but rice to eat so I would

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.860 
got nothing but rice to eat so I would
suggest<00:02:48.700> these<00:02:49.060> people<00:02:49.390> probably<00:02:49.570> hadn't

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
suggest these people probably hadn't

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.180 
suggest these people probably hadn't
been<00:02:49.960> able<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.170> get<00:02:50.290> any<00:02:50.500> food<00:02:50.680> for<00:02:50.860> quite<00:02:50.980> some

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
been able to get any food for quite some

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.800 
been able to get any food for quite some
time<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:51.430> that's<00:02:51.880> probably<00:02:52.120> why<00:02:52.390> they<00:02:52.540> decide

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
time so that's probably why they decide

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.890 
time so that's probably why they decide
to<00:02:52.900> do<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.200> rap<00:02:53.380> but<00:02:53.950> these<00:02:54.730> accusations<00:02:55.390> that
