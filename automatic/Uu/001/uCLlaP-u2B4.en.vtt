very similar to this one spruce and this

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
one looks a lil almost like jungle but

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.890 
one looks a lil almost like jungle but
if<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.040> look<00:01:17.159> very<00:01:17.220> carefully<00:01:17.610> karralys<00:01:18.270> tale

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
if you look very carefully karralys tale

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.140 
if you look very carefully karralys tale
of<00:01:19.080> YouTube's<00:01:19.500> color<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> make<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
of YouTube's color is going to make it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.539 
of YouTube's color is going to make it
look<00:01:21.570> bad<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.470> those<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.430> new

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
look bad but those are here is the new

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.380 
look bad but those are here is the new
one<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.299> right<00:01:24.450> here<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> jungle

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
one and this right here is the jungle

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.460 
one and this right here is the jungle
slightly<00:01:27.390> different<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:27.930> color<00:01:28.140> which

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
slightly different in color which

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.069 
slightly different in color which
honestly<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.280> think<00:01:29.790> they<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.570> did<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.840> for

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
honestly I think they just did this for

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.420 
honestly I think they just did this for
a<00:01:31.110> proxy<00:01:31.590> they're<00:01:31.770> probably<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.250> change

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
a proxy they're probably going to change

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.910 
a proxy they're probably going to change
it<00:01:32.549> because<00:01:32.670> these<00:01:33.090> leaves<00:01:33.659> look<00:01:34.290> exactly

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it because these leaves look exactly

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.069 
it because these leaves look exactly
like<00:01:34.979> oak<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.790> middle-click<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.570> have

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
like oak but if I middle-click I have

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.310 
like oak but if I middle-click I have
the<00:01:37.229> new<00:01:37.350> leaves<00:01:37.560> which<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.430> looks<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.670> oak

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
the new leaves which it looks like oak

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.170 
the new leaves which it looks like oak
same<00:01:40.320> thing<00:01:40.500> over<00:01:40.590> here<00:01:40.710> they<00:01:41.369> look<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:41.909> oak

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
same thing over here they look like oak

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.389 
same thing over here they look like oak
but<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.079> says<00:01:43.259> Oh<00:01:43.409> quickforce<00:01:44.009> anyway

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
but this one says Oh quickforce anyway

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.649 
but this one says Oh quickforce anyway
so<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.670> probably<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.479> stay<00:01:45.630> up

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
so this probably is going to stay up

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
and you can have the Savannah looking

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.920 
and you can have the Savannah looking
trees<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.989> for<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.160> roof<00:02:16.420> saplings<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.720> have

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
trees and for the roof saplings you have

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.949 
trees and for the roof saplings you have
to<00:02:18.050> use<00:02:18.200> four<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:18.590> them<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.920> make<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.340> work

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
to use four of them to make this work

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.570 
to use four of them to make this work
using<00:02:20.959> one<00:02:21.170> won't<00:02:21.470> work<00:02:21.620> for<00:02:22.069> some<00:02:22.190> reason<00:02:22.459> and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
using one won't work for some reason and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.580 
using one won't work for some reason and
then<00:02:23.030> you'll<00:02:23.150> get<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.480> one<00:02:23.660> now<00:02:24.290> like<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.560> said

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
then you'll get this one now like I said

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.130 
then you'll get this one now like I said
the<00:02:25.400> textures<00:02:26.030> are<00:02:26.120> probably<00:02:26.450> just<00:02:26.600> proxies

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
the textures are probably just proxies

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.979 
the textures are probably just proxies
the<00:02:27.440> leaves<00:02:27.950> are<00:02:28.130> proxies<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.090> they're

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
the leaves are proxies and they're

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.509 
the leaves are proxies and they're
probably<00:02:30.140> going<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:30.410> update<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:31.130> probably

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519

instead of having okay of course I'm

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.370 
instead of having okay of course I'm
pretty<00:03:02.329> sure<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.540> showed<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:02.959> in<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.230> last

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
pretty sure I showed this in the last

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.319 
pretty sure I showed this in the last
snapshot<00:03:03.859> if<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.459> put<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.670> frame<00:03:04.910> here<00:03:05.299> and

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
snapshot if you put a frame here and

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.449 
snapshot if you put a frame here and
then<00:03:05.570> you<00:03:05.630> put<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:06.019> map<00:03:06.290> on<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.890> took<00:03:07.220> the

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
then you put a map on it it took the

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.330 
then you put a map on it it took the
whole<00:03:07.489> screen<00:03:08.030> but<00:03:08.829> beforehand<00:03:09.829> if<00:03:10.069> you<00:03:10.190> look

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
whole screen but beforehand if you look

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.460 
whole screen but beforehand if you look
at<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.489> side<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.970> didn't<00:03:11.269> have<00:03:11.390> any<00:03:11.630> type<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:11.930> I

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
at the side it didn't have any type of I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.319 
at the side it didn't have any type of I
guess<00:03:12.739> border<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.400> what<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.090> would<00:03:14.180> do<00:03:14.299> is

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
guess border and what it would do is

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.720 
guess border and what it would do is
just<00:03:14.600> float<00:03:14.959> so<00:03:15.470> they<00:03:15.590> fix<00:03:15.859> that<00:03:16.100> they<00:03:16.400> have

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
just float so they fix that they have

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.580 
just float so they fix that they have
added<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.329> little<00:03:17.569> picture<00:03:17.930> frame<00:03:18.079> border<00:03:18.109> on

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
added the little picture frame border on

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.410 
added the little picture frame border on
the<00:03:18.680> side<00:03:18.859> so<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.609> way<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:19.910> just<00:03:19.940> doesn't

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
the side so this way it just doesn't

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.550 
the side so this way it just doesn't
look<00:03:20.510> weird<00:03:20.750> when<00:03:20.959> looking<00:03:21.230> at<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.350> picture

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
look weird when looking at a picture

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.440 
look weird when looking at a picture
frame<00:03:21.769> it<00:03:22.010> looks<00:03:22.160> pretty<00:03:22.400> natural<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.329> can

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
frame it looks pretty natural you can

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.580 
frame it looks pretty natural you can
start<00:03:23.600> rotated<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:24.170> can<00:03:24.290> still<00:03:24.440> have

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
start rotated you can still have

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.949 
start rotated you can still have
multiple<00:03:25.069> um<00:03:26.290> hey<00:03:27.290> paintings<00:03:28.100> on<00:03:28.310> them<00:03:28.959> Wow

it's very annoying can't stop it unless

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.470 
it's very annoying can't stop it unless
you<00:04:09.440> close<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:09.980> game<00:04:10.160> open<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:11.030> again<00:04:11.150> and

you close the game open it again and

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.449 
you close the game open it again and
then<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.780> same<00:04:11.959> thing<00:04:12.140> would<00:04:12.230> come<00:04:12.440> one<00:04:12.709> I

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459

spawn<00:04:40.700> now<00:04:41.479> the<00:04:41.540> world<00:04:41.900> spawn<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:42.800> put<00:04:43.100> over

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
spawn now the world spawn I put over

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.450 
spawn now the world spawn I put over
here<00:04:43.430> is<00:04:43.520> just<00:04:43.639> like<00:04:44.360> right<00:04:44.570> here<00:04:45.160> now<00:04:46.160> if<00:04:46.310> you

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
here is just like right here now if you

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.730 
here is just like right here now if you
wanted<00:04:46.729> to<00:04:46.820> you<00:04:46.880> could<00:04:46.970> just<00:04:47.150> have<00:04:47.630> set<00:04:48.500> world

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
wanted to you could just have set world

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.350 
wanted to you could just have set world
spawn<00:04:49.130> without<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.700> coordinates<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.240> it

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
spawn without the coordinates and it

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.730 
spawn without the coordinates and it
would<00:04:50.450> automatically<00:04:50.930> spawn<00:04:51.200> it<00:04:51.350> next<00:04:51.590> to

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
would automatically spawn it next to

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.810 
would automatically spawn it next to
that<00:04:51.860> command<00:04:52.130> block<00:04:53.380> yeah<00:04:54.380> so<00:04:55.040> let<00:04:55.610> me<00:04:55.700> just

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
that command block yeah so let me just

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.780 
that command block yeah so let me just
step<00:04:56.090> on<00:04:56.270> over<00:04:56.300> fast<00:04:56.720> we<00:04:57.229> just<00:04:57.260> do<00:04:57.620> kill<00:04:58.400> and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
step on over fast we just do kill and

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.590 
step on over fast we just do kill and
then<00:04:59.510> I<00:04:59.540> will<00:04:59.870> spawn<00:05:00.229> right<00:05:00.970> here<00:05:01.970> yeah<00:05:02.240> I've

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
then I will spawn right here yeah I've

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.730 
then I will spawn right here yeah I've
messed<00:05:02.840> up<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.110> cornice<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.440> little<00:05:03.590> bit<00:05:03.680> I

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
messed up the cornice a little bit I

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.740 
messed up the cornice a little bit I
guess<00:05:03.770> but<00:05:04.550> very<00:05:04.700> close<00:05:04.970> to<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.180> spawn<00:05:05.510> point

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
guess but very close to the spawn point

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.460 
guess but very close to the spawn point
that<00:05:05.900> you<00:05:06.020> wanted<00:05:07.300> my<00:05:08.300> previous<00:05:08.870> spawn<00:05:09.169> for

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
that you wanted my previous spawn for

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.080 
that you wanted my previous spawn for
this<00:05:09.590> world<00:05:09.860> will<00:05:10.100> somewhere<00:05:10.580> way<00:05:10.729> over<00:05:10.940> there

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
this world will somewhere way over there

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.550 
this world will somewhere way over there
it<00:05:11.180> was<00:05:11.270> kind<00:05:11.450> of<00:05:11.539> a<00:05:11.630> pain<00:05:12.020> to<00:05:12.050> get<00:05:12.289> back<00:05:12.440> over

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
it was kind of a pain to get back over

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.409 
it was kind of a pain to get back over
here<00:05:12.680> but<00:05:13.580> yeah<00:05:13.669> that's<00:05:13.789> from<00:05:14.000> which<00:05:14.090> on<00:05:14.270> that

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
here but yeah that's from which on that

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.570 
here but yeah that's from which on that
point<00:05:14.660> and<00:05:14.900> i<00:05:15.260> believe<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.800> last<00:05:16.039> one<00:05:16.250> which<00:05:16.430> I

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
point and i believe the last one which I

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.460 
point and i believe the last one which I
couldn't<00:05:17.030> really<00:05:17.419> see<00:05:17.750> a<00:05:17.780> difference<00:05:17.960> because

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
couldn't really see a difference because

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.830 
couldn't really see a difference because
I<00:05:18.680> I<00:05:18.950> was<00:05:19.220> like<00:05:19.400> okay<00:05:20.210> I'm<00:05:20.360> pretty<00:05:20.660> sure<00:05:20.810> I

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
I I was like okay I'm pretty sure I

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.000 
I I was like okay I'm pretty sure I
could<00:05:20.990> really<00:05:21.260> do<00:05:21.410> this<00:05:21.440> in<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.800> latest

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
could really do this in the latest

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.820 
could really do this in the latest

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
bugs it came look the leads not even on

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.890

the lead lead get off there's so many
bugs<00:05:45.910> in<00:05:46.090> this<00:05:46.210> one<00:05:46.480> snapshot<00:05:46.780> there<00:05:47.560> nope

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
bugs in this one snapshot there nope

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.310 
bugs in this one snapshot there nope
there<00:05:48.610> we<00:05:48.760> go<00:05:48.850> I'm<00:05:49.030> finally<00:05:49.240> out<00:05:49.360> okay<00:05:50.260> so

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.340 
there we go I'm finally out okay so
supposedly<00:05:51.220> what<00:05:51.700> it<00:05:51.820> said<00:05:52.120> is<00:05:52.360> if<00:05:52.660> you<00:05:52.840> sprint

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
supposedly what it said is if you sprint

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.310 
supposedly what it said is if you sprint
like<00:05:53.650> if<00:05:54.130> I'm<00:05:54.280> walking<00:05:54.310> if<00:05:54.880> i<00:05:55.000> click<00:05:55.360> sprint<00:05:55.750> my

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
like if I'm walking if i click sprint my

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.260 
like if I'm walking if i click sprint my
horse<00:05:56.590> will<00:05:56.860> go<00:05:56.950> faster<00:05:57.430> which<00:05:57.640> I<00:05:57.880> don't<00:05:57.940> see

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
horse will go faster which I don't see

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.060 
horse will go faster which I don't see
it<00:05:58.300> mean<00:05:58.630> I<00:05:58.960> don't<00:05:59.140> see<00:05:59.320> it<00:05:59.350> really<00:05:59.920> going

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
it mean I don't see it really going

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.970 
it mean I don't see it really going
faster<00:06:00.460> feels<00:06:00.760> normal<00:06:01.000> and<00:06:01.380> then<00:06:02.380> of<00:06:02.710> course

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
faster feels normal and then of course

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.610 
faster feels normal and then of course
the<00:06:03.160> last<00:06:03.340> one<00:06:03.580> is<00:06:03.820> that<00:06:04.120> boat<00:06:04.750> will<00:06:05.170> go<00:06:05.260> faster

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
the last one is that boat will go faster

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.520 
the last one is that boat will go faster
now<00:06:05.830> if<00:06:06.070> you<00:06:06.880> sprint<00:06:07.420> while<00:06:07.660> on<00:06:07.930> a<00:06:07.990> boat<00:06:08.320> it

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
now if you sprint while on a boat it

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.290 
now if you sprint while on a boat it
should<00:06:08.860> go<00:06:09.040> faster<00:06:09.460> which<00:06:09.760> I<00:06:09.880> don't<00:06:10.060> see<00:06:10.180> the

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
should go faster which I don't see the

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.490 
should go faster which I don't see the
difference<00:06:10.390> I<00:06:10.720> think<00:06:10.930> she's<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.230> point<00:06:11.440> of

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
difference I think she's the point of

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.060 
difference I think she's the point of
view<00:06:12.960> yes<00:06:13.960> this<00:06:14.350> is<00:06:14.470> just<00:06:14.620> the<00:06:14.680> point<00:06:14.830> of<00:06:14.920> view

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
view yes this is just the point of view

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.770 
view yes this is just the point of view
in<00:06:15.160> my<00:06:15.280> opinion<00:06:15.520> but<00:06:16.150> there's<00:06:16.390> also<00:06:16.570> a<00:06:16.750> new

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
in my opinion but there's also a new

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.600 
in my opinion but there's also a new
mechanic<00:06:17.050> when<00:06:17.440> when<00:06:17.860> it<00:06:17.950> does<00:06:18.100> come<00:06:18.280> to<00:06:18.430> boats

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
mechanic when when it does come to boats

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.670 
mechanic when when it does come to boats
for<00:06:18.850> example<00:06:19.240> i'm<00:06:19.450> not<00:06:19.660> using<00:06:19.870> them<00:06:19.990> i'm<00:06:20.500> not

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
for example i'm not using them i'm not

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.350 
for example i'm not using them i'm not
using<00:06:20.950> the<00:06:21.130> mouse<00:06:21.250> i'm<00:06:21.880> just<00:06:22.060> going<00:06:22.210> to<00:06:22.270> be

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
using the mouse i'm just going to be

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.840 
using the mouse i'm just going to be
using<00:06:22.510> the<00:06:22.780> WASD<00:06:23.620> keys<00:06:23.860> and<00:06:24.100> i<00:06:24.490> can<00:06:24.700> actually

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
using the WASD keys and i can actually

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.570 
using the WASD keys and i can actually
control<00:06:25.450> which<00:06:25.750> direction<00:06:26.680> it<00:06:26.980> wants<00:06:27.250> to<00:06:27.460> go

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
control which direction it wants to go

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.490 
control which direction it wants to go
without<00:06:27.790> facing<00:06:28.660> the<00:06:28.930> direction<00:06:29.050> with<00:06:29.440> the

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
without facing the direction with the

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.040 
without facing the direction with the
mouse<00:06:29.680> now<00:06:30.490> it's<00:06:31.030> not<00:06:31.210> really<00:06:31.450> practical<00:06:31.660> but

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
mouse now it's not really practical but

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.530 
mouse now it's not really practical but
it's<00:06:32.230> there<00:06:32.470> if<00:06:32.500> you<00:06:32.740> wanted<00:06:33.040> to<00:06:33.190> I<00:06:33.730> still

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
it's there if you wanted to I still

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.960 
it's there if you wanted to I still
prefer<00:06:35.470> to<00:06:35.860> use<00:06:36.010> the<00:06:36.160> mouse<00:06:36.310> to<00:06:36.370> guide<00:06:36.790> it

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
prefer to use the mouse to guide it

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.300 
prefer to use the mouse to guide it
because<00:06:37.930> if<00:06:38.110> I<00:06:38.170> was<00:06:38.350> just<00:06:38.500> doing<00:06:38.680> backwards

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
because if I was just doing backwards

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.980 
because if I was just doing backwards
you<00:06:39.820> can't<00:06:40.150> really<00:06:40.360> see<00:06:40.480> where<00:06:40.780> you're<00:06:40.960> going

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
you can't really see where you're going

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.520 
you can't really see where you're going
and<00:06:41.320> then<00:06:41.500> you<00:06:41.620> make<00:06:41.860> capsize<00:06:42.760> your<00:06:43.060> ship

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
and then you make capsize your ship

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.260 
and then you make capsize your ship
capsized<00:06:44.530> your<00:06:44.770> ship<00:06:45.090> but<00:06:46.090> yeah<00:06:46.150> that's

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
capsized your ship but yeah that's

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.810 
capsized your ship but yeah that's
pretty<00:06:46.420> much<00:06:46.540> of<00:06:46.690> this<00:06:46.870> snapshots<00:06:47.680> very<00:06:48.190> short

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
pretty much of this snapshots very short

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.050 
pretty much of this snapshots very short
why<00:06:49.420> not<00:06:49.630> really<00:06:49.720> short<00:06:50.020> now<00:06:50.170> but<00:06:50.670> it<00:06:51.670> was<00:06:51.820> very

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
why not really short now but it was very

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.060 
why not really short now but it was very
unexpected<00:06:52.270> I<00:06:52.930> didn't<00:06:53.500> expect<00:06:53.560> to<00:06:53.890> do<00:06:54.040> a

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
unexpected I didn't expect to do a

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.920 
unexpected I didn't expect to do a
snapshot<00:06:54.430> review<00:06:54.910> so<00:06:55.180> early<00:06:55.450> on<00:06:55.570> this<00:06:55.720> week

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
snapshot review so early on this week

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.840 
snapshot review so early on this week

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
but like I stated it's probably because

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.450 
but like I stated it's probably because
