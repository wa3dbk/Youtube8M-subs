00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.029
 another 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.779
 the planet earth is a living system 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.569
 formed by a network of relationships 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:34.520
 among living beings interconnected with space 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.129
 Yesterday the human being is just for one of the thousands of years the call has of life 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.520
 all that we do the general as a consequence for the environment 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.750
 we exchange a series of impacts we get with our day to day 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.530
 awareness of these problems 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.960
 is still insufficient in relation to their size 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.980
 our daily lives 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.370
 our actions 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.070
 still not leading to a sustainable path for the planet 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.800
 What can we do to change all this? 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.229
 it is necessary to change our posture in the smallest things of the day to day 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.150
 at leisure time 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.000
 the work 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.970
 I have taken 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.560
 that has to start from each of us 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.820
 I'm thinking of a change in environments where there are faces 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.440
 the environmental management system of the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.440
 O 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.830
 ef 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:44.340
 is close to the coelba is aware of its important role in the preservation and 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.430
 conservation of the environment 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.430
 inserting environmental question in its productive chain 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.190
 from planning to customer relationships 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.780
 turbinated 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 supplier management 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.350
 the coelba give priority to less toxic products 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.130
 packaging that can be re-used recycled or 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.629
 nice pilot 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.179
 he wants 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.399
 solid waste management 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.609
 the coelba solid waste management program 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.159
 begins with 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.159
 focus on waste reduction 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.649
 to generate less and less 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.579
 once it generates from the reef 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.079
 one must seek reuse 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.799
 recycling another responsible destination
