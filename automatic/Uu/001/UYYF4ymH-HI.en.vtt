 hello dear friends swami strix and 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:24.279
 with the release of gta 5 as it were, and costing 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.259
 everyone wants to play it for free 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.390
 tamisha on pirates in this video i 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.290
 I'll tell you where you can download it without 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.050
 viruses in no ads and no other 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.790
 Labuda and tell from what computer 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.129
 actually this toy can be 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.160
 run 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.589
 as official system requirements 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.239
 the mesh requirements that are 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:51.190
 here's the incentive here they are here they are yes it 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.100
 a little lie 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.739
 since it says that the processor 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.519
 must be at least 4 nuclear 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.129
 here you see it from intel and a time 2 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.180
 inclusive 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:11.050
 no processor can be dual core and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.979
 the very minimum that I saw 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.710
 so i will say when a person played gta 5 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.680
 Speech comfortable game of course does not go 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.500
 because here the system of the 3rd is not even less 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:30.130
 minimum well, as shown in steam speech 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:33.759
 it goes somewhere 20-30 fps in a game like this but 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:40.479
 you can play it she will have you 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:42.850
 eat at such stands about 3-4 x ha 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.689
 bytes of RAM well there closer to three on 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.219
 really 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:52.570
 and you can play at least 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:56.109
 intel celeron dual core processor 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:01.780
 the purity of each seller must be 16 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:07.479
 gigahertz here so what now let's go to 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:10.860

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.860

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.210
