for<00:01:36.659> an<00:01:36.990> answer<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.500> most<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> game<00:01:38.159> but

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
for an answer for most of the game but

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.410 
for an answer for most of the game but
mister<00:01:39.990> jumper<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.850> end<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.150> regulation

and<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.979> ended<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:44.340> costing<00:01:44.810> Cavs<00:01:45.810> betters

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and that ended up costing Cavs betters

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
and that ended up costing Cavs betters
is<00:01:46.470> Cleveland<00:01:46.950> decided<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.759> score<00:01:48.210> any

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
is Cleveland decided not to score any

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.330 
is Cleveland decided not to score any
points<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.960> overtime<00:01:49.170> which<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> problem

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
points in overtime which is a problem

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.499

for<00:01:50.850> Game<00:01:51.060> two<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.750> going<00:01:52.079> forward<00:01:52.549> I<00:01:53.549> think

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
for Game two and going forward I think

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.389 
for Game two and going forward I think
that<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> foots<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.740> Game<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:55.950> or

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that there was a foots in Game one or

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
that there was a foots in Game one or
the<00:01:56.520> whole<00:01:56.729> series<00:01:57.270> flashed<00:01:57.930> before

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the whole series flashed before

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.749 
the whole series flashed before
Cleveland's<00:01:59.250> eyes<00:01:59.479> seeing<00:02:00.590> Kyrie<00:02:01.590> Irving<00:02:02.250> get

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
Cleveland's eyes seeing Kyrie Irving get

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.929 
Cleveland's eyes seeing Kyrie Irving get
his<00:02:03.719> knee<00:02:03.960> injured<00:02:04.350> again<00:02:04.710> then<00:02:05.399> obviously

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
his knee injured again then obviously

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.670 
his knee injured again then obviously
the<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.119> Warriors<00:02:06.719> go<00:02:06.960> down<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.350> floor

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
the the Warriors go down the floor

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.949 
the the Warriors go down the floor
Harrison<00:02:08.670> Barnes<00:02:08.819> hits<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.300> three<00:02:09.690> and

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
Harrison Barnes hits a three and

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.809 
Harrison Barnes hits a three and
basically<00:02:10.349> puts<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.830> game<00:02:10.979> out<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.190> reach<00:02:11.340> I

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
basically puts the game out of reach I

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.309 
basically puts the game out of reach I
think<00:02:12.270> that's<00:02:12.690> that

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
think that's that

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.809 
think that's that
that<00:02:13.530> could<00:02:13.680> not<00:02:13.829> or<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.159> might<00:02:14.430> not<00:02:14.579> only<00:02:14.730> be

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
that could not or that might not only be

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.429 
that could not or that might not only be
game<00:02:15.180> one<00:02:15.420> but<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:15.689> might<00:02:15.749> be<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:15.989> series<00:02:16.409> I

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
game one but it might be the series I

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.530 
game one but it might be the series I
can't<00:02:16.859> see<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.249> Cavs<00:02:17.519> playing<00:02:17.909> any<00:02:18.150> better

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
can't see the Cavs playing any better

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.920 
can't see the Cavs playing any better
than<00:02:18.810> they<00:02:18.930> did<00:02:18.989> in<00:02:19.349> Game<00:02:19.409> one<00:02:19.980> especially

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
than they did in Game one especially

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.459 
than they did in Game one especially
without<00:02:21.930> Irving<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.010> now<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.400> sudden<00:02:24.030> uh<00:02:24.469> you

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
without Irving and now the sudden uh you

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.289 
without Irving and now the sudden uh you
know<00:02:25.590> you've<00:02:25.769> got<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.099> go<00:02:26.189> you've<00:02:26.579> got<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.760> come

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
know you've got to go you've got to come

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.420 
know you've got to go you've got to come
back<00:02:27.329> without<00:02:27.840> him<00:02:28.290> play<00:02:28.739> even<00:02:28.980> better<00:02:29.129> I

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
back without him play even better I

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.920 
back without him play even better I
think<00:02:29.609> Golden<00:02:30.000> State's<00:02:30.269> got<00:02:30.480> room<00:02:30.689> for

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
think Golden State's got room for

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.979 
think Golden State's got room for
improvement<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.680> my<00:02:32.219> opinion<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.969> I<00:02:33.870> think

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
improvement in my opinion and I think

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.000 
improvement in my opinion and I think
this<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.349> going<00:02:34.439> to<00:02:34.530> be<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> really<00:02:34.889> tough

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
this is going to be a really tough

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.490 
this is going to be a really tough
series<00:02:35.579> for<00:02:36.000> Cleveland<00:02:36.719> to<00:02:36.840> hang<00:02:37.019> around<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.469> I

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
said there's a lot of chatter going on

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.709 
said there's a lot of chatter going on
should<00:02:47.250> we<00:02:47.310> bet<00:02:47.549> on<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.790> money<00:02:48.030> line<00:02:48.209> here<00:02:48.540> or

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:48.719 
should we bet on the money line here or

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.089 
should we bet on the money line here or
on<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.900> spread<00:02:49.319> which<00:02:49.500> do<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:49.859> better

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
on the spread which do you like better

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.929 
on the spread which do you like better
for<00:02:50.370> Game<00:02:50.489> two<00:02:50.519> uh<00:02:51.349> I<00:02:52.349> think<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.859> spread<00:02:53.159> um<00:02:53.849> I

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
for Game two uh I think the spread um I

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.209 
for Game two uh I think the spread um I
think<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.750> spread<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.169> telling<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.769> be<00:02:55.889> honest

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219 
think the spread is telling to be honest

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:00.409 
think the spread is telling to be honest
with<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.609> I<00:02:57.019> it's<00:02:58.019> it's<00:02:58.379> hard<00:02:58.650> not<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.120> to<00:03:00.120> read

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
with you I it's it's hard not to to read

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.939 
with you I it's it's hard not to to read
into<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.379> much<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:02.189> Cavs<00:03:02.639> at<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.540> Greek

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:03.949 
into it so much the Cavs at the Greek

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.750 
into it so much the Cavs at the Greek
probably<00:03:04.949> the<00:03:05.069> Warriors<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.579> Greek

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
probably the Warriors of the Greek

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.149 
probably the Warriors of the Greek
closed<00:03:06.060> at<00:03:06.299> five<00:03:06.659> and<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.019> half<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.530> Game<00:03:07.739> one

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
closed at five and a half and Game one

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.429 
closed at five and a half and Game one
and<00:03:08.459> we're<00:03:09.329> looking<00:03:09.629> at<00:03:09.750> Game<00:03:09.930> two<00:03:10.139> in<00:03:10.290> it's

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
and we're looking at Game two in it's

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.050 
and we're looking at Game two in it's
seven<00:03:10.919> and<00:03:11.069> a<00:03:11.099> half<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.489> obviously<00:03:11.819> that's

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
seven and a half and obviously that's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.599 
seven and a half and obviously that's
the<00:03:12.329> part<00:03:12.569> of<00:03:12.629> it<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:12.870> with<00:03:13.049> Kyrie<00:03:13.319> Irving<00:03:13.919> very

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
the part of it is with Kyrie Irving very

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.509 
the part of it is with Kyrie Irving very
likely<00:03:14.939> to<00:03:15.209> be<00:03:15.239> out<00:03:15.569> but<00:03:16.010> it's<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.250> it's

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
likely to be out but it's just it's

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.399 
likely to be out but it's just it's
tough<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:18.060> think<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.389> line<00:03:18.629> tells<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.139> that

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
tough I think that line tells you that

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.219 
tough I think that line tells you that
that<00:03:19.979> Golden<00:03:20.879> State<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.659> going<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.930> play<00:03:22.079> even

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229 
that Golden State is going to play even

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:23.749 
that Golden State is going to play even
better<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.709> Cleveland's<00:03:23.099> gonna<00:03:23.189> play<00:03:23.519> worse

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:23.759 
better and Cleveland's gonna play worse

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:26.059 
better and Cleveland's gonna play worse
I<00:03:24.030> take<00:03:24.479> a<00:03:24.540> look<00:03:24.689> at<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.930> numbers<00:03:25.290> klay

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
I take a look at the numbers klay

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.640 
I take a look at the numbers klay
Thompson<00:03:26.639> 5<00:03:26.909> of<00:03:27.150> 14<00:03:27.659> he<00:03:27.989> can<00:03:28.169> be<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.319> little<00:03:28.439> bit

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
Thompson 5 of 14 he can be a little bit

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.710 
Thompson 5 of 14 he can be a little bit
more<00:03:28.859> efficient<00:03:29.489> draymond<00:03:29.939> Green<00:03:29.970> before<00:03:30.599> of

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
more efficient draymond Green before of

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.809 
more efficient draymond Green before of
13<00:03:31.169> he's<00:03:31.409> typically<00:03:31.949> a<00:03:31.979> little<00:03:32.220> bit<00:03:32.489> better

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
13 he's typically a little bit better

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.429 
13 he's typically a little bit better
than<00:03:33.090> that

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
than that

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.219 
than that
the<00:03:35.009> threes<00:03:35.430> 3s<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.419> think<00:03:36.599> Golden<00:03:36.870> State<00:03:37.079> can

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
the threes 3s I think Golden State can

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.159
