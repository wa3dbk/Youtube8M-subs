let has disruption in the corneal

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.590 
let has disruption in the corneal
surface<00:01:42.429> so<00:01:42.819> if<00:01:42.969> you<00:01:43.060> have<00:01:43.149> a<00:01:43.209> tiny<00:01:43.479> little

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.779 
surface so if you have a tiny little
scratch<00:01:44.560> in<00:01:44.770> there<00:01:44.920> that's<00:01:45.340> not<00:01:45.579> always

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
scratch in there that's not always

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.760 
scratch in there that's not always
visible<00:01:46.060> with<00:01:46.539> just<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.899> ophthalmoscope<00:01:47.200> or

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
visible with just the ophthalmoscope or

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.660 
visible with just the ophthalmoscope or
the<00:01:47.920> little<00:01:48.929> device<00:01:49.929> that<00:01:50.319> your<00:01:51.159> doctor<00:01:51.549> or

the little device that your doctor or
your<00:01:51.700> veterinarian<00:01:52.209> will<00:01:52.359> use<00:01:52.599> to<00:01:52.779> look<00:01:52.929> in

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
your veterinarian will use to look in

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.989 
your veterinarian will use to look in
your<00:01:53.200> dog's<00:01:53.380> eyes<00:01:53.619> it's<00:01:54.279> not<00:01:54.520> always<00:01:54.670> visible

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
your dog's eyes it's not always visible

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.690 
your dog's eyes it's not always visible
so<00:01:55.209> this<00:01:55.590> substance<00:01:56.590> will<00:01:56.770> bind<00:01:57.069> to<00:01:57.549> those

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
so this substance will bind to those

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.849 
so this substance will bind to those
areas<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.299> turn<00:01:58.539> them<00:01:58.719> green<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.169> they'll<00:01:59.679> be

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
areas and turn them green and they'll be

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.099
