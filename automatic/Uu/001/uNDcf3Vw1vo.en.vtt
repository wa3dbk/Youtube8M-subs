anaesthetic the local anaesthetic needle
is<00:01:14.460> much<00:01:14.729> smaller<00:01:15.090> than<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.540> needle<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
is much smaller than this needle so the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.620 
is much smaller than this needle so the
time<00:01:16.920> when<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.369> needle<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.790> inserted<00:01:17.939> should

the needle is invert is advanced very

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.510 
the needle is invert is advanced very
slowly<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.659> same<00:01:36.960> time<00:01:37.320> pressure<00:01:38.220> is

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
slowly at the same time pressure is

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.149 
slowly at the same time pressure is
applied<00:01:38.640> gently<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> syringe<00:01:40.200> just

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
applied gently to the syringe just

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.950 
applied gently to the syringe just
before<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.729> reaches<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.150> epidural<00:01:42.689> space

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
before one reaches the epidural space

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.080 
before one reaches the epidural space
the<00:01:43.710> needle<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:44.220> come<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.549> against<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the needle will come up against a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.389 
the needle will come up against a
ligament<00:01:45.540> called<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> ligamentum<00:01:46.770> flavum

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
ligament called the ligamentum flavum

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.969 
ligament called the ligamentum flavum
and<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.180> quite<00:01:48.479> gritty<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:49.770> an

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
and this is quite gritty and you get an

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.700 
and this is quite gritty and you get an
increased<00:01:50.490> amount<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:51.060> resistance<00:01:51.409> at<00:01:52.409> this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
increased amount of resistance at this

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.130 
increased amount of resistance at this
point<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.460> epidural<00:01:53.970> space<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.479> very<00:01:54.689> close

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
point the epidural space is very close

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.770 
point the epidural space is very close
so<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> needle<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.820> advanced<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.479> very

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
so the needle is just advanced a very

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.020 
so the needle is just advanced a very
small<00:01:58.170> amount<00:01:58.320> further<00:01:58.860> there's<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> very

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
small amount further there's a very

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.840 
small amount further there's a very
sudden<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.960> convincing<00:02:01.920> loss<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.280> resistance

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
sudden and convincing loss of resistance

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.289 
sudden and convincing loss of resistance
and<00:02:03.180> at<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.810> point<00:02:04.460> one<00:02:05.460> knows<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.149> is

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and at this point one knows that one is

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.960 
and at this point one knows that one is
in<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> epidural<00:02:07.049> space<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> syringe<00:02:08.789> is

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
in the epidural space so the syringe is

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.570 
in the epidural space so the syringe is
removed<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:10.220> now<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.640> epidural

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
removed and now the epidural

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.900 
removed and now the epidural
editor<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.120> inserted<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.160> just<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.610> very

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
editor is inserted this is just a very

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.870 
editor is inserted this is just a very
fine<00:02:16.300> plastic<00:02:16.840> tube<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:17.980> threaded<00:02:18.670> through

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
fine plastic tube it is threaded through

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.060 
fine plastic tube it is threaded through
the<00:02:19.180> needle<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.710> all<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.040> remains

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
the needle and this is all that remains

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.120 
the needle and this is all that remains
in<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.730> body<00:02:22.290> patients<00:02:23.290> get<00:02:23.470> worried<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:23.890> if

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
in the body patients get worried that if

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.530 
in the body patients get worried that if
they're<00:02:24.280> having<00:02:24.490> an<00:02:24.580> epidural<00:02:25.000> they<00:02:25.300> think

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
they're having an epidural they think

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.660 
they're having an epidural they think
that<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.810> needle<00:02:26.200> might<00:02:26.410> stay<00:02:26.710> in<00:02:26.740> but<00:02:27.250> no<00:02:27.460> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
that the needle might stay in but no the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.910 
that the needle might stay in but no the
needle<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.060> removed<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.810> all<00:02:29.410> that<00:02:29.590> remains

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
needle is removed and all that remains

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.520 
needle is removed and all that remains
in<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.160> body<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.700> this<00:02:31.150> very<00:02:31.450> fine<00:02:31.810> plastic

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
in the body is this very fine plastic

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.550 
in the body is this very fine plastic
tube<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.090> you're<00:02:34.240> able<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.570> lie<00:02:34.930> back<00:02:35.200> and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
tube so you're able to lie back and

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.740 
tube so you're able to lie back and
function<00:02:36.130> normally<00:02:36.670> this<00:02:37.270> end<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.630> the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
function normally this end of the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.020 
function normally this end of the
catheter<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.470> then<00:02:39.250> attached<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.790> what<00:02:39.940> we

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
catheter is then attached to what we

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.390 
catheter is then attached to what we
call<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.300> filter<00:02:40.870> we<00:02:41.200> then<00:02:41.410> attach<00:02:41.530> an<00:02:41.950> infusion

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
call a filter we then attach an infusion

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.790 
call a filter we then attach an infusion
of<00:02:42.640> local<00:02:43.060> anaesthetic<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.320> end<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.710> the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
of local anaesthetic to this end of the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.490 
of local anaesthetic to this end of the
filter<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:46.240> idea<00:02:46.630> is<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.170> you

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
filter and the idea is that you

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.010 
filter and the idea is that you
gradually<00:02:47.980> get<00:02:48.280> local<00:02:48.760> anesthetic<00:02:49.360> infused

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
gradually get local anesthetic infused

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.410 
gradually get local anesthetic infused
into<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.740> body<00:02:51.040> through<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.580> catheter<00:02:52.180> and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
into the body through the catheter and

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.350 
into the body through the catheter and
the<00:02:52.959> body<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.650> distal<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.790> this<00:02:54.910> part<00:02:55.209> of

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
the body that is distal to this part of

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.390 
the body that is distal to this part of
the<00:02:55.450> catheter<00:02:55.840> then<00:02:56.230> gradually<00:02:56.800> gets<00:02:57.010> numbed

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
the catheter then gradually gets numbed

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.000 
the catheter then gradually gets numbed
and<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:58.570> essence<00:02:58.959> that's<00:02:59.260> how<00:02:59.440> we<00:02:59.500> perform<00:02:59.920> an

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
and in essence that's how we perform an

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.730 
and in essence that's how we perform an
epidural<00:03:00.490> either<00:03:01.330> for<00:03:01.750> your<00:03:01.900> operation<00:03:02.470> or

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
epidural either for your operation or

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.180 
epidural either for your operation or
for<00:03:02.800> pain<00:03:03.280> relief<00:03:03.310> afterwards
