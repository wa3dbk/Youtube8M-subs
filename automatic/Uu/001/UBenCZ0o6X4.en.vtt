00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.700
 hi everyone my name is Anton and today 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.089
 on the channel and like I will tell you how 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.710
 extend battery life on ipad 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.050
 thanks to which are equipped with apple 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.510
 tablet and will provide about 10 hours 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.189
 work in principle with moderate 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.050
 resource utilization can achieve 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.140
 the fact that the tank and listen to the whole day and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.160
 even more, however, even these indicators 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.260
 are the limit 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.390
 and how to save charge 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.050
 rechargeable ipad we tell 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.410
 Now in this video so the first tip 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.129
 it dim the screen and turn it on 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.170
 of tanks this is done in our settings 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.800
 such a setting and go to the menu bright and 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 both and here with the slider 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.600
 regular marx so that we were comfortable 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.899
 Here's an example I have put well, probably 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.210
 percent of quarrels and for me they are enough 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.260
 comfortable though the cigarette didn't turn out that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.950
 the screen is dim 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.630
 but since the Auto-Brightness was used well 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.740
 preferably also turn off because 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.340
 ipad it works 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.790
 neatly yes and to one guard people she 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:23.310
 on the contrary fat and mk tor mule and so 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.470
 let 's give another erg from the screen 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.930
 adjust with the mouse control 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.860
 Mishin control appeared its 7 and 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:36.180
 It is caused you bring svayp from the bottom of the screen 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.890
 up this here and all 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.130
 brightness adjustment is us here 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.630
 here at the bottom right if you also 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.759
 out of 6 then if i 'm not mistaken over push two 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.659
 home button times 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.210
 here a trip menu then I'll give you a swap 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.329
 left and somewhere in the area will 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.460
 brightness adjustment and so let's go on 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.590
 what else can save you charge 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.600
 battery and this is if you turn off 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.750
 unused screen and install 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.679
 lock on the minimum value and 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.060
 so all this is done by us in the section 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.550
 basic do nice nice nice nice not 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.500
 with and here's an automatic block set this 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.730
 lock on the minimum value then 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.790
 there are 2 minutes and explain why this is us 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.890
 let's say you moved away from your wounds still 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.989
 is burning and even then he is Demet 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.420
 will turn off but if we will stand 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.989
 appendage is valid 15 all 15 minutes these 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.060
 will burn and eat battery if 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.530
 you don't need that then of course 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.319
 disconnected Well, let's next 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.560
 advice is still desirable to include too much 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.190
 pressure and lowering the closed tap on 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.700
 finger it 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.030
 control point is not mistaken yet 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.120
 notification center here when we find well 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.340
 let's any program but in for pro 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.180
 we press the auto industry and as you can see 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.040
 I'm already set up here what is the purpose 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.810
 reminders not about sticker on badge 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.510
 are present the sound was present there 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.340
 it is extremely blocked so not 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.489
 be lazy to set up all the programs 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.910
 which you don't need so they don't sleep 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:26.500
 I will block the tap for notifications 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:30.819
 the screen turns on and eats the resource prices 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.709
 Battery and indeed, in principle, push 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.380
 notifies enough gluttonous things and 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.290
 fries altogether disable push about those 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.190
 programs that you don't need so 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.560
 let's look for advise and advice 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.440
 disable geolocation completely but although 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.489
 would be part of this section with us 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.459
 privacy privacy service there 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.970
 geolocation off if you want 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.560
 so that they can use locations 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.139
 partially do everything you are also here 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.100

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:07.510
 when when taking photos 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.290
 show you where these photos were 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.959
 are made 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.489
 please leave geo-locations 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.019
 only photos and in other programs 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.430
 disable well or vice versa us an example 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.070
 cards want him to immediately 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.820
 location and other pairs of memory in fig 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.190
 and interfere with business 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.360
 and so turn off and leave only in 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.460
 cards well let's give the next tip yet 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.160

 put how to say frozen 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.770

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:45.000
 cook frosts eats up prices again 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:48.130
 battery charge and therefore do not be lazy 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.700
 pastor how did you win by working with 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:56.500
 a tablet to take and unload but figs and not 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:05:01.990
