00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
consciousness of the program link unit

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.850 
consciousness of the program link unit
they<00:00:46.730> thought<00:00:47.120> they<00:00:47.540> could<00:00:47.750> maintain<00:00:47.960> control

you can't just keep plugging your brain
into<00:00:52.010> this<00:00:52.129> machine<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:52.610> not<00:00:52.850> expecting<00:00:53.420> if

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
into this machine and not expecting if

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.990 
into this machine and not expecting if
it<00:00:53.690> I'm<00:00:53.780> tired<00:00:54.110> but<00:00:54.620> once<00:00:54.979> they<00:00:55.250> opened<00:00:55.760> the

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
it I'm tired but once they opened the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
that's great is this real the experiment

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.399 
that's great is this real the experiment
turned<00:01:07.640> on<00:01:08.060> them<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:08.750> think<00:01:08.930> one<00:01:09.170> of<00:01:09.200> them

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
turned on them you think one of them

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.770 
turned on them you think one of them
units<00:01:09.890> crawled<00:01:10.580> up<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:10.939> extension<00:01:11.420> cord<00:01:11.659> and

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
units crawled up the extension cord and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.210 
units crawled up the extension cord and
killed<00:01:11.960> his<00:01:12.049> maker<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:12.590> why<00:01:12.770> didn't<00:01:13.100> they

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
killed his maker and why didn't they

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.410 
killed his maker and why didn't they
kill<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:14.020> maybe<00:01:15.020> they<00:01:15.229> were<00:01:15.970> saying<00:01:16.970> there's

kill you maybe they were saying there's
another<00:01:17.509> world<00:01:18.200> on<00:01:18.740> top<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.310> this<00:01:19.430> one<00:01:19.640> that's

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
another world on top of this one that's

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.029 
another world on top of this one that's
right<00:01:20.509> we're<00:01:20.899> nothing<00:01:21.140> but<00:01:21.259> a<00:01:21.289> simulation<00:01:21.920> on

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
right we're nothing but a simulation on

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:29.050 
right we're nothing but a simulation on
some<00:01:22.250> fakir<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.390> who's<00:01:23.630> in<00:01:23.840> control<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.880> could

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
some fakir so who's in control you could

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:45.430 
some fakir so who's in control you could
call<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.509> end<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.780> world

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.120 

a<00:01:45.550> 13th<00:01:46.550> floor<00:01:46.900> you<00:01:47.900> can't<00:01:48.170> go<00:01:48.350> there<00:01:48.710> even

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
a 13th floor you can't go there even

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.050 
a 13th floor you can't go there even
though<00:01:49.550> it<00:01:49.700> doesn't<00:01:50.000> exist

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.000 

hey<00:01:55.060> what'd<00:01:55.330> you<00:01:55.360> do<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.659> the<00:01:55.750> world<00:01:55.960> turned<00:01:56.860> it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
hey what'd you do to the world turned it

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.159 
hey what'd you do to the world turned it
off
