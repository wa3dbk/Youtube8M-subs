00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello how about youtube friends talk to you 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.340
 and well in this new tutorial 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.880
 let's learn how to set the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.060
 bios to start from a c of this 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.949
 way is very easy can be done with 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.980
 any operating system does not need 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.980
 make windows xp or windows 7 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.070
 it is done in the same way with the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.530
 operating system for this I have to 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.290
 tell them that computers are all 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.160
 different then are not always the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.340
 same buttons in my case is the button f 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.570
 2 and f 12 there are other cases that can be 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.980
 between 10 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.750
 Efe 9 the delete key or the skateboard key 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.649
 in some of the cases to be able 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.360
 enter the bios then you already know to 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.710
 you them a message will appear 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.899
 what letter is to enter the bios 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.980
 the next steps because they are all 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.830
 all general good I hope so 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.070
 serve them and well I will record from a 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.659
 camera of a digital camera so that 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.490
 can see it 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.490
 we see each other until the prison 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.040
 well once we're in our 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.780
 computer this is to the computer to 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.320
 what are we going to configure the bios 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.680
 to start from a cd of a 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.200
 very easy way this is used when 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.960
 let's format or when simply 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.630
 we want to flip from a usb 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.660
 from a cd sorry these computers 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.360
 well do not bring this is a notebook not 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:51.580
 bring this CD player as you can see 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.160
 neither on the other side is there a reader but 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.300
 I connected an external reader and 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.550
 this way we will be able to do it 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.790
 well the first thing we have to do is 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.110
 insert our cd 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.110
 in our reader 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.780
 and here we will wait to verify that 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.549
 I'm really reading it so that I do not 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.319
 let's have no error at the moment 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.319
 to format our computer 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.989
 let's see ipc 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.849
 and here it is because the civilian is a record of 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:38.230
 windows 7 and let's go now if we proceed to 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.480
 which would 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.659
 and restart 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.120
 our computer we are going to restart and 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.120
 let's wait for it to restart 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:57.480
 here it is important to have the f keys 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.260
 sometimes it's f 2 f 10 f 12 or in some 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.780
 suppress cases or the script letter in 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:09.470
 this case to flip 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.470
 we type efe 9 several times 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.690
 and here he asks us in what way 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.840
 we want to look for our computer there 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.630
 several cases here we can flip from 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.330
 the usb that is the reader I decided that is the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:31.170
 what I have here here is not marking them 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:34.590
 or just flip with the hard drive 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.510
 what is that is fine 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.080
 to configure the bios this is a 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.650
 way to debut but to set 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.200
 the bios what we have to do is the 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.780
 next key let's go to the 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.900
 bios with efe 2 or suppress 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.030
 is already starting windows we are going to 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.620
 type again 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.600
 efe 12 in this case I think f10 to enter 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.110
 to the bios and here we are already entering 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.650
 the bios here we go to configuration 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.890
 of system system configuration and 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:17.169
 the bass here we moved with these 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:20.590
 keys we move to understand why 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.690
 has not used the the mouse then we 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.660
 we go to the option that says options 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.660
 boot and boot options 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.370
 here is OK 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.009
 here we put options of start and 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.270
 in start sequence we go to 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:42.449
 below and we give ok here is how it starts 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.599
 our 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.569
 our boot first is what 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:52.889
 it would be on our hard drive and second 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:57.390
 is the boot of vÃ©lez of the disc 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:05:03.090
 well what we have to do is 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:08.040
 give an enter and upload here upload it to 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:12.030
 sata disk and it automatically goes up 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.130
 to start first with our disk to 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.920
 format and then in this way 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.620
 we're just going skype tells us that if 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.980
 we want to save the changes and type 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.500
 f10 to save the changes and this 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.780
 way out in this case I 'm not going to 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.790
 do 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:35.920
 and so they will flip from 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:39.010
 they will be able to flip from the disk to 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.120
 be able to format well well that easy 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.970
 is this there is no problem when 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.130
 try to flip from a disk all the 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.370
 most computers already bring a 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:56.770
 option apart from entering lips already brings 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:06:00.700
 an option that says boot is written wv2 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.710
 and a t in this way they can 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.430
 you select the option to flip 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.950
 civil or civil rom and so they will be able to 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:13.000
 start from a cd to be able to format 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.830
 I hope you have understood me and then that is 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.060
 a whole greet all of us to see 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.060
 the next until the
