by a guy named simply scar who used em a

by a guy named simply scar who used em a
really<00:00:26.250> simple<00:00:26.640> mechanic<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.269> Minecraft<00:00:27.720> that

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
really simple mechanic in Minecraft that

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.689 
really simple mechanic in Minecraft that
I've<00:00:27.930> never<00:00:28.140> seen<00:00:28.289> before<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:29.099> not<00:00:29.369> sure<00:00:29.429> if<00:00:29.609> I

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
I've never seen before I'm not sure if I

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.910 
I've never seen before I'm not sure if I
came<00:00:29.880> up<00:00:30.029> with<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.269> idea<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.590> what

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
came up with the idea of this but what

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.490 
came up with the idea of this but what
he<00:00:32.009> did<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.189> he<00:00:32.399> simply<00:00:32.820> put<00:00:33.030> ignite<00:00:33.630> at<00:00:33.780> t3

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
he did was he simply put ignite at t3

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.160 
he did was he simply put ignite at t3
and<00:00:35.010> ender<00:00:35.370> portal<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.450> blast<00:00:36.750> him<00:00:36.989> into

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
and ender portal and it blast him into

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
and ender portal and it blast him into
the<00:00:37.350> air<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.800> he<00:00:38.340> only<00:00:38.520> used<00:00:38.790> seven<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.450> get

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the air and he only used seven to get

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.930 
the air and he only used seven to get
him<00:00:39.719> up<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.800> hundred<00:00:40.860> blocks<00:00:41.730> high

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
him up to about a hundred blocks high

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.170 
him up to about a hundred blocks high
and<00:00:42.320> I<00:00:43.320> thought<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:44.100> could<00:00:44.129> go<00:00:44.430> higher<00:00:45.149> than

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and I thought we could go higher than

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.740 
and I thought we could go higher than
that<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:47.039> I'm<00:00:47.340> gonna<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.059> using<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.629> new

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
that and so I'm gonna be using the new

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.569 
that and so I'm gonna be using the new
feature<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.680> latest<00:00:50.039> snapshot<00:00:50.219> that

allows<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> fire<00:00:51.780> ignited<00:00:52.410> TNT<00:00:53.039> through

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
allows you to fire ignited TNT through

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.560 
allows you to fire ignited TNT through
Spencer's<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.760> pretty<00:00:56.760> much<00:00:56.850> since<00:00:57.420> they're

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
Spencer's and pretty much since they're

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
Spencer's and pretty much since they're
all<00:00:57.690> going<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> end<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.160> be

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
all going to go on to the end and all be

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.459 
all going to go on to the end and all be
unloaded<00:01:00.210> they'll<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.780> go<00:01:00.960> off<00:01:01.140> at<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.379> same

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469

unloaded they'll all go off at the same
time<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> reasons<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.719> my

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
time now I do the reasons that my

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.240 
time now I do the reasons that my
computer<00:01:04.110> will<00:01:04.619> not<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.890> able<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.159> handle<00:01:05.540> 9

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
computer will not be able to handle 9

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.210 
computer will not be able to handle 9
stacks<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.610> 12<00:01:09.390> dispensers<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.409> firing<00:01:10.950> off

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
stacks in 12 dispensers all firing off

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.240 
stacks in 12 dispensers all firing off
at<00:01:11.430> once<00:01:12.090> pretty<00:01:12.510> much<00:01:12.750> i<00:01:13.020> can't<00:01:13.860> do<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
at once pretty much i can't do the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.550 
at once pretty much i can't do the
entire<00:01:14.549> thing<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.570> i'm<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> try<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.229> with

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
entire thing so i'm going to try it with

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.390 
entire thing so i'm going to try it with
two<00:01:17.090> stocks<00:01:18.090> tnt<00:01:18.659> /<00:01:18.960> dispenser<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.310> if

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
two stocks tnt / dispenser and see if

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:35.480 
two stocks tnt / dispenser and see if
that<00:01:20.460> works<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.150> let's<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:22.049> started

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:02:42.820
