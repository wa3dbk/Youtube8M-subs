the<00:00:20.910> level<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.270> resistance<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.380> here<00:00:22.560> we've

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the level of resistance so here we've

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.800 
the level of resistance so here we've
got<00:00:22.769> maximum<00:00:23.400> resistance<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.359> drill<00:00:24.660> but

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810

probably<00:01:53.040> photos<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> clown<00:01:53.670> doing<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.090> all

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
probably photos the clown doing here all

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.999 
probably photos the clown doing here all
peers<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.500> he<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.740> again

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
peers going to do is he can again

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.740 
peers going to do is he can again
activate<00:01:56.460> wake<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.299> muscle<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.720> side

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
activate wake up the muscle on the side

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.350 
activate wake up the muscle on the side
of<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.110> hip<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.220> put<00:01:59.549> his<00:01:59.640> hand<00:01:59.909> there<00:02:00.060> just

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
of the hip so I put his hand there just

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.999 
of the hip so I put his hand there just
to<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.500> little<00:02:01.590> bit<00:02:01.740> more<00:02:01.830> at<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
to just to get a little bit more at the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.590 
to just to get a little bit more at the
exercise<00:02:02.369> we<00:02:02.549> should<00:02:02.790> feel<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.299> muscle

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
exercise we should feel the muscle

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.270 
exercise we should feel the muscle
contract<00:02:03.960> underneath<00:02:04.350> his<00:02:04.470> hand<00:02:04.770> there<00:02:05.009> which

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
contract underneath his hand there which

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.800 
contract underneath his hand there which
will<00:02:05.430> add<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.030> exercise<00:02:06.330> but<00:02:06.539> we've<00:02:06.659> got

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
will add to the exercise but we've got

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.050 
will add to the exercise but we've got
gimmick<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.920> feature<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.789> speed

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
gimmick is the feature the the speed

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.940 
gimmick is the feature the the speed
pads<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.380> highest<00:02:10.679> level<00:02:10.770> of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
pads this is the highest level of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.590 
pads this is the highest level of
resistance<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.120> go<00:02:12.209> from<00:02:12.360> being

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
resistance so we can go from being

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.380 
resistance so we can go from being
unloaded<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.860> read<00:02:14.250> bad<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> green<00:02:15.000> band<00:02:15.209> to

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
unloaded to read bad to a green band to

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.270 
unloaded to read bad to a green band to
both<00:02:15.600> together<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.709> can<00:02:16.860> really<00:02:17.010> grow

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
both together so you can really grow

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.010 
both together so you can really grow
your<00:02:17.310> greater<00:02:18.180> progressions<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.810> way<00:02:18.959> two

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
your greater progressions that way two

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.300 
your greater progressions that way two
people<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:19.530> do<00:02:19.650> five<00:02:19.830> or<00:02:19.980> six<00:02:20.130> repetitions

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
people just do five or six repetitions

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.580 
people just do five or six repetitions
it<00:02:21.290> that's<00:02:22.290> lovely

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
it that's lovely

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.880 
it that's lovely
that's<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:23.100> story<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.090> forceful<00:02:24.890> explosive

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
that's it story a forceful explosive

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.340 
that's it story a forceful explosive
movements<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.370> really<00:02:26.670> controlled<00:02:27.350> as

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
movements it's really controlled as

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.960 
movements it's really controlled as
great<00:02:28.739> clatters<00:02:29.100> there's<00:02:29.280> partly<00:02:29.670> warm-up

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
great clatters there's partly warm-up

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.699 
great clatters there's partly warm-up
and<00:02:30.120> reduce<00:02:30.390> up<00:02:30.569> Rebecca<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.200> keeping<00:02:31.470> injury

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
and reduce up Rebecca and keeping injury

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.100 
and reduce up Rebecca and keeping injury
free<00:02:31.920> through<00:02:32.100> season

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.020 

so<00:02:37.650> now<00:02:37.740> include<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.250> bit<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.460> abduction<00:02:38.760> aids

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
so now include a bit of abduction aids

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.910 
so now include a bit of abduction aids
in<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.180> movement<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.600> well<00:02:39.750> people<00:02:40.530> with<00:02:40.740> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
in the movement as well people with the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.610 
in the movement as well people with the
with<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.490> hip<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.970> glute<00:02:42.180> thing<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:43.350> well

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
with the hip and glute thing so well

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.800 
with the hip and glute thing so well
when<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.890> do<00:02:44.010> Peter<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.370> stack<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.730> legs<00:02:44.880> and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
when you do Peter is stack the legs and

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.560 
when you do Peter is stack the legs and
just<00:02:46.110> lift<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.380> legs<00:02:46.650> straight<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.210> might<00:02:48.210> go

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.790 

make<00:02:51.570> sure<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.720> hips<00:02:51.900> are<00:02:52.080> stacked<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.440> top<00:02:52.500> on

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
make sure the hips are stacked on top on

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.350 
make sure the hips are stacked on top on
oh<00:02:52.830> they're<00:02:53.130> not<00:02:53.280> rocking<00:02:53.640> for<00:02:53.850> not<00:02:54.060> walking

oh they're not rocking for not walking
back<00:02:54.860> it's<00:02:55.860> good<00:02:56.390> up<00:02:57.830> down

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
back it's good up down

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.160 
back it's good up down
so<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:02.000> quick<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.360> exercise<00:03:03.660> combined

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
so this quick so this exercise combined
