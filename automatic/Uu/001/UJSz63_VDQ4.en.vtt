00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.930 
shaped like an S put on the points dig
into<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:48.510> spring<00:02:49.680> push<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.489> it<00:02:51.580> simply

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
into the spring push it and it simply

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.150 
into the spring push it and it simply
comes<00:02:52.180> out<00:02:52.360> spring<00:02:53.050> will<00:02:53.230> not<00:02:53.500> come<00:02:53.800> out<00:02:53.920> on

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
comes out spring will not come out on

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.979 
comes out spring will not come out on
its<00:02:54.190> own<00:02:54.989> okay<00:02:55.989> there<00:02:56.530> we<00:02:56.770> have<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.130> done<00:02:57.340> now

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
its own okay there we have that done now

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.240 
its own okay there we have that done now
with<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.110> own<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.380> have<00:02:59.530> one<00:02:59.709> piece<00:02:59.890> in<00:03:00.100> here

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
with you own you have one piece in here

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.960 
with you own you have one piece in here
we<00:03:00.670> drop<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.030> spring<00:03:01.980> simply<00:03:02.980> just<00:03:03.220> put<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.790> in

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
we drop the spring simply just put it in

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.180 
we drop the spring simply just put it in
here<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:06.160> it's<00:03:06.400> just<00:03:06.519> like<00:03:06.640> that

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
here so it's just like that

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.490 
here so it's just like that
next<00:03:09.360> use<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:10.570> piece<00:03:10.780> that<00:03:10.989> also<00:03:11.019> came<00:03:11.440> out

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
next use this piece that also came out

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.960 
next use this piece that also came out
of<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.860> barrel<00:03:13.140> drop<00:03:14.140> that<00:03:14.320> in<00:03:14.470> here<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:14.970> it's

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
of the barrel drop that in here so it's

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.289 
of the barrel drop that in here so it's
exactly<00:03:16.390> like<00:03:16.570> this<00:03:17.580> what<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.730> next<00:03:19.000> want<00:03:19.150> to

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
exactly like this what you next want to

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.420 
exactly like this what you next want to
do<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:20.470> take<00:03:20.739> this<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.959> push<00:03:22.959> it<00:03:23.140> down<00:03:23.430> it'll

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
do is take this and push it down it'll

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.539 
do is take this and push it down it'll
make<00:03:24.579> a<00:03:24.610> little<00:03:24.730> click<00:03:25.350> it's<00:03:26.350> good<00:03:26.620> makes<00:03:27.400> it

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
make a little click it's good makes it

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.050 
make a little click it's good makes it
realistic<00:03:27.820> too<00:03:28.209> okay<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.769> take<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.730> grip

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
realistic too okay you take this grip

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.350 
realistic too okay you take this grip
from<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.390> ultra<00:03:31.900> around<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.410> stick<00:03:32.620> grip<00:03:32.799> pen

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
from the ultra around the stick grip pen

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.350 
from the ultra around the stick grip pen
put<00:03:34.360> this<00:03:34.540> simply<00:03:35.019> on<00:03:35.200> top<00:03:35.440> of<00:03:35.590> here<00:03:36.150> this<00:03:37.150> is

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
put this simply on top of here this is

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.930 
put this simply on top of here this is
so<00:03:37.600> when<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:37.900> shoot<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:39.160> guts<00:03:39.400> don't<00:03:39.640> come

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
so when you shoot the guts don't come

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.390 
so when you shoot the guts don't come
flying<00:03:40.239> out<00:03:40.480> because<00:03:41.049> when<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:41.320> shoot<00:03:41.620> this

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
flying out because when you shoot this

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.970 
flying out because when you shoot this
is<00:03:42.610> supposed<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.910> come<00:03:43.060> out<00:03:43.090> only<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:44.590> if<00:03:44.799> you

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
is supposed to come out only but if you

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.280 
is supposed to come out only but if you
don't<00:03:45.130> have<00:03:45.250> this<00:03:45.400> in<00:03:45.720> first<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.840> all<00:03:46.930> this<00:03:47.110> is

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
don't have this in first of all this is

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.830 
don't have this in first of all this is
thinner<00:03:47.620> than<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.579> grip<00:03:48.820> okay<00:03:49.630> obviously

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
thinner than the grip okay obviously

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.110 
thinner than the grip okay obviously
then<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.440> grip<00:03:50.709> wouldn't<00:03:51.040> have<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.730> purpose

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
then the grip wouldn't have a purpose

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.460 
then the grip wouldn't have a purpose
for<00:03:52.329> a<00:03:52.360> pen<00:03:52.570> but<00:03:53.200> these<00:03:53.470> however<00:03:53.860> are<00:03:55.470> thicker

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
for a pen but these however are thicker

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.110 
for a pen but these however are thicker
than<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.040> grip<00:03:57.480> meaning<00:03:59.160> that<00:04:00.160> if<00:04:00.489> you<00:04:00.579> were

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
than the grip meaning that if you were

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.990 
than the grip meaning that if you were
to<00:04:01.329> shoot<00:04:02.070> they<00:04:03.070> would<00:04:03.250> not<00:04:03.400> come<00:04:03.610> out<00:04:03.760> they

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
to shoot they would not come out they

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.900 
to shoot they would not come out they
would<00:04:04.090> actually<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.690> grip<00:04:04.900> would<00:04:05.049> stop<00:04:05.350> them

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
would actually the grip would stop them

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.580 
would actually the grip would stop them
would<00:04:06.910> stop<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.540> guts<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.989> fly<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:08.410> from

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
would stop the guts to fly it from

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.060 
would stop the guts to fly it from
flying<00:04:08.890> out<00:04:10.260> that's<00:04:11.260> why<00:04:11.410> you<00:04:11.500> have<00:04:11.620> this<00:04:11.769> grip

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
flying out that's why you have this grip

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.129 
flying out that's why you have this grip
