00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
say it is small a bit smaller when you

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.469 
say it is small a bit smaller when you
feel<00:01:57.650> it<00:01:57.710> smaller<00:01:58.310> when<00:01:58.550> it<00:01:58.700> gets<00:01:58.909> smaller<00:01:59.270> to

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.630 
feel it smaller when it gets smaller to
you<00:01:59.600> then<00:01:59.840> it<00:01:59.960> gets<00:02:00.050> smaller<00:02:00.440> don't<00:02:01.310> try<00:02:01.580> and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
you then it gets smaller don't try and

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.690 
you then it gets smaller don't try and
force<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.210> yeah<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.160> moment<00:02:04.340> it's<00:02:04.550> not

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700

getting<00:02:04.970> smaller<00:02:05.210> I'm<00:02:05.479> thinking<00:02:05.900> smaller<00:02:06.259> but

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
getting smaller I'm thinking smaller but

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.870 
getting smaller I'm thinking smaller but
it's<00:02:06.619> not<00:02:06.800> getting<00:02:07.100> smaller<00:02:07.400> so<00:02:07.610> I'm<00:02:07.729> not

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
it's not getting smaller so I'm not

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.690 
it's not getting smaller so I'm not
going<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.090> force<00:02:08.360> it<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:09.649> let<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:10.009> it's<00:02:10.310> my<00:02:10.550> own

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
going to force it you let it it's my own

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.680 
going to force it you let it it's my own
mind<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.360> it's<00:02:11.930> just<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.260> way<00:02:12.380> it<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.650> yeah
