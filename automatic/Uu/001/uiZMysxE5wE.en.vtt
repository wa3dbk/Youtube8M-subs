the<00:01:59.670> next<00:01:59.939> step<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.509> take<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> finishing

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the next step is to take the finishing

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.020 
the next step is to take the finishing
nails<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.680> insert<00:02:02.009> them<00:02:02.219> into<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.610> notches

nails and insert them into the notches
of<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.329> vertical<00:02:03.570> pieces<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> round<00:02:04.680> head

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
of the vertical pieces with a round head

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.959 
of the vertical pieces with a round head
facing<00:02:05.250> inwards

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
facing inwards

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.389 
facing inwards
you<00:02:06.899> might<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> force<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.250> does

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
you might have to force it in if it does

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.330 
you might have to force it in if it does
not<00:02:08.550> fit<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:09.750> secure<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.289> add<00:02:10.470> some<00:02:10.860> hot<00:02:11.009> glue

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
not fit to secure it add some hot glue

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:23.240 
not fit to secure it add some hot glue
or<00:02:11.519> wood

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.340 

next<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.180> will<00:02:24.240> need<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.450> drill<00:02:24.810> some<00:02:25.020> small

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
next you will need to drill some small

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.410 
next you will need to drill some small
pilot<00:02:25.650> holes<00:02:26.010> into<00:02:26.370> both<00:02:26.670> ends<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.210> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
pilot holes into both ends of the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.920 
pilot holes into both ends of the
horizontal<00:02:28.020> pieces<00:02:28.910> at<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.120> step<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.750> may

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
horizontal pieces at this step you may
