00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 dragons are the type of animal of 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.379
 initially available in the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.849
 sims on a magic pass they returned 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:15.330
 with the dragon valley world in the sims 3 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.850
 dragon eggs cost 49 magic coins 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.720
 and are accessible by seeing that they are going 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.420
 peres that is an added npc in the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.340
 sims on a magic pass where objects 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.460
 for jobs can also be 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.380
 bought when you get a dragon egg 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.270
 by simple need to interact with it 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.520
 because the color of the dragon that will collide 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.879
 depends on how often they interact 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.899
 with the egg say the a6 interactions is the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.250
 red dragon 7 up to 13 gold dragon 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.350
 14 and up is the purple dragon union 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.870
 should be maintained after hatching of the egg 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.300
 because the dragon will use it as a bed and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.160
 locked the reds will probably go 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.170
 burn many objects 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.719
 usually they start to burn things 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.600
 that hatch the name of the dragon that suggests 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.489
 always and burning only one gold dragons 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.130
 little more disciplined but will not 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.720
 igniting surrounding objects if the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.380
 are neglected 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.970
 the name of the dragon is always part 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.250
 Quiet purple are very friendly and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.229
 it was almost never a fire in things 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.299
 however even the purple dragons are 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.240
 creatures very difficult to maintain 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.250
 and can still cause fires 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.200
 especially your dragon has been 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.200
 neglected the name of the dragon is toth 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.690
 sims must interact with your dragon 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.460
 often the rebirth of the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.280
 suffering can only be done by means of 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.230
 their purchases in the magic city beyond 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.980
 to encourage various items around 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.780
 a batch 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.000
 dragons can set fire to life in the 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.030
 visits resulting in his death 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.140
 dragons like flowers especially ours 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.120
 the yellow ones 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.400
 they can also eat spoiled food 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.200
 and piles of garbage when the Indians 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.450
 dragons must be very careful with a 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.620
 all spell I was chan 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.290

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:27.380
