it was something unique and different so
I<00:00:43.020> knew<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.950> wanted<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> buy<00:00:44.370> this

so that I could show you guys and do a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.880 
so that I could show you guys and do a
review<00:00:46.800> now<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.120> don't<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.660> an<00:00:48.930> iPhone<00:00:49.110> 6<00:00:49.680> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
review now I don't have an iPhone 6 I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.979 
review now I don't have an iPhone 6 I
have<00:00:49.920> an<00:00:50.070> iPhone<00:00:50.190> 6<00:00:50.640> plus<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> can't

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
have an iPhone 6 plus so I can't

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.900 
have an iPhone 6 plus so I can't
actually<00:00:52.230> put<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> phone<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
actually put it on the phone but I

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.119 
actually put it on the phone but I
figured<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.440> at<00:00:55.680> least<00:00:55.860> make

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
figured what I do is that at least make

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.799 
figured what I do is that at least make
a<00:00:56.160> video<00:00:56.460> showing<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.030> my<00:00:57.180> impressions<00:00:57.719> of

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
a video showing you my impressions of

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.020 
a video showing you my impressions of
the<00:00:57.899> build<00:00:58.109> quality<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.760> video

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the build quality and this video

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.060 
the build quality and this video
essentially<00:01:00.510> serves<00:01:00.750> as<00:01:01.109> something<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.859> little

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
essentially serves as something a little

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.920 
essentially serves as something a little
bit<00:01:02.160> better<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.760> more<00:01:02.969> reliable<00:01:03.510> than<00:01:03.719> just

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
bit better and more reliable than just

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.870 
bit better and more reliable than just
looking<00:01:04.229> at<00:01:04.320> press<00:01:04.589> images<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.729> video

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
looking at press images in this video

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.670 
looking at press images in this video
you<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> nice<00:01:06.689> idea<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> true

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
you really get a nice idea of the true

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.429 
you really get a nice idea of the true
quality<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.549> device<00:01:08.670> well<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:10.020> product

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
quality of the device well the product

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.330 
quality of the device well the product
so<00:01:11.130> let's<00:01:11.520> take<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> closer<00:01:12.180> look<00:01:12.299> now<00:01:13.340> jumping

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
so let's take a closer look now jumping

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.640 
so let's take a closer look now jumping
to<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> most<00:01:14.939> unique<00:01:15.330> aspect<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> case<00:01:16.259> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
to the most unique aspect of the case it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.590 
to the most unique aspect of the case it
definitely<00:01:16.979> has<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.729> material<00:01:18.330> in

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
definitely has to be this material in

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.960 
definitely has to be this material in
the<00:01:18.900> middle<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.009> inside<00:01:20.400> it's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the middle here in the inside it's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.969 
the middle here in the inside it's
almost<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> carpet<00:01:22.049> material<00:01:22.200> now

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
almost like a carpet material now

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.649 
almost like a carpet material now
obviously<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:24.060> real<00:01:24.240> carpet

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
obviously it's not like real carpet

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.020 
obviously it's not like real carpet
because<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.290> sticker<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:26.159> way<00:01:26.340> but

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
because it's just a sticker in a way but

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.640 
because it's just a sticker in a way but
this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.450> something<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.869> don't<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.560> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
this is something I don't really see it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.499 
this is something I don't really see it
often<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.280> phone<00:01:29.610> cases<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.119> fact<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.450> is

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
often on phone cases in fact this is

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.730 
often on phone cases in fact this is
really<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.750> first<00:01:30.869> phone<00:01:31.140> case<00:01:31.350> I've<00:01:31.530> seen

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
really the first phone case I've seen

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.370 
really the first phone case I've seen
with<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.250> material<00:01:32.689> now<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.750> do<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
with this material now we do have the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
another unique aspect of this case is

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.520 
another unique aspect of this case is
the<00:02:05.640> two<00:02:05.820> part<00:02:06.090> design<00:02:06.420> now<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.350> not

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
the two part design now it is not

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.919 
the two part design now it is not
multi-layer<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.640> OtterBox<00:02:09.330> cases<00:02:09.599> or

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
multi-layer like OtterBox cases or

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.020 
multi-layer like OtterBox cases or
incipio<00:02:10.349> cases<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.009> instead<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.670> slider

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
incipio cases but instead it's a slider

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.860 
incipio cases but instead it's a slider
case

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
case

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.900 
case
and<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.440> slides<00:02:13.740> because<00:02:14.130> what<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.610> do<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.819> you

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
and it slides because what you do is you

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.760 
and it slides because what you do is you
slide<00:02:15.120> off<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.360> bottom<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.050> then<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.470> slide

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
slide off the bottom and then you slide

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.520 
slide off the bottom and then you slide
the<00:02:16.950> phone<00:02:17.100> up<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:18.060> chute<00:02:18.600> here<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.140> once

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the phone up in this chute here and once

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.380 
the phone up in this chute here and once
the<00:02:19.650> phone<00:02:19.800> slid<00:02:20.160> up<00:02:20.310> then<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.819> just<00:02:20.970> put<00:02:21.209> on

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
the phone slid up then you just put on

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.130 
the phone slid up then you just put on
the<00:02:21.750> bottom<00:02:22.050> cap<00:02:22.319> now<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.730> design<00:02:23.970> it's<00:02:24.900> not

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
the bottom cap now this design it's not

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.350 
the bottom cap now this design it's not
a<00:02:25.170> bad<00:02:25.530> design<00:02:25.980> but<00:02:26.670> not<00:02:26.700> really<00:02:27.090> what<00:02:27.209> I

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
a bad design but not really what I

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.110 
a bad design but not really what I
prefer<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.110> do<00:02:28.440> prefer<00:02:29.040> those<00:02:29.459> traditional

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
prefer I do prefer those traditional

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.290 
prefer I do prefer those traditional
multi-layer<00:02:31.020> cases<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.790> different

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
multi-layer cases but it is different

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.260 
multi-layer cases but it is different
and<00:02:33.510> if<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.340> style<00:02:35.640> then<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.150> might

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
and if you like this style then it might

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.430 
and if you like this style then it might
be<00:02:36.300> good<00:02:36.480> for<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.930> know<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.319> is

on

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.090 
on
maybe<00:03:12.480> Amazon<00:03:12.989> or<00:03:13.140> something<00:03:13.170> but<00:03:13.980> that's

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
maybe Amazon or something but that's

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.770 
maybe Amazon or something but that's
really<00:03:14.340> what<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.610> see<00:03:15.030> as<00:03:15.239> being<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.569> main

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
really what I see as being the main

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.509 
really what I see as being the main
benefit<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.350> having<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.620> case<00:03:16.799> of<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.130> design

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
benefit to having a case of this design

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.819 
benefit to having a case of this design
these<00:03:18.420> are<00:03:18.600> definitely<00:03:18.930> more<00:03:19.049> popular<00:03:19.560> with

these are definitely more popular with

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.920 
these are definitely more popular with
the<00:03:20.100> original<00:03:20.579> iPhones<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.090> came<00:03:21.329> out<00:03:21.480> the

popular<00:03:24.780> but<00:03:25.170> just<00:03:25.950> think<00:03:26.160> about<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:26.519> as<00:03:26.730> one

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
popular but just think about this as one

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.449 
popular but just think about this as one

colors are also they're interesting very
different<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:33.360> isn't<00:03:33.720> really<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.989> color

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
different this isn't really a color

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.759 
different this isn't really a color
scheme<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:35.100> would<00:03:35.280> put<00:03:35.459> on<00:03:35.519> my<00:03:35.700> own<00:03:36.030> phone

scheme that I would put on my own phone

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.460 
scheme that I would put on my own phone
it's<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.860> little<00:03:38.100> bit<00:03:38.280> feminine<00:03:38.579> in<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.090> way

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
it's a little bit feminine in a way

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.840 
it's a little bit feminine in a way
especially<00:03:40.470> this<00:03:40.650> light<00:03:40.890> blue<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.430> gold<00:03:41.640> of

nice access their large holes here for

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.900 
nice access their large holes here for
the<00:03:54.510> ports<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.440> 3.5<00:03:56.040> millimeter<00:03:56.640> headphone

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
the ports so 3.5 millimeter headphone

jack<00:03:57.090> port<00:03:57.570> is<00:03:57.840> there<00:03:58.079> you<00:03:58.170> open<00:03:58.350> so<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.190> the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
jack port is there you open so is the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.910 
jack port is there you open so is the
lightning<00:03:59.670> cable<00:03:59.850> port<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:01.500> speaker

lightning cable port and the speaker

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.400 
lightning cable port and the speaker
grille<00:04:02.250> would<00:04:02.940> be<00:04:03.090> very<00:04:03.420> nicely<00:04:03.660> exposed<00:04:04.079> here

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
grille would be very nicely exposed here

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.140 
grille would be very nicely exposed here
so<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:04.739> can<00:04:04.859> hear<00:04:05.070> any<00:04:05.250> noise<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:05.760> your

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
phone produces now take a look at the

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.550 
phone produces now take a look at the
buttons<00:04:08.850> here<00:04:09.120> we<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.930> on<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.350> right<00:04:10.530> side

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
buttons here we have on the right side

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.020 
buttons here we have on the right side
the<00:04:11.340> power<00:04:11.760> sleep/wake<00:04:12.630> button<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:14.030> it's

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
the power sleep/wake button and it's

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.759 
the power sleep/wake button and it's
pretty<00:04:15.299> good<00:04:15.540> but<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> little<00:04:16.140> cheap<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.680> way

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
pretty good but a little cheap the way

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.349 
pretty good but a little cheap the way
it's<00:04:16.919> set<00:04:17.070> up<00:04:17.100> let's<00:04:17.400> see<00:04:17.549> how<00:04:17.700> close<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.209> can

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
it's set up let's see how close I can

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.420 
it's set up let's see how close I can
focus<00:04:18.539> this<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.680> button<00:04:19.950> here<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.220> more

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
focus this in the button here is more

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.379 
focus this in the button here is more
like<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.640> cantilever<00:04:21.060> piece<00:04:21.359> of<00:04:21.510> plastic<00:04:21.989> just

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
like a cantilever piece of plastic just

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:23.909 
like a cantilever piece of plastic just
connected<00:04:22.659> by<00:04:22.689> a<00:04:22.810> just<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.199> little<00:04:23.409> piece<00:04:23.650> there

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
connected by a just a little piece there

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.350 
connected by a just a little piece there
so<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.520> does<00:04:24.639> feel<00:04:24.879> like<00:04:24.939> something<00:04:25.330> that

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
so it does feel like something that

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.820 
so it does feel like something that
might<00:04:25.479> come<00:04:25.599> off<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.379> that<00:04:26.499> would<00:04:26.620> really<00:04:26.740> be

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
might come off and that would really be

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.459 
might come off and that would really be
a<00:04:26.949> big<00:04:27.129> disaster<00:04:27.249> if<00:04:27.699> it<00:04:27.789> came<00:04:27.909> off<00:04:28.150> because

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:28.469 
a big disaster if it came off because

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:30.959 
a big disaster if it came off because
the<00:04:29.469> button<00:04:29.770> would<00:04:30.189> be<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.400> lot<00:04:30.669> harder<00:04:30.819> to

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969 
the button would be a lot harder to

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.879 
the button would be a lot harder to
press<00:04:31.300> because<00:04:31.539> it<00:04:31.659> would<00:04:31.779> be<00:04:31.900> indented<00:04:32.710> and

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
press because it would be indented and

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.760 
press because it would be indented and
sunk<00:04:33.189> in<00:04:33.569> so<00:04:34.569> think<00:04:35.050> about<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.349> but<00:04:35.650> I<00:04:35.680> really

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
sunk in so think about that but I really

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.439 
sunk in so think about that but I really
don't<00:04:36.009> see<00:04:36.069> it<00:04:36.189> breaking<00:04:36.490> necessarily<00:04:37.240> but

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
don't see it breaking necessarily but

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:38.700 
don't see it breaking necessarily but
it's<00:04:37.629> definitely<00:04:37.749> not<00:04:37.960> one<00:04:38.229> of<00:04:38.259> the<00:04:38.379> highest

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
it's definitely not one of the highest

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.040 
it's definitely not one of the highest
quality<00:04:39.099> buttons<00:04:39.490> that<00:04:39.699> I've<00:04:39.819> seen<00:04:40.120> now

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
quality buttons that I've seen now

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.179 
quality buttons that I've seen now
flipping<00:04:41.319> over<00:04:41.439> on<00:04:41.620> this<00:04:41.710> side<00:04:41.770> it's

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:42.189 
flipping over on this side it's

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.339 
flipping over on this side it's
basically<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.729> same<00:04:42.879> construction<00:04:43.360> for<00:04:43.990> the

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
basically the same construction for the

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.879 
basically the same construction for the
volume<00:04:45.310> up<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.669> down<00:04:45.699> buttons<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.629> then<00:04:47.349> the

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
volume up and down buttons and then the

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.159 
volume up and down buttons and then the
mute<00:04:48.069> switch<00:04:48.370> of<00:04:48.969> course<00:04:49.270> doesn't<00:04:49.569> have<00:04:49.689> any

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
mute switch of course doesn't have any

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.540 
mute switch of course doesn't have any
sort<00:04:50.439> of<00:04:50.529> cover<00:04:50.710> on<00:04:50.919> it<00:04:50.949> so<00:04:51.099> you<00:04:51.279> really<00:04:51.340> have

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
sort of cover on it so you really have

and off now taking a look at this side
we<00:04:58.719> do<00:04:58.840> have<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.409> hole<00:04:59.740> for<00:05:00.219> the<00:05:00.400> camera<00:05:00.430> and

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
we do have the hole for the camera and

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.360 
we do have the hole for the camera and
it's<00:05:01.689> nice<00:05:01.870> and<00:05:01.900> open<00:05:02.110> normally<00:05:02.979> on<00:05:03.099> pretty

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
much any case it's not really an issue

you about the hole for the camera

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.879 
you about the hole for the camera
usually<00:05:06.849> all<00:05:07.060> of<00:05:07.090> them<00:05:07.360> are<00:05:07.539> ample<00:05:08.199> size<00:05:08.409> and

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
usually all of them are ample size and

this is no different from those now my

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
final verdict for this case is kind of

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.089 
final verdict for this case is kind of
average<00:05:15.939> I've<00:05:16.389> got<00:05:16.629> to<00:05:16.750> say<00:05:16.930> for<00:05:17.439> the<00:05:17.620> price<00:05:17.770> of

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:21.879 
1699 I would kind of expect something of

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.969 
1699 I would kind of expect something of
a<00:05:21.939> little<00:05:22.180> higher<00:05:22.360> quality<00:05:22.900> of<00:05:23.110> course<00:05:23.710> this

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
a little higher quality of course this

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.469 
a little higher quality of course this
little<00:05:24.129> carpeted<00:05:24.699> pad<00:05:24.909> here<00:05:25.240> which<00:05:25.389> I

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
little carpeted pad here which I

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.019 
little carpeted pad here which I
absolutely<00:05:25.629> love<00:05:26.229> really<00:05:26.830> is<00:05:27.099> awesome<00:05:27.339> and<00:05:27.849> I

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 
absolutely love really is awesome and I

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:29.790 
absolutely love really is awesome and I
really<00:05:28.270> do<00:05:28.449> appreciate<00:05:28.839> that<00:05:29.169> they<00:05:29.409> included

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
really do appreciate that they included

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.950 
really do appreciate that they included
that<00:05:29.919> high<00:05:30.099> quality<00:05:30.159> piece<00:05:30.819> inside<00:05:31.569> the<00:05:31.750> case

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
that high quality piece inside the case

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.320 
that high quality piece inside the case
however<00:05:32.710> everything<00:05:33.339> else<00:05:33.550> just<00:05:33.699> seems<00:05:34.060> quite

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
however everything else just seems quite

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.059 
however everything else just seems quite
cheap<00:05:34.569> if<00:05:34.810> they<00:05:35.020> didn't<00:05:35.259> have<00:05:35.439> this<00:05:35.800> piece

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
cheap if they didn't have this piece

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.040 
cheap if they didn't have this piece
here<00:05:36.400> I<00:05:36.580> would<00:05:36.939> really<00:05:37.120> say<00:05:37.330> this<00:05:37.569> is<00:05:37.719> a<00:05:37.750> really

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
here I would really say this is a really

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.809 
here I would really say this is a really
cheap<00:05:38.229> case<00:05:38.500> like<00:05:38.800> not<00:05:38.919> even<00:05:39.129> really<00:05:39.310> worth<00:05:39.460> 10

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
cheap case like not even really worth 10

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.969 
cheap case like not even really worth 10
bucks<00:05:40.050> so<00:05:41.050> that's<00:05:41.110> definitely<00:05:41.529> something<00:05:41.919> to

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
bucks so that's definitely something to

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.950 
bucks so that's definitely something to
consider<00:05:42.069> this<00:05:43.000> bottom<00:05:43.389> piece<00:05:43.539> that<00:05:43.810> comes

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
consider this bottom piece that comes

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.869 
consider this bottom piece that comes
off<00:05:44.169> the<00:05:44.199> slider<00:05:44.589> design<00:05:45.069> that's<00:05:45.490> something<00:05:45.849> a

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:45.879 
off the slider design that's something a

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.519 
off the slider design that's something a
little<00:05:46.330> bit<00:05:46.419> niche<00:05:46.659> that's<00:05:47.080> not<00:05:47.289> something

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:47.529 
little bit niche that's not something

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:49.200 
little bit niche that's not something
you<00:05:47.680> find<00:05:47.860> in<00:05:48.099> most<00:05:48.189> other<00:05:48.430> cases<00:05:48.669> so<00:05:49.120> if

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
you find in most other cases so if

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.040 
you find in most other cases so if
that's<00:05:49.330> something<00:05:49.569> you're<00:05:49.750> really<00:05:49.930> looking

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
that's something you're really looking

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.379 
that's something you're really looking
for<00:05:50.229> this<00:05:51.069> case<00:05:51.370> might<00:05:51.639> be<00:05:51.759> one<00:05:51.909> of<00:05:51.939> your<00:05:52.060> few

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
for this case might be one of your few

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.360 
for this case might be one of your few
choices<00:05:52.659> now<00:05:53.620> another<00:05:53.919> thing<00:05:54.069> I<00:05:54.129> forgot<00:05:54.250> to

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
choices now another thing I forgot to

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.800 
choices now another thing I forgot to
mention<00:05:54.550> is<00:05:54.849> it<00:05:55.029> comes<00:05:55.240> in<00:05:55.389> several<00:05:55.599> other

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
mention is it comes in several other

mention is it comes in several other
colors<00:05:56.229> including<00:05:56.889> black<00:05:57.189> white<00:05:57.610> and<00:05:57.879> red<00:05:58.360> and

but<00:06:04.419> yeah<00:06:04.689> my<00:06:04.899> final<00:06:05.169> verdict<00:06:05.439> is<00:06:05.560> I<00:06:05.740> think

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
but yeah my final verdict is I think

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.980 
but yeah my final verdict is I think
it's<00:06:06.009> a<00:06:06.039> little<00:06:06.219> overpriced<00:06:06.639> if<00:06:07.419> I<00:06:07.599> had<00:06:07.870> the

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
it's a little overpriced if I had the

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.959 
it's a little overpriced if I had the
choice<00:06:08.169> now<00:06:08.680> assuming<00:06:09.219> that<00:06:09.370> it's<00:06:09.580> in<00:06:09.669> a<00:06:09.759> color

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:09.969 
choice now assuming that it's in a color

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.510 
choice now assuming that it's in a color
of<00:06:10.089> my<00:06:10.509> taste<00:06:10.899> I<00:06:11.289> probably<00:06:12.009> still<00:06:12.219> wouldn't<00:06:12.399> go

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
of my taste I probably still wouldn't go

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.719 
of my taste I probably still wouldn't go
for<00:06:12.789> it<00:06:12.939> I'm<00:06:13.089> not<00:06:13.330> a<00:06:13.360> big<00:06:13.539> fan<00:06:13.750> of<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.699> kind<00:06:15.699> of

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
for it I'm not a big fan of the kind of

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.309 
for it I'm not a big fan of the kind of
the<00:06:15.819> cheap<00:06:15.969> plastics<00:06:16.449> on<00:06:16.569> the<00:06:16.659> outside<00:06:16.960> here

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
the cheap plastics on the outside here

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.950 
the cheap plastics on the outside here
now<00:06:17.800> it's<00:06:18.759> not<00:06:18.939> the<00:06:19.089> worst<00:06:19.300> I've<00:06:19.539> ever<00:06:19.629> seen

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
now it's not the worst I've ever seen

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.170 
now it's not the worst I've ever seen
but<00:06:20.620> I'm<00:06:20.800> just<00:06:20.949> saying<00:06:21.189> for<00:06:21.370> the<00:06:21.460> price<00:06:21.669> it's

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
but I'm just saying for the price it's

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.360 
but I'm just saying for the price it's
not<00:06:22.419> the<00:06:22.569> best<00:06:22.779> now<00:06:23.409> in<00:06:23.560> a<00:06:23.620> previous<00:06:23.979> review<00:06:24.159> I

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
not the best now in a previous review I

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.540 
not the best now in a previous review I
did<00:06:24.580> another<00:06:24.759> case<00:06:25.060> from<00:06:25.469> max<00:06:26.469> boost<00:06:26.830> and<00:06:27.189> I

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
did another case from max boost and I

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.459 
did another case from max boost and I
did<00:06:27.729> this<00:06:28.330> other<00:06:28.509> case<00:06:28.839> that<00:06:28.990> they<00:06:29.080> have<00:06:29.229> it's

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:29.469 
did this other case that they have it's

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:31.559 
did this other case that they have it's

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
quality and it's actually a few dollars
