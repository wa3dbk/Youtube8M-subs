 very specific attacks and all in 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.320
 a memory ball so how does the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.120
 recover and well it's very simple 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.860
 you have to start by creating yourself 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.719
 an account on pocket cheikh so 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.180
 wait i'm going to disconnect myself for 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.710
 show you here so there you have 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.770
 already registered so if you already have a 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.050
 camp you register connect 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.760
 sorry and if we are not registered ben 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.149
 you have that one is a nickname and a word 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:04.710
 password and an email address 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:07.080
 go we'll connect that's it then 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.350
 then you will have notebook on the news 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.750
 from eternit to click on the link 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.220
 of evoli and you will land on a page 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.780
 like this with the features 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.610
 then how to add it to 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.189
 download went very simple 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.680
 look here you added to the 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.159
 download jts so you only have to 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.530
 click on the small button 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.020
 here you have a message that appears 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.299
 and who tells you that pokemon 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.009
 will receive will be part of a raid in 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.079
 first to avoid being cloned or 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.960
 sent on the gts since it's when 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.159
 even a pokemon at dock finally edit 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.439
 rather here and there you see the little 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.180
 message you have a pokemon on hold 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.280
 to download on the gts 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.829
 so now how to do that is 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:07.110
 very simple 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:09.479
 you turn on your nintendo ds it's a 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.010
 little sound then you have to 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.190
 go to the nintendo cwf settings 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.239
 here you go in the settings 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.370
 Wi-Fi connection 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:25.769
 you have in your connection 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.840
 main focus 9 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.530
 this is it will be she does not want to be done 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.090
 good too bad then you go down I 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.630
 I'm sorry we really see you but you 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:42.090
 go in getting dns auto and you 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.440
 put name and for the primary dns that's it 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.120
 the focus is done it's simple 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.739
 you have to put the one that appears on 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.930
 pau kiczek here it is 87 points 98 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.590
 points 141 points 99 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.530
 watch those of the snow change 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.769
 regularly 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.510
 finally you if you recover 7 evolved 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.000
 after May 7 it will take you 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.049
 enter the dns indicated by poker cup 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.970
 who will have changed 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:16.440
 so we validate then we said I 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.940
 find a set I should have taken the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.000
 style and it would have been much more 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.000
 simple 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.569
 141 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.849
 and on the 19th we made you validate 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.790
 you say that the parameters are 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.730
 correct and save you the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.640
 settings 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.180
 after you come back okay again the 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:49.280
 game is reviving and there is only waiting 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.319
 that the menu arrives then why in 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.349
 evolving pokemon gifts simply 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.079
 because our size has been long 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.579
 the dull mascot is therefore rather 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.280
 than to offer you a pokemon already 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.200
 sold but we thought why not 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.180
 give you a gift of his pre- evolution 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:13.280
 here we deny any fault of the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:15.170
 wireless connection during this game and 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.570
 so here we are in a pokemon center 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.930
 we will connect immediately to the 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.930
 gts 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.889
 we can make an exchange to change and 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.930
 yes of course need your 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.880
 business are connected to the wifi at 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.520
 you're working it did not have any 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.520
 wifi connection scene for hidden 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:48.770
 defeat and there it may be a little 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.430
 more complicated so connect wi fi 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.139
 nintendo 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.729
 you may encounter a 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.529
 error message so no worries 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.300
 it's quite normal firefighters 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.430
 Czech Republic has a large number of members and 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.139
 a lot of connections 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.569
 if you see a message from madiba of 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.009
 persevere but patience and a little 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:13.089
 of luck is to have recovered your 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:16.900
 small evolve the checking in progress 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:16.900
 and what is it 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.710
 a beautiful evoli and the quality of my 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.480
 phone is really disgusting 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.860
 this is then to show you a little 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.860
 little how he is 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.750
 he really does not want to do 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.660
 the autofocus too bad I'm sorry 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.060
 So here is a small and volition united 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.639
 computer with an original trainer 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.130
 and pernia the 2004 idea and yes because 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:04.100
 we created eternia on April 20, 2004 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.800
 in a bowl memory evolis female 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.139

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.940
 level 10 on April 20, 2013 it's good 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:15.380
 it is that today of a distant country 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:19.910
 he is docile by nature he holds in 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.590
 forgetting to put an object too bad 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.660
 I add I'm going to change to 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.650
 hold the object nugget so this video 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.790
