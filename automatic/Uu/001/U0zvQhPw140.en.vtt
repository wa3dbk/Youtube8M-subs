do<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.540> think<00:02:47.750> they<00:02:47.900> will<00:02:48.049> that<00:02:48.440> will<00:02:48.620> be<00:02:48.799> the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
do you think they will that will be the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.210 
do you think they will that will be the
winning<00:02:49.730> time<00:02:50.030> wall<00:02:50.379> you<00:02:51.379> know<00:02:51.500> because<00:02:52.040> you

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
winning time wall you know because you

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.960 
winning time wall you know because you
see<00:02:52.250> some<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:54.069> cuts<00:02:55.069> they<00:02:55.370> made<00:02:55.610> are

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
see some of the the cuts they made are

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.789 
see some of the the cuts they made are
supposed<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.390> stay<00:02:56.660> on<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:57.170> logs<00:02:57.379> the

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
supposed to stay on the logs the

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.530 
supposed to stay on the logs the
standing<00:02:58.220> log<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.670> they<00:02:59.180> missed<00:02:59.420> that

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
standing log and they missed that

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.289 
standing log and they missed that
several<00:02:59.989> times<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.680> think<00:03:01.209> there<00:03:02.209> are

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
several times and I think there are

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.880 
several times and I think there are
other<00:03:02.420> teams<00:03:02.660> that<00:03:02.930> have<00:03:03.110> practiced<00:03:03.769> this

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
other teams that have practiced this

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.880 
other teams that have practiced this
more<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:04.790> will<00:03:04.940> do<00:03:05.090> much<00:03:05.420> better<00:03:05.890> all

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
more and and will do much better all

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.580 
more and and will do much better all
