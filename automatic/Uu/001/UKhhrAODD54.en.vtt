00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.440
 here is the oliver samsung we are 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.410
 here at ifa 2014 and stand here 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.820
 this is what thinks of the new hwh 7100 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.320
 you see, this is already here 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.710
 just below the diesel below 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.650
 the tv that are salvaged boxes 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.480
 Well tvs are not necessarily 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.220
 known in whose sounds and have 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.800
 In that sense , of course, you have to watch that one 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.300
 also appropriate content with the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.460
 That's why samsung has gotten over 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.350
 a very very long long swinging 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.050
 box will assume I can even 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.790
 samsung can lift this way too 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.690
 a very big box will be webber 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.270
 a total of eight channels 81 box with 320 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.010
 watt and also in chic metal design 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.200
 it 's all with half of it too 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.789
 accordingly to the body hdtv 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.770
 fits and then speak the same 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.870
 matching soundtrack for is a cool one 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.850
 idea because it was not the appropriate one 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.160
 has boxing because 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.019
 tv alone just does not have the sound 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.239
 he needed our living room 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.150
 reasonable to scream because we want to 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.799
 There is a big tv for that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.000
 additional seat down there are small 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.590
 bit a subwoofer for the bass 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.470
 and so on you still need 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.270
 additional device and that's what you need 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.369
 especially not this long 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.960
 soundbar 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.680
 what takes the human being is the human 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.509
 do not sound different and can be easy 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.920
 not to prescribe the subwoofer that is 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.330
 he can be parked somewhere there 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.149
 is not that important in the rest 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.350
 two and who of course has to go straight ahead 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.670
 the tv is not so 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.590
 be irritating before now 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.319
 come together it has a very cool 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.850
 thing if you look at this 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:45.220
 makes it real are so good 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.049
 So a thing here in the living room too 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.330
 Make if you are halfway in the 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.700
 then bought expensive televisions 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.960
 you also have the right sound so 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.090
 look at the thing again 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.320
 a little closer 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.960
 I'll try it now 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.100
 pans to show a bit more accurate so 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.700
 I like it very much 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.810
 the award would I just do not know 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.299
 Of course it is not cheap 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.670
 Of course that had to be done accordingly 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.440
 a little unfussy the look was the short and 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.209
 you liked it when he asked about it 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.800
 have it off in the comments 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.290
 I hope there are still enough videos 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.700
 in this respect abo and we read our days 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.420
 otherwise I am the people again I am everything 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.420
 together
