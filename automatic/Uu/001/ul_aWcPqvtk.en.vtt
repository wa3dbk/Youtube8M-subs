the 3 door went back in 1969 the
interior<00:06:08.370> fairly<00:06:09.370> similar<00:06:09.699> a<00:06:09.880> different

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
interior fairly similar a different

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
wheel and gauges and everything so much

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.499 
wheel and gauges and everything so much
the<00:06:19.750> only<00:06:19.840> the<00:06:20.470> other<00:06:20.590> model<00:06:20.830> 69<00:06:21.389> it's<00:06:22.389> only

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
the only the other model 69 it's only

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:25.290 
the only the other model 69 it's only
when<00:06:22.690> you<00:06:22.780> moved<00:06:22.960> to<00:06:23.139> the<00:06:23.289> SS<00:06:23.770> model<00:06:24.520> they<00:06:24.669> the

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
when you moved to the SS model they the

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.290 
when you moved to the SS model they the
interior<00:06:26.080> changes<00:06:26.320> of<00:06:26.620> it<00:06:27.090> taillights

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
interior changes of it taillights

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.000 
interior changes of it taillights
so<00:06:29.229> you'll<00:06:29.470> see<00:06:29.650> the<00:06:30.610> two-door<00:06:31.440> perhaps<00:06:32.440> a<00:06:32.710> lot

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
so you'll see the two-door perhaps a lot

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.060 
so you'll see the two-door perhaps a lot
different<00:06:33.370> and<00:06:33.550> these<00:06:34.330> are<00:06:34.630> it's<00:06:35.590> a<00:06:35.710> 12<00:06:35.949> inch

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
different and these are it's a 12 inch

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.760 
different and these are it's a 12 inch
wheel<00:06:36.360> five<00:06:37.360> star<00:06:37.599> as<00:06:37.750> well<00:06:37.810> and<00:06:38.500> they<00:06:38.740> have

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:42.240 
caps and cover the whole world the whole
world<00:06:40.810> pretty<00:06:41.260> much<00:06:41.320> instead<00:06:41.770> of<00:06:41.860> a<00:06:41.949> sinister

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
world pretty much instead of a sinister

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.270 
world pretty much instead of a sinister
lot<00:06:42.669> the<00:06:42.760> other<00:06:42.789> three<00:06:43.150> models<00:06:43.479> so<00:06:44.099> above<00:06:45.099> all

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
lot the other three models so above all

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.279 
lot the other three models so above all
of<00:06:45.430> them<00:06:45.690> because<00:06:46.690> this<00:06:46.810> is<00:06:46.870> one<00:06:47.110> of<00:06:47.139> the

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:47.289 
of them because this is one of the

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:49.800 
of them because this is one of the
latest<00:06:47.440> models<00:06:48.210> had<00:06:49.210> more<00:06:49.389> horsepower<00:06:49.780> than

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
latest models had more horsepower than

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.409 
latest models had more horsepower than
the<00:06:50.020> others<00:06:50.260> and<00:06:50.440> pretty<00:06:51.130> much<00:06:51.280> yeah<00:06:51.669> miss<00:06:52.270> P

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
the others and pretty much yeah miss P

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:56.279 
the others and pretty much yeah miss P
she<00:06:53.250> sort<00:06:54.250> of<00:06:54.310> rallied<00:06:54.610> these<00:06:54.789> fair<00:06:55.509> bit<00:06:55.690> in

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
she sort of rallied these fair bit in

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:58.020 
she sort of rallied these fair bit in
fact<00:06:56.470> in<00:06:56.650> their<00:06:56.740> time<00:06:56.979> and<00:06:57.250> made<00:06:57.849> a<00:06:57.880> few

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
fact in their time and made a few

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.060 
fact in their time and made a few
changes<00:06:58.090> to<00:06:58.419> this<00:06:58.599> model<00:06:58.810> brought<00:06:59.440> out<00:06:59.590> the<00:06:59.740> SS

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
changes to this model brought out the SS

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.730 
changes to this model brought out the SS
which<00:07:00.280> had<00:07:00.460> a<00:07:00.490> higher<00:07:00.699> horsepower<00:07:01.740> higher

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
which had a higher horsepower higher

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.920 
which had a higher horsepower higher
compression<00:07:03.130> and<00:07:03.430> overall<00:07:04.300> sportier

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
compression and overall sportier

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.030 
compression and overall sportier
features<00:07:05.940> so

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.040 
features so

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.460 
features so
that's<00:07:08.700> a<00:07:08.820> pretty<00:07:09.360> much<00:07:09.540> run<00:07:09.810> down<00:07:09.990> of<00:07:10.020> the
