Microsoft Access in this video I'm going

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.470 
Microsoft Access in this video I'm going
to<00:00:15.620> import<00:00:15.980> data<00:00:16.219> from<00:00:16.490> Microsoft<00:00:17.060> Excel

unlike<00:00:18.439> my<00:00:18.619> previous<00:00:19.009> video<00:00:19.279> where<00:00:19.579> I

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
unlike my previous video where I

this<00:00:28.510> makes<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:29.050> import<00:00:29.410> process<00:00:29.650> a<00:00:30.130> bit<00:00:30.369> more

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
this makes the import process a bit more

this makes the import process a bit more

effect

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.950 

at<00:05:10.700> this<00:05:10.880> point<00:05:11.150> I've<00:05:11.420> made<00:05:11.660> all<00:05:11.810> of<00:05:11.840> my

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
at this point I've made all of my

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.350 
at this point I've made all of my
Corrections<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:13.310> will<00:05:13.460> ask<00:05:13.610> me<00:05:13.820> if<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:14.120> want<00:05:14.300> to

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
Corrections it will ask me if I want to

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.680 
Corrections it will ask me if I want to
create<00:05:14.630> a<00:05:14.690> query<00:05:14.960> I<00:05:15.260> will<00:05:15.560> click<00:05:15.770> on<00:05:15.920> No

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.900 

so<00:05:19.200> it<00:05:19.320> has<00:05:19.470> created<00:05:19.650> my<00:05:19.950> four<00:05:20.220> tables<00:05:20.610> for<00:05:20.820> me

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
so it has created my four tables for me

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.189 
so it has created my four tables for me
it<00:05:21.720> has<00:05:21.900> foreign<00:05:22.290> keys<00:05:22.590> as<00:05:22.860> lookup<00:05:23.280> fields

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.790 

so<00:05:26.800> far<00:05:27.099> we<00:05:27.580> have<00:05:27.729> imported<00:05:28.150> data<00:05:28.689> with<00:05:29.439> one

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
so far we have imported data with one

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.769 
so far we have imported data with one
many-to-many<00:05:30.340> relationship<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.509> one

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:31.779 
many-to-many relationship and one

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.050 
many-to-many relationship and one
one-to-many<00:05:32.620> relationship<00:05:33.340> we<00:05:33.639> will<00:05:33.789> need<00:05:33.969> to

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
one-to-many relationship we will need to

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.239 
one-to-many relationship we will need to
do<00:05:34.180> some<00:05:34.419> more<00:05:34.689> work<00:05:34.900> in<00:05:35.169> the<00:05:35.379> next<00:05:35.590> video<00:05:35.949> and

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:36.249 
do some more work in the next video and

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:39.059 
do some more work in the next video and
we'll<00:05:36.639> use<00:05:36.699> some<00:05:36.909> complex<00:05:37.629> queries<00:05:38.110> such<00:05:38.830> as

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:39.069 
we'll use some complex queries such as

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.279 
we'll use some complex queries such as
make<00:05:39.310> table<00:05:39.759> append<00:05:40.330> and<00:05:40.569> we<00:05:40.870> will<00:05:41.050> create

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
make table append and we will create

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:49.780 
make table append and we will create
some<00:05:41.560> ad<00:05:41.710> hoc<00:05:41.740> joins

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.850
