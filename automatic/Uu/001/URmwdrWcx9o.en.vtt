00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
to Kerry Teague he's on the inside going

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.920 
to Kerry Teague he's on the inside going
into<00:01:28.420> this<00:01:28.510> corner<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.490> right<00:01:30.910> off<00:01:31.150> and<00:01:31.690> right

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
into this corner and right off and right

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.650 
into this corner and right off and right
across<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.560> corner<00:01:33.360> spinning<00:01:34.360> into<00:01:34.540> the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
across the corner spinning into the

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.170 
across the corner spinning into the
outside<00:01:35.050> into<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.620> grass<00:01:35.830> no<00:01:36.460> Rick<00:01:36.640> I<00:01:36.790> believe

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
outside into the grass no Rick I believe

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.090 
outside into the grass no Rick I believe
he<00:01:37.360> knew<00:01:37.630> he<00:01:37.870> had<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.050> problem<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:38.560> saw<00:01:38.920> him

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
he knew he had a problem you saw him

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.950 
he knew he had a problem you saw him
motioning<00:01:39.610> for<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:39.940> car<00:01:40.180> for<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:40.570> truck<00:01:40.840> to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
motioning for that car for that truck to

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.810 
motioning for that car for that truck to
go<00:01:41.110> another<00:01:41.320> side<00:01:41.680> I<00:01:41.710> think<00:01:41.860> he<00:01:42.280> had<00:01:42.400> just<00:01:42.550> spun

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
go another side I think he had just spun

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.000 
go another side I think he had just spun
out<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.030> lap<00:01:43.660> or<00:01:43.840> two<00:01:43.870> ago<00:01:44.230> maybe<00:01:44.470> it<00:01:44.770> flat

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
out a lap or two ago maybe it flat

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.710 
out a lap or two ago maybe it flat
spotted<00:01:45.340> two<00:01:45.550> tires<00:01:45.790> but<00:01:45.970> he<00:01:46.090> really<00:01:46.510> took<00:01:46.660> a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
spotted two tires but he really took a

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.600 
spotted two tires but he really took a
hard<00:01:46.930> left<00:01:47.170> there<00:01:47.410> as<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:47.590> can<00:01:47.650> see<00:01:47.770> we<00:01:48.310> didn't

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
hard left there as you can see we didn't

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.609 
hard left there as you can see we didn't
see<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:48.880> happen<00:01:49.270> first<00:01:49.780> time<00:01:50.020> around<00:01:50.260> so<00:01:50.560> you

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
see that happen first time around so you

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.350 
see that happen first time around so you
can<00:01:50.860> now<00:01:50.979> I<00:01:51.010> understand<00:01:51.580> why<00:01:51.760> he<00:01:51.940> was<00:01:52.060> slow<00:01:52.330> to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
can now I understand why he was slow to

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.940 
can now I understand why he was slow to
unbuckle<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:53.170> get<00:01:53.380> out<00:01:53.500> of<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.710> truck

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
unbuckle and get out of the truck

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.410 
unbuckle and get out of the truck
because<00:01:54.220> he<00:01:54.340> did<00:01:54.490> hit<00:01:54.670> backwards<00:01:55.150> in<00:01:55.330> the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
because he did hit backwards in the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.210 
because he did hit backwards in the
front<00:01:55.660> part<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.960> truck<00:01:56.050> yeah<00:01:56.800> I<00:01:56.830> tell<00:01:57.190> you

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
front part of the truck yeah I tell you

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.190 
front part of the truck yeah I tell you
you<00:01:57.430> know<00:01:57.490> in<00:01:57.820> almost<00:01:58.090> act<00:01:58.360> like<00:01:58.510> the<00:01:58.780> throttle

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.410 
you know in almost act like the throttle
hung<00:01:59.410> or<00:01:59.680> something<00:02:00.310> I<00:02:00.400> mean<00:02:00.520> he<00:02:00.640> really<00:02:01.119> went

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
hung or something I mean he really went
