00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.500
 parents all came to my store 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.420
 then because they did not stay 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.060

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.640

 earn only good as it is only 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.359
 let's hurry up and get out of here not 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.820
 I understand this game well knowing that no 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.890
 you know it's a good start at least you know 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.140
 that you need help much better than 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.449
 videogame master that I met in my 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.699
 store but to understand the game in the 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.320
 that you're stuck we understand first 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.379
 the games in general you like the 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.800
 games feed or well 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.660
 you like games, I mean 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.120
 you should like it or otherwise because 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.429
 would you be here to me if there are many types 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.030
 of games that we can play like the 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:03.290
 basketball 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.510
 today is a little help 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.250
 Hey, you have a button and with me 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.150
 you can give some arms I have a little bit of 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.990
 disadvantage with this is that you can 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.990
 do with that thing 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.580
 Mr. guide - talk and more defense 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.000
 is football catch the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.000
 Mr. DÃ­az 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:34.759
 all 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:37.840
 there are board games and ari you owe me 20 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.840
 million dollars 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.570
 I was winning that game caray that 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.940
 it was fun if the game of life 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.830
 it can be fun in fact as soon as 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.200
 the game is more fun for you instead of 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.970
 scary you are happier and even the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.770
 Terrifying parts can be fun 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.280
 because you never know what's going to happen to the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.280
 around the corner 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.530
 you see they all have something in common I do not see 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.050
 how basketball and board games 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.050
 have something in common let's see 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.100
 Now watch carefully all the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.490
 games have rules if they do not follow the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.010
 rules you get in trouble 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.600
 everyone also has goals is the 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.810
 goal of the game what you want 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.810
 reach 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.970
 they all have players like you or me 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.480
 or like any other that plays the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.160
 game and finally everyone has challenges is 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.290
 something that has to be overcome to achieve 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.450
 the goal could be the opposing team 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.180
 the difficult parts of a game itself 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.420
 it's fine fantastic but what does it have to 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.030
 see that with me caught here see the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.430
 Chance and life is also like a game 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.220
 and like all life games 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.590
 back rules behind players and rites 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.020
 happens in everyone's life even in the 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.570
 of you friends but in your case ari is 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.000
 a bit more literally wait you said that 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.740
 the game you gave me has no rules 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.600
 no no no no I said missing the 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.700
 instructions but a game can not 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.400
 exist without radios without them you can not 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.320
 play we just need to find out the ones from 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.060
 made we go to the cinema to see a 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.900
 movie that teaches us why the 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.900
 Rules are so important 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.630
 and run movie 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:46.620

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:49.200
 what is right in baseball 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.849

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.849
 I can bring magic 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.700
 now they run 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.069
 and the ball 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.230

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.920
 the children seem to be doing 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.400
 all wrong 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:26.020
 but we do not know how to play 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.020
 seems to forget these rules 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.500

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.320
 excited and happy exactly and it is 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.420

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.860

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.350
