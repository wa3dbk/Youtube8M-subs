okay<00:00:05.980> this<00:00:06.190> is<00:00:06.340> a<00:00:06.370> video<00:00:06.520> of<00:00:06.730> the<00:00:06.819> heart<00:00:07.180> the

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:07.960 
okay this is a video of the heart the

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.390 
okay this is a video of the heart the
anatomy<00:00:08.350> of<00:00:08.380> the<00:00:08.469> heart<00:00:08.680> so<00:00:09.190> we're<00:00:09.309> gonna

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
anatomy of the heart so we're gonna

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.570 
anatomy of the heart so we're gonna
start<00:00:09.670> off<00:00:09.760> by<00:00:09.820> identifying<00:00:10.389> the<00:00:10.780> superior

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
start off by identifying the superior

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.730 
start off by identifying the superior
vena<00:00:12.580> cava<00:00:12.910> there<00:00:13.840> in<00:00:13.960> green<00:00:14.290> and<00:00:16.290> then<00:00:17.290> below

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
vena cava there in green and then below

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.519 
vena cava there in green and then below
that<00:00:17.770> we<00:00:17.980> have<00:00:18.130> the<00:00:18.340> inferior<00:00:19.180> vena<00:00:19.750> cava<00:00:20.080> and

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
that we have the inferior vena cava and

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:27.450 
that we have the inferior vena cava and
yellow<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:25.180> then<00:00:25.509> we<00:00:25.869> have<00:00:26.710> in<00:00:26.980> light<00:00:27.189> pink

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
yellow and then we have in light pink

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.060 
yellow and then we have in light pink
here<00:00:27.790> we<00:00:28.000> have<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:28.599> right<00:00:28.930> ventricle<00:00:29.680> or<00:00:29.860> I'm

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
here we have the right ventricle or I'm

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.240 
here we have the right ventricle or I'm
sorry<00:00:30.279> right<00:00:30.460> atrium<00:00:31.500> then<00:00:32.500> below<00:00:32.860> that<00:00:32.890> in

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
sorry right atrium then below that in

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.500 
sorry right atrium then below that in
blue<00:00:33.489> we<00:00:33.790> have<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.270> right<00:00:34.630> ventricle<00:00:35.590> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
blue we have the right ventricle and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.080 
blue we have the right ventricle and
then<00:00:37.510> we<00:00:38.320> have<00:00:38.560> on<00:00:38.950> this<00:00:39.130> side<00:00:39.400> we<00:00:39.580> have<00:00:39.760> the

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
then we have on this side we have the

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.240 
then we have on this side we have the
ingrain<00:00:40.810> the<00:00:41.170> left<00:00:42.040> atrium<00:00:42.970> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.860> in

ingrain the left atrium and then in
orange<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:46.060> left<00:00:46.330> ventricle<00:00:48.510> up<00:00:49.510> there<00:00:49.870> in

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
orange the left ventricle up there in

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.910 
orange the left ventricle up there in
yellow<00:00:50.200> we<00:00:50.620> have<00:00:50.650> the<00:00:51.070> pulmonary<00:00:51.670> trunk<00:00:52.920> which

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
yellow we have the pulmonary trunk which

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.740 
yellow we have the pulmonary trunk which
divides<00:00:54.400> into<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.850> right<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.420> left

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
divides into the right and left

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.510 
divides into the right and left
pulmonary<00:00:56.940> arteries<00:00:59.610> okay<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:01.800> then<00:01:02.800> we<00:01:03.190> have

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
pulmonary arteries okay and then we have

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.210 
pulmonary arteries okay and then we have
in<00:01:04.409> hot<00:01:05.409> pink<00:01:05.860> we<00:01:06.100> have<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.490> aorta<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:09.040> then

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
in hot pink we have the aorta and then

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.990 
in hot pink we have the aorta and then
we're<00:01:09.400> gonna<00:01:09.550> do<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:09.760> pulmonary<00:01:10.390> veins

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
we're gonna do the pulmonary veins

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.530 
we're gonna do the pulmonary veins
there's<00:01:13.000> right<00:01:13.300> and<00:01:13.330> left<00:01:13.930> ones<00:01:14.170> in<00:01:14.380> red<00:01:15.540> so

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
there's right and left ones in red so

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.760 
there's right and left ones in red so
there's<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:17.560> left<00:01:17.860> pulmonary<00:01:18.190> veins<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
there's the left pulmonary veins and the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.700 
there's the left pulmonary veins and the
right<00:01:21.100> pulmonary<00:01:21.670> veins<00:01:23.430> okay<00:01:24.430> and<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:26.229> here

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
right pulmonary veins okay and then here

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.750 
right pulmonary veins okay and then here
until<00:01:27.310> this<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.479> gonna<00:01:28.690> be<00:01:28.960> this<00:01:29.170> whole

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
until this is gonna be this whole

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.490 
until this is gonna be this whole
structure<00:01:30.760> here<00:01:31.090> is<00:01:31.120> your<00:01:31.600> interventricular

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
structure here is your interventricular

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.990 
structure here is your interventricular
septum<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:35.430> dividing<00:01:36.430> your<00:01:36.610> different

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
septum it's dividing your different

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.640 
septum it's dividing your different
ventricles<00:01:37.630> so<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:39.430> enter<00:01:39.820> in<00:01:40.060> between

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
ventricles so it's enter in between

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.170 
ventricles so it's enter in between
ventricular<00:01:41.650> between<00:01:42.220> your<00:01:42.430> ventricles<00:01:42.820> and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
ventricular between your ventricles and

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.230 
ventricular between your ventricles and
a<00:01:43.360> septum<00:01:43.900> is<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:45.280> structure<00:01:45.729> that<00:01:45.760> divides

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
a septum is that structure that divides

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.960 
a septum is that structure that divides
it<00:01:46.479> okay<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:47.439> let's<00:01:47.770> open<00:01:48.010> him<00:01:48.369> up<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.820> talk

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
it okay so let's open him up and talk

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.600 
it okay so let's open him up and talk
about<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.600> structures<00:01:50.049> inside

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.400 

and<00:01:55.610> as<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:56.030> can<00:01:56.180> see<00:01:56.240> again<00:01:56.660> we<00:01:56.870> still<00:01:57.140> have

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
and as you can see again we still have

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.000 
and as you can see again we still have
the<00:01:57.650> opening<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.400> right<00:01:58.430> atrium<00:02:00.010> the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
the opening to the right atrium the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.289 
the opening to the right atrium the
right<00:02:01.400> ventricle

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.830 

and<00:02:06.810> there's<00:02:07.380> opening<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> left<00:02:08.459> atrium

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
and there's opening to the left atrium

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.210 
and there's opening to the left atrium
and<00:02:09.840> now<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.349> opening<00:02:10.769> to<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:10.979> left

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
and now the opening to the left

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.180 
and now the opening to the left
ventricle<00:02:11.700> okay<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:12.720> on<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.050> right<00:02:13.290> atrium<00:02:14.010> we

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
ventricle okay so on the right atrium we

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.949 
ventricle okay so on the right atrium we
have<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.489> tricuspid<00:02:14.940> valve<00:02:15.420> which<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.690> what

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
have the tricuspid valve which is what

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.000 
have the tricuspid valve which is what
the<00:02:16.080> red<00:02:16.290> pipe<00:02:16.560> cleaner<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.129> going<00:02:17.519> through

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
the red pipe cleaner is going through

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.089 
the red pipe cleaner is going through
okay<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.370> pencil<00:02:20.730> two<00:02:20.959> in<00:02:21.959> purple<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:23.069> have

your left atrium okay and what the green

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.080 
your left atrium okay and what the green
pipe<00:03:01.049> cleaner<00:03:01.079> is<00:03:01.709> going<00:03:02.099> through<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.670> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
pipe cleaner is going through is the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.970 
pipe cleaner is going through is the
bicuspid<00:03:03.750> or<00:03:04.230> mitral<00:03:04.290> valve<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:08.000> again<00:03:09.000> in

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
bicuspid or mitral valve and again in

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.110 
bicuspid or mitral valve and again in
lavender<00:03:10.980> there<00:03:11.220> we<00:03:11.459> have<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:11.730> chordae

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
lavender there we have the chordae

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.940 
lavender there we have the chordae
tendineae<00:03:12.480> which<00:03:12.840> are<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.109> white<00:03:13.290> strands

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
tendineae which are the white strands

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.270 
tendineae which are the white strands
and<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:14.760> orange<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:16.170> papillary<00:03:16.680> muscles

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
and in orange the papillary muscles

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.590 
and in orange the papillary muscles
which<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.420> chordae<00:03:18.840> tendineae<00:03:19.200> adhere<00:03:20.160> to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
which the chordae tendineae adhere to

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.599 
which the chordae tendineae adhere to
okay<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.470> then<00:03:22.650> one<00:03:22.920> more<00:03:23.160> thing<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.549> I

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
okay and then one more thing that I

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.580 
okay and then one more thing that I
wanted<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:23.940> identify<00:03:24.209> here<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
wanted to identify here is the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.069 
wanted to identify here is the
interatrial<00:03:26.220> septum<00:03:26.549> I'm<00:03:27.420> gonna<00:03:27.600> zoom<00:03:27.900> in

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
interatrial septum I'm gonna zoom in

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.960 
interatrial septum I'm gonna zoom in
here<00:03:29.030> it's<00:03:30.030> just<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.600> wall<00:03:31.049> if<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.980> like<00:03:32.790> if

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
here it's just this wall if you like if

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.610 
here it's just this wall if you like if
you<00:03:33.120> put<00:03:33.299> your<00:03:33.480> fingers<00:03:33.870> for<00:03:34.079> there<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.410> wall

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
you put your fingers for there the wall

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.000 
you put your fingers for there the wall
that<00:03:34.859> you<00:03:35.569> feel<00:03:36.569> yeah<00:03:37.319> it's<00:03:37.560> gonna<00:03:37.680> be<00:03:37.859> your

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
that you feel yeah it's gonna be your

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.879 
that you feel yeah it's gonna be your
interatrial<00:03:38.819> septum<00:03:39.230> so<00:03:40.230> it's<00:03:40.380> really<00:03:40.590> hard

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
interatrial septum so it's really hard

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.160 
interatrial septum so it's really hard
to<00:03:41.010> see<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.790> basically<00:03:42.599> I<00:03:42.690> guess<00:03:42.900> if<00:03:43.049> your

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
to see so basically I guess if your

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.780 
to see so basically I guess if your
teacher<00:03:43.410> puts<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.829> pipe<00:03:44.160> cleaner<00:03:44.400> through

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
teacher puts a pipe cleaner through

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.240 
teacher puts a pipe cleaner through
there<00:03:44.940> that's<00:03:45.120> what<00:03:45.359> she's<00:03:45.569> going<00:03:45.810> for<00:03:46.250> okay

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
there that's what she's going for okay

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.460 
there that's what she's going for okay
and<00:03:47.489> also<00:03:47.760> um<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.450> don't<00:03:48.599> think<00:03:48.810> we<00:03:48.959> identify

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
and also um I don't think we identify

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.349 
and also um I don't think we identify
the<00:03:49.530> aortic<00:03:49.980> semilunar<00:03:50.250> valve<00:03:50.730> did<00:03:51.000> we<00:03:51.120> on

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
the aortic semilunar valve did we on

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.150 
the aortic semilunar valve did we on
this<00:03:51.540> side<00:03:51.599> okay<00:03:52.260> on<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.560> left<00:03:52.769> side<00:03:52.919> of<00:03:53.069> the

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
this side okay on the left side of the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
this side okay on the left side of the
heart<00:03:54.290> over<00:03:55.290> here<00:03:55.919> we<00:03:56.099> have<00:03:56.480> let<00:03:57.480> me<00:03:57.630> zoom<00:03:57.870> in

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.350 

we<00:04:01.180> get<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.480> better<00:04:01.659> picture<00:04:02.400> um<00:04:03.400> yep<00:04:03.849> up<00:04:04.030> there

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
we get a better picture um yep up there

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.039 
we get a better picture um yep up there
in<00:04:04.599> red<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:06.340> have<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.579> aortic<00:04:07.420> semilunar

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
in red we have the aortic semilunar

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.800 
in red we have the aortic semilunar
valve<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:09.549> can<00:04:09.579> see<00:04:10.000> how<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.360> would<00:04:10.480> go<00:04:10.629> off

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
valve you can see how that would go off

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.289 
valve you can see how that would go off
and<00:04:11.049> into<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.439> aorta<00:04:11.790> okay<00:04:12.790> so<00:04:12.849> now<00:04:13.150> we're

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
and into the aorta okay so now we're

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.149 
and into the aorta okay so now we're
going<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.540> identify<00:04:14.079> the<00:04:14.140> different<00:04:14.590> coronary

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
going to identify the different coronary

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.520 
going to identify the different coronary
vessels<00:04:15.640> and<00:04:15.790> veins<00:04:15.849> so<00:04:16.269> we<00:04:16.389> have<00:04:16.539> to<00:04:16.720> piece

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
vessels and veins so we have to piece

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.930 
vessels and veins so we have to piece
them<00:04:17.709> back<00:04:17.769> together

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.230 

or<00:04:24.940> at<00:04:25.030> least<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.330> vendor<00:04:25.629> full<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:26.050> them<00:04:27.240> okay

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
or at least a vendor full of them okay

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.460 
or at least a vendor full of them okay
so<00:04:29.970> starting<00:04:30.970> off<00:04:31.150> on<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.539> right<00:04:31.840> side<00:04:32.199> of<00:04:32.349> the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
so starting off on the right side of the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.629 
so starting off on the right side of the
heart<00:04:33.060> up<00:04:34.060> here<00:04:34.419> in<00:04:34.539> red<00:04:34.840> we<00:04:35.139> have<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.639> right

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
heart up here in red we have the right

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.010 
heart up here in red we have the right
coronary<00:04:37.389> vessel<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:40.389> left<00:04:40.599> coronary

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
coronary vessel and the left coronary

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.320 
coronary vessel and the left coronary
vessel<00:04:41.530> is<00:04:41.740> right<00:04:42.129> here<00:04:42.370> in<00:04:42.460> a<00:04:42.520> hot<00:04:42.669> pink<00:04:43.030> it's

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
vessel is right here in a hot pink it's

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.320 
vessel is right here in a hot pink it's
actually<00:04:43.780> just<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:45.520> bowl<00:04:45.849> it's<00:04:46.090> right

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
actually just that that bowl it's right

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.760 
actually just that that bowl it's right
there<00:04:46.539> yeah<00:04:46.840> it's<00:04:47.110> not<00:04:47.379> the<00:04:47.590> whole<00:04:47.740> thing

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
there yeah it's not the whole thing

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.619 
there yeah it's not the whole thing
because<00:04:48.310> it's<00:04:48.460> gonna<00:04:48.550> break<00:04:48.819> off<00:04:49.060> in<00:04:49.270> yellow

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:49.629 
because it's gonna break off in yellow

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.980 
because it's gonna break off in yellow
to<00:04:50.199> the<00:04:50.319> circumflex<00:04:50.860> artery<00:04:51.720> which<00:04:52.720> is<00:04:52.870> gonna

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
to the circumflex artery which is gonna

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.790 
to the circumflex artery which is gonna
wrap<00:04:53.289> around<00:04:53.789> so<00:04:54.789> the<00:04:55.719> circumflex<00:04:56.229> artery

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
wrap around so the circumflex artery

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.529 
wrap around so the circumflex artery
would<00:04:57.009> wrap<00:04:57.219> around<00:04:57.250> up<00:04:57.639> top<00:04:57.909> following<00:04:58.360> that

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
would wrap around up top following that

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.459 
would wrap around up top following that
vein<00:04:58.949> and<00:04:59.949> then<00:05:00.580> it<00:05:01.360> breaks<00:05:01.690> off<00:05:01.960> in<00:05:02.110> green

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
vein and then it breaks off in green

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.110 
vein and then it breaks off in green
into<00:05:02.979> the<00:05:03.719> anterior<00:05:05.009> interventricular

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
into the anterior interventricular

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.540 
into the anterior interventricular
artery<00:05:09.900> so<00:05:10.900> that<00:05:11.050> structure<00:05:11.319> there's<00:05:12.250> an

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
artery so that structure there's an

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.439 
artery so that structure there's an
anterior<00:05:12.909> interventricular<00:05:13.419> artery<00:05:14.159> then<00:05:15.449> we

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
anterior interventricular artery then we

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.260 
anterior interventricular artery then we
have<00:05:16.750> in<00:05:17.370> light<00:05:18.370> pink<00:05:18.610> there<00:05:18.849> we<00:05:18.969> have<00:05:19.150> the

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
have in light pink there we have the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.209 
have in light pink there we have the
great<00:05:19.629> cardiac<00:05:20.199> veins<00:05:20.530> so<00:05:20.800> that<00:05:20.949> runs

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
great cardiac veins so that runs

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:23.790 
great cardiac veins so that runs
parallel<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:21.879> the<00:05:22.210> interventricular<00:05:23.080> artery

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
parallel to the interventricular artery

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.550 
parallel to the interventricular artery
so<00:05:24.069> there's<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.340> great<00:05:24.639> cardiac<00:05:25.150> vein<00:05:27.120> okay<00:05:28.120> and

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
so there's a great cardiac vein okay and

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.490 
so there's a great cardiac vein okay and
over<00:05:29.560> here<00:05:29.949> on<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.810> right<00:05:31.810> side<00:05:32.080> of<00:05:32.199> the<00:05:32.289> heart

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
over here on the right side of the heart

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.209 
over here on the right side of the heart
we<00:05:32.949> have<00:05:33.190> in<00:05:33.430> yellow<00:05:33.699> we<00:05:34.090> have<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:35.219> small

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.219 
we have in yellow we have the small

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.290 
we have in yellow we have the small
cardiac<00:05:36.789> vein

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.880 

right<00:05:39.930> here<00:05:42.090> so<00:05:42.780> there's<00:05:42.960> your<00:05:43.140> small<00:05:43.410> cardiac

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
right here so there's your small cardiac

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.170 
right here so there's your small cardiac
vein<00:05:44.100> and<00:05:44.250> it<00:05:44.340> actually<00:05:44.460> wraps<00:05:44.820> around<00:05:45.000> the

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
vein and it actually wraps around the

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.780 
vein and it actually wraps around the
back<00:05:45.390> but<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.930> back<00:05:46.110> of<00:05:46.290> our<00:05:46.410> heart<00:05:46.740> is<00:05:47.040> not

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
back but the back of our heart is not

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.380 
back but the back of our heart is not
complete<00:05:48.300> so<00:05:49.230> we<00:05:49.590> can't<00:05:49.950> see<00:05:50.220> that<00:05:50.430> and<00:05:50.970> then<00:05:51.150> I

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
complete so we can't see that and then I

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.040 
complete so we can't see that and then I
guess<00:05:51.750> when<00:05:51.930> identify<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:52.530> coronary<00:05:53.520> sinus

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
guess when identify the coronary sinus

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.790 
guess when identify the coronary sinus
and<00:05:55.520> that's<00:05:56.520> going<00:05:56.760> to<00:05:56.820> be<00:05:57.170> back<00:05:58.170> here<00:05:58.470> in<00:05:58.560> red

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
and that's going to be back here in red

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.100 
and that's going to be back here in red
so<00:05:59.280> see<00:05:59.460> you<00:06:00.150> should<00:06:00.390> have<00:06:00.480> had<00:06:00.630> structures

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
so see you should have had structures

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.290 
so see you should have had structures
back<00:06:01.290> there<00:06:01.530> but<00:06:01.710> we<00:06:01.740> don't<00:06:02.010> on<00:06:02.280> this<00:06:02.490> model<00:06:02.670> so

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
back there but we don't on this model so

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.750 
back there but we don't on this model so
there's<00:06:03.480> your<00:06:03.660> red<00:06:03.870> and<00:06:04.740> red<00:06:05.100> your<00:06:05.310> coronary

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
there's your red and red your coronary

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.550 
there's your red and red your coronary
sinus<00:06:05.940> so<00:06:06.270> we<00:06:06.390> could<00:06:06.690> not<00:06:06.810> identify<00:06:07.050> the

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
sinus so we could not identify the

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.950 
sinus so we could not identify the
middle<00:06:07.980> cardiac<00:06:08.370> vein<00:06:08.640> and<00:06:08.880> the<00:06:09.300> posterior

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
middle cardiac vein and the posterior

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.580 
middle cardiac vein and the posterior
interventricular<00:06:10.770> artery
