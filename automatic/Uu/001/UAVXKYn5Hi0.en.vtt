00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello everyone on the holidays 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.620
 I want to make dessert 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.920
 New Year's and today I will cook 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.049
 new year cake shaped like a candle and so 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.070
 I will need a classic for this 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.050
 biscuit cooking reference under video in 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.660
 description 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.869
 any jam can be taken for cream 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.609
 need butter and condensed milk and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.669
 for decoration mastic and small candle 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.160
 the first thing you need to do is whip the cream 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.760
 butter butter must 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.760
 be soft 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.670
 in the whipped butter quietly add 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.670
 condensed milk and continue to beat 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.240
 butter cream is ready to cut 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.580
 biscuit of the desired shape 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.580
 I will have a square candle 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.130
 measure it to be exactly all edges 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:19.130
 matched each other if necessary 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.130
 prune 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.350
 now each part is cut into three more 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.350
 parts 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:45.820
 go to the lubrication cake we coat 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.440
 jam next cake we grease thin 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:57.280
 a layer of cream and turn on 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:02:00.520
 smeared cake and jam grease again 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.200
 cream jam should not be much to 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.200
 he did not run out on our sides 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:15.600
 lubricate with cream and put on jam 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.819
 jam it again and do it 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.819
 with all cake layers 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.560
 immediately cut out for the candle 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.560
 small hole in shape 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:57.640
 We check the insert a candle recruit 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.640
 Now you need to lubricate the cream all sides 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.870
 what were perfectly smooth edges with cream 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.870
 wrapping film 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.490
 this is how cream is made 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.920
 perfectly smooth we remove the cake in 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:38.940
 refrigerator until cream solidifies 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:41.520
 the cream is cold and you can remove the film while 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.360
 we set aside the cake and we will 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.310
 I rolled mastic prepared 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.930
 she added dye she became me 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.300
 gently pink and i need now 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.500
 roll into thin thin layer 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.500
 what i will do 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:22.350
 measure the height of the cake and a little bit with 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:24.490
 overlap we will wrap the cake we measure 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.750
 here here 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:37.890
 measure off with the help of a large ruler i 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.890
 I use the board and cut it down 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.310
 leveled 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:00.810
 well, that's probably all perry left 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.810
 cut off 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:14.160

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:17.220
 cut the bottom wet the brush in syrup 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.370
 in sugar grease 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:30.200
 Snowflake Decoration Mastic 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:30.200
 and attach to the cake 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:57.760
 we insert a candle and oil cream 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.760
 we decorate around the candle 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.400
 the final touch we light the candle 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.659
