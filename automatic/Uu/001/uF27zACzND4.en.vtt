00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello today i will teach you to read there i 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.629
 long home how do you understand I do not explain 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.080
 came up with a misty pen and so we went 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:21.140
 so what kind of garbage do we have this since 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:25.560
 they read why do I need a quick 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:29.839
 I would not reveal it yet either 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:36.530
 tablature is called essentially this 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:40.650
 simplified notes but then all people 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.100
 so to understand what it would be like them 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.500
 you can read the necessary before and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.610
 what they are all there 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.520
 held stripes 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:57.330
 strips are strings like amazing 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.480
 the bottom wall of this one is 6 strings 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:05.900
 and 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:09.829
 I mean the thickest is 5 4 3 2 1 and 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:14.039
 so we still have on tobacco 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:16.350
 I will not go deep into it 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.179
 notation if the simplest project has 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.880
 we have stripes and numbers on these 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:23.999
 strips which means the numbers on these 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.450
 strips such as we well have the world 

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:30.210
 We put here the number 1 that it will be 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.749
 mean it will mean that you take 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.740
 play your finger or pick 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:38.549
 the third string is exactly the first varnish on 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.729
 third string 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:46.729
 well I understand further we took pumpkin here 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.729
 ten 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.899
 module 2 string 10 lat we clamp on 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:00.120
 the second side 10 you play everything is clear 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:04.940
 and so it was even more of 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.940
 I will explain with the example of the chord 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:27.270
 that is, in F major major 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:33.180
 write the buffer straight like this again 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:36.090
 denoting 6 5 4 3 2 1 and since we 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.280
 chord f first finger we 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.540
 we clamp the bars that is the sixth string 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.510
 us sounds like 1 lat fifth string 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.870
 on 3 fret 4 also on the third third 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.820
 the second 2 on the first floor on the first it 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.850
 there will be abortions for example we need to play 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.600
 some kind of fight is not easy to pull build 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.690
 and play a fight some kind of fight 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:08.550
 that is, either down holds or up 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:12.570
 designated strangely arrows this 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.420
 down arrow are n't you bad just the sixth 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.000
 the string is here so this down arrow 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.640
 well, let's write an example of a simple fight upside down 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.670
 up down and write again 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:31.620
 duplicate this our chord is f like this 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.709
 thats down to 25 duplicate in fact 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.260
 so record only morons normal 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.110
 I'll show you boy 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:49.030
 he recorded 3 2 1 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:52.940
 if you have if for example on tablature 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.329
 only at about 1 bar of some kind and there 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:01.359
 a few chords is like David 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:03.950
 apple which chords below to save 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:09.670
 below that helped which cord 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:12.680
 david 11 some kind of like there and 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:17.180
 Shows a fight some arrows 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.660
 up down there jamming over here and no longer 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:25.270
 written a million times this number is 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:30.440
 that, and so I think everything is clear 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.990
 strings of wards play i don't think that you 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.169
 learned so need to give you 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:42.550
 practical task 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:49.880
 it is simple just break your fingers and 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:54.050
 so again for you number 3 2 1 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.910
 By the way, you can probably do this 6 5 4 3 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:08.210
 2 not see there will stand 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:13.720
 letter and dj bi and and small this 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.720
 same designation that is me for 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:20.150
 salt si 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.570
 also me just another act so 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:27.110
 task for you i will write the tablature you 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.449
 will have to play the guy and so on 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:35.750
 sixth string 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:36.569
 1 you play me 2 3 4 switches to 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:50.219
 fifth face 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:53.959
 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 and here 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:06:03.199
 play first second third fourth 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:06:12.089
 no, not all return so 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:16.459
 We climb over the game 5 4 3 2 that further 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:28.769
 tied to the next play too 5 4 3 2 

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:33.059
 5 4 3 2 5 4 3 2 5 4 3 2 2 and here 5 4 3 2 

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:35.539
 Crimea recorded a little bit but in general as a matter of fact 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:38.249
 so write 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:42.860
 So I have to play as it sounds 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:42.860
 example of a house you must yourself 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:25.550
 That's about it and I hope that everything 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:25.550
 it was understandable and you learned the parade lesson
