curious about trying a gel eyeliner for
a<00:02:03.899> really<00:02:04.200> long<00:02:04.229> time<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:04.770> because<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.369> just

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
a really long time now because I just

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.150 
a really long time now because I just
feel<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.329> goes<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.869> much<00:02:06.990> easier<00:02:07.259> you

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
feel like it goes on so much easier you

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.380 
feel like it goes on so much easier you
know<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.340> looks<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.850> lot<00:02:08.970> better<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.330> it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
know it looks a lot better and it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.840 
know it looks a lot better and it
doesn't<00:02:09.630> like<00:02:10.130> crack<00:02:11.130> up<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.550> day<00:02:11.670> that's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
doesn't like crack up in the day that's

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.240 
doesn't like crack up in the day that's
going<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.060> sound<00:02:12.210> really<00:02:12.270> weird<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.770> I'll

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
going to sound really weird but the I'll

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.250 
going to sound really weird but the I'll
another<00:02:14.550> was<00:02:14.760> wearing<00:02:15.300> before<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.750> was<00:02:16.080> a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
another was wearing before this was a

so good it goes on so easy especially if

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.030 
so good it goes on so easy especially if

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
you haven't really used liquid eyeliner

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.710 
you haven't really used liquid eyeliner
but<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.370> really<00:02:50.550> want<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.820> nice<00:02:50.970> like<00:02:51.330> flick

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720

it kind of reminds me of a seaside

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.400

and<00:05:46.070> get<00:05:46.160> it<00:05:46.220> even<00:05:46.400> though<00:05:46.640> you<00:05:47.360> know<00:05:47.450> maybe

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080

it's<00:05:48.290> a<00:05:48.350> little<00:05:48.560> bit<00:05:48.650> expensive<00:05:48.890> but<00:05:49.130> is<00:05:49.520> the

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
it's a little bit expensive but is the

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.020 
it's a little bit expensive but is the
best<00:05:50.390> investment<00:05:50.540> I<00:05:50.840> think<00:05:51.080> really<00:05:51.350> long<00:05:51.560> time

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
best investment I think really long time

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.150 
best investment I think really long time
anyway<00:05:53.030> so<00:05:53.090> that's<00:05:53.360> the<00:05:53.600> end<00:05:53.750> that<00:05:54.440> so<00:05:54.950> there's

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
anyway so that's the end that so there's

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:03.010
