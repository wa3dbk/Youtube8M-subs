com and we're going to show you a
congregational<00:00:08.040> song<00:00:08.189> pattern<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.880> this

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.180 
congregational song pattern and this

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.030 
congregational song pattern and this
pattern<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.960> going<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.290> have<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> baseline<00:00:10.770> and

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
pattern is going to have a baseline and

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:31.269 
pattern is going to have a baseline and
let<00:00:11.160> me<00:00:11.220> go<00:00:11.310> ahead<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.700> play<00:00:12.330> through<00:00:12.690> it

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.549 

so<00:00:32.279> there<00:00:32.879> it<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.149> there's<00:00:33.989> really<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.379> much

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
so there it is there's really not much

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.979 
so there it is there's really not much
to<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.850> but<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.210> may<00:00:36.360> you're<00:00:36.690> gonna<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
to it but you may you're gonna have to

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.869 
to it but you may you're gonna have to
do<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:37.260> practicing<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.949> get<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> walking

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
do some practicing to get the walking

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.060 
do some practicing to get the walking
bass<00:00:39.059> line<00:00:39.649> but<00:00:40.670> instead<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.730> doing<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:43.860> regular

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
bass line but instead of doing a regular

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
bass line but instead of doing a regular
walking<00:00:44.460> bass<00:00:44.760> line<00:00:45.000> we're<00:00:45.269> going<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.449> do<00:00:45.600> this

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
walking bass line we're going to do this

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.020 
walking bass line we're going to do this
I<00:00:46.170> found<00:00:47.010> doing<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.550> establishes<00:00:49.699> tempo<00:00:50.699> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
I found doing this establishes tempo a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.360 
I found doing this establishes tempo a
little<00:00:51.300> bit<00:00:51.720> better<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.220> really

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
little bit better but it's really

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.299 
little bit better but it's really
optional<00:00:53.670> I'll<00:00:54.180> show<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.449> both<00:00:54.690> ways<00:00:55.250> let<00:00:56.250> me

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
optional I'll show you both ways let me

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.860 
optional I'll show you both ways let me
go<00:00:56.430> ahead<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.579> show<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.059> way<00:00:57.269> first<00:00:57.540> and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
go ahead and show you this way first and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.780 
go ahead and show you this way first and
for<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.290> first<00:00:58.409> section<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.610> just

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
for the first section of it it's just

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.549 
for the first section of it it's just
going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> follow<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.390> pattern<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.019> we<00:01:01.409> have

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
going to follow this pattern so we have

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.719 
going to follow this pattern so we have
to<00:01:01.680> hand<00:01:01.890> positions<00:01:02.250> we're<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.519> to<00:01:02.579> deal

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
to hand positions we're going to deal

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.749 
to hand positions we're going to deal
with<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:04.350> left<00:01:04.769> hand<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.129> an<00:01:05.309> F<00:01:05.460> any

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
with on the left hand we have an F any

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.510 
with on the left hand we have an F any
flat<00:01:06.630> F<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.500> an<00:01:07.619> E<00:01:07.680> flat<00:01:07.800> on<00:01:08.009> the<00:01:08.070> left<00:01:08.250> hand<00:01:08.369> on

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
flat F in an E flat on the left hand on

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.279 
flat F in an E flat on the left hand on
the<00:01:08.550> right<00:01:08.729> hand<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.060> an<00:01:09.270> A<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.720> an<00:01:09.810> F<00:01:10.050> and

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
the right hand we have an A and an F and

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.120 
the right hand we have an A and an F and
then<00:01:11.190> we're<00:01:11.789> going<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.970> make<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.149> transition

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
then we're going to make a transition

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.060 
then we're going to make a transition
we're<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> play<00:01:14.429> see<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.880> left<00:01:15.060> hand

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
we're going to play see on the left hand

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.710 
we're going to play see on the left hand
and<00:01:17.070> we're<00:01:17.550> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> deal<00:01:17.910> with<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.210> hand

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and we're going to deal with this hand

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.300 
and we're going to deal with this hand
position<00:01:19.820> fdm<00:01:20.820> lifted<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.630> flat<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.619> F<00:01:23.039> on<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
position fdm lifted a flat and F on the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.359 
position fdm lifted a flat and F on the
right<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:25.080> we're<00:01:25.410> gonna<00:01:25.500> go<00:01:25.710> back<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:25.920> forth

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
right and we're gonna go back and forth

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.609 
right and we're gonna go back and forth
we're<00:01:27.300> gonna<00:01:27.420> use<00:01:27.690> that<00:01:27.720> C<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.320> make<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
we're gonna use that C to make the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.420 
we're gonna use that C to make the
transition<00:01:28.880> on<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.940> left<00:01:30.270> hand

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.820 

so<00:01:34.000> once<00:01:34.270> you've<00:01:34.450> got<00:01:34.660> that<00:01:34.870> let<00:01:35.110> me<00:01:35.200> play<00:01:35.590> that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
so once you've got that let me play that

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.520 
so once you've got that let me play that
slowly

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.440 

we're<00:01:42.530> going<00:01:42.680> to<00:01:42.740> play<00:01:43.009> some<00:01:43.070> changes<00:01:43.939> we're

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
we're going to play some changes we're

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.179 
we're going to play some changes we're
going<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.630> use<00:01:44.719> a<00:01:44.750> number<00:01:44.960> system<00:01:45.469> for<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:46.039> key

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
going to use a number system for the key

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.389 
going to use a number system for the key
of<00:01:46.280> F<00:01:46.929> so<00:01:47.929> one<00:01:48.229> two<00:01:48.469> three<00:01:48.770> four<00:01:49.039> five<00:01:49.070> six

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
of F so one two three four five six

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.480 
of F so one two three four five six
seven<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.810> then<00:01:50.990> one<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.500> this<00:01:51.979> is<00:01:52.159> going<00:01:52.340> to

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
seven and then one and this is going to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.700 
seven and then one and this is going to
follow<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:53.320> baseline<00:01:54.320> that's<00:01:54.740> going<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:54.979> go

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
follow a baseline that's going to go

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.100 
follow a baseline that's going to go
6251<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:59.060> want<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.270> practice<00:01:59.659> that<00:01:59.689> on<00:01:59.990> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
6251 so we want to practice that on the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:08.050 
6251 so we want to practice that on the
left-hand<00:02:00.500> D<00:02:01.100> G<00:02:02.060> C<00:02:02.990> F<00:02:03.610> D<00:02:04.659> G<00:02:05.659> C<00:02:06.469> F<00:02:07.310> now<00:02:07.729> this<00:02:07.939> is

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
left-hand D G C F D G C F now this is

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.160 
left-hand D G C F D G C F now this is
going<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.239> be<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.450> trick<00:02:08.690> we're<00:02:08.989> going<00:02:09.110> to

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
going to be the trick we're going to

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.960 
going to be the trick we're going to
throw<00:02:09.530> filler<00:02:09.950> notes<00:02:10.250> in<00:02:10.429> there<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.819> are

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
throw filler notes in there that are

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.759 
throw filler notes in there that are
going<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.180> be<00:02:11.390> chromatically<00:02:12.110> half<00:02:12.590> step

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
going to be chromatically half step

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.470 
going to be chromatically half step
above<00:02:12.890> or<00:02:13.220> chromatically<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.700> half<00:02:14.000> step<00:02:14.269> below
