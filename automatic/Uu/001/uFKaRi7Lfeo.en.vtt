00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.029
 you're good friends today we 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.310
 finds himself for a new video on 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.800
 gta 5 online with a subscriber 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.300
 which is called guillaume snipe 38 so 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.339
 who joined me and who is part of 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.789
 my crew z ktm on ps4 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:31.310
 so today the video is going to talk 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.149
 a little tip if you want 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.340
 drive the famous hydra so here it is 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.870
 the famous hydra so very weird huh 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.000
 for takeoff for those who are not 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.199
 regulars who take the old in 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.870
 his fighter plane called the 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.359
 gesture hours I say no nonsense so 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.609
 this game mode will allow you to no 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.809
 only drive the famous hydra without 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.120
 need to do the show 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.039
 turning in quotation marks or without having 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.500
 need to buy it because it costs 3 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.820
 millions in free mode this game mode 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.219
 also allows you to go see the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.260
 yacht that is at the level of the 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.519
 beach not far from the rides so the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.110
 famous yacht found in the mode 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.549
 solo and that we also find in 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.950
 steering modes so you'll be able to 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.540
 go on I do not know if we can 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.950
 to visit them I do not have a little tour 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.049
 really we can go in a few 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.280
 days a few pieces so I believe 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.770
 this is where you go to make a 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.899
 little tour of casks for those who want 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.100
 really explore it from top to bottom 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.390
 to make small delusions is a 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.630
 little game mode that's if you do 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.789
 short videos on the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.200
 the boat can be quite nice 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.640
 so there you can see the view 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.500
 interior of the famous hydra so 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.330
 the interior that it's pretty similar a 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.810
 old but I find it a little more 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.490
 stylish and - - - ruined by the view is 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.520
 less spoiled I think so here's me 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.840
 that's my personal opinion so with this 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.550
 hydra to it is quite manageable it enough 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.800
 fast also in a straight line well 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.509
 obviously I would not have fun doing 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.040
 big stunts so here you can 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.290
 see we see the yacht show in the process of 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.320
 massacre it with my missiles 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.880
 so he's pretty cool 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.860
 it's a pity I do not understand 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.490
 why rockstar did not leave them 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.670
 in free mode 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.369
 it cost them nothing at all just the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.600
 not to simply give up 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.619
 this is me I have a little tip that I 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.340
 make you train in the approached one 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.560
 video how to have them in free mode 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.269
 so here I wanted to present when 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.640
 of my next video and for now 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.010
 I present them to you this game mode 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.390
 so the bot me I do not have I 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.700
 I'm not on it I have not done 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.680
 a little trick I already had a two three 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.530
 I start again I had already been doing a 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.690
 ride with buddies so here I wanted 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.459
 not ask me last time I had 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.290
 posed and my hydra was impossible to 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.280
 take off from the blow become all-paper 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.510
 knowing that they had no vehicle 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.459
 or I told him I will not do it 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.010
 same bullshit this time I feel 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.090
 fresh and start all over again 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.470
 started that video which you can 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.329
 see the interior pretty friendly a 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.890
 everything has been 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.440
 everything was redone rank modeling so 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.890
 everything and everything is nickel so there wooden 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.720
 guillaume seine 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.090
 you go there for a walk I 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.470
 was worth the side of the aircraft door so the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.360
 bot is at the beach level for 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.740
 those who do not know well that's tried to 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.700
 to follow roughly my trajectory 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.980
 as in the video and the aircraft carrier 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.470
 is not very far from mud we have 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.470
 started a while we started so 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.989
 it's not very very far so we go there 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.220
 to return to the airport 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.050
 so here I'm going to do a little bit of everything 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.670
 crazy I'm going a little bit tested what he has in 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.260
 the belly see if the one manageable enough 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.820
 I find it quite simple but a cry that 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.040
 as soon as he is really big and huge 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.590
 that he is imposing I find enough 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.959
 manageable and compared to some planes 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.459
 when you pay your sentence the trigger by 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.410
 finished in the savannah's decor is 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.660
 still pretty handy he stays right 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.519
 So it's good I got a 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.200
 little fright I got neither the filament 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.450
 I heard jude law that I told him 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.360
 remembered I thought fire lucie fucking 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.500
 I'm going to finish in here so here you are 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.730
 go straight on once you 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.500
 have come out of the track continues to little 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.790
 near all right turn not that me to 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.640
 right or left you go pretty much 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.760
 all right and no 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.080
 see the aircraft carrier that appears that 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.240
 not appear very far anyway 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.890
 it's about where you 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.720
 reappear and then even less you 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.490
 go see a little silhouette and in 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.319
 its surroundings so those who galÃ¨rent 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.700
 bages will try to put small 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.260
 small screenshots for on the 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.660
 map for pretty much where he stands 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.990
 find but hey there too if you 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.250
 arrive 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.380
 so much the better if you can not say 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.090
 the me in the comments I have not 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.709
 thought on the spot has to put you a 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.270
 little point on the map and I reduce 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.800
 besides a big mistake on my part 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.930
 but good separable next time 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.740
 I will try not to make this mistake 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.570
 so here you can see the magnificent 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.800
 aircraft carrier so we can go to 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.510
 the interior really in all 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.980
 pieces that for what they did the 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.050
 robbery can really go into 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.950
 even places we could not explore 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.380
 during robberies 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.419
 so it's pretty cool me I'm going 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.890
 go ask me I'll show you 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.330
 quickly do where we can go 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.500
 I will not make you see everything I have 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.260
 want to leave you the surprise when 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.360
 even for those who want to go see him 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.449
 I'm just going to climb all the way up 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.749
 level 2 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.219
 level 2 of the cockpit code yes that's it 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:58.199
 that's what we say yeah this low level 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.849
 of the control tower if you prefer 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.289
 just mounted there I will not go down I 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.669
 will leave you the surprise for those 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.050
 who really want to keep the surprise 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.639
 I told myself I'm not going spoils 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.110
 in quotation marks for those who do not have 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.639
 does the robberies too that they are not 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.439
 still got there I'm told 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.020
 until then showed the trick after this 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:16.199
 will be theirs to discover 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.879
 the trick to discover the door 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.229
 so here I quickly put my 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.219
 little mask I have no time to 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.889
 put before the video my little 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:25.110
 mask that looks like my logo so 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.150
 here is the little mask of owls 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.129
 or sign a saibou owl 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.939
 neighbors he eats I do not mean to say 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:33.449
 bullshit finally brief 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:35.159
 So here I am sharing you like the hydra 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.620
 we give it a pity that the thing 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:38.009
 does not feel the pilots trick finally 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.779
 short 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.460
 and is what is a pity or cisse 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:43.080
 can not use the door char that 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.219
 would be huge that we could use the 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.999
 bot will drive him the chariot door also the 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.599
 aircraft carrier forgiveness because it's not 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:50.339
 a tank door 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:52.020
 it would be huge anyway I 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:52.919
 I would be super happy but good 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.389
 do not dream too much 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.889
 so where we can see a little down 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.169
 at the payload level me what am I going 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.300
 do what does go back up earlier and 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.439
 I make you a little bit high 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.849
 story of not too much you not 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:05.009
 way is not enormously big 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.259
 choice it's just it's just a 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.849
 gateway if you prefer so that's it 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.560
 I hope that in any case this video is going 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.690
 you like this little video tips

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.530
 have already done so but I want to 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.720
 present to any mac a community that 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.800
 are not supposed to follow the old ones 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.139
