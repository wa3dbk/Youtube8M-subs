 breton derby waited between lorient and 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.150
 reindeer the 13th faces the 11th 1 point 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.369
 difference between the two formations 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.330
 lorient who has to play without his goalkeeper 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.090
 holder 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.830
 audard alain traorÃ© quercia and coutadeur 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.040
 are not recovered from their side injury 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.869
 rennais alessandrini and kadir are not 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.910
 not there in attack that a friend and boy 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.190
 lack of defense of absences 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.160
 important for Rennes coming out 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.450
 all the same, an interesting victory 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.400
 Sylvain ripoll always makes up for 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.440
 christian gourcuff on the bench of 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.070
 hail who is attacking the match 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.920
 getting this penalty referee freddy 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.550
 fautrel did not hesitate after this fall 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.210
 of vincent aboubakar the blame and net of 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.600
 sylvain armand 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.040
 red card seems severe for 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.770
 the former player of paris saint germain 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.049
 he is excluded after six minutes two 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.640
 matches only a huge handicap 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.930
 for Rennes especially as yann 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.570
 Jouffre turns the penalty into a 7th goal 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.090
 minute 1-0 for lorient 4th goal of the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.950
 season for jouffre and rennais 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.710
 have to play the whole game in 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.329
 numerical inferiority 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.189
 an extremely complex situation and 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.840
 lorient give their heart to 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.869
 dominate try to score quickly 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.880
 the second goal with this possibility 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.189
 for abubakar that seeps into the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.140
 surface new contacts but no 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.909
 fault 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.630
 the Cameroon striker weighs on the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.420
 Rennes defense 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.369
 he who has already scored nine goals this 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.649
 season be as much as falcao 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.850
 the striker of the ace monaco at half-time 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.950
 lorient leads 1 0 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.179
 it's an interesting result for 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.189
 Lorient but they did not know how to put 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.569
 the second goal against Rennes who 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.359
 resists reindeer who only lost two of 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.520
 his last seven games and who's going 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.880
 try to come back despite the fact of 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.490
 play nice lorient is fit on 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.069
 three wins in four 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.290
 goal-scoring matches 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.420
 and yet Rennes gets some 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.080
 opportunities in the image of this one the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.690
 ball 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.540
 rejected by the defense and the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.220
 keeper chaigneau and lorient preserves 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.080
 still dominance over most 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.800
 actions attention to this balloon in 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.830
 the back of the defense 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.670
 with this cross-hit stopped 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.920
 by costil lorient who insist with a 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.190
 very good number gave me this ball 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.680
 on the right side 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.270
 the indentation is well done and the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.570
 strike leaves no chance to costil 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.400
 it was not until the 87th minute to 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.800
 see lorient score that second goal 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.000
 that of final victory on 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.400
 doubled for yann jouffre 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.490
 he scored his fifth goal of the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.490
 season 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.720
 lorient lost only once to 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.920
 home for four wins and two 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.800
 once again the hakes 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.720
 dominate their opponents win 2 0 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.720
 of lorient face reindeer in this derby
