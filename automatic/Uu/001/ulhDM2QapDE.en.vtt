00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.059
 several consider that teaching 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.430
 of the art of second-language music 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.050
 and even physical education are only 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.090
 not a necessity in the development 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.470
 students while several studies 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.720
 demonstrate the opposite 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.610
 these lessons are essential to 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.590
 maintaining our health and our 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.990
 culture we made the acquaintance 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.610
 of teachers 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.000
 specialists who despite conditions 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.739
 difficult are born the patients is 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.650
 museum specialist that means having 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.229
 nineteen groups an average of about 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.100
 480 students I meet once or 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:46.479
 two a week 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.670
 personally I do not have many 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:51.489
 for a primary specialist to have 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.159
 ten big around 250 students in at 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.870
 load but I know very well that 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.470
 specialists who can have up 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.600
 28 26 groups that do several schools 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.640
 who really go several schools I 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:13.060
 a colleague is they do not see 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:15.760
 far from 8 years i believe giuseppe the 2 3 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.800
 4 1 2 3 4 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.780
 for those who have several small 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.090
 schools yes but we have their office and in 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.320
 their misfortune to tone less luck than 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.030
 I have in my big school I have a lot 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.930
 more time here done I put everything 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.780
 my material 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.220
 here it's been 12 years initiated that allowed me 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.290
 to understand the environments to adapt to 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.800
 fears to children is really creating 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.360
 the link 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.590
 after that is when the links created on 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.870
 can start trying to finally 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.010
 trust then ideally he 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.240
 really should specialists 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.830
 always stay in the same school but 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.510
 sometimes it's difficult this is what 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.409
 again the workload is 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.680
 rather important 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.930
 you have to have a good organization 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.640
 must also be worked for a 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.670
 English specialist in primary not 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.009
 be afraid to put a lot of hours 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.479
 after school important subjects 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.250
 too often occupies a place 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.710
 insufficient in the schedule 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.020
 what are the challenges in this regard 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.009
 must raise the teaching staff and 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.709
 seven groups 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.660
 which brings me to have nearly 197 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.950
 students it's happiness to be 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.270
 physical education teacher or 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.930
 to be special and that's actually it 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.700
 the correction so much 997 to fix that 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.230
 takes a lot of notes I take 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.090
 notes to each co to know for 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.190
 evaluate I was wondering why at the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.500
 end of the year at 25 o'clock I was 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.940
 tired our colleagues understand the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.680
 kind of life that we note the difficulty 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.150
 we have to be everywhere we can not 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.799
 do the maximum work that we do 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.819
 when you're in a single school what 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.650
 is said here is to have the feeling 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.269
 of belonging within and as a 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.850
 visitor a whole difficult to do 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.650
 to feel in the school team when you 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.480
 is there a day a week I get 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.590
 sad for what he wants is that 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.480
 everything should be improved or at least 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.000
 try to decrease the amount of school 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.110
 these amounts of displacement of his 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.880
 teachers the water it does not make a 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.350
 beautiful teaching quality 10 I do 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.049
 also a lot of parallels on the hour 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.569
 from the south but he tells me are busy doing 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.180
 that the morning then good I leave the school to 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.160
 about 4 o'clock and the evening if 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.859
 I did not have to finish what I have 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.269
 to do at home you calm down there would be 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.220
 really the working conditions of 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.560
 specialists in primary it would be that 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.109
 the education ministry finally got 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.720
 give really prescribed time for 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.799
 each of the disciplines taught 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.690
 presently what we live is not 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.130
 easy because it's our colleague 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.750
 who decide our conditions of 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.790
 work and time that will be assigned 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.570
 to our disciplines to their work well 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.910
 40 or 50 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.799
 even more meet when our 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.100
 next episode of the teachers and 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.790
 teachers who 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.790
 we can by the arms 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.300
 a lot of work trades 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.610
 that they are in the evening talking with a bag of 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.830
 correction or who has to go to a 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.230
 meeting for a training that have for 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.750
 idea of â€‹â€‹the full time for the 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.760
 planning the correction in my 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.720
 normal task crooked by talking with 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.090
 former teachers 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.570
 our task is a lot weighed down with 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.570
 years
