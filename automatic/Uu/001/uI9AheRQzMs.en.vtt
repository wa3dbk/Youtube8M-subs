00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
that they were warned they were told to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.000

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
get the start line and the actual waiter

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.920 
get the start line and the actual waiter
had<00:00:23.400> apparently<00:00:23.850> no<00:00:24.150> choice<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.600> send<00:00:24.779> them

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
had apparently no choice to send them

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.130 
had apparently no choice to send them
off<00:00:25.050> 15<00:00:25.740> seconds<00:00:26.250> late<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.140> unfortunately

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
off 15 seconds late and unfortunately

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.050 
off 15 seconds late and unfortunately
there<00:00:28.380> was<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> three<00:00:29.189> or<00:00:29.279> four<00:00:29.460> actually<00:00:29.849> left

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
on the left on the start line so that's

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.670 
on the left on the start line so that's
the<00:00:32.640> actual<00:00:32.820> that's<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.079> reason<00:00:34.559> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the actual that's the the reason that

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.380 
the actual that's the the reason that
they're<00:00:34.860> few<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.130> them<00:00:35.250> were<00:00:35.370> left<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.149> wasn't
