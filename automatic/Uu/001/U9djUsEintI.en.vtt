00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
really um just to kind of speed up the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.079

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
and then I would suggest starting with

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.720 
and then I would suggest starting with
patterns<00:00:20.820> which<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.300> what<00:00:21.600> I'm<00:00:21.689> doing<00:00:21.720> and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
patterns which is what I'm doing and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.990 
patterns which is what I'm doing and
they're<00:00:23.730> really<00:00:24.090> easy<00:00:25.310> well<00:00:26.310> not<00:00:26.519> all<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.760> them

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
they're really easy well not all of them

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.519
