00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.480
 hello dear friends my name is the 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.960
 Basler and I want you one 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.240
 give an overview of these books in the 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.870
 Last last two years from the machines 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.410
 in this case it is the book de 1 off 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.000
 and lasts 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.500
 Here you will find many exercises 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.780
 changed the movement and the 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:34.930
 music theory the next book is the book 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.180
 rudiment in the two course will be in 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.350
 the three works and finds them ice 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:45.780
 here learned the technique of flims and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.780
 red and living room 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.710
 Dear friends, we are back up 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:01:08.190
 broadcast and we play today will be us 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:09.660
 today the double blows to these blows 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:22.050
 then become practically double 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:23.670
 Give it to me if you play faster 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.360
 now have the double beat in the left 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.360
 built-in 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.290
 You see, it's so easy for us 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.290
 Sounds like it has been there since then 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.619
 Of course there is no such thing as a track 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.930
 only two double strokes but also 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.080
 several and alternating with right and 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.929
 left that would be the case in this case 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.929
 same exercises again same approach 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.360
 you have seen me now I am after the 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.080
 second double beat by hand 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.269
 gone upstairs 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:40.019
 otherwise you have to correct the accent 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:42.989
 not on the next 1 so again you 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.180
 you always have to make two notes before the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.010
 accent by hand then go up 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.010
 so that could play in the accent 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:20.100
 the next exercise and that sounds like it 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.100
 is done 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.570
 Training for the red then you have the 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.570
 five in the sky the seven around the 9 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.030
 nice that you have watched 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.940
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.480
