 hello everyone with you at 12 to chaos and now 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.880
 I will comment on the sharp moment in but 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.160
 the river I played for this water guy on top 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.070
 and wanna show you some funny 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.890
 moments from this match let's see 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.590
 your fleece rak a.d. 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.890
 there is a tear and there is a new one against it 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.960
 the hero queen see what I want from the dance 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.140
 attack to give on the head but she 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.150
 departs from goes flying away from me and 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.980
 starting three wells but sees that 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.200
 suitable reinforcement therefore 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.540
 the green tarke is in danger now at him 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.989
 attack together try to kill him but I 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.210
 I stand this damn queen hammer and sw and 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.969
 hammer I take her for me running 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.440
 mad wine good i have soon 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.090
 will roll back when I move it as 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.160
 recharged I attack her camp 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.860
 I do not spend it until I use w I knock it with a hammer 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.469
 and I still have to become a hammer 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.930
 take her and here's such a crazy 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.750
 Tarik here we have a clear shown as 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.489
 destroy kwn I think it was necessary to cut 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.670
 do something again i mean i come up 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.400
 camp w ulta hammer all goodbye 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.280
 very much demage of about 130 nm 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.080
 Demage was with me at this moment further 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.369
 most likely will be here 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.070
 fits with us also in 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.799
 but this time she is level 6 and she 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.840
 dangerous you see as protection and for 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.670
 punching armor she beats poor river 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.909
 throws up and you have ults 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.619
 no, I run away somehow and save 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.159
 last hit but she didn't 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.600
 to continue the persecution would be very dead 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.020
 the bear here mocks the queen like 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.340
 wants so much wants to dump of course but here 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.259
 just starting to run away but here already 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.630
 frantic recline back i put and 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.590
 see how fast we tear it 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.600
 tarik real killed for this moment 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.430

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.380
 bear attacking them yours i am with 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.600
 delivered although it was necessary to fight Kislyuk 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.880
 your favorite then switch to the forest 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.189
 the bear also beats bursting a woman with 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.840
 wand and attack we stand soon 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.280
 very little when I roll back 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.590
 our artus as you see in artifacts 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.430
 therefore, a small camp is given and we kill 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.590
 also vi 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.420
 bye actually queen there 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.400
 hurt just the guy who cut out 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.200
 Video Thanks to this large and coppenole 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.150
 here we see see how very fast 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.069
 dying queen pursues his cult it 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.050
 mummy right on all tarik along with 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.390
 the team is hammering the head 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.110
 opponent chasing a thrash chasing 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.810
 throwing camp 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.160
 I leave now probably probably need 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:35.060
 move this product to beats and minus thrash 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.780
 Here is such a topic and let's put 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.459
 pause and by the way here see the quad 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.959
 ult alex and i like that 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.140
 dodge because she's like 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.660
 unusual and that's what I wanted to tell 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.430
 about tariqa is generally a very powerful guy with 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.440
 this in this video I probably let you down 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.130
 the results of the last competition at the same time there all 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.250
 past and pashkin deduct well and new 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.709
 also announce that we have interesting 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.400
 Tarika appeared new passivka this 4 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.799
 percent here is the maximum mana goes to 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.069
 attack that is, it turns out that if 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.230
 hero and creeps 2 percent not only 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.829
 that every hit on the heroes rolls back 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.209
 Hilton 3. 4 seconds that is possible 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.269
 constantly hilyatsya 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.829
 and apply a bunch of demage thanks to man 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.690
 Amumu is the only thing that mana you very much 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.549
 long stacks especially in the form of a drop 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.280
 therefore, it is necessary to improve it as much as possible 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.010
 rather and relay you beats they 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.130
 spells so as soon as possible 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.350
 take mon amour our watermelon do not know need 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.970
 not needed but in this game I collected a stub 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.489
 generally very good fist because 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.970
 fist gives you and armor and a lot 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:47.329
 mana therefore mind us mind and fist at all 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.980
 it could be snowing 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.630
 dodges more precisely save at 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.269
 least and here we have a wild fight 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.760
 bear about mummy killed bear beat 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.319
 great exost I'm starting to hit first 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.840
 we then switching to the mesh grid 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.720
 should thinner up taking away literally 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.340
 with a blow of 300 hp demolished, the suite is also suitable 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.290
 And I thought this enemy Alex was going to 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.700
 not to fight but no it's ally alexa i 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:14.410
 You lost to a bunch of x's such here 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.019
 the game turned out to be such a nares 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.150
 Then there was the game pretty boring 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.459
 give us there one at a time 10 surrendered well 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.040
 in short, nothing powerful was all the most 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.020
 interesting I gathered in this video I advise 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.430
