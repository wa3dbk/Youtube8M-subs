00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 Hi, people today teach me how to make a 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.790
 childhood mug cake he sold 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.950
 team bag that comes ready is just 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.280
 take milk 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.240
 I bought chocolate brigadeiro e 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.960
 Brownie 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.640
 I start Brazilian is very good here. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.090
 in the setup mode when you put 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:29.279
 50 ml of milk and the mug must have 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.080
 capacity of 300 ml can serve a 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.730
 ability of me I got the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.079
 big connect 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:41.910
 I went to the window so let's go there already 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:50.039
 I dumped the contents of here live in 70 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:52.250
 and placing 50 grams now only ml milk 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.250
 place 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.760
 in the instructions nothing you move in a place 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.170
 well I'm calling you to put it on 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.330
 one minute 10 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.590
 but will vary there according to the 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.590
 sound power and microphones 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:16.190
 Ready, it's kinda hot. 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.739
 the auction is very hot the ideal is that 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.200
 You can cool off a bit. 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.380
 if you want to eat it out of the mug 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.220
 otherwise as you say but you like 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:32.500
 I'm going to take it out of here and hope it's cool. 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.500
 so as not to be in danger of breaking 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.060
 I just misinformed he did not change here. 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.480
 inside everything came out as the brigadeiro 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.180
 he got the grains here teaching 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.250
 there you have the option to eat like this or 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.890
 make a filling and put I would prefer 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.250
 eat like this but I'll put a 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.250
 stuffing in it
