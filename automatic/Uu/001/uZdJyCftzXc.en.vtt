right<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.559> using<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.309> sea<00:01:02.520> sponge<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.270> dab

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
right there using the sea sponge to dab

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.710 
right there using the sea sponge to dab
on<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.379> little<00:01:04.650> bit<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.070> grey<00:01:05.309> texture<00:01:05.909> so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
on a little bit of that grey texture so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.630 
on a little bit of that grey texture so
I'm<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.930> sure<00:01:06.990> where<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.619> came<00:01:07.920> from<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
I'm not sure where that came from in the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.850 
I'm not sure where that came from in the
actual<00:01:09.270> scene<00:01:09.600> what<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.110> reflecting<00:01:10.710> into

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
actual scene what was reflecting into

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.890 
actual scene what was reflecting into
the<00:01:11.070> water<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.700> made<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> very<00:01:12.060> interesting

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the water but it made a very interesting

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.100 
the water but it made a very interesting
background<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:14.210> that's<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.570> something

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
background and that's kind of something

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.499 
background and that's kind of something
that<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.320> look<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.950> when<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.220> am<00:01:17.460> looking<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.479> a

water<00:02:07.049> lily<00:02:07.229> pads<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.929> after<00:02:09.929> I've<00:02:10.190> got<00:02:11.190> some

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
water lily pads and after I've got some

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.710 
water lily pads and after I've got some
of<00:02:11.549> this<00:02:12.140> background<00:02:13.140> water<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.310> and

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
of this background water and and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.539 
of this background water and and
reflections<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.319> will<00:02:16.709> remove<00:02:17.310> that

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
reflections in I will remove that

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.500 
reflections in I will remove that
masking<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.269> then<00:02:18.450> paint<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.930> those<00:02:19.110> areas<00:02:20.510> and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
masking to then paint in those areas and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.660 
masking to then paint in those areas and
for<00:02:21.750> those<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.620> don't<00:02:22.799> know<00:02:22.950> masking

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
for those of you that don't know masking

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.240 
for those of you that don't know masking
is<00:02:23.849> a<00:02:24.470> substance<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:25.860> paint<00:02:26.069> onto

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
is a substance that you can paint onto

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.430 
is a substance that you can paint onto
the<00:02:26.459> paper<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.180> basically<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.870> blocks<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
the paper and basically it blocks the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.500 
the paper and basically it blocks the
paint<00:02:28.860> from<00:02:31.670> painting<00:02:32.670> or<00:02:32.940> from<00:02:33.209> coloring

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
paint from painting or from coloring

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.190 
paint from painting or from coloring
that<00:02:33.660> area<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.890> remains<00:02:35.280> white<00:02:35.670> and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
that area so that it remains white and

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.740 
that area so that it remains white and
then<00:02:37.200> when<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.340> remove<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.970> masking<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.569> can

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
then when you remove the masking you can

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.110 
then when you remove the masking you can
either<00:02:39.900> paint<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.470> area<00:02:40.500> or<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.790> can<00:02:41.940> leave

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
either paint that area or you can leave

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.900 
either paint that area or you can leave
it<00:02:42.269> white<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.099> often<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.250> masking<00:02:44.730> will

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
it white and often the masking will

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.300 
it white and often the masking will
leave<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.480> little<00:02:45.750> bit<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.110> hard<00:02:46.379> edge<00:02:46.650> or<00:02:47.040> an

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
leave a little bit of a hard edge or an

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.130 
leave a little bit of a hard edge or an
unusual<00:02:47.730> shaped<00:02:48.209> edge<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.720> will<00:02:48.780> look<00:02:48.989> a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
unusual shaped edge and it will look a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.069 
unusual shaped edge and it will look a
little<00:02:49.459> wrong<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.629> will<00:02:51.780> go<00:02:51.900> back<00:02:52.019> and

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
little wrong so I will go back and

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.379 
little wrong so I will go back and
soften<00:02:52.709> edges<00:02:52.889> where<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.370> masking<00:02:53.970> has<00:02:54.120> been

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
soften edges where the masking has been

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.460 
soften edges where the masking has been
to<00:02:54.840> make<00:02:55.049> it<00:02:56.359> be<00:02:57.359> a<00:02:57.389> part<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.079> painting

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
to make it be a part of the painting

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.770 
to make it be a part of the painting
more<00:02:58.650> or<00:02:59.060> sometimes<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.209> will<00:03:00.389> paint<00:03:00.540> around

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
more or sometimes I will paint around

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.479 
more or sometimes I will paint around
those<00:03:00.989> edges<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:01.440> clean<00:03:01.650> them<00:03:01.829> up<00:03:01.950> some<00:03:04.489> so

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
those edges and clean them up some so

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.319 
those edges and clean them up some so
I'm<00:03:05.670> getting<00:03:06.630> across<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.200> back<00:03:07.380> here<00:03:07.739> and

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
I'm getting across the back here and

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.490 
I'm getting across the back here and
continuing<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.480> do<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.780> cream<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.350> then

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
continuing to do the cream and then

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.800 
continuing to do the cream and then
using<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.130> sponge<00:03:11.549> to<00:03:11.880> put<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.299> texture

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
using the sponge to put in that texture

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:24.879 
using the sponge to put in that texture
a<00:03:22.099> little<00:03:23.099> bit<00:03:23.220> more<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.639> close-up<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.359> you

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
a little bit more of a close-up for you

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.379 
a little bit more of a close-up for you
so<00:03:25.889> you<00:03:25.980> can<00:03:26.099> see<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.340> little<00:03:26.549> bit<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.849> that<00:03:27.030> kind

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
so you can see a little bit of that kind

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.960 
so you can see a little bit of that kind
of<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.780> gray<00:03:28.349> purpley<00:03:28.920> texture<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.760> there's<00:03:29.910> a

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
of a gray purpley texture and there's a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.470 
of a gray purpley texture and there's a
little<00:03:30.120> bit<00:03:30.329> of<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:31.579> kind<00:03:32.579> of<00:03:32.669> a<00:03:32.760> peachy<00:03:33.239> color

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
little bit of a kind of a peachy color

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.000 
little bit of a kind of a peachy color
in<00:03:34.349> that<00:03:35.220> background<00:03:35.970> area<00:03:36.329> also<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:37.169> so<00:03:37.950> I

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
in that background area also and so I

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.129 
in that background area also and so I
put<00:03:38.370> just<00:03:38.639> a<00:03:38.790> little<00:03:38.819> bit<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.419> into<00:03:39.989> the

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
put just a little bit of that into the

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:51.160 
put just a little bit of that into the
cream<00:03:40.380> color<00:03:40.680> as<00:03:41.400> well

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.900 

and<00:03:52.170> we're<00:03:52.410> almost<00:03:52.530> done<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.220> if<00:03:53.490> you<00:03:53.700> will

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910
