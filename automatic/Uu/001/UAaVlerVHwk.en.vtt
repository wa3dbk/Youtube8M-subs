November December January February march

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.060 
November December January February march
april<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.250> five<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.180> six<00:00:39.390> months<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.680> half<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
april so five to six months and half a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.830

year<00:00:41.250> that's<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.520> big<00:00:41.760> time<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.329> i<00:00:42.510> would<00:00:42.660> like

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
year that's a big time and i would like

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.200 
year that's a big time and i would like
to<00:00:42.989> think<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:44.100> reason<00:00:44.430> they're<00:00:44.760> doing<00:00:45.059> this

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
to think the reason they're doing this

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.580 
to think the reason they're doing this
is<00:00:45.450> because<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.410> probably<00:00:46.710> looks<00:00:47.129> terrible<00:00:47.760> on

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
is because it probably looks terrible on

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.529 
is because it probably looks terrible on
playstation<00:00:49.590> 3<00:00:49.860> xbox<00:00:50.780> 360<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.809> wii<00:00:52.410> u<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.539> i

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii u and i

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.479 
playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii u and i
can<00:00:54.780> see<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.320> coming<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.829> watch<00:00:56.010> dogs<00:00:56.280> but

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
can see this coming out watch dogs but

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.060 
can see this coming out watch dogs but
is<00:00:56.550> potentially<00:00:57.120> next-gen<00:00:57.719> only<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
is potentially next-gen only and the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.410 
is potentially next-gen only and the
reason<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.430> they're<00:00:59.670> waiting<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.149> because

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
reason that they're waiting is because

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.760 
reason that they're waiting is because
obviously<00:01:00.570> hardly<00:01:01.140> anyone's<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> have

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
obviously hardly anyone's going to have

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.260 
obviously hardly anyone's going to have
a<00:01:01.800> console<00:01:02.190> by<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.370> time<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.760> was<00:01:02.820> supposed<00:01:03.180> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
a console by the time it was supposed to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.910 
a console by the time it was supposed to
come<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.140> if<00:01:04.229> they<00:01:04.350> wait<00:01:04.500> six<00:01:04.739> months

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
come out so if they wait six months

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.580 
come out so if they wait six months
adopters<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:05.970> then<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.439> buy

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
adopters get it and then you can buy

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.990 
adopters get it and then you can buy
watchdogs<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> new<00:01:08.430> generation<00:01:08.939> of

watchdogs to the new generation of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.399 
watchdogs to the new generation of

however<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.850> was<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.000> skeptical<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.570> watch

of people saying oh it's like the second

this<00:01:41.759> crap<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.600> marketing

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
this crap I think it's just a marketing

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.170 
this crap I think it's just a marketing
gimmick<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.549> release<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.759> next<00:01:45.030> generation

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
gimmick to release it on next generation

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.370 
gimmick to release it on next generation
so<00:01:45.600> they<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> speak<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.200> better

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
so they can get to speak it better

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.190 
so they can get to speak it better
reviews<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.390> played<00:01:49.049> out

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
reviews and have it you know played out

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.080 
reviews and have it you know played out
better<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.740> those<00:01:50.340> are<00:01:50.460> my<00:01:50.549> thoughts<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:50.970> i'm

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
better but those are my thoughts but i'm

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.370 
better but those are my thoughts but i'm
very<00:01:51.119> skeptical<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> be<00:01:52.350> able

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
very skeptical it's not going to be able

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.370 
very skeptical it's not going to be able
to<00:01:52.560> live<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> hype<00:01:53.250> at<00:01:53.460> all<00:01:53.930> but<00:01:54.930> very

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
to live up to the hype at all but very

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.260 
to live up to the hype at all but very
rarely<00:01:55.590> do<00:01:56.009> games<00:01:56.219> do<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.640> anyway<00:01:57.000> no<00:01:57.240> matter

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
rarely do games do that anyway no matter

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.170 
rarely do games do that anyway no matter
how<00:01:57.570> good<00:01:57.750> they<00:01:57.930> are<00:01:58.399> but<00:01:59.399> no<00:01:59.520> i<00:01:59.549> can't<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.060> it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
how good they are but no i can't see it

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.580 
how good they are but no i can't see it
living<00:02:00.509> up<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.719> any<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> hype<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.350> it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
living up to any of the hype that it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.069 
living up to any of the hype that it
produced<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.820> looks<00:02:03.000> amazing<00:02:03.600> from<00:02:03.960> what

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
produced but it looks amazing from what

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.630 
produced but it looks amazing from what
we've<00:02:04.229> seen<00:02:04.259> but<00:02:04.619> i'm<00:02:04.680> very<00:02:05.009> skeptical<00:02:05.430> i

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
we've seen but i'm very skeptical i

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.950 
we've seen but i'm very skeptical i
think<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.850> will<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> very<00:02:06.240> weak<00:02:06.479> story<00:02:06.840> and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
think it will have a very weak story and

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.619 
think it will have a very weak story and
would<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.259> bland<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.799> boring<00:02:08.629> but

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
would just be bland and boring but

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.420 
would just be bland and boring but
obviously<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.500> was<00:02:10.739> almost<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
obviously this was almost one of the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.589 
obviously this was almost one of the
games<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.730> i<00:02:11.849> was<00:02:11.970> like<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.209> know<00:02:12.330> what<00:02:12.360> I'm

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
games that i was like you know what I'm

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.970 
games that i was like you know what I'm
going<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.750> get<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> xbox<00:02:13.230> really

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
going to get the xbox really

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.040 
going to get the xbox really
so<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.550> new<00:02:14.670> xbox<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.300> playstation<00:02:15.870> 4

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
so the new xbox with a playstation 4

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.309 
so the new xbox with a playstation 4
really<00:02:16.800> soon<00:02:17.129> so<00:02:17.159> I<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.400> play<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.700> game<00:02:18.319> but

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
really soon so I can play this game but

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.960 
really soon so I can play this game but
now<00:02:19.500> I'm<00:02:19.739> not<00:02:19.950> interested<00:02:20.159> at<00:02:20.519> all<00:02:20.670> because

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
now I'm not interested at all because

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.580 
now I'm not interested at all because
they've<00:02:21.420> delayed<00:02:21.870> at<00:02:22.049> six<00:02:22.230> months<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.500> i'll

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
they've delayed at six months and i'll

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.170 
they've delayed at six months and i'll
probably<00:02:22.739> have<00:02:22.890> an<00:02:22.980> xbox<00:02:23.159> one<00:02:23.430> by<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:23.819> so

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
probably have an xbox one by then so

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.410 
probably have an xbox one by then so
this<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.110> what<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.409> is<00:02:25.440> i<00:02:25.970> was<00:02:26.970> looking<00:02:27.209> forward

it'll<00:03:02.340> come<00:03:02.519> out<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.760> Jay<00:03:02.879> I<00:03:02.910> think<00:03:03.209> it'll<00:03:03.329> come

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
it'll come out on Jay I think it'll come

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.569 
it'll come out on Jay I think it'll come
out<00:03:03.629> on<00:03:03.750> current<00:03:04.019> generation<00:03:04.470> anyway<00:03:04.920> just

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
out on current generation anyway just

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.009 
out on current generation anyway just
for<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.180> know<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.299> couple<00:03:06.510> more<00:03:06.750> sales

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
for that you know a couple more sales

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.390 
for that you know a couple more sales
but<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.349> think<00:03:07.620> primarily<00:03:07.769> this<00:03:08.190> will<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.370> a

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
but I think primarily this will be a

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.910 
but I think primarily this will be a
next<00:03:08.609> generation<00:03:08.849> game<00:03:09.680> tell<00:03:10.680> me<00:03:10.739> what<00:03:10.859> you
