00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.269
 it's a pretty good question because I do not 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.450
 I remember since I have use of reason 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.689
 I think because my dad always had 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.189
 I have been on a motorcycle since January 2011 when 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.529
 I got tired of the tails of caracas and 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.029
 I decided to buy a motorcycle and the first 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.279
 Once I rode a motorcycle it was the year 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.220
 passed as a barbecue but as 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.660
 driver I had to be on a motorcycle to 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.920
 build the character of patricia that 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.140
 you are seeing the air of all 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.390
 ways to break I have years knowing what 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.700
 is to be on a motorcycle because my current boyfriend 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.370
 husband and 14 years of relationship always 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.740
 he was on a motorcycle the first on a motorcycle 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.660
 so big for the one that I had and I 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:55.570
 It was always a skinny what the bike and the 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.570
 Largest motorcycle for the size 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.659
 because a fast vehicle 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.210
 vehicle that allows us to reach 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.790
 anywhere without the problems of 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.860
 tails of caracas work in radio I have 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.330
 a program from 3 to 5 in the afternoon and the 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.520
 way to fulfill all my 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.930
 commitments taking into account the difficult 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.020
 caracas traffic is 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.720
 we call the tele 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.240
 transporter that's why it's the beauty of 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.550
 being in many is not just being able to get 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.190
 before because it avoids a lot of tail but 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.470
 also be respectful of the life of 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.570
 respectful of traffic laws that 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.720
 I feel about it when it pulls a 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.720
 little bit 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.930
 the biggest scare the theft of a motorcycle makes 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.640
 and some years four armed people 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.060
 in hills of beautiful mountain and a 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.140
 terrifying experience I left ccp to 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.390
 theaters of saucers and here the people 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.650
 it does not not hold traffic lights what changes 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.750
 it starts all the world starts in 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.400
 start mode and 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.229
 but fortunately it did not happen to older 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.950
 I did hit myself 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.899
 a couple of strokes on a strong motorbike that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.270
 they scared I tell you from experience 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.270
 own that on the mountain to go slow 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.070
 here quiet and you have to go with the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.380
 mind in peace the moments you see visible 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.820
 all 9 motorcycles all the time is 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.280
 difficult to violate their right to circulate 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.290
 what to ourselves the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.520
 We are working on the motorized 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.520
 we are attacking in life 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.290
 If you are driving your motorcycle do not attend 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.570
 do not talk by cell phone, motorized friend 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.550
 you do not want to see if you are guiding 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.260
 between the vehicles the imprudence 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.360
 can lead to you being one of the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.760
 100 motorized selections daily 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.740
 way with consciousness in a straight line and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.570
 without using the cell phone to any care 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.580
 for life is one on the motorcycle there is no 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.790
 102 security remembers that life only 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.209
 there is a 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.209
