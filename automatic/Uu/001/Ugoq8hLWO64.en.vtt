00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
it's kind of in a tradition for me to

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.390 
it's kind of in a tradition for me to
every<00:00:02.310> summer<00:00:02.520> go<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.540> top<00:00:03.720> of<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:04.049> 14er<00:00:04.500> so

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
every summer go to the top of a 14er so

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.140 
every summer go to the top of a 14er so
we're<00:00:05.819> here<00:00:06.060> at<00:00:06.120> Mount<00:00:06.720> Evans<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.500> we<00:00:08.370> let's

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
we're here at Mount Evans and we let's

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.970 
we're here at Mount Evans and we let's
see<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.570> don't<00:00:10.019> know<00:00:10.170> what<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> altitude<00:00:10.559> of

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
see I don't know what the altitude of

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.759 
see I don't know what the altitude of
the<00:00:11.040> base<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.670> here<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:13.080> dude<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.290> paying<00:00:13.620> no

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
the base is here this dude is paying no

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.770 
the base is here this dude is paying no
attention<00:00:13.799> will<00:00:14.309> turn<00:00:14.490> all<00:00:15.330> right<00:00:15.420> just<00:00:15.630> out

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
attention will turn all right just out

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.650 
attention will turn all right just out
of<00:00:15.870> curiosity

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
of curiosity

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.290 
of curiosity
alright<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:19.010> you<00:00:19.100> can<00:00:19.220> see<00:00:19.430> I<00:00:19.460> do<00:00:19.640> have<00:00:20.060> enough

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
alright so you can see I do have enough

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.750 
alright so you can see I do have enough
power<00:00:20.510> of<00:00:20.690> this<00:00:20.810> altitude<00:00:21.170> to<00:00:21.770> be<00:00:22.070> able<00:00:22.430> to<00:00:22.730> a

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
power of this altitude to be able to a

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.679 
power of this altitude to be able to a
wheelie<00:00:23.240> I<00:00:23.360> want<00:00:23.660> to<00:00:23.720> emphasize<00:00:24.140> that<00:00:25.689> all

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
wheelie I want to emphasize that all

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.940 
wheelie I want to emphasize that all
right<00:00:26.950> so<00:00:28.210> one<00:00:29.210> thing<00:00:29.419> about<00:00:29.660> it<00:00:29.840> with<00:00:29.960> 14<00:00:30.800> or

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
right so one thing about it with 14 or

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.470 
right so one thing about it with 14 or
is<00:00:31.220> it<00:00:31.400> does<00:00:31.520> get<00:00:31.669> a<00:00:31.730> lot<00:00:31.880> cooler<00:00:32.119> a<00:00:32.270> lot

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
is it does get a lot cooler a lot

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.720 
is it does get a lot cooler a lot
quicker<00:00:32.660> when<00:00:32.960> you<00:00:33.050> go<00:00:33.170> up<00:00:33.410> we<00:00:34.160> have<00:00:34.400> good

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
quicker when you go up we have good

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.240 
quicker when you go up we have good

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
degrees it's a little warmer than when I

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.020 
degrees it's a little warmer than when I
came<00:00:41.300> up<00:00:41.480> here<00:00:41.600> with<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:42.890> seven<00:00:43.340> thanks<00:00:43.519> it<00:00:43.730> gets

came up here with a seven thanks it gets
pretty<00:00:44.180> popular<00:00:44.480> yep<00:00:47.500> so<00:00:48.500> one<00:00:48.949> thing<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.190> will

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
pretty popular yep so one thing you will

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.369 
pretty popular yep so one thing you will
notice<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:50.059> that<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:50.390> road<00:00:50.629> has<00:00:50.930> changed

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
notice is that the road has changed

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.040 
notice is that the road has changed
quite<00:00:51.559> a<00:00:51.620> bit<00:00:51.710> they<00:00:52.100> don't<00:00:52.370> really<00:00:53.000> paint<00:00:53.870> it

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
quite a bit they don't really paint it

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.810 
quite a bit they don't really paint it
very<00:00:54.260> much<00:00:54.410> up<00:00:54.649> here<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.250> that's<00:00:55.610> because

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
very much up here and that's because

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.410 
very much up here and that's because
this<00:00:56.719> road<00:00:57.020> spends<00:00:57.500> a<00:00:57.770> large<00:00:58.520> portion<00:00:59.059> of<00:00:59.300> the

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
this road spends a large portion of the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.299 
this road spends a large portion of the
time<00:00:59.660> of<00:00:59.899> the<00:00:59.989> year<00:01:00.140> close<00:01:00.559> like<00:01:00.980> four<00:01:01.190> or<00:01:01.250> five

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
time of the year close like four or five

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:02.889 
time of the year close like four or five
months<00:01:01.700> and<00:01:02.000> that's<00:01:02.210> because<00:01:02.420> there<00:01:02.750> will<00:01:02.840> be

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
months and that's because there will be

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.340 
months and that's because there will be
snow<00:01:03.170> up<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:04.220> bat<00:01:04.940> here<00:01:05.300> Bo<00:01:05.479> five<00:01:05.720> six<00:01:06.020> feet<00:01:06.200> of

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
snow up to bat here Bo five six feet of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.969 
snow up to bat here Bo five six feet of
it<00:01:06.520> even<00:01:07.520> at<00:01:07.610> this<00:01:07.759> altitude<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:08.840> as<00:01:09.560> you<00:01:09.800> get

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
it even at this altitude and as you get

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.590 
it even at this altitude and as you get
off<00:01:10.160> they<00:01:10.490> get<00:01:10.640> to<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.880> point<00:01:11.060> there's<00:01:11.330> even

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
off they get to the point there's even

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.990 
off they get to the point there's even
more<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.899> more<00:01:12.110> snow<00:01:12.410> so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
more and more snow so

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.360 
more and more snow so
the<00:01:15.660> one<00:01:16.170> thing<00:01:16.350> you'll<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.770> notice<00:01:17.010> is

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
the one thing you'll really notice is

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.390 
the one thing you'll really notice is
that<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.930> wildlife<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.200> plants<00:01:20.160> are<00:01:20.310> going

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
that the wildlife and plants are going

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.950 
that the wildlife and plants are going
to<00:01:20.520> change<00:01:20.760> significantly<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.510> we<00:01:21.630> increase

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to change significantly as we increase

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.719 
to change significantly as we increase
in<00:01:22.110> altitude<00:01:22.230> then<00:01:23.160> we're<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.370> to<00:01:23.430> go<00:01:23.490> from

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
in altitude then we're going to go from

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.899 
in altitude then we're going to go from
seeing<00:01:24.030> right<00:01:24.300> now<00:01:24.330> there's<00:01:24.690> Aspen's

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
seeing right now there's Aspen's

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.800 
seeing right now there's Aspen's
we<00:01:27.420> got<00:01:27.570> pine<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.289> got<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.469> lot<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.740> wild<00:01:29.069> grass

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
we got pine we got a lot of wild grass

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.539 
we got pine we got a lot of wild grass
we<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:31.049> let's<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.740> anything<00:01:32.219> else<00:01:32.369> I'm

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
we have let's see anything else I'm

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
we have let's see anything else I'm
noticing<00:01:32.850> immediately<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:34.200> only<00:01:34.350> thing

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
noticing immediately not only thing

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.039 
noticing immediately not only thing
terribly<00:01:34.920> obvious<00:01:35.159> blood<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.630> climb<00:01:36.899> an

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
terribly obvious blood as we climb an

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.779 
terribly obvious blood as we climb an
altitude<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.770> types<00:01:38.039> of<00:01:38.189> plants<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.640> there

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
altitude the types of plants that there

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.880 
altitude the types of plants that there
are<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.840> already<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.319> pines<00:01:40.649> are

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
are you can already see the pines are

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.800 
are you can already see the pines are
starting<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.399> shorter<00:01:41.880> these<00:01:42.450> are<00:01:42.600> not

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
starting to get shorter these are not

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.160 
starting to get shorter these are not
young<00:01:43.229> Pines<00:01:43.859> here<00:01:44.490> these<00:01:45.149> are<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.359> there's

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
young Pines here these are just there's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.219 
young Pines here these are just there's
not<00:01:46.469> much<00:01:46.770> air<00:01:47.099> and<00:01:47.459> so<00:01:48.149> what<00:01:48.359> happens<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.990> they

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
not much air and so what happens is they

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.559 
not much air and so what happens is they
get<00:01:49.349> shorter<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.890> shorter<00:01:49.950> because<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.420> you

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
get shorter and shorter because as you

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.389 
get shorter and shorter because as you
can<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> pines<00:01:52.289> have<00:01:52.530> already<00:01:52.859> come<00:01:53.130> down

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
can see the pines have already come down

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.249 
can see the pines have already come down
and<00:01:53.670> height<00:01:53.909> quite<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> bit<00:01:54.539> we're<00:01:55.109> still

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
and height quite a bit we're still

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.959 
and height quite a bit we're still
getting<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.619> lot<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.770> tall<00:01:56.099> ones<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.640> lot<00:01:56.819> of

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
getting a lot of tall ones but a lot of

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.330 
getting a lot of tall ones but a lot of
these<00:01:57.060> ones<00:01:57.329> next<00:01:57.599> to<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.899> road<00:01:58.109> are<00:01:58.679> already

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
these ones next to the road are already

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.490 
these ones next to the road are already
about<00:02:00.149> half<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.780> height<00:02:00.959> of<00:02:01.020> what<00:02:01.289> they<00:02:01.439> were

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
about half the height of what they were

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.010 
about half the height of what they were
now<00:02:02.069> there<00:02:02.670> gets<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.179> a<00:02:03.209> point<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.899> is

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
now there gets to be a point and it is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.160 
now there gets to be a point and it is
amazingly<00:02:04.819> consistent<00:02:05.819> in<00:02:06.420> altitude<00:02:06.869> no

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
amazingly consistent in altitude no

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.020 
amazingly consistent in altitude no
matter<00:02:07.319> where<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.560> go<00:02:07.679> there's<00:02:08.579> an<00:02:08.700> altitude

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
matter where you go there's an altitude

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.720 
matter where you go there's an altitude
called<00:02:09.539> Timberline<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:11.009> what<00:02:11.160> happens<00:02:11.579> at

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
called Timberline and what happens at

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.670 
called Timberline and what happens at
Timberline<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.510> that's<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.049> altitude<00:02:13.560> above

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
Timberline is that's the altitude above

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.619 
Timberline is that's the altitude above
which<00:02:13.980> there<00:02:14.250> isn't<00:02:14.430> enough<00:02:14.849> air<00:02:15.150> for<00:02:15.360> trees

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
which there isn't enough air for trees

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.869 
which there isn't enough air for trees
to<00:02:15.810> grow<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.860> we're<00:02:17.220> actually<00:02:17.340> pretty<00:02:17.730> close

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
to grow and we're actually pretty close

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.339 
to grow and we're actually pretty close
you<00:02:18.239> can<00:02:18.359> already<00:02:18.510> see<00:02:18.840> they're<00:02:18.989> starting<00:02:19.290> to

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
you can already see they're starting to

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.199 
you can already see they're starting to
thin<00:02:19.590> out<00:02:19.620> here<00:02:19.950> quite<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.250> bit<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.150> can

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
thin out here quite a bit and you can

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.270 
thin out here quite a bit and you can
see<00:02:21.480> over<00:02:21.750> on<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:22.049> Ridge<00:02:22.290> there<00:02:22.620> aren't<00:02:23.129> any

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
see over on that Ridge there aren't any

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.569 
see over on that Ridge there aren't any
fines<00:02:23.609> at<00:02:23.819> all<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.870> once<00:02:25.140> these<00:02:25.859> pools<00:02:26.220> are<00:02:26.459> how

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
fines at all so once these pools are how

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.610 
fines at all so once these pools are how
tall<00:02:26.819> are<00:02:27.090> how<00:02:27.329> deep<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.750> snow<00:02:27.810> can<00:02:28.230> get<00:02:28.410> here

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
tall are how deep the snow can get here

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.250 
tall are how deep the snow can get here
and<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.700> way<00:02:29.910> they<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:30.359> see<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.690> road<00:02:30.930> and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
and that way they can see the road and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.080 
and that way they can see the road and
tell<00:02:31.440> where<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> road<00:02:31.709> is<00:02:32.099> when<00:02:32.700> they<00:02:32.819> can't

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
tell where the road is when they can't

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.020 
tell where the road is when they can't
actually<00:02:33.709> see<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.829> pavement<00:02:35.280> or<00:02:35.370> be<00:02:35.730> able<00:02:35.849> to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
actually see the pavement or be able to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.099 
actually see the pavement or be able to
tell<00:02:36.299> where<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.690> because<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:36.930> will<00:02:37.079> look

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
tell where it is because it will look

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.260 
tell where it is because it will look
like<00:02:37.230> just<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.739> flat<00:02:37.980> snow<00:02:38.250> drift<00:02:38.519> across<00:02:38.670> here

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
like just a flat snow drift across here

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.750 
like just a flat snow drift across here
so<00:02:40.870> now<00:02:41.110> we're<00:02:41.320> above<00:02:41.530> Timberline<00:02:41.860> there's<00:02:42.610> no

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
so now we're above Timberline there's no

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.000 
so now we're above Timberline there's no
trees<00:02:43.090> whereas<00:02:43.840> right<00:02:44.380> down<00:02:44.560> there<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:44.890> can

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
trees whereas right down there you can

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.240 
trees whereas right down there you can
see<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:46.150> amazes<00:02:46.900> me<00:02:46.930> how<00:02:47.080> consistent<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.100> is

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
see it amazes me how consistent it is

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.360 
see it amazes me how consistent it is
it's<00:02:48.850> like<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.270> go<00:02:49.450> 50<00:02:50.020> feet<00:02:50.260> up<00:02:50.500> or<00:02:50.680> down<00:02:50.890> and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
it's like you go 50 feet up or down and

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.980 
it's like you go 50 feet up or down and
that<00:02:51.790> changes<00:02:52.210> whether<00:02:52.420> or<00:02:52.570> not<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.810> see

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
that changes whether or not you see

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.230 
that changes whether or not you see
trees<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.650> an<00:02:53.770> amazingly<00:02:54.310> consistent<00:02:54.610> line

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
trees it is an amazingly consistent line

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.690 
trees it is an amazingly consistent line
all<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.600> way<00:02:55.720> across<00:02:55.930> up<00:02:56.380> here

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
all the way across up here

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.699 
all the way across up here
this<00:02:58.270> is<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.450> prototype<00:02:58.720> car<00:02:59.200> I've<00:02:59.410> seen<00:02:59.680> a

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
this is a prototype car I've seen a

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.009 
this is a prototype car I've seen a
couple<00:02:59.770> of<00:03:00.190> these<00:03:00.310> up<00:03:00.520> here<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:01.270> I<00:03:01.629> really

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
couple of these up here and I really

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.979 
couple of these up here and I really
want<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.379> see<00:03:02.940> what<00:03:03.940> is<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:05.519> really<00:03:06.519> curious

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
want to see what is it really curious

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.890 
want to see what is it really curious
okay<00:03:07.989> yeah<00:03:08.950> I'll<00:03:09.250> pass<00:03:09.489> you<00:03:09.519> what<00:03:10.450> we<00:03:10.629> have

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
okay yeah I'll pass you what we have

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.140 
okay yeah I'll pass you what we have
here<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.349> this<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.129> a<00:03:12.160> car<00:03:12.459> that<00:03:12.489> is<00:03:12.790> not<00:03:12.940> in

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
here is this is a car that is not in

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.140 
here is this is a car that is not in
production<00:03:13.330> yet<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.650> they<00:03:15.519> put<00:03:15.760> these<00:03:15.849> bags

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
production yet and they put these bags

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.449 
production yet and they put these bags
over<00:03:16.540> for<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:16.840> couple<00:03:16.959> reasons<00:03:17.110> one<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.160> to

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
over for a couple reasons one is to

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.240 
over for a couple reasons one is to
disguise<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.540> bodywork<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:20.560> make<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.040> so<00:03:21.160> you

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
disguise the bodywork and make it so you

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.979 
disguise the bodywork and make it so you
can't<00:03:21.310> tell<00:03:21.760> what<00:03:22.120> shape<00:03:22.360> they<00:03:22.540> have<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:22.959> they

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
can't tell what shape they have and they

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.780 
can't tell what shape they have and they
have<00:03:23.200> foam<00:03:23.560> blocks<00:03:23.920> underneath<00:03:24.310> them<00:03:24.580> and

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
have foam blocks underneath them and

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.910 
have foam blocks underneath them and
other<00:03:25.480> stuff<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.230> make<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.620> harder

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
other stuff like that to make it harder

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.860 
other stuff like that to make it harder
to<00:03:26.950> tell<00:03:27.280> what<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.640> car<00:03:27.849> actually<00:03:28.150> looks<00:03:28.629> like

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
to tell what the car actually looks like

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.830 
to tell what the car actually looks like
but<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:29.920> can<00:03:29.950> see<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.090> spots<00:03:31.510> where

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
but you can see in the spots where

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.960 
but you can see in the spots where
there's<00:03:32.080> just<00:03:32.440> paint<00:03:32.830> they<00:03:33.370> also<00:03:33.489> paint<00:03:33.849> it

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
there's just paint they also paint it

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.900 
there's just paint they also paint it
with<00:03:34.090> this<00:03:34.920> wildly<00:03:35.920> contrasting<00:03:36.519> black<00:03:36.640> and

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
with this wildly contrasting black and

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.360 
with this wildly contrasting black and
white<00:03:37.090> paint<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.989> really<00:03:38.410> looks<00:03:38.650> tacky<00:03:38.980> and

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
white paint that really looks tacky and

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.039 
white paint that really looks tacky and
the<00:03:39.459> idea<00:03:39.730> behind<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:40.209> is<00:03:40.360> what<00:03:40.930> they're

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
the idea behind it is what they're

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.050 
the idea behind it is what they're
trying<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.319> do<00:03:41.470> is<00:03:41.739> make<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:42.130> as<00:03:42.250> hard<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.819> tell

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
trying to do is make it as hard to tell

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.600 
trying to do is make it as hard to tell
what<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.480> car<00:03:43.690> looks<00:03:43.959> like<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.380> possible<00:03:44.950> we

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
what the car looks like is possible we

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.039 
what the car looks like is possible we
actually<00:03:45.940> have<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.120> line<00:03:46.390> of<00:03:46.569> these<00:03:46.690> things<00:03:46.930> I

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
actually have a line of these things I

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.350 
actually have a line of these things I
passed<00:03:47.290> one<00:03:47.560> of<00:03:47.590> them<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:48.519> we<00:03:48.610> got<00:03:48.760> one<00:03:48.790> two

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
passed one of them and we got one two

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.720 
passed one of them and we got one two
three<00:03:49.870> more<00:03:50.140> up<00:03:50.349> here<00:03:50.380> I'm<00:03:51.220> going<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.459> see<00:03:51.549> if<00:03:51.579> I

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
three more up here I'm going to see if I

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.030 
three more up here I'm going to see if I
can<00:03:51.880> get<00:03:51.970> by<00:03:52.120> this<00:03:52.180> one<00:03:52.480> now

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.649 

that<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.159> cool<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:57.150> now<00:03:57.269> we're<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.599> point

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
that is cool so now we're to the point

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.720 
that is cool so now we're to the point
they've<00:03:58.110> dropped<00:03:58.290> this<00:03:58.500> down<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:59.159> a<00:03:59.459> narrow

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
they've dropped this down to a narrow

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.750 
they've dropped this down to a narrow
road<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.750> that's<00:04:01.019> just<00:04:01.230> getting<00:04:02.190> paving

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
road and that's just getting paving

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.869 
road and that's just getting paving
equipment<00:04:03.269> up<00:04:03.330> here<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.659> a<00:04:03.690> nightmare<00:04:04.580> this<00:04:05.580> is

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
equipment up here is a nightmare this is

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.600 
equipment up here is a nightmare this is
not<00:04:06.390> easy<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.170> they're<00:04:07.650> paving<00:04:07.860> time<00:04:08.280> is

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
not easy and they're paving time is

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.070 
not easy and they're paving time is
really<00:04:08.849> sure<00:04:09.120> they<00:04:09.390> were<00:04:09.450> really<00:04:09.870> short

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
really sure they were really short

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.750 
really sure they were really short
paving<00:04:10.650> would<00:04:10.799> know<00:04:10.920> it's<00:04:11.069> a<00:04:11.190> part<00:04:11.430> of<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.579> is

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
paving would know it's a part of it is

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.819 
paving would know it's a part of it is
they<00:04:12.480> need<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.750> pave<00:04:12.989> when<00:04:13.290> it's<00:04:13.440> warm<00:04:13.680> enough

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
they need to pave when it's warm enough

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.229 
they need to pave when it's warm enough
that<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.250> payment<00:04:14.640> will<00:04:14.730> actually<00:04:15.030> have<00:04:15.120> time

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
that the payment will actually have time

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.330 
that the payment will actually have time
is<00:04:15.450> set<00:04:15.629> properly<00:04:15.870> and

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
is set properly and

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.210 
is set properly and
they<00:04:18.910> don't<00:04:19.180> have<00:04:19.870> very<00:04:20.320> long<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.829> be<00:04:20.919> able<00:04:21.010> to

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
they don't have very long to be able to

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.310 
they don't have very long to be able to
heat<00:04:21.430> up<00:04:21.459> asphalt<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.449> that<00:04:22.570> temperature<00:04:22.870> get

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
heat up asphalt to that temperature get

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.939 
heat up asphalt to that temperature get
it<00:04:23.410> down<00:04:23.620> make<00:04:24.490> sure<00:04:24.520> it's<00:04:24.850> good<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.360> then<00:04:26.199> lay

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
it down make sure it's good and then lay

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.430 
it down make sure it's good and then lay
more<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.610> so<00:04:27.940> ends<00:04:28.210> up<00:04:28.360> taking<00:04:28.570> they<00:04:28.990> laid<00:04:29.199> in

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
more and so ends up taking they laid in

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.230 
more and so ends up taking they laid in
the<00:04:29.530> road<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.740> little<00:04:29.949> bit<00:04:30.100> narrow<00:04:30.400> work<00:04:30.610> they

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
the road a little bit narrow work they

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.409 
the road a little bit narrow work they
all<00:04:31.330> do<00:04:31.510> as<00:04:31.660> much<00:04:31.840> prep<00:04:32.139> work<00:04:32.350> they

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
all do as much prep work they

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.659 
all do as much prep work they
intentionally<00:04:34.650> cut<00:04:35.650> some<00:04:35.889> corners<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.490> try

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
intentionally cut some corners to try

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:37.920 
intentionally cut some corners to try
and<00:04:36.790> make<00:04:36.880> sure<00:04:36.940> they<00:04:37.210> get<00:04:37.330> pavement<00:04:37.780> down

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
and make sure they get pavement down

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.870 
and make sure they get pavement down
before<00:04:38.800> winter<00:04:39.100> rolls<00:04:39.280> around<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:39.729> that's

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
before winter rolls around and that's

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.909 
before winter rolls around and that's
just<00:04:40.150> if<00:04:40.750> they<00:04:40.960> wanted<00:04:41.229> to<00:04:41.290> try<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:41.650> paint<00:04:41.800> it

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
just if they wanted to try and paint it

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.850 
just if they wanted to try and paint it
right<00:04:42.570> it'd<00:04:43.570> probably<00:04:43.900> take<00:04:44.110> them<00:04:44.350> 10<00:04:44.560> 20

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
right it'd probably take them 10 20

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.080 
right it'd probably take them 10 20
years<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.250> be<00:04:45.340> able<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.610> pave<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.850> whole<00:04:46.120> thing

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.270 

so<00:04:49.780> speed<00:04:50.260> limit<00:04:50.500> 30<00:04:50.680> if<00:04:50.860> you're<00:04:50.980> going<00:04:51.070> off

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
so speed limit 30 if you're going off

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.220 
so speed limit 30 if you're going off
the<00:04:51.430> cliff<00:04:51.480> speed<00:04:52.480> limit<00:04:52.750> 20<00:04:53.020> if<00:04:53.110> you're

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
the cliff speed limit 20 if you're

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.610 
the cliff speed limit 20 if you're
climbing<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:53.620> mountain<00:04:55.110> so<00:04:56.110> as<00:04:56.199> you<00:04:56.290> can<00:04:56.410> see

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
climbing the mountain so as you can see

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.350 
climbing the mountain so as you can see
the<00:04:56.770> terrain<00:04:56.949> even<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.520> little<00:04:57.790> plants<00:04:58.210> and

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
the terrain even the little plants and

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.030 
the terrain even the little plants and
stuff<00:04:58.449> like<00:04:58.690> that<00:04:58.750> there's<00:04:59.080> a<00:04:59.139> lot<00:04:59.320> less<00:04:59.650> and

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
stuff like that there's a lot less and

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.650 
stuff like that there's a lot less and
before<00:05:00.430> some<00:05:00.850> of<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.000> hills<00:05:01.180> we<00:05:01.330> were<00:05:01.419> coming

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
before some of the hills we were coming

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.510 
before some of the hills we were coming
around<00:05:01.780> we're<00:05:01.990> completely<00:05:02.290> green<00:05:02.590> not<00:05:03.280> about

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
around we're completely green not about

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.909 
around we're completely green not about
half<00:05:03.790> rocks<00:05:04.120> I<00:05:04.449> can<00:05:04.930> definitely<00:05:05.050> feel<00:05:05.470> the

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
half rocks I can definitely feel the

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.490 
half rocks I can definitely feel the
power<00:05:06.190> just<00:05:06.610> what<00:05:07.389> power<00:05:07.600> I<00:05:07.720> had<00:05:08.020> in<00:05:08.199> the<00:05:08.229> bike

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
there down to the trees it's about a

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.460 
there down to the trees it's about a
thousand<00:05:28.660> feet<00:05:28.720> something<00:05:29.110> like<00:05:29.200> that

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
thousand feet something like that

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.790 
thousand feet something like that
combustion<00:05:30.250> engine<00:05:30.639> but<00:05:30.940> they<00:05:31.180> flag<00:05:31.690> dude<00:05:32.020> on

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
combustion engine but they flag dude on

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.410 
combustion engine but they flag dude on
your<00:05:32.950> side<00:05:33.130> of<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.280> road

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.690 

this<00:05:38.020> road<00:05:38.380> ain't<00:05:38.410> big<00:05:38.950> enough<00:05:38.980> for<00:05:39.220> the<00:05:39.460> two

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
this road ain't big enough for the two

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.670 
this road ain't big enough for the two
of<00:05:39.730> us<00:05:40.060> I'm<00:05:40.690> not<00:05:40.780> gonna<00:05:40.930> be<00:05:41.110> able<00:05:41.140> to<00:05:41.380> do<00:05:41.470> it<00:05:41.500> but

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
of us I'm not gonna be able to do it but

of us I'm not gonna be able to do it but
we'll<00:05:41.830> try<00:05:41.980> it<00:05:42.040> anyway

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.200 

and<00:05:45.930> you<00:05:46.080> heard<00:05:46.350> how<00:05:46.710> much<00:05:46.950> slower<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.820> engine

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
and you heard how much slower the engine

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.030 
and you heard how much slower the engine
is<00:05:48.360> coming<00:05:48.780> to<00:05:48.840> life<00:05:49.080> when<00:05:49.320> I<00:05:49.380> climb<00:05:49.710> up<00:05:49.740> an

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
is coming to life when I climb up an

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.400 
is coming to life when I climb up an
altitude<00:05:50.400> like<00:05:50.730> this<00:05:51.030> the<00:05:51.750> air<00:05:51.930> we<00:05:52.380> are

snowflakes really thin ones but it's
probably<00:06:31.559> an<00:06:31.649> indicator<00:06:32.009> it's<00:06:32.219> going<00:06:32.399> to<00:06:32.459> get

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:32.549 
probably an indicator it's going to get

00:06:32.549 --> 00:06:37.749 
probably an indicator it's going to get
a<00:06:32.609> lot<00:06:32.789> colder<00:06:33.029> a<00:06:33.209> lot<00:06:33.419> faster<00:06:34.109> up<00:06:34.289> here<00:06:34.529> you<00:06:34.649> go
