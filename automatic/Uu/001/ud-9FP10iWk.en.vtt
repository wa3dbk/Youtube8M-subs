00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.840
 very good guys how are you here in 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.370
 a new valid video you have seen in 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.890
 screen you fine lady do a command 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.230
 I discovered that those who do not know what they are 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.630
 excusable your personalized command 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.349
 let's say with a series of modifications 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.300
 in command that we say to skip 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.160
 a lever back and he will spend 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.470
 is another lever on the sides goes lakers 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.350
 to all competitive players what 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.030
 they use in that the truth is very useful 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.880
 for those who play competitive and such 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.739
 since you have more advantage you can jump 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.840
 point at once and such 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.000
 - either a case example is worth not 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.489
 we can jump and aim with a 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.980
 the time there is at best you can but it is 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.649
 complicated you lose precision and such as 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.539
 you know here you lose a lot of precision 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.940
 because you take away the thumb of the hand 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.829
 right that we tell him this one 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.449
 move to the screen and you lose 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.409
 a lot of precision and such in that 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:08.380
 movement since you lose because it's like that 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.289
 you can not look at the cart and 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.329
 here we have one is complicated because 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.020
 you have to skip remove the purge 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:18.700
 tight I ordered twice x and you can not 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.990
 point and shoot both bullets and 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.610
 which is fine would be a little trick 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.679
 only it works on PlayStation 4 as 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.110
 have these options worth we get 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.210
 here on the ps button in settings it's worth not 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.920
 method of adjustments in accessibility voucher 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.689
 which is the end of the assignment of authors 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.090
 automatic is going to have it removed 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.819
 the sleeve back and we give it down here and the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.679
 x we're going to change it for the r3, it's worth it 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.899
 We want to play this camera will 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.459
 everything I tell the console is worth so 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.409
 to enter a game to enter the 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.420
 pisto and if Nestor everything would be with the r3 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.119
 what happens if we do not just want to use it 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.950
 for call of duty, we go and get 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:56.770
 We here to restart the letter 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.869
 match is you give to restart and I would give 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.280
 to confirm so that you are saved 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.979
 In this case it's worth it and it welcomes me 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.289
 3rd to confirm, as you see now, only 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.329
 works the r3 watch the game with the 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.319
 X and does not leave me so I was going to give 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.479
 give him r3 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.700
 and it really leaves me here 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.200
 we have one is worth so for example 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.040
 I have it against 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.360
 tactics and I bend down with the X and 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.190
 he stabbed with the circle, but if 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.989
 you have always determined and such I do not know 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.110
 at all, as I would say but more or less 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.330
 I think he slashes with the X and he 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.830
 end the circle I think yes no 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.260
 I think so because if what else is the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.420
 century valencia the trick and the advantage 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.950
 what does this have, for example, are we going to 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.620
 find us for example 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.150
 for example one but certainly not 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.010
 you will cost an hour and the first 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.569
 departure since it is quite complicated 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.849
 get used to vouchers like a school 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.200
 but let's say otherwise done let's 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.459
 let's see if we find one that I 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.160
 are shooting and something like that 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.569
 but at the moment he does not see anyone by the way 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.099
 This idea took me by a friend of mine the 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.200
 doctor channel you have a knife in the 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.200
 description for example this uncle 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.760
 For example, let's take a note 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.340
 how to aim and be good as you jump 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.650
 with the r3 the precision gains a lot 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.380
 since you do not have the joystick let's say 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.640
 to the X and such and you can now aim 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.010
 and jump at once 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.680
 motionless the joystick because it's easier 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.990
 and more comfortable and that's what a 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.220
 scoop control 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.160
 let's say it only works in playstation 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.080
 talent stations 4 since it has this 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.030
 option x you have no idea why not 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.950
 I have it and such but well this is 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.480
 get used to and have one let's say a 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.010
 tactical continuation that is that as 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.980
 where he teaches from a beginning and is 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.540
 You get used to it and we go that I recommend 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.640
 that you do it and such because it is a life 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.739
 pretty cool for example here we can 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.930
 point rotate the joystick or more 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.530
 easily the accuracy increases 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.810
 very much since you can move you can 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.940
 make millions of things more easily 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.769
 that will cost you to get used to 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.980
 a principle but good this is what 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.510
 is lost and it's like playing again in the 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.070
 call of duty yang puts you in a game 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.890
 online to try this and it has cost me 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.350
 very much because I jumped car 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.060
 mouse this as it commands that does not jump 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.010
 always with the X but good more or 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.750
 least I have it a bit dominated and it's 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.640
 used to it and so we'll see while 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.049
 so much here we have some there is already 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.549
 a few bullets apart he had a 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.430
 old is shooting well because it is what 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.650
 that this guy has for example 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.750
 although I did not kill him but you have a 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.120
 idea that you can shoot and all that to 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.389
 the time we're going to see here we have 2 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.490
 for example this guy gets on the 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.050
 it does not matter is that I am human is what 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.850
 that has but good does not matter here 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.090
 we have all this wine we kill that for 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.280
 example to this out there I'm a little 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.169
 red and I do not see him from Veronica point line 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.600
 world but that more or less you do a 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.539
 idea not so if you liked it let's say 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.850
 this mini tutorial trick of what I know 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:57.099
 that one wants to call but hey well here 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.320
 let's say look is you can aim and 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:03.969
 shoot the time and it's like easier 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:08.960
 as a shield but different 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:10.879
 and it costs you your money and such and this 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.099
 it's pretty easy as you can see it's easier 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:14.870
 aiming is easier to jump and easier 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.909
 everything so I hope you liked the 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.150
 video subscribe if you see these 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:22.150
 in the next video until next time 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.150
 goodbye
