00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
you can see here I have a basic template

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.500 
you can see here I have a basic template
for<00:00:48.120> new<00:00:48.600> pages<00:00:48.950> and<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> tutorial

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
for new pages and I have a tutorial

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.529 
for new pages and I have a tutorial
template<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:54.030> special<00:00:54.360> thing<00:00:54.510> about

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
template and the special thing about

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810 
template and the special thing about
this<00:00:54.840> tutorial<00:00:55.320> template<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.520> I've<00:00:56.610> got

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
this tutorial template is that I've got

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.220 
this tutorial template is that I've got
ahead<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.360> make<00:00:58.550> made<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.760> specialized<00:01:00.600> for

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
ahead and make made it specialized for

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.329 
ahead and make made it specialized for
flash<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.600> it's<00:01:03.600> optimized<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.619> work<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.309> that

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
flash so it's optimized to work for that

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.390 
flash so it's optimized to work for that
and<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:07.350> differs<00:01:07.860> from<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and as you can see it differs from the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.480 
and as you can see it differs from the
original<00:01:09.060> template<00:01:09.479> because<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.590> has<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.979> table

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
original template because it has a table

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.890 
original template because it has a table
with<00:01:11.610> two<00:01:11.790> columns<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.510> won<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
with two columns and it won for the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.310 
with two columns and it won for the
video<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> description<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
video and one for the description and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
video and one for the description and
this<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.470> how<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.680> looks<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> video

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
this is how that looks we have the video

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.359 
this is how that looks we have the video
here<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> description<00:01:19.530> right<00:01:19.860> over<00:01:20.130> here

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
here and the description right over here

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.200 
here and the description right over here
so<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.780> go<00:01:22.020> ahead<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.259> open<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.880> fold

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
so if we go ahead and open up this fold

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.749 
so if we go ahead and open up this fold
up<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> media<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:26.250> my<00:01:26.460> slices

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
up here the media one I have my slices

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.149 
up here the media one I have my slices
which<00:01:27.720> are<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.080> buttons<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.650> header<00:01:28.890> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
which are the buttons in the header I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.780 
which are the buttons in the header I
have<00:01:29.610> thumbnails<00:01:30.590> which<00:01:31.590> are<00:01:31.950> these<00:01:32.430> things

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
have thumbnails which are these things

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.399 
have thumbnails which are these things
right<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:33.990> i<00:01:34.020> use<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
right here and that's what i use the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.090 
right here and that's what i use the
droplets<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.189> make<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.630> am<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.049> tutorials<00:01:37.680> so

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
droplets to make and I am I tutorials so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.280 
droplets to make and I am I tutorials so
if<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.250> open<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.610> tutorials<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.840> every

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
if I open up the tutorials I have every

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.859 
if I open up the tutorials I have every
single<00:01:40.500> tutorial<00:01:41.240> separated<00:01:42.240> into<00:01:42.360> folders

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
single tutorial separated into folders

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.679 
single tutorial separated into folders
and<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.439> helps<00:01:43.829> with<00:01:44.460> when<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.479> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and that helps with when I have it to

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.850 
and that helps with when I have it to
trial<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.140> way<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.680> multiple

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
trial like this way I have multiple

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.990 
trial like this way I have multiple
files<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.430> that's<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
files to go with it so that's just to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.510 
files to go with it so that's just to
keep<00:01:51.390> everything<00:01:51.659> organized<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.100> say<00:01:53.490> I

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
keep everything organized so say I

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.709 
keep everything organized so say I
wanted<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.030> make<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.740> change<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:56.360> could<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.540> in

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
wanted to make a change I could go in

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.260 
wanted to make a change I could go in
this<00:01:57.960> into<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.590> temple<00:01:58.939> template<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.060> make

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
this into this temple template and make

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.910 
this into this temple template and make
the<00:02:00.420> change<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.170> would<00:02:01.350> apply<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the change and it would apply it to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.370 
the change and it would apply it to
every<00:02:02.250> single<00:02:02.549> page<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.810> depends<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.290> that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
every single page that depends on that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.920 
every single page that depends on that
