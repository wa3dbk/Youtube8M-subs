00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
course the date basically shows my

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.250 
course the date basically shows my
progress<00:02:33.890> since<00:02:34.760> my<00:02:35.030> skills<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:35.690> November

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
progress since my skills in November

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.280 
progress since my skills in November
will<00:02:36.799> obviously<00:02:37.549> not<00:02:37.940> be<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.269> same<00:02:38.569> as<00:02:38.840> my

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
will obviously not be the same as my

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.240 
will obviously not be the same as my
skills<00:02:39.739> now<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.420> helps<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.319> teacher<00:02:42.590> to

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
skills now so it helps the teacher to

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.000 
skills now so it helps the teacher to
see<00:02:43.519> that<00:02:43.760> you've<00:02:44.329> progressed<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.260> you've

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
see that you've progressed and you've

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.520 
see that you've progressed and you've
learned<00:02:46.250> then<00:02:46.879> I<00:02:47.090> divided<00:02:47.660> my<00:02:47.690> portfolio<00:02:48.349> in

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
learned then I divided my portfolio in

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.509 
learned then I divided my portfolio in
different<00:02:48.950> sections<00:02:49.430> still<00:02:50.359> life<00:02:50.599> with

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
different sections still life with

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.940 
different sections still life with
fruits<00:02:52.519> vegetables<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.420> flowers<00:02:54.579> portraits

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
sketches and nude art of course it's in

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.410 
sketches and nude art of course it's in
French<00:03:03.079> because<00:03:03.709> my<00:03:04.190> course<00:03:04.519> is<00:03:04.670> in<00:03:04.819> French<00:03:05.120> I

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
French because my course is in French I

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.740 
French because my course is in French I
added<00:03:06.139> two<00:03:06.380> more<00:03:06.620> sections<00:03:06.889> one<00:03:07.880> which<00:03:08.389> is

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
added two more sections one which is

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.979 
added two more sections one which is
based<00:03:09.019> on<00:03:09.349> how<00:03:10.010> we<00:03:10.069> studied<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.239> human

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
based on how we studied the human

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.309 
based on how we studied the human
anatomy<00:03:12.590> in<00:03:12.709> class<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:14.799> I<00:03:15.799> also<00:03:16.489> added<00:03:16.880> a<00:03:17.319> last

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
anatomy in class and I also added a last

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.759 
anatomy in class and I also added a last
section<00:03:19.130> called<00:03:19.639> fan<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.560> inside<00:03:21.560> I

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
section called fan and inside I

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.670 
section called fan and inside I
basically<00:03:22.280> put<00:03:22.669> all<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:23.510> additional<00:03:24.079> work

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
basically put all the additional work

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.460 
basically put all the additional work
that<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.549> did<00:03:25.609> that<00:03:26.269> doesn't<00:03:26.660> tackle<00:03:26.900> anything

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
that I did that doesn't tackle anything

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.830 
that I did that doesn't tackle anything
with<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.370> course<00:03:28.639> but<00:03:29.239> I<00:03:29.480> know<00:03:29.540> that

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
with it in the course but I know that

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.629 
with it in the course but I know that
without<00:03:30.049> this<00:03:30.380> course<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:30.919> wouldn't<00:03:31.310> have<00:03:31.370> done

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
without this course I wouldn't have done

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.190 
without this course I wouldn't have done
my<00:03:32.510> direwolf

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
my direwolf

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.569 
my direwolf
for<00:03:33.829> example<00:03:34.370> oh<00:03:34.989> my<00:03:35.989> baby<00:03:36.470> dragon<00:03:36.739> you<00:03:37.370> might

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
for example oh my baby dragon you might

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.069 
for example oh my baby dragon you might
also<00:03:37.819> have<00:03:38.120> noticed<00:03:38.359> that<00:03:38.690> I<00:03:39.019> put<00:03:39.799> tags<00:03:41.079> with

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
also have noticed that I put tags with

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.559 
also have noticed that I put tags with
each<00:03:42.380> drawing

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
each drawing

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.729 
each drawing
this<00:03:44.499> tag<00:03:45.069> shows<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:46.150> method<00:03:46.540> I<00:03:46.689> used<00:03:46.989> for<00:03:47.650> the

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
this tag shows the method I used for the

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.280 
this tag shows the method I used for the
drawing<00:03:48.010> for<00:03:48.609> example<00:03:48.999> this<00:03:49.150> one<00:03:49.420> I<00:03:49.689> used

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
drawing for example this one I used

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.970 
drawing for example this one I used
watercolor<00:03:51.239> pencils<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.659> for<00:03:53.319> this<00:03:53.499> one<00:03:53.739> I

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
watercolor pencils and for this one I

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.209 
watercolor pencils and for this one I
use<00:03:54.400> pastels<00:03:54.969> it<00:03:55.780> not<00:03:56.079> only<00:03:56.290> shows<00:03:56.469> the

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:57.219 
use pastels it not only shows the

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.270 
use pastels it not only shows the
variety<00:03:57.670> of<00:03:58.090> techniques<00:03:59.049> I<00:03:59.290> used<00:03:59.590> but<00:03:59.920> it<00:04:00.099> also

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
variety of techniques I used but it also

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.759 
variety of techniques I used but it also
helps<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.939> teacher<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.540> know<00:04:01.750> which<00:04:02.319> one<00:04:02.620> you

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
helps the teacher to know which one you

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.879 
helps the teacher to know which one you
used<00:04:03.040> exactly<00:04:03.639> and<00:04:04.030> he<00:04:04.480> can<00:04:04.659> thus<00:04:04.930> better<00:04:05.379> come

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
used exactly and he can thus better come

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.160 
used exactly and he can thus better come
to<00:04:06.099> a<00:04:06.129> conclusion<00:04:06.609> concerning<00:04:07.090> your<00:04:07.540> work<00:04:07.780> and

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
by the way I also put in the awakening

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.199 
by the way I also put in the awakening
