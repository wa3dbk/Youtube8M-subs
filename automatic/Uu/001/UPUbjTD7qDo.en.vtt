00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.430
 American football has established itself 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.660
 France in the early 80s after 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.950
 have spent many years in 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.750
 ignorance gives it has changed 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.730
 this sport really starts to do 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.150
 talk about him and attracts more and more 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.259
 people 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.139
 there are signs that show that 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.430
 actually the audience responds more or 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.230
 less present than there is an expectation 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.869
 behind there are clubs that are in 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.160
 development that there are big cons 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.320
 work that is done at the club level 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.310
 on communication 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 so here it is there is a feeling that there is a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.970
 kind of emulation in the middle and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.970
 this is it 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.480
 in pessac anyway where I play it's 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.129
 in the process of becoming popular since 4,5 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.930
 in progress - since I've been there and everything 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.370
 I really saw evolution because 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.230
 that clubs I think they do some 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.449
 demons the gait of you to show yourself to 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.620
 more and more and going towards the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.940
 legs is necessarily it's a sport 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.829
 what pleasure is a sport show so 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.300
 there are many people who I like to see 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.039
 this and every year the federation 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.750
 french football the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.680
 find they're counting more and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.240
 more licensees 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.210
 there were only four thousand 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.530
 enthusiasts in 98 since this figure has 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.140
 stopped increasing 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.060
 twelve thousand in 2005 sixteen thousand in 2009 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.580
 and more than 22 thousand today 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.990
 so how do you explain this phenomenon 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.409
 there are several strategies there really are 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.610
 had all this work around around 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.280
 of the opening of young practices 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.190
 because the junior practice has been 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.470
 was opened that the late 80s 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.190
 and then we opened the practice that 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.630
 90 saf saf currents and a call a 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.909
 call for air at the level of the federation 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.590
 and its increase the number of licensees 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.970
 as everyone can see it's 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.200
 more and more mediatized there is the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.770
 super bowl that starts to post on 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.330
 national chains 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.009
 so I think there is a good 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.899
 evolution compared to five years ago 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.119
 ten years ago that I knew and 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.340
 I hope in any case 6.5 10 years that 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.530
 it will be really good to use it as 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.090
 basketball or handball and 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.770
 the increase of these football matches 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.300
 american on television is a big 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.460
 opportunity for a confidential sport 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.220
 like this one we need to 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.080
 profit that is to say that at the end of 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.340
 account that it's because people 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.890
 they asked either because the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.120
 strings asked the final point done 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.480
 there are crazy football anymore 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.200
 American very well perfect falcon 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.720
 bounced on 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.160
 apart from a few exceptions only the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.290
 US Championship is of interest to 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.610
 chains yet initiatives do not 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.290
 are missing from the side of French clubs 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.690
 now there are a lot of clubs that 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.570
 broadcast the match via live internet 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.790
 going through these vectors there that are 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.760
 vectors used by the population 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.019
 the youngest I think we are going we will 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.610
 to make known more and more 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.010
 also use all these vectors there the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.120
 institutional sites on which we have 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.739
 put energy 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.480
 that's good because that's a problem 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.860
 federation but to fetch 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.540
 new licensees and especially his 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.980
 young people have to go through 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.110
 social networks at European level 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.180
 the national team and vice champion 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.950
 of Europe at the championship level 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.959
 France remains in the top 3 behind 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.549
 germany and austria or the 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.230
 difference is that we are a bit braked 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.940
 by the rugby 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.040
 germany austria there is not 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.540
 all of rugby so the players who have 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.760
 want to go on a collective sport 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.930
 outside and contacts so 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.299
 necessarily goes the American football 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.860
 and then they have ways a little bit 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.060
 superior to ours who are celebrating their 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.519
 championship is a bit more attractive 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.470
 but continuing to develop the 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.420
 number of licensees the structuring of 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.480
 clubs and then the organization 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.069
 I think we can yes someday 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.200
 at this level there if really all 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.790
 clubs it's investing in 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.659
 Youth training or in 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.370
 seniors' training 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.750
 I really think that France is 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.610
 can expect a good European level 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.980
 to reach this desired level is 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.200
 returned to the French sports landscape 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.590
 there is still halfway to 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.590
