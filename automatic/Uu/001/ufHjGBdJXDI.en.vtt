it's<00:01:24.570> better<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.960> go<00:01:25.080> straight<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:25.500> month<00:01:25.770> 18

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
it's better to go straight from month 18

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.760 
it's better to go straight from month 18
to<00:01:26.460> 20<00:01:26.970> you've<00:01:27.900> got<00:01:28.049> more<00:01:28.229> chance<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.619> actually

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
to 20 you've got more chance of actually

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.660 
to 20 you've got more chance of actually
seeing<00:01:29.100> something<00:01:29.700> change<00:01:30.860> but<00:01:31.860> let's<00:01:32.400> get

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
seeing something change but let's get

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.039 
seeing something change but let's get
right<00:01:32.850> into<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.799> move<00:01:35.009> over<00:01:35.310> here

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
right into it so if I move over here

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.590 
right into it so if I move over here
what<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.140> will<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.400> comparison<00:01:39.180> of

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
what we will do is have a comparison of

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.460 
what we will do is have a comparison of
month<00:01:39.840> 18<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.770> here<00:01:41.299> some<00:01:42.299> advice<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:43.049> are<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
month 18 up here some advice on are you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.190 
month 18 up here some advice on are you
just<00:01:43.740> saying<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.990> just

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
just saying you can see so if I just

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.320 
just saying you can see so if I just
bring<00:01:46.350> everything<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.009> friends

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
bring everything to the friends

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.640 
bring everything to the friends
so<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.230> the<00:01:49.770> front<00:01:51.080> with<00:01:52.080> my<00:01:52.230> fringe

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
so this is the front with my fringe

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.330 
so this is the front with my fringe
obviously<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.400> searching<00:01:53.730> much<00:01:53.910> in<00:01:55.340> these

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
obviously it's searching much in these

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.040 
obviously it's searching much in these
bits<00:01:56.880> are<00:01:58.580> here<00:02:00.020> my<00:02:01.020> collarbone<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:03.050> so

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
bits are here my collarbone is here so

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.430 
bits are here my collarbone is here so
maybe<00:02:04.710> an<00:02:05.010> inch<00:02:05.270> they're<00:02:06.270> all<00:02:06.600> there<00:02:06.780> abouts

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
maybe an inch they're all there abouts

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:20.650 
maybe an inch they're all there abouts
and<00:02:08.010> if<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.520> turn<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.390> side

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:32.350 

and<00:02:22.880> then<00:02:23.880> finally<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.960> other<00:02:25.320> side

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.670 

so<00:02:33.360> remember<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.900> don't<00:02:33.989> get<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.439> see<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
so remember I don't get to see the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.130 
so remember I don't get to see the
comparison<00:02:34.950> until<00:02:35.579> I<00:02:35.760> edit<00:02:36.269> but<00:02:36.750> what<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.930> will

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
comparison until I edit but what I will

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.509 
comparison until I edit but what I will
