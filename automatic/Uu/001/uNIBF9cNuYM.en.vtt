 Forest flowers. It only seems to us that the forests are growing 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:43.579
 only trees. Actually growing there 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:02:21.440
 a huge number of flowers that cover the ground 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:03:06.130
 blue, white and yellow "carpet". It happens that you go among 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.130
 the forest and suddenly you fall into an amazing glade, 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.130
 on which grow bells, chamomile, St. John's wort, cornflower 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.130
 and many others. Forest flowers are different 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.130
 the fact that they require special living conditions. In the wild 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.130
 nature, they are protected by trees, they are not 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.860
 scorching sun, they are not subject to strong winds. Forest 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.860
 flowers also like shadow very much, in periods of cold 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.860
 they do not freeze due to the fact that they are covered by the fallen 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.860
 foliage. Recently, designers have been trying to introduce 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.860
 forest flowers in the design of urban and park flower beds. 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.860
 Not every plant takes root in such conditions, and all 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.860
 the same species quietly moved from the forests to the cities, the great 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.860
 lots of. Most often in the cities can be found 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.860
 the bell, the forest geranium, and the wolfberry aster in general 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.860
 Considered the progenitor of most modern colors of the family 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.860
 Astrov. This is due to the fact that many forest flowers 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.860
 so good that you can admire for a very long time 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.260
 by them. It's amazing that nobody waters them, weeds them. 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.940
 and generally does not care for them, but they are fine 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.060
 grow by themselves. Moreover, almost any forest flower can 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.290
 compete in beauty with indoor or garden 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.290
 flowers.
