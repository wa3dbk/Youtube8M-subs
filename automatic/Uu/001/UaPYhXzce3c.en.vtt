00:00:09.104 --> 00:00:15.980
Hi kids..er..gamers and welcome to "Le fond de l'Affaire".

00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:20.682
The show who will gradually turn you into a true gentleman.

00:00:20.765 --> 00:00:24.409
er...into a true cultured geek.

00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:30.401
Today I would like to start with all the secrets of...

00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:33.250
The Legend of Zelda

00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:35.954
Ha...What a cute boy this Zelda.

00:00:36.563 --> 00:00:39.222
Zelda is not the game's hero

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:40.725
His name is Link.

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.678
Zelda is the princess's nam...

00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:43.500
Whatever !

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.076
You're not introducing me ?

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.814
Nope !

00:00:50.228 --> 00:00:51.895
Ze leuguend of Zelda

00:00:51.898 --> 00:00:53.602
The legend of Zelda

00:00:54.058 --> 00:00:57.570
The saga was created around the 80's somewere

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.529
In the time of disco and...

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:04.901
The 21st February 1986 in Japan on Famicom Disk System

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.789
Then in 1987 on NES

00:01:08.794 --> 00:01:13.783
The title of the saga was inspired by the name of Francis Scott Fitzgerald's wife

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.241
The author of the Great Gatsby.

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:20.242
For sige...Shigegu...Sigi...

00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:21.556
Shigeru Miyamoto

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.687
The game creator

00:01:24.227 --> 00:01:27.027
this name was meaningful and sounds great

00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:33.944
The saga was inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto's childhood

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.175
Indeed, he enjoyed to go to adventure on forests around his house in Kyoto

00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:42.649
armed with an arc, a slingshot or something else.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.887
During interwiews, Shigeru Miyamoto tells us his better child adventure.

00:01:50.216 --> 00:01:53.119
The discovery of a cave.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.568
He was scared but he take a lantern and go into the cave.

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.375
This story even if it was 20 years earlier was an inspiration for the game.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.111
Me, one day, when i was a kid,

00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:09.775
I fell into a well,

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.552
Ha...I was forced to eat rocks to survive.

00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:17.170
And, this is only after two hours that...

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.477
i could get out of there.

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:24.776
This wasn't the only influence.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:30.027
Indeed, Peter Pan was a model to create Link,

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:34.598
The commonalities aren't just the green dress and the stupid hat.

00:02:34.598 --> 00:02:37.666
Peter pan is playing flute,

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:40.157
he has a fairy as a friend,

00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:42.010
he fight is shadow,

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.528
and his adopted people never get older.

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:47.529
Like kokiries.

00:02:47.627 --> 00:02:50.654
All of that but also the fact they're both dress like a big fa...

00:02:50.724 --> 00:02:53.536
At begining, the game was named "Adventure".

00:02:53.537 --> 00:02:57.285
Players had to create their own levels and chalenge their friends.

00:02:57.574 --> 00:03:00.721
Finally they found it was boring to build dungeons,

00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:02.627
and it was way more fun to play with them.

00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:06.738
Anyway, me, that touch one of my balls but the other stay static.

00:03:08.068 --> 00:03:09.616
At the begining of the development,

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:15.992
The Ledgend of Zelda was supposed to happend on a fantastic medieval past,

00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:19.707
and also in a sci-fi future.

00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:26.321
The Triforce was an electonic device with whom you can time travel.

00:03:26.725 --> 00:03:33.578
The hero did the link into thoose two times.

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.072
This is why he was called Link.

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:41.565
The game was developped at the same time of Super Mario Bros, and by the same team.

00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:44.029
This explain the commonalities.

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:48.553
like the teleportation flute you can also find on Super Mario Bros 3.

00:03:48.554 --> 00:03:53.729
The Legend of Zelda was created to be the opposed of Super Mario Bros.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.303
Mario is on side view, and this is a scoring and a platform game.

00:03:57.304 --> 00:04:02.859
For Zelda, they choose a top view and this is more a reflexion game with a scenario.

00:04:03.046 --> 00:04:07.932
Mario and Zelda met again on the development of Zelda Ocarina of Time on Nintendo 64.

00:04:07.933 --> 00:04:12.993
Who was supposed to be, because of the technical limitations, build like Mario 64

00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:13.994
around a castle

00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:14.995
ganondorf's one

00:04:14.996 --> 00:04:19.466
In whom you go through levels, thanks to pictures.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.974
The fight against Ganondorf's ghost is a vestige of this concept.

00:04:25.762 --> 00:04:32.280
This opus was originally an FPS before they choose to keep that idea only for the arc.

00:04:32.694 --> 00:04:39.920
Indeed Shigeru Miyamoto wanted us to see the change between child-link and adult-link.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:44.458
He also want players to see Link because he said :

00:04:44.454 --> 00:04:46.203
"He is so cool"

00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:53.681
At begining A link to the past was based on a team of heroes with complementary powers.

00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:59.146
The team was constitute by a warior elf, a mage, and a girl.

00:04:59.852 --> 00:05:08.298
What a team... A warior with dress of dance,
an old man who trembles and throw sparkles,
and a chick.

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:12.234
That "Chick" as you said was supposed to be a fairy.

00:05:15.843 --> 00:05:18.724
She can't stop to cut me off. It really pisses me off...

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:27.998
Well that's over, stay tuned and keep to surf on the net.

00:05:29.892 --> 00:05:31.131
Is it OK? Can i go?

00:05:31.132 --> 00:05:32.132
OK

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:36.024
I can tell you she will not stay too much this little bitc..

00:05:36.025 --> 00:05:37.875
