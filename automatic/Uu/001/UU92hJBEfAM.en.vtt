than<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.769> traditional<00:03:36.950> approach<00:03:37.549> let's<00:03:38.209> look

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
than a traditional approach let's look

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.699 
than a traditional approach let's look
at<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.510> back<00:03:38.630> wheels<00:03:38.840> here<00:03:39.079> a<00:03:39.109> minute<00:03:39.290> where

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
at the back wheels here a minute where

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:40.870 
at the back wheels here a minute where
we're<00:03:39.859> seeing<00:03:40.010> them<00:03:40.250> turn<00:03:40.430> around<00:03:40.730> I<00:03:40.819> don't

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
we're seeing them turn around I don't

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.309 
we're seeing them turn around I don't
know<00:03:41.060> if<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.269> audience<00:03:41.630> can<00:03:41.780> tell<00:03:41.989> from<00:03:42.139> the

know if the audience can tell from the
camera<00:03:42.650> angle<00:03:42.859> but<00:03:43.489> they're<00:03:43.730> steering<00:03:44.209> so

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
camera angle but they're steering so

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.640 
camera angle but they're steering so
let's<00:03:44.780> go<00:03:44.900> look<00:03:45.019> at<00:03:45.109> the<00:03:45.230> trunk<00:03:45.500> because

let's go look at the trunk because

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.170 
let's go look at the trunk because
there's<00:03:45.919> a<00:03:45.980> steering<00:03:46.519> rack<00:03:46.730> there<00:03:46.970> where<00:03:47.120> you

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
there's a steering rack there where you

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.420 
there's a steering rack there where you
can<00:03:47.209> see<00:03:47.480> it<00:03:47.569> more<00:03:47.780> easily<00:03:48.019> this<00:03:48.560> has<00:03:48.769> got<00:03:49.069> four

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
can see it more easily this has got four

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.449 
can see it more easily this has got four
wheel<00:03:49.609> steer<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.299> what<00:03:51.049> it<00:03:51.169> does<00:03:51.349> is<00:03:51.829> every

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
wheel steer and what it does is every

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.750 
wheel steer and what it does is every

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
wheel steers every wheel drives and

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.809 
wheel steers every wheel drives and
every<00:03:56.599> wheel<00:03:56.810> is<00:03:57.139> controlled<00:03:57.620> by<00:03:57.829> our<00:03:57.980> fastest

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
every wheel is controlled by our fastest

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
suspension system and as you point it

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.920 
suspension system and as you point it
out<00:04:03.019> that's<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.709> motor<00:04:04.190> there<00:04:04.489> that<00:04:04.760> actually

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
out that's a motor there that actually

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.990 
out that's a motor there that actually
activates<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.109> rear<00:04:06.319> tow<00:04:06.650> links<00:04:07.010> in<00:04:07.160> in

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
activates the rear tow links in in

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.150 
activates the rear tow links in in
parking<00:04:08.569> lot<00:04:08.720> maneuvers<00:04:09.230> it<00:04:09.530> allows<00:04:09.889> the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
parking lot maneuvers it allows the

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.490 
parking lot maneuvers it allows the
vehicle<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.730> act<00:04:11.389> like<00:04:11.599> a<00:04:11.630> much<00:04:11.840> smaller<00:04:12.079> car

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
vehicle to act like a much smaller car

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.909 
vehicle to act like a much smaller car
and<00:04:13.160> it<00:04:13.340> has<00:04:13.489> a<00:04:13.750> 37-foot<00:04:14.750> turning<00:04:15.139> circle<00:04:15.530> so

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
and it has a 37-foot turning circle so

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.830 
and it has a 37-foot turning circle so
even<00:04:16.310> though<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.609> wheelbase<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.389> eight

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
even though the wheelbase is eight

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.560 
even though the wheelbase is eight
inches<00:04:18.079> longer<00:04:18.530> than<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.889> CTS<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:20.120> has<00:04:20.359> the

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
inches longer than a CTS it has the

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.719 
inches longer than a CTS it has the
exact<00:04:21.019> same<00:04:21.109> turning<00:04:21.709> circle<00:04:22.010> diameter<00:04:22.159> and

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
exact same turning circle diameter and

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.790 
exact same turning circle diameter and
so<00:04:23.330> there's<00:04:23.750> three<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.110> a<00:04:24.140> half<00:04:24.200> degrees<00:04:24.440> of

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
so there's three and a half degrees of

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.620 
so there's three and a half degrees of
steer<00:04:25.039> at<00:04:25.159> the<00:04:25.280> rear<00:04:25.460> wheels

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
steer at the rear wheels

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.440 
steer at the rear wheels
parking<00:04:27.350> lot<00:04:27.380> speeds<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:28.460> turns<00:04:28.730> out<00:04:29.060> of

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
parking lot speeds and it turns out of

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.170 
parking lot speeds and it turns out of
phase<00:04:29.690> at<00:04:30.170> high<00:04:31.100> speed<00:04:31.430> going<00:04:31.700> down<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.060> road

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
phase at high speed going down the road

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.360 
phase at high speed going down the road
60<00:04:32.630> miles<00:04:32.840> an<00:04:32.990> hour<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:33.410> above<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:34.160> wheel

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
60 miles an hour and above the wheel

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.700 
60 miles an hour and above the wheel
rear<00:04:34.760> wheels<00:04:34.940> turn<00:04:35.300> in<00:04:35.630> phase<00:04:35.960> and<00:04:36.320> what<00:04:36.530> that

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
rear wheels turn in phase and what that

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.460 
rear wheels turn in phase and what that
does<00:04:36.920> is<00:04:36.980> it<00:04:37.310> allows<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.910> vehicle<00:04:38.030> to

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
does is it allows the vehicle to

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.020 
does is it allows the vehicle to
transition<00:04:39.470> more<00:04:39.890> slowly<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.700> more

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
transition more slowly and more

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.300 
transition more slowly and more
comfortably<00:04:41.540> between<00:04:42.020> lanes<00:04:42.320> with<00:04:43.160> the

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
comfortably between lanes with the

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.420 
comfortably between lanes with the
in-phase<00:04:43.910> steering<00:04:44.540> and<00:04:44.750> so<00:04:45.110> it<00:04:45.650> really<00:04:45.680> works

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
in-phase steering and so it really works

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.660 
in-phase steering and so it really works
well<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:47.260> it<00:04:48.260> just<00:04:48.800> makes<00:04:49.010> it<00:04:49.160> that<00:04:49.220> much<00:04:49.610> more

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
well and it just makes it that much more

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.210 
well and it just makes it that much more
enjoyable<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.630> engaging<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:51.260> drive<00:04:51.500> David

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
enjoyable and engaging to drive David

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.410 
enjoyable and engaging to drive David
