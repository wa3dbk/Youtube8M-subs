00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:03.049 
okay so here's that thing that i created

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.320 
okay so here's that thing that i created
the<00:00:04.049> big<00:00:04.350> color<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.950> if<00:00:05.609> you<00:00:05.730> go<00:00:05.910> over<00:00:06.089> here

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
the big color and if you go over here

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.030 
the big color and if you go over here
and<00:00:06.390> if<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.020> just<00:00:07.410> right-click<00:00:07.859> and

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
duplicate that layer over to the other

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.820 
duplicate that layer over to the other
baked<00:00:11.849> occ<00:00:12.389> you'll<00:00:13.170> get<00:00:13.380> something<00:00:13.620> that

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
baked occ you'll get something that

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.179 
baked occ you'll get something that
looks<00:00:13.889> like<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:17.600> and<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.350> set<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:19.890> to

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
looks like this and you can set this to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.060 
looks like this and you can set this to
many<00:00:21.000> different<00:00:21.270> features<00:00:21.779> like<00:00:22.080> if<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.800> set

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
many different features like if you set

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.120 
many different features like if you set
to<00:00:23.490> normal<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.350> you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.529> change<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.039> opacity

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
to normal and you can change the opacity

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.700 
to normal and you can change the opacity
down<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.390> bit<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.930> tip<00:00:28.230> back<00:00:28.500> your

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
down a little bit you can tip back your

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.270 
down a little bit you can tip back your
parts<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.490> that's<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.119> nice<00:00:30.269> thing<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.689> do

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.010 

you<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.430> set<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.820> different<00:00:36.149> levels<00:00:36.360> so

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
you can set it on different levels so

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.970 
you can set it on different levels so
right<00:00:37.260> now<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.250> at

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.600 

a<00:00:46.809> few<00:00:47.809> levels<00:00:48.050> down<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:48.860> if<00:00:48.980> I<00:00:49.070> can<00:00:49.280> go<00:00:49.430> like

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
a few levels down so if I can go like

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.619 
a few levels down so if I can go like
this<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:54.340> I<00:00:55.340> can<00:00:55.489> set<00:00:55.699> it<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:56.000> higher<00:00:56.360> value

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
this and I can set it to a higher value

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.900 
this and I can set it to a higher value
like<00:00:57.050> linear<00:00:57.410> dodge<00:00:57.620> ad<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.220> you<00:00:58.610> can<00:00:58.760> see

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
like linear dodge ad and you can see

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.840 
like linear dodge ad and you can see
what<00:00:59.150> that<00:00:59.300> did<00:00:59.540> is<00:00:59.690> it<00:01:00.680> kept<00:01:01.010> all<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.309> detail

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
what that did is it kept all the detail

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.479 
what that did is it kept all the detail
in<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.180> model<00:01:02.540> and<00:01:02.660> then<00:01:03.470> just<00:01:03.920> add<00:01:04.160> it<00:01:04.190> a

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
in the model and then just add it a

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.690 
in the model and then just add it a
little<00:01:04.670> bit<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:05.180> extra<00:01:06.140> brightness<00:01:06.700> you're

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
little bit of extra brightness you're

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.580 
little bit of extra brightness you're
going<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:07.910> be<00:01:07.970> very<00:01:08.119> careful<00:01:08.690> where<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:09.380> add

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
going to be very careful where you add

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.450 
going to be very careful where you add
this<00:01:09.830> at<00:01:10.070> because<00:01:10.610> certain<00:01:11.450> things<00:01:11.660> will<00:01:11.840> pop

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
this at because certain things will pop

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.740 
this at because certain things will pop
like<00:01:13.460> this<00:01:13.940> for<00:01:14.210> example<00:01:14.330> this<00:01:15.259> is<00:01:15.320> now<00:01:15.700> very

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
like this for example this is now very

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.650 
like this for example this is now very
popping<00:01:17.750> out<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.880> this<00:01:19.880> exposure<00:01:20.360> ratio<00:01:21.550> so

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
popping out the this exposure ratio so

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.730 
popping out the this exposure ratio so
you<00:01:23.660> know<00:01:23.780> it's<00:01:23.960> all<00:01:24.140> depends<00:01:24.500> where<00:01:24.649> you're

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
you know it's all depends where you're

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.719 
you know it's all depends where you're
going<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:24.950> put<00:01:25.160> this<00:01:26.380> but<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.500> is<00:01:27.649> very<00:01:27.729> handy

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
going to put this but it is very handy

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.580 
going to put this but it is very handy
the<00:01:29.270> fact<00:01:29.509> that<00:01:29.630> you<00:01:29.780> can<00:01:29.930> colorize<00:01:30.259> your

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
the fact that you can colorize your

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.010 
the fact that you can colorize your
parts<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.979> little<00:01:31.039> bit<00:01:31.539> looks<00:01:32.539> like<00:01:32.750> mine

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
parts a little bit looks like mine

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.240 
parts a little bit looks like mine
hopped<00:01:33.470> into<00:01:33.920> something

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.370 

there<00:01:40.880> is

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.440 

so<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.549> got<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.790> mess<00:01:45.939> around<00:01:46.090> with<00:01:46.299> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
so you got to mess around with the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.490 
so you got to mess around with the
opacity<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:47.170> gotta<00:01:47.380> mess<00:01:47.590> around<00:01:47.860> with<00:01:48.219> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
opacity you gotta mess around with the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.980 
opacity you gotta mess around with the
what<00:01:50.500> you're<00:01:50.649> going<00:01:50.829> to<00:01:50.890> add<00:01:51.070> it<00:01:51.340> as<00:01:51.579> but<00:01:52.570> the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
what you're going to add it as but the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.740 
what you're going to add it as but the
the<00:01:53.350> idea<00:01:53.680> behind<00:01:53.829> that<00:01:54.070> map<00:01:54.369> is<00:01:54.610> to<00:01:55.119> tip<00:01:55.420> back

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
the idea behind that map is to tip back

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.850 
the idea behind that map is to tip back
your<00:01:55.960> parts<00:01:58.079> another<00:01:59.079> thing<00:01:59.259> you<00:01:59.350> can<00:01:59.500> do<00:01:59.679> with

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
your parts another thing you can do with

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.039 
your parts another thing you can do with
it<00:02:00.039> so<00:02:00.970> I'm<00:02:01.060> going<00:02:01.119> to<00:02:01.270> make<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.420> duplicate<00:02:01.689> of

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
it so I'm going to make a duplicate of

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.600 
it so I'm going to make a duplicate of
it<00:02:04.200> notice<00:02:05.200> by<00:02:05.319> making<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.649> duplicate<00:02:06.130> of<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.460> it

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
it notice by making a duplicate of it it

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.020 
it notice by making a duplicate of it it
just<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.990> just<00:02:08.050> added<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:09.039> little<00:02:09.429> bit<00:02:09.610> more<00:02:09.789> to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
just it just added a little bit more to

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.650 
just it just added a little bit more to
it<00:02:10.230> also<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.830> can<00:02:11.860> go<00:02:12.250> image<00:02:12.790> adjustments

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
it also you can go image adjustments

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.930 
it also you can go image adjustments
exposure<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.640> use<00:02:15.640> this<00:02:15.819> as<00:02:16.060> an<00:02:16.239> exposure<00:02:17.940> to

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
exposure and use this as an exposure to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.820 
exposure and use this as an exposure to
brighten<00:02:19.269> up<00:02:19.330> your<00:02:19.390> parts

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.670 

very<00:02:27.460> good<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.810> what<00:02:28.960> we're<00:02:29.080> going<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.290> do<00:02:29.410> here

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
very good so what we're going to do here

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.260 
very good so what we're going to do here
is<00:02:29.710> kind<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.250> play<00:02:30.460> around<00:02:30.490> with<00:02:30.850> these<00:02:30.970> layers

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
is kind of play around with these layers

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.570 
is kind of play around with these layers
a<00:02:31.360> little<00:02:31.720> bit<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.140> see<00:02:32.440> what<00:02:32.800> we<00:02:32.920> can<00:02:33.130> do<00:02:33.340> to

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
a little bit and see what we can do to

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.350 
a little bit and see what we can do to
add<00:02:33.850> subtract<00:02:34.600> out<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.990> little<00:02:35.470> bit<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:36.580> color

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
add subtract out a little bit of color

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.350 
add subtract out a little bit of color
but<00:02:37.660> let's<00:02:38.440> look<00:02:38.620> at<00:02:38.800> what<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.370> looking

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
but let's look at what this is looking

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.290 
but let's look at what this is looking
like<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.750> Maya<00:02:41.080> first<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.790> I'm<00:02:42.880> going<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:43.090> save

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
like in Maya first so I'm going to save

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:57.770 
like in Maya first so I'm going to save
this<00:02:43.510> out<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.650> go<00:02:47.860> back<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.310> Maya

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.410 

and<00:02:58.110> now<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.069> whole<00:02:59.490> bunch<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.970> textures

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
and now I have a whole bunch of textures

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.449 
and now I have a whole bunch of textures
out<00:03:00.630> here<00:03:00.870> or<00:03:01.020> materials<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.860> i<00:03:01.890> don't<00:03:02.220> want

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
out here or materials that i don't want

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.000 
out here or materials that i don't want
and<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.790> can<00:03:03.090> show<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.660> little<00:03:04.010> misty

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
and I can show you this little misty

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.530 
and I can show you this little misty
trick<00:03:06.860> first<00:03:07.860> off<00:03:08.100> what<00:03:09.000> I'm<00:03:09.090> going<00:03:09.240> to<00:03:09.270> do<00:03:09.390> is

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
trick first off what I'm going to do is

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.160 
trick first off what I'm going to do is
make<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> new<00:03:10.080> Lambert<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:11.690> that<00:03:12.690> Lambert<00:03:13.080> is

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
make a new Lambert and that Lambert is

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.070 
make a new Lambert and that Lambert is
going<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.350> be<00:03:13.440> called<00:03:13.650> gun<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.720> got<00:03:15.959> to

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
going to be called gun so I got to

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.350 
going to be called gun so I got to
condense<00:03:16.319> all<00:03:16.560> these<00:03:16.770> down<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.190> one<00:03:17.520> texture

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
condense all these down to one texture

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.449 
condense all these down to one texture
that's<00:03:18.690> clean<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:21.390> Lambert<00:03:21.660> 12<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.560> now<00:03:23.280> going

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
that's clean so Lambert 12 is now going

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:31.470 
that's clean so Lambert 12 is now going
to<00:03:23.520> be<00:03:23.580> gun

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.380 

and<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:32.200> can<00:03:32.409> get<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:32.680> texture<00:03:33.129> here<00:03:36.390> middle

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
and I can get that texture here middle

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.970 
and I can get that texture here middle
mouse<00:03:37.510> button<00:03:37.540> click<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.110> drag<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.409> down<00:03:38.590> to

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
mouse button click and drag it down to

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.170 
mouse button click and drag it down to
gun<00:03:39.370> at<00:03:39.790> color<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:43.440> then<00:03:44.440> assign<00:03:44.890> gone<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:46.060> the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
gun at color and then assign gone to the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:56.020 
gun at color and then assign gone to the
gun

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.630 

very<00:03:56.690> cool<00:03:58.209> all<00:03:59.209> right<00:03:59.390> now<00:04:00.280> what<00:04:01.280> I<00:04:01.310> can<00:04:01.520> do

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
very cool all right now what I can do

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.550 
very cool all right now what I can do
here<00:04:01.880> is<00:04:02.090> optimize<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.140> scene<00:04:03.350> size<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:06.380> what

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
here is optimize the scene size and what

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.620 
here is optimize the scene size and what
that'll<00:04:06.800> do<00:04:07.069> is<00:04:07.100> get<00:04:07.610> rid<00:04:07.640> of<00:04:07.850> any<00:04:08.090> unwanted

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
that'll do is get rid of any unwanted

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.809 
that'll do is get rid of any unwanted
materials<00:04:09.410> that<00:04:09.680> i'm<00:04:09.800> not<00:04:09.980> using<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:10.640> now<00:04:10.760> I

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
materials that i'm not using so now I

materials that i'm not using so now I
only<00:04:11.030> have<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.330> globe<00:04:11.569> in<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.840> lambert

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
only have the globe in the lambert

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.380 
only have the globe in the lambert
that's<00:04:12.440> a<00:04:12.590> really<00:04:13.430> awesome<00:04:13.580> truck<00:04:14.030> because

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
on you a little bit of a seam right here

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.430 
on you a little bit of a seam right here
it's<00:04:22.610> nothing<00:04:22.910> we<00:04:23.120> can't<00:04:23.150> repair<00:04:23.720> in<00:04:24.080> fact<00:04:24.290> it

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440

to<00:04:26.090> do<00:04:26.270> that<00:04:26.300> in<00:04:28.419> UV<00:04:29.419> texture<00:04:29.720> editor<00:04:29.810> we<00:04:30.470> can

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
to do that in UV texture editor we can

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.159 
to do that in UV texture editor we can
hunt<00:04:30.860> down<00:04:30.919> that<00:04:31.070> seam<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:35.450> you<00:04:35.600> can<00:04:35.750> see<00:04:35.930> it's

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
hunt down that seam and you can see it's

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.580 
hunt down that seam and you can see it's
in<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:36.830> general<00:04:37.220> area<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:38.630> i<00:04:38.660> can<00:04:38.900> go<00:04:39.020> images

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
in this general area so i can go images

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.640 
in this general area so i can go images
display<00:04:40.250> images<00:04:40.700> and<00:04:41.450> you<00:04:41.480> can<00:04:41.750> see<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:42.140> for

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
display images and you can see that for

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.740 
display images and you can see that for
some<00:04:42.860> odd<00:04:43.010> reason<00:04:43.040> it<00:04:43.640> didn't<00:04:44.180> go<00:04:44.270> clean<00:04:44.570> to

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
some odd reason it didn't go clean to

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.150 
some odd reason it didn't go clean to
the<00:04:44.780> edge<00:04:45.190> well<00:04:46.240> that's<00:04:47.240> no<00:04:47.510> big<00:04:47.690> deal<00:04:47.870> i<00:04:48.160> can

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
the edge well that's no big deal i can

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.640 
the edge well that's no big deal i can
just<00:04:49.310> grab<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.940> UVs<00:04:50.390> in<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.870> area<00:04:51.200> that<00:04:51.470> are

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
just grab the UVs in the area that are

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.610 
just grab the UVs in the area that are
affected<00:04:52.310> by<00:04:52.340> that<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:53.360> i<00:04:53.900> can<00:04:54.080> use<00:04:54.290> the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
affected by that and i can use the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:03.270 
affected by that and i can use the
scooch<00:04:55.070> tool

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.970 

okay<00:05:03.880> be<00:05:04.360> on<00:05:04.510> the<00:05:04.660> keyboard<00:05:05.110> allows<00:05:05.440> me<00:05:05.740> to

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
okay be on the keyboard allows me to

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.700 
okay be on the keyboard allows me to
resize<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.790> brush<00:05:07.000> I<00:05:07.270> can<00:05:07.870> just<00:05:08.050> scoop<00:05:08.440> these

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
resize the brush I can just scoop these

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:17.240 
resize the brush I can just scoop these
uvz<00:05:09.250> and<00:05:09.580> just<00:05:09.880> a<00:05:10.000> little<00:05:10.210> bit<00:05:14.940> there<00:05:15.940> we<00:05:16.030> go

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
uvz and just a little bit there we go

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:25.810 
uvz and just a little bit there we go
you<00:05:18.250> can<00:05:18.400> see<00:05:18.550> that<00:05:18.580> repaired<00:05:19.150> that<00:05:19.210> seemed

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.490 

so<00:05:26.420> anytime<00:05:26.750> you<00:05:26.870> see<00:05:27.080> a<00:05:27.110> seam<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:29.330> it<00:05:30.290> seems

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
so anytime you see a seam and it seems

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.320 
so anytime you see a seam and it seems
magically<00:05:31.100> appear<00:05:31.460> out<00:05:31.610> of<00:05:31.640> nowhere<00:05:31.790> because

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
magically appear out of nowhere because

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.280 
magically appear out of nowhere because
of<00:05:32.720> the<00:05:33.310> layer<00:05:34.720> stuff<00:05:35.720> that<00:05:35.870> we've<00:05:36.020> been<00:05:36.140> doing

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
of the layer stuff that we've been doing

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.190 
of the layer stuff that we've been doing
in<00:05:36.530> Photoshop<00:05:37.240> so<00:05:38.240> it<00:05:38.360> looks<00:05:38.510> like<00:05:38.570> this<00:05:38.840> whole

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
in Photoshop so it looks like this whole

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.930 
in Photoshop so it looks like this whole
entire<00:05:39.650> thing<00:05:39.770> right<00:05:40.190> here<00:05:40.220> needs<00:05:40.700> to<00:05:40.820> be

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
entire thing right here needs to be

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.190 
entire thing right here needs to be
scooted<00:05:43.030> again<00:05:44.030> I<00:05:44.060> grab<00:05:44.450> about<00:05:44.690> three<00:05:44.750> or<00:05:45.080> four

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
scooted again I grab about three or four

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.190 
scooted again I grab about three or four
layers<00:05:46.100> down<00:05:46.520> in<00:05:46.880> order<00:05:47.270> to<00:05:47.420> do<00:05:47.570> this<00:05:47.780> so<00:05:48.170> that

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
layers down in order to do this so that

00:05:48.200 --> 00:06:11.470 
layers down in order to do this so that
way<00:05:48.650> it<00:05:48.800> blends<00:05:49.160> nice

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:30.190

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
then check for any flaws in it so

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.440 
then check for any flaws in it so
there's<00:06:36.290> little<00:06:36.530> more<00:06:37.010> right<00:06:37.280> there<00:06:40.450> so
