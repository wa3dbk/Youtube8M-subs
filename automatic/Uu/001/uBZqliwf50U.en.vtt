00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.410
 I try to already say horns 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.330
 of gazelle but it must be great 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.560
 complicated well you know what I'm 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.119
 I launched the challenge of doing them for the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.789
 first time at the same time as you in 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.370
 doing the video so raises his sleeves 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.830
 with me look at the ingredients and 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.100
 put in the kitchen to test that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.100
 together 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.370
 I will start preparing the prank 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.379
 almond powder base 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:59.940
 I will add to my almond powder the 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.940
 sugar cinnamon nutmeg 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:12.960
 I add honey the soft butter it 's a 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.450
 word is orange blossom as and when 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.990
 measure until you get a prank 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.990
 homogeneous 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.770
 once the dough and homogeneous we go 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.390
 to make a kind of ball we know that 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.330
 the dough is ready when we can 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.340
 work to make a little sausage 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.670
 stuffing that we can put in the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.770
 dough 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.350
 then move on to the preparation of the dough 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.660
 I add salt to the flour 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.960
 I add the melted butter and now 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:45.400
 I will knead the dough until 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.400
 all edges are well incorporated 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.610
 is also added the egg white then 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.020
 in fact I do almost the same gesture 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.360
 what would I do if I made a paste to 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.310
 bread is what is called kneading the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.190
 dough and I'm going to add little by little 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.450
 now the orange blossom water for 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.310
 that the dough is well homogeneous you go 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.310
 have to add a little more water 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.710
 and then once it's homogeneous and 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.119
 well you have to knead it until 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.170
 they are well dissolved once 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.180
 the dough and smooth and homogeneous 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.650
 we'll let her wait ten minutes 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.170
 before embarking on the confection 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.920
 gazelle camps I discover the dough 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.920
 in five legs 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.830
 I will take care of the first stick I 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.660
 will spread out on a thickness of 2 mm I 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.510
 take a little joke that I roll in 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.650
 cigar shape when I can already him 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.660
 give a little bit a shape two 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.590
 croissants the one I'm going to give a 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.940
 mac en gazelle we can make some 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.519
 tiny as big tits there I 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.660
 make big ones to show well but 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.220
 also because to learn it is 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.819
 simpler and we can also delay 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.819
 tiny 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.400
 so I put on a baking sheet 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.940
 covered with parchment paper or anti 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.349
 adhesive 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.140
 we just have to bake 15 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.730
 minutes at 180 Â° having the best it's 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.830
 to have preheated his oven a little more 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.049
 warm before and down to 180 at 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.790
 moment when kids and little tricks 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.160
 they must not be browned at the end 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.799
 and here are the gazelle horns houses 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.000
 are ready right I admit I still have 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.530
 work to be done for them to be 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.450
 perfect and also pretty in the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.670
 oriental pastries but in any case 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.690
 it feels heavenly good besides I 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.980
