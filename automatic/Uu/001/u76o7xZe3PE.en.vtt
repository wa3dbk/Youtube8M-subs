00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
their own attainment they have psychic

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.970

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.780 
minds and they can give that kind of
analysis<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:36.350> think<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.800> skeptic<00:02:37.280> might<00:02:37.519> say

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
analysis so I think a skeptic might say

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.860 
analysis so I think a skeptic might say
well<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:39.110> know<00:02:39.430> how<00:02:40.430> do<00:02:40.489> you<00:02:40.700> know<00:02:40.940> how<00:02:41.690> do<00:02:41.750> you

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
well you know how do you know how do you

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.660 
well you know how do you know how do you
know<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.230> they<00:02:42.410> are<00:02:42.560> really<00:02:42.739> qualified<00:02:43.400> in

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
know that they are really qualified in

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.380 
know that they are really qualified in
that<00:02:43.700> way

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
that way

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.170 
that way
so<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.620> another<00:02:45.769> kind<00:02:46.100> of<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:46.790> know<00:02:46.820> self

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
so is it another kind of a you know self

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.650 
so is it another kind of a you know self
referencing<00:02:47.840> kind<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.519> yeah<00:02:49.519> well<00:02:50.209> I<00:02:50.239> I<00:02:50.330> can

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
referencing kind of yeah well I I can

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.910 
referencing kind of yeah well I I can
see<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.959> Christian<00:02:51.320> but<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.650> could<00:02:51.769> also

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
see the Christian but you could also

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.820 
see the Christian but you could also
apply<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.670> science<00:02:53.180> where<00:02:53.709> in<00:02:54.709> the

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
apply that to science where in the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.289 
apply that to science where in the
higher<00:02:55.040> levels<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.989> scientific<00:02:56.989> research

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
higher levels of scientific research

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.449 
higher levels of scientific research
then<00:02:59.299> well<00:03:00.140> in<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.380> case<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:00.769> Einstein<00:03:00.980> and

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
then well in the case of Einstein and

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.360 
then well in the case of Einstein and
the<00:03:01.959> relativity<00:03:02.959> then<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:03.620> was<00:03:03.769> only<00:03:03.890> two<00:03:04.280> or

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
the relativity then I was only two or

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.630 
the relativity then I was only two or
three<00:03:04.400> people<00:03:04.820> who<00:03:05.540> could<00:03:06.100> could<00:03:07.100> understand

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
three people who could could understand

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.440 
three people who could could understand
it<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.350> who<00:03:09.350> who<00:03:09.560> could<00:03:09.739> say<00:03:09.920> yes<00:03:10.269> yeah<00:03:11.269> this

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
it and who who could say yes yeah this

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.069 
it and who who could say yes yeah this
is<00:03:11.630> correct<00:03:12.079> so<00:03:12.890> there<00:03:13.070> is<00:03:13.190> some<00:03:13.400> some<00:03:13.610> kind<00:03:13.850> of

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
is correct so there is some some kind of

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.710 
is correct so there is some some kind of
analogy<00:03:15.079> with<00:03:15.320> with<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.980> scientific<00:03:16.760> anyways

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
analogy with with the scientific anyways

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.020 
analogy with with the scientific anyways
just<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:19.280> inner<00:03:19.519> contemplative<00:03:20.390> science

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
just to the inner contemplative science

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.720 
just to the inner contemplative science
so<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.239> Thailand<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:24.230> day's<00:03:24.530> them<00:03:24.860> probably

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
so in Thailand this day's them probably

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.910 
so in Thailand this day's them probably
the<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.269> man<00:03:26.480> who<00:03:26.659> is<00:03:26.840> acknowledged<00:03:27.620> as<00:03:27.769> the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
the the man who is acknowledged as the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.149 
the the man who is acknowledged as the
leader<00:03:28.159> of<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.670> forest<00:03:29.060> Sangha<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:30.590> phantom

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
leader of the forest Sangha is phantom

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.199 
leader of the forest Sangha is phantom
hawa<00:03:31.610> hawa<00:03:32.269> hawa<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.819> most<00:03:34.819> months<00:03:35.090> would

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
hawa hawa hawa and most months would

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.610 
hawa hawa hawa and most months would
take<00:03:35.450> him<00:03:35.690> as<00:03:36.080> an<00:03:36.230> authority<00:03:36.860> on<00:03:37.069> us<00:03:37.430> but<00:03:38.060> he

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
take him as an authority on us but he

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.890 
take him as an authority on us but he
interestingly<00:03:39.620> in<00:03:40.610> his<00:03:40.849> old<00:03:41.060> age<00:03:41.269> he's<00:03:41.659> in<00:03:41.780> his

interestingly in his old age he's in his
90s<00:03:42.409> now<00:03:42.680> he's<00:03:43.159> become<00:03:43.519> somewhat<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.030> a

see<00:06:04.069> so<00:06:04.279> so<00:06:05.379> the<00:06:06.379> the<00:06:07.629> you<00:06:08.629> know<00:06:08.719> I<00:06:08.779> I<00:06:08.839> have

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
see so so the the you know I I have

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:15.040 
see so so the the you know I I have
faith<00:06:09.469> in<00:06:09.710> in<00:06:10.039> in<00:06:10.909> Omaha<00:06:11.569> Bois<00:06:12.789> myself<00:06:13.810> but<00:06:14.810> I

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
faith in in in Omaha Bois myself but I

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.139 
faith in in in Omaha Bois myself but I
think<00:06:15.259> it's<00:06:15.620> important<00:06:16.219> that<00:06:16.399> we<00:06:16.729> don't<00:06:16.969> feel

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:17.149 
think it's important that we don't feel

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:18.670 
think it's important that we don't feel
that<00:06:17.210> faith<00:06:17.599> in<00:06:17.749> our<00:06:17.899> hands<00:06:18.110> means<00:06:18.409> that<00:06:18.589> we

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
that faith in our hands means that we

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.820 
that faith in our hands means that we
have<00:06:18.830> to<00:06:18.979> be<00:06:19.099> completely

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
have to be completely

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.290 
have to be completely
uncritical<00:06:21.830> of<00:06:21.949> everything<00:06:22.430> they<00:06:22.639> say<00:06:22.879> and<00:06:22.909> do

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
uncritical of everything they say and do

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.820 
uncritical of everything they say and do
I<00:06:23.569> think<00:06:23.899> that<00:06:24.050> we<00:06:24.139> should<00:06:24.349> still<00:06:24.589> be<00:06:24.620> able<00:06:24.709> to

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
I think that we should still be able to

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.929 
I think that we should still be able to
say<00:06:24.979> yet<00:06:25.360> I<00:06:26.360> don't<00:06:26.749> I<00:06:27.080> don't<00:06:27.169> agree<00:06:27.560> with<00:06:27.979> with

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:28.939 
say yet I don't I don't agree with with

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:34.269 
say yet I don't I don't agree with with
that<00:06:29.680> with<00:06:30.680> with<00:06:31.039> this<00:06:31.930> declaration<00:06:32.930> of<00:06:33.649> his

that with with this declaration of his

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.449 
that with with this declaration of his
enlightenment<00:06:35.209> I<00:06:35.719> don't<00:06:36.439> see<00:06:36.709> that<00:06:36.949> it's<00:06:37.159> had

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:37.459 
enlightenment I don't see that it's had

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:41.079 
enlightenment I don't see that it's had
the<00:06:37.999> positive<00:06:38.479> results<00:06:39.219> that<00:06:40.219> he<00:06:40.430> expected

the positive results that he expected

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:42.659 
the positive results that he expected
and<00:06:41.209> hurt
