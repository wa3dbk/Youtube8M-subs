00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.720
 the poster that will explain a 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.370
 little bit how the bus goes 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.340
 Basque team 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.130
 hello good as you can see here 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.930
 is the bus this would be like the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.980
 team's wardrobe is not the one that 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.500
 moves from the hotel to the exit and from 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.450
 the arrivals to the hotel then the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.400
 runners in this do not usually travel alone 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.280
 it's not going to the exits ideas the hotels 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.010
 and good as you can see it has communities 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.120
 they do not have seats that go almost almost 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.309
 tombs 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.670
 who wants the house then back to 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.339
 hotel 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.280
 and well, as you can see, here you have 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.629
 a discussion table have how are you going to 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.940
 be if they want to be in groups or 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.390
 wants to be more hours more 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.579
 equation through 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.800
 and then here but the coffee maker that is 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.900
 where they usually drink coffee then before 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.300
 the exits or 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.760
 they are many is fine after they are 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.960
 Of course here we have a bathroom 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.180
 and here is a watering can where we're going to 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.220
 use more than them us 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.690
 a micro more here and here comes where 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.690
 they usually do all the joints 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.760
 meetings before the director can not 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.210
 usually gives the team strategy 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.610
 missions where they are most relaxed 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.520
 and then the bus has two showers 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.850
 where they fight after digging a 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.330
 race to get to the hotel they arrive at the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.770
 hotel already prepared for 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.850
 for more massage 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.850
 if they arrive relaxed 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.170
 many hours here all the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.330
 side dependencies there are transfers then 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.090
 that can be two hours 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.920
 three hours then then I'll try what 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.630
 more relaxed than they can before the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.690
 career and then three months after the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.460
 beating and they relax and I just 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.060
 there is some mail that has some way 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.040
 special because normally back 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.320
 they usually put the ones that go 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.180
 leaders to career as they are more 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.610
 comfortable quieter that can you 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.600
 close the door do not want to listen 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.030
 nothing here 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.610
 otherwise each and every turn I 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.840
 take a seat and respect each other 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.849
 they the seat of the genius 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.370
 and yes it usually takes place out but 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.640
 let's go maniata without any 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.640
 description 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.100
 Any anecdote you have 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.870
 that has happened here inside and that 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.560
 they buy referents that when they win they do not 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.560
 when you win 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.870
 the winner the classmates have 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.159
 aware that we have seen it 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.159
 way they are left 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.689
 to you
