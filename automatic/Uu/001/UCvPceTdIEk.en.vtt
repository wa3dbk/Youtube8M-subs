00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.480
 Good day to all with the latest 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.350
 events would like to tell you about 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.699
 changes 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.100
 but he is almost 6.2 actually 6.2 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.470
 turned out to be quite a large patch 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.869
 since there is enough in the game 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.840
 many new changes would like to start 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.200
 garrison namely from the pier garrison 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.510
 which many players have been waiting for will not 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.850
 go ahead to the pier account 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.570
 some hasty conclusions because 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.629
 for the time being, I am personally not in this innovation. 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.910
 figured out but I want to say what appeared 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.180
 new currency you need to send 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.460
 ships is the oil that build our 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.770
 priests we need to do a little 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.910
 chain of quests before and 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.170
 build it 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 we have a map that we can 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.010
 watch some tags where we can 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.810
 ship our ships to 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.720
 earn more oil 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.850
 as for the ships themselves they made 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.270
 quite good there are plenty 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.180
 types of ships and for example the most 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.009
 the first ship which 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.740
 make for us looks enough 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.220
 not bad as for the types of ships 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.770
 There are only five of them. The first view is infantry. 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.770
 transport 2 warships 3 aircraft carrier 4 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.630
 submarines 5 destroyers this hike 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.729
 the most awesome 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.460
 ships fifth look so okay prize in 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.399
 principle of the wharf can speak very and 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.180
 very much but need yourself first 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.619
 delve into this building after 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.140
 several quests of the press and us 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.060
 finally sent to Tanaan 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.750
 the jungle where we meet a lot 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.540
 jobs as we build it from their mini 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.939
 base as in other locations of draenor and 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.670
 the story continues about which I tell you 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.740
 I will not speak 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.310
 by first impressions location is very 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.870
 beautiful gloomy to some extent 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.750
 species right now in this 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.870
 locations many people all all something 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.630
 farm reputation and passes the quest so 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.330
 what if you want to farm the quest by 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.540
 fast the group on the subject will be special 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.459
 labor especially some quests 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.110
 with a group you need to do as one 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.110
 very difficult and also 6.2 added for a long time 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.569
 new chapter for the legendary quest 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.569
 it is this chapter 4 called she 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.720
 the embodiment of darkness again kadgar gives us 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:53.480
 the job finally we can get 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.640
 this ring she 735 items leva 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.130
 added new sets which again 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.069
 outraged the players I understand blizzard 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.100
 didn't even bother too much and 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.470
 done with this shooting range 18 and second season 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.010
 puppey are virtually identical, they like 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.829
 so only in color differ 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.440
 well and so how did I remember not to mention 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.890
 about the most important innovation 6.2 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.260

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.299
 called then the distance of hellfire with 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.870
 the main boss I think everyone already 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:32.459
 well-known archimonde well, let's see 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.010

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.190
 quickly any deal anywhere 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.790
 Archimonde slightly sensational update 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.040
 which includes new events 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:50.430

 mode for passing quietly insts will 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.610
 fall 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.970
 interesting and good clothes appeared 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:08.230
 new features in the guide to 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.690
 Adventure has a new insert 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.140
 which is called recommended content 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.579
 show us here that exist 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:21.609

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.560
 we have events 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.300
 if we look in the calendar here 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.930
 see their tab itself we have specified 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.410
 tasks in the calendar specified days when 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.810
 these tasks can be performed and what 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.979
 get a test reward also here there is 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:48.370
 some clues like quest 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:51.970
 prepare for an invasion you can 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.880
 take in this tab also changed 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.190
 clear ball but about him i am in this video 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.580
 I will not speak like that 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.310
 to get myself ashran but I know what's there 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.610
 added underground complex 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.220

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.820
 another video 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:18.100
 6.2 added also very very large 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.190
 number of cool pets for your 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.500
 collections but what about flights I think 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.140
 there is no sense to keep everyone already know 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.110
 how will they be 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.220
 6.2 and what you need to do to 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.560
 fly and draenor 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.860
 Well, actually that's all the main 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.870
 The changes that have touched v 6.2 are 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.810
 many other less significant 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.510
 changes in the new patch you can 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.240
