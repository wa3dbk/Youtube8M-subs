00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
HD beats here the white colors and these

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.729 
HD beats here the white colors and these
are<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.260> much<00:00:47.120> different<00:00:48.120> from<00:00:48.410> these<00:00:49.410> right

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
are not much different from these right

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.090 
are not much different from these right
here<00:00:49.770> these<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.160> exactly<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> same<00:00:51.079> but<00:00:52.100> just

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
here these are exactly the same but just

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.580 
here these are exactly the same but just
different<00:00:53.520> colors<00:00:53.899> these<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:55.050> not<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.379> best

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
different colors these are not the best

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.880 
different colors these are not the best
headphones<00:00:56.239> buy<00:00:57.239> beats<00:00:57.510> these<00:00:57.899> are<00:00:58.170> okay<00:00:58.859> I

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
headphones buy beats these are okay I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.299 
headphones buy beats these are okay I
guess<00:00:59.039> and<00:01:00.260> they<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.530> good<00:01:01.649> bass<00:01:01.980> so

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
guess and they have really good bass so

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.640 
guess and they have really good bass so
if<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.820> bass<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.390> loud<00:01:03.660> music<00:01:03.930> these

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
if you like bass and loud music these

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.679 
if you like bass and loud music these
are<00:01:04.710> definitely<00:01:05.010> great<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.060> not

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
are definitely great for that and not

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.289 
are definitely great for that and not
really<00:01:07.020> comfortable<00:01:07.290> also<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.310> i<00:01:08.580> don't

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
really comfortable also so i don't

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.630
