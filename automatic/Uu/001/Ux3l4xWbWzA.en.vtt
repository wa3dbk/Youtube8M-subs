00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
now as I normally do with all my reviews

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.960 
now as I normally do with all my reviews
I'd<00:03:46.310> like<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:47.060> tell<00:03:47.599> the<00:03:48.109> viewers<00:03:48.440> what

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
I'd like to tell the viewers what

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.849

markers<00:03:49.970> they<00:03:50.209> can<00:03:50.449> and<00:03:50.659> can't<00:03:50.870> use<00:03:51.199> that<00:03:51.590> will

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
markers they can and can't use that will

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.860 
markers they can and can't use that will
cause<00:03:52.129> bleed<00:03:52.519> through<00:03:52.819> on<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.359> next<00:03:53.629> page

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
cause bleed through on the next page

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.879 
cause bleed through on the next page
because<00:03:54.229> most<00:03:54.769> of<00:03:54.949> our<00:03:55.099> coloring<00:03:55.940> books<00:03:56.329> are

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
because most of our coloring books are

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.199 
because most of our coloring books are
double-sided<00:03:57.889> pictures<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.760> don't<00:03:58.940> have<00:03:59.180> a

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.950 
I used the BIC and it bled through and
right<00:04:58.380> here<00:04:58.680> i<00:04:58.710> used<00:04:59.270> the<00:05:00.270> prism<00:05:00.600> of<00:05:00.630> colors

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
and that bled through on the back so you

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.510 
and that bled through on the back so you
can<00:05:03.570> use<00:05:03.750> pretty<00:05:04.050> much<00:05:04.170> any<00:05:04.560> marker<00:05:05.040> on<00:05:05.220> it

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520
