one's<00:02:20.220> not<00:02:20.400> gonna<00:02:20.580> be<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:22.100> core<00:02:23.100> design<00:02:23.459> which<00:02:24.030> I

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
one's not gonna be a core design which I

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.850 
one's not gonna be a core design which I
know<00:02:25.290> look<00:02:25.620> at<00:02:25.680> that

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
know look at that

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.860 
know look at that
48<00:02:26.670> about<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.780> same<00:02:27.959> size<00:02:28.200> as<00:02:28.500> 4<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.860> 6<00:02:29.130> so

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
48 about the same size as 4 to 6 so

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.380 
48 about the same size as 4 to 6 so
probably<00:02:30.870> use<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.170> 48<00:02:32.180> by<00:02:34.310> was<00:02:35.310> $4.99<00:02:35.790> so

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
probably use the 48 by was $4.99 so

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.900 
probably use the 48 by was $4.99 so
that's<00:02:36.690> good<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.959> know<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:39.140> now<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.170> have<00:02:40.910> steel
