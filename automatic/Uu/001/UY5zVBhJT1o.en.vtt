00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.390
 hello and welcome to coco tv for 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.180
 new video presentation 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.210
 today 's large-format cooling glass 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.700
 with the cool dim assassin 2 that integrates 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.920
 the range well put storm and we can 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.809
 see it's a big killer piece 2 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.250
 so update the assassin does not 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.500
 the aircraft not tested on the farm but to 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.620
 the time and that is available in europe 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.040
 via alpina fun and this was the case two 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.480
 case two murderers 2 always with eight 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.550
 heat pipes so a base that is when 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.680
 even pretty impressive as one 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.140
 can see eight heat pipes that are 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.149
 line at the level of updates new 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.040
 fan then always a frame 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.830
 flexible it's very simple news 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.180
 forms for the fins especially to 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.800
 the back which is much more convex 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.410
 it's working too we can 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.270
 find the fans a 120 mm to 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.560
 the front a 140 mm at the back 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.880
 300 rpm minimum for the 2200 for the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.369
 Maximum 140 and 1400 for the 120 mm 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.320
 maximum also the design is enough 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.850
 interesting then of course the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.160
 color will not please everyone 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.899
 but it's nice to have this little 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.390
 circle on the side it changes a little 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.130
 so after if it's okay 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.580
 with the rest of the configuration a 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.810
 priori it is not won nevertheless 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.700
 appreciate that change 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.840
 especially compared to the colors we have 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.310
 the habit of seeing in 10 shots 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.009
 especially in gamer storm 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.569
 the finish is pretty good but as 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.700
 it can be seen on the top 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.920
 fingerprints on the fins in 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.270
 aluminum remains its mark enormously 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.130
 so be careful when 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.929
 manipulations the installation of 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.009
 fans is particularly simple 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:04.739
 it's just a simple clip up and like 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.810
 the fan already has its flexible frame 

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.910
 no need to add two small ones 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.920
 washers or others to mitigate 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.660
 vibrations we also put up very 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.270
 easily normally so the little 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.030
 problem to see correctly the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.099
 fan the radiator shines not bad but 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.540
 it is rather simply put 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.790
 note so we have two fans 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.770
 we will not be able to add 2 3rd 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.110
 some radiators in dual tower the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.110
 allow this one does not allow it the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.629
 height we take our little cheat 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.080
 with the box and we look at the height 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.240
 167 mm so 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.310
 voltages at the level of the housings but 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.590
 especially same problem as for the case of 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.050
 if we put like these we see 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.280
 the fan of the senses enormously so 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.570
 to pay attention at the level of 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.970
 memory we already know that it's going to encroach 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.620
 on the first jump and maybe on the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.200
 second or even the third according to 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.360
 the motherboard we pay attention memory 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.470
 low profile or with classic radiator 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.220
 nothing exuberant if possible at the level 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.340
 the price 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.660
 so for now in europe it is not 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.000
 not available but we should type 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.950
 in 70 80 euros it remains very 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.260
 classic compared to this template the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.120
 test on the 980x of course without 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.709
 overclocking and with a big 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.360
 overclocking and we are very busy 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.020
 quickly in the meantime we wish you 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.020
 a good day
