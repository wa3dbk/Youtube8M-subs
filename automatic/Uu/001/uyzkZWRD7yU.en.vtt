00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
that frames the bed really really nicely

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.999 
that frames the bed really really nicely
and<00:05:29.909> that<00:05:30.449> leads<00:05:30.689> on<00:05:30.839> to<00:05:31.050> one<00:05:31.409> of<00:05:31.559> the<00:05:31.830> most

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
and that leads on to one of the most

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.919 
and that leads on to one of the most
spectacular<00:05:32.219> bathrooms<00:05:33.029> I've<00:05:33.269> ever<00:05:33.629> had<00:05:33.839> the

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:33.929 
spectacular bathrooms I've ever had the

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:37.820 
spectacular bathrooms I've ever had the
pleasure<00:05:34.050> of<00:05:34.229> working<00:05:34.379> on<00:05:34.649> oh<00:05:36.199> well<00:05:37.199> okay<00:05:37.559> I

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
pleasure of working on oh well okay I

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.999 
pleasure of working on oh well okay I
see<00:05:38.610> what<00:05:38.789> you<00:05:38.969> mean<00:05:39.179> that<00:05:39.240> is<00:05:39.860> that<00:05:40.860> is

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
see what you mean that is that is

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.009 
see what you mean that is that is
incredible<00:05:41.550> spectacular<00:05:42.269> isn't<00:05:42.389> it<00:05:42.539> you<00:05:42.959> know

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:43.019 
incredible spectacular isn't it you know

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:45.109 
incredible spectacular isn't it you know
the<00:05:43.409> original<00:05:43.559> brief<00:05:44.009> was<00:05:44.249> to<00:05:44.490> create<00:05:44.909> a<00:05:44.939> home

00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:45.119 
the original brief was to create a home

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:47.929 
the original brief was to create a home
which<00:05:45.330> was<00:05:45.509> opulent<00:05:46.009> but<00:05:47.009> practical<00:05:47.699> and

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:47.939 
which was opulent but practical and

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:49.790 
which was opulent but practical and
comfortable<00:05:48.149> and<00:05:48.869> I<00:05:48.929> think<00:05:49.169> this<00:05:49.349> room<00:05:49.619> more

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
comfortable and I think this room more

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.189 
comfortable and I think this room more
than<00:05:50.009> any<00:05:50.159> in<00:05:50.399> the<00:05:51.240> house<00:05:51.449> epitomizes<00:05:52.169> that

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
than any in the house epitomizes that

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.529 
than any in the house epitomizes that
when<00:05:52.830> who<00:05:53.009> would<00:05:53.159> not<00:05:53.369> want<00:05:53.579> to<00:05:53.759> have<00:05:54.240> a<00:05:54.269> bath

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
when who would not want to have a bath

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.019 
when who would not want to have a bath
in<00:05:54.719> this<00:05:54.869> bath<00:05:55.079> in<00:05:55.619> this<00:05:56.249> space<00:05:56.519> looking<00:05:56.909> out

in this bath in this space looking out

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:59.449 
in this bath in this space looking out
at<00:05:57.209> that<00:05:57.360> view<00:05:57.740> they've<00:05:58.740> done<00:05:59.039> an<00:05:59.219> excellent

at that view they've done an excellent

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.909 
at that view they've done an excellent
job<00:05:59.879> of<00:06:00.300> matching<00:06:00.749> the<00:06:00.779> pool<00:06:01.139> color<00:06:01.409> with<00:06:01.769> the

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
job of matching the pool color with the

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.889 
job of matching the pool color with the
sea<00:06:02.189> color<00:06:02.459> and<00:06:02.729> at<00:06:03.059> the<00:06:03.179> right<00:06:03.419> time<00:06:03.719> of<00:06:03.869> day

the<00:06:04.559> two<00:06:04.829> bodies<00:06:05.279> of<00:06:05.309> water<00:06:05.519> read<00:06:06.329> like<00:06:06.659> one<00:06:06.929> I

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
the two bodies of water read like one I

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.199 
the two bodies of water read like one I
think<00:06:08.159> you'll<00:06:08.249> agree<00:06:08.369> Nick<00:06:08.610> oh<00:06:08.729> this<00:06:08.879> is<00:06:08.999> what

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:14.579 
that view one of the challenges on this

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:16.759 
that view one of the challenges on this
project<00:06:14.759> was<00:06:15.149> the<00:06:15.599> swimming<00:06:15.990> pool<00:06:16.169> which<00:06:16.379> is<00:06:16.709> a

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:16.769 
project was the swimming pool which is a

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:18.859 
project was the swimming pool which is a
room<00:06:17.039> flow<00:06:17.279> but<00:06:17.939> is<00:06:18.059> in<00:06:18.149> actual<00:06:18.419> fact<00:06:18.449> a

00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:18.869 
room flow but is in actual fact a

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:20.959 
room flow but is in actual fact a
cantilever<00:06:19.469> structure<00:06:19.860> in<00:06:20.490> which<00:06:20.669> you<00:06:20.819> can

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
cantilever structure in which you can

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.480 
cantilever structure in which you can
see<00:06:21.119> from<00:06:21.300> the<00:06:21.389> driveway<00:06:21.629> but<00:06:22.439> had<00:06:23.309> its

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
see from the driveway but had its

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.279 
see from the driveway but had its
engineering<00:06:23.969> challenges<00:06:24.509> fortunately<00:06:25.169> we

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
engineering challenges fortunately we

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.199 
engineering challenges fortunately we
had<00:06:25.469> a<00:06:25.499> very<00:06:25.769> good<00:06:25.829> team<00:06:26.219> on<00:06:26.459> board<00:06:26.939> on<00:06:27.119> this

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:27.209 
had a very good team on board on this
