00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.060
 I am I am 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.879
 click here 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.569
 kouchner tse 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.449
 it's the second death and never cared how 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.969
 install on your site the company 6 2 on the principle 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.609
 as you can see it's great I do not know what's going to happen 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.130
 to find survivors 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.369
 you have to go through others 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.569
 in this case it's great 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:30.880
 it's primordial 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.080
 children being under domination 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.470
 the kitchen the second mission on them 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.570
 in the countryside 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.200
 copÃ© because 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.330
 I prefer parties online 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.200
 but I do not have the game 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.120
 so things that are not very good 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.980
 the movement was clearly I did not get along very quickly it's going very 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.450
 well I have principles 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.920
 but she did not take part the sepa by a microphone to 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.019
 the process is simple 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.019
 too much bacardi why because 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.730
 speaking at the microphone of gastro m 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.480
 football is what happens to us to communicate this decline on the certificates 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.350
 his therapy 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.720
 on paper it's good 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.320
 sensational conservatism 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.330
 nearly 6,800 stations 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.880
 all their loved ones 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880
 so the deputies defend the base 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.230
 this level makes this new factor kids suffer 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.230
 three cards 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.720
 in fact I think it's from what argues that this mission 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.760
 several times 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.760
 besides they are defended the very basis of staying at home 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.890
 but what's good is why I wanted to comment and like that 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 on sugar is sure build that does not drop that one thinks I'm testing 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.360
 under the halls 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.710
 Thursday NATO is not like on xbox times where you have all the time 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.390
 required at 9 9 euros 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.979
 every year I feel super calogero 6 besides many things to do 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.189
 he did not show up 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.189
 when you have a good ability first he plays on the left 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.300
 finally for the om and to see the lyrics 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.300
 so it's through afp 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.939
 complete others 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.339
 your task 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.289
 deny% and this to help them get back up 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:32.529
 on the xbox live be blocked 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.529
 on the other side of the Atlantic for their morin corruption 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.959
 that's done 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.419
 sponsoring as css rise 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.239
 I assure you 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.239
 as these species can follow one another at john and why because 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.209
 in the past by many are not superstitious even if you have 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.209
 in use 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.219
 the graphics are perfectly 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.219
 to be able to take corridor players 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.819
 example the fed cases are not impounded 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.229
 yannick until mature 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:14.229
 they did not try 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.959
 people do not dissipate 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.809
 google would be about to see it at the top left of the screen 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.229
 for her it's pathetic 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.259
 however, she continues 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:33.759
 thanks to the site 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:37.059
 very strong so that their circuit fluidity and its tickets 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:38.769
 these strikes 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.259
 she stole the recorders 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.189
 me it is necessary software of watch 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:45.309
 these spaces 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.369
 so here I have to wait for the cross shot after the crash I think I 

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:49.419
 will go 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:50.289
 this Wednesday 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:53.339
 use subprimes ap 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:55.209
 over a week 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.939
 systematic about the participants why would I leave target 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:59.869
 here 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.869
 to understand the accident s 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:11.350
 while he 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.350
 at the eu level 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:20.079
 it's a fact the internet-based campaign not its completed exercise 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.019
 his tournament 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.199
 lucas does all the levels because I think the highest level first 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.409
 federal state level 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.900
 for the conventional power output the last place after its break 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:36.919
 4 no longer a sinecure it was like for the young people of that time 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:42.219
 Let's go 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.180
 Tracked by the club 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.430
 brew is always a pleasure thanks to his courage to say when I play 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.689
 a game why not make a comment 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.340
 precisely that 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.340
 sarr 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.340
 if it is less smiling 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
 how did I prepare it 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.520
 by readers 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.749
 So here is the lensois tax not adapted from Saint-Savin 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.129
 an asset that is often said 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.710
 you have to say 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.660
 little thing that is super important except that good when we will be able 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.159
 when we could see all the colors 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.240
 in some cases these 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.240
 It can be interesting 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:42.409
 it was also in 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.629
 in the comments if you want 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:47.819
 tell me, sir, the games you're playing 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:50.770
 d as to paris 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.199
 I preferred on tariff plans it's a small ranking 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.620
 like that is little 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.960
 what you love much more than I could make a surprise 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.619
 even if it could tell me then that I was leading 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:02.619
 puts free to read more between extreme 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.439
 French 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:09.439
 always a pleasure for subscribers in addition to olive trees 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:13.719
 david bellion 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:16.719
 that's why from penhars 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.500
 at least that's what they say so well that our our little commentary of the day 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.990
 so I hope he's worth his pen 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.810
 in the heart of the summer in the comments if you have offensives 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.810
 for those who wonder if it's possible 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.400
 one day maybe not all your comments 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.210
 with this weapon
