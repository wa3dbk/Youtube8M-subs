00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
big foreign animation because it

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.960 
big foreign animation because it
controls<00:02:15.910> how<00:02:16.239> an<00:02:16.390> object<00:02:16.510> rotates<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:18.819> is

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
controls how an object rotates this is

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.240 
controls how an object rotates this is
the<00:02:19.120> axis<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.540> rotation<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:20.230> down<00:02:20.500> there<00:02:20.769> and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
the axis of rotation is down there and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.550 
the axis of rotation is down there and
the<00:02:21.940> same<00:02:22.120> way<00:02:22.269> as<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.480> rotate<00:02:22.720> an<00:02:23.019> object<00:02:23.110> it

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the same way as you rotate an object it

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.420 
the same way as you rotate an object it
will<00:02:23.620> rotate<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:29.110> have

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
will rotate like that so we have

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.800 
will rotate like that so we have
modifications<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.610> list<00:02:30.819> orb<00:02:31.150> come<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.630> help

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
modifications to list orb come to help

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.470 
modifications to list orb come to help
counter<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.319> door<00:02:32.620> opening<00:02:33.040> like<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.489> will

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
counter the door opening like that will

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.729 
counter the door opening like that will
look<00:02:34.599> stupid<00:02:35.880> we<00:02:36.880> do<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.239> by<00:02:37.599> setting<00:02:38.530> the

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
look stupid we do that by setting the

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.319 
look stupid we do that by setting the
angle<00:02:39.069> snap<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.519> forty-five<00:02:40.239> percent<00:02:42.329> rotated

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
angle snap to forty-five percent rotated

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.270 
angle snap to forty-five percent rotated
90<00:02:44.200> degrees<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.129> side<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:47.170> moved<00:02:48.010> into

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
90 degrees on the side and moved into

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.160 
90 degrees on the side and moved into
place

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.990 

and<00:02:53.709> now<00:02:53.800> we<00:02:53.860> have<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.220> pivot<00:02:54.520> point<00:02:54.700> exactly

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
and now we have the pivot point exactly

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.520 
and now we have the pivot point exactly
where<00:02:55.330> we<00:02:55.450> wanted

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.800 

now<00:03:01.160> i'm<00:03:01.250> going<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.520> apply<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.880> simple<00:03:02.300> material

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
now i'm going to apply a simple material

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.780 
now i'm going to apply a simple material
to<00:03:02.930> these<00:03:03.080> models<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:04.100> i<00:03:04.160> can<00:03:04.340> tell<00:03:04.520> them<00:03:04.670> apart

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
to these models so i can tell them apart

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.010 
to these models so i can tell them apart
from<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.360> visual<00:03:05.660> from<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.170> collision<00:03:06.500> model

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
from the visual from the collision model

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.350 
from the visual from the collision model
you'll<00:03:09.020> not<00:03:09.140> make<00:03:09.470> this<00:03:09.650> crude<00:03:10.280> stone<00:03:10.880> plus

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
you'll not make this crude stone plus

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.890 
you'll not make this crude stone plus
like<00:03:11.569> that<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:13.040> crude<00:03:13.310> or<00:03:13.640> like<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:16.900> select

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
like that in a crude or like that select

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.000 
like that in a crude or like that select
them<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.290> go<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.890> edit<00:03:19.630> clone<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:21.620> make<00:03:21.770> up

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
them and go to edit clone and make up

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.150 
them and go to edit clone and make up
this<00:03:22.190> like<00:03:22.880> that<00:03:23.950> answer

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.970 

don't<00:03:27.820> apply<00:03:28.150> any<00:03:28.720> material<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.410> them<00:03:29.590> that

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
don't apply any material to them that

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.430 
don't apply any material to them that
will<00:03:30.130> help<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.520> keep<00:03:31.000> them<00:03:31.180> apart<00:03:31.510> in<00:03:32.410> the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
will help you keep them apart in the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.960 
will help you keep them apart in the
others<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:36.220> is<00:03:36.370> going<00:03:36.580> to<00:03:36.700> be<00:03:36.820> the

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
others and this is going to be the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.170 
others and this is going to be the
static<00:03:37.390> port<00:03:37.570> on<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.870> model<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.970> let<00:03:39.970> what

static port on the model and let what
we're<00:03:40.420> going<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.630> make<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.960> much<00:03:41.110> so<00:03:41.710> we

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
we're going to make it a much so we

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.470 
we're going to make it a much so we
convert<00:03:42.250> it<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.430> an<00:03:42.550> edible<00:03:42.910> mesh<00:03:45.270> then<00:03:46.270> we

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
convert it to an edible mesh then we

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.350 
convert it to an edible mesh then we
click<00:03:47.080> attach<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:48.190> attach<00:03:48.460> the<00:03:48.670> two<00:03:48.850> shapes<00:03:49.150> to

click attach to attach the two shapes to

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.930 
click attach to attach the two shapes to
each<00:03:49.450> other<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:52.450> we<00:03:52.690> Center<00:03:53.790> something<00:03:54.790> the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
each other and we Center something the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.060 
each other and we Center something the
pivot<00:03:55.270> point<00:03:55.300> to<00:03:55.660> la<00:03:55.810> biet<00:03:56.050> which<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:56.770> always<00:03:56.920> a

pivot point to la biet which is always a
good<00:03:57.280> idea<00:03:57.340> when<00:03:58.000> you're<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.210> critical<00:03:58.810> Asian

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
good idea when you're a critical Asian

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.670 
good idea when you're a critical Asian
without<00:04:00.310> that<00:04:00.520> form<00:04:00.850> just<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.150> be<00:04:01.270> sure<00:04:01.680> I'm

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
without that form just to be sure I'm

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.580 
without that form just to be sure I'm
converted<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.280> an<00:04:03.340> edible<00:04:03.700> Michigan<00:04:04.590> then

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
converted to an edible Michigan then

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.710 
converted to an edible Michigan then
we're<00:04:05.710> going<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:05.920> add<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:06.190> eh<00:04:06.790> rigid<00:04:07.510> body

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
we're going to add a eh rigid body

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.420 
we're going to add a eh rigid body
modified<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:11.890> notice<00:04:12.130> of<00:04:12.280> the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
modified to it you notice of the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.890 
modified to it you notice of the
material<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.180> storm<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:15.160> set<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.450> the

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
material to storm and set the the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.250 
material to storm and set the the
bounding<00:04:17.260> volume<00:04:17.290> to<00:04:17.799> pack<00:04:18.160> Street<00:04:18.520> shape

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
bounding volume to pack Street shape

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.690 
bounding volume to pack Street shape
this<00:04:20.260> will<00:04:20.440> create<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:20.799> mock<00:04:21.070> shake<00:04:21.340> when<00:04:21.580> we

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
this will create a mock shake when we

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.960 
this will create a mock shake when we
export<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.300> any<00:04:22.600> format

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.900 

and<00:04:26.180> this<00:04:27.080> one<00:04:27.350> is<00:04:27.500> going<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.830> be<00:04:27.950> animated<00:04:28.610> so

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
and this one is going to be animated so

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.450 
and this one is going to be animated so
it<00:04:29.060> has<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.360> remain<00:04:29.630> a<00:04:29.690> box<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.800> box<00:04:30.950> primitive

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
it has to remain a box the box primitive

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.060 
it has to remain a box the box primitive
so<00:04:32.420> we<00:04:32.540> had<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.690> bitch<00:04:32.990> curative<00:04:33.620> morning<00:04:33.860> fire

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
so we had a bitch curative morning fire

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.840 
so we had a bitch curative morning fire
again<00:04:35.080> set<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.170> material<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.830> wood<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.460> the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
again set the material to wood and the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.730 
again set the material to wood and the
bounding<00:04:38.240> volume<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.780> access<00:04:39.380> on

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.589 

right<00:04:43.370> now<00:04:43.789> we<00:04:43.849> have<00:04:43.970> actual<00:04:44.360> collision

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
right now we have actual collision

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.320 
right now we have actual collision
messes<00:04:45.050> in<00:04:45.199> the<00:04:45.289> scene<00:04:45.580> now<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.639> static<00:04:47.060> part

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
messes in the scene now the static part

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.740 
messes in the scene now the static part
which<00:04:47.900> is<00:04:48.319> a<00:04:48.380> mob<00:04:48.710> shape<00:04:48.979> and<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:50.330> animator

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
which is a mob shape and the animator

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.909 
which is a mob shape and the animator
part<00:04:51.050> which<00:04:51.770> is<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:52.009> box<00:04:52.310> primitive<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:54.530> turret

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
part which is a box primitive the turret

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.249 
part which is a box primitive the turret
ball<00:04:55.190> we<00:04:55.759> use<00:04:55.940> possibilities<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.840> create<00:04:56.990> this

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
ball we use possibilities to create this

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.029 
ball we use possibilities to create this
motion<00:04:57.770> right<00:04:58.960> because<00:04:59.960> this<00:05:00.199> collision

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
motion right because this collision

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.529 
motion right because this collision
shapes<00:05:01.400> will<00:05:01.639> behave<00:05:01.910> in<00:05:02.150> completely

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
shapes will behave in completely

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:03.939 
shapes will behave in completely
different<00:05:02.690> ways<00:05:03.169> we're<00:05:03.530> going<00:05:03.680> to<00:05:03.740> have<00:05:03.830> to

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
different ways we're going to have to

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.820 
different ways we're going to have to
create<00:05:04.250> 2<00:05:04.490> bhk<00:05:05.120> of<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.300> two-body<00:05:05.599> helpers<00:05:06.080> one

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
create 2 bhk of a two-body helpers one

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.950 
create 2 bhk of a two-body helpers one
for<00:05:07.069> each<00:05:07.099> of<00:05:07.370> them<00:05:08.949> so<00:05:10.539> but<00:05:11.539> we're<00:05:11.720> going<00:05:11.870> to

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
for each of them so but we're going to

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.719 
for each of them so but we're going to
start<00:05:12.139> by<00:05:12.199> giving<00:05:12.470> up<00:05:12.770> these<00:05:13.009> names<00:05:13.400> that<00:05:13.639> will

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
start by giving up these names that will

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.460 
start by giving up these names that will
make<00:05:13.940> them<00:05:14.060> easier<00:05:14.449> to<00:05:14.479> teleport<00:05:14.990> so<00:05:15.380> we're

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
make them easier to teleport so we're

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.890 
make them easier to teleport so we're
going<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.710> call<00:05:15.860> this<00:05:15.889> one<00:05:16.750> see<00:05:17.750> them<00:05:17.990> start<00:05:18.560> it

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
going to call this one see them start it
