00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
mean nothing he's not just gonna be

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.770 
mean nothing he's not just gonna be
tough<00:04:37.110> because<00:04:37.289> I<00:04:37.440> can<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:39.000> know<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.150> had<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.479> be

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
tough because I can you know I had to be

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.469 
tough because I can you know I had to be
disciplined<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:41.370> eat<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.729> right<00:04:41.880> thing<00:04:42.150> as

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
disciplined to eat the right thing as

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:49.540

you<00:04:42.780> know<00:04:42.900> how<00:04:43.289> to<00:04:43.349> move<00:04:43.620> tracking<00:04:43.979> it<00:04:44.250> down<00:04:44.400> 72

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.420 

so<00:04:50.550> I<00:04:50.789> mean<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.539> could<00:04:51.720> actually<00:04:51.930> do<00:04:52.259> it<00:04:52.430> like

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
so I mean I could actually do it like

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.390 
so I mean I could actually do it like
but<00:04:53.880> I<00:04:53.910> just<00:04:54.120> gotta<00:04:54.330> discipline<00:04:54.960> myself

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
but I just gotta discipline myself

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.909 
but I just gotta discipline myself
because<00:04:56.400> I<00:04:56.970> wouldn't<00:04:57.720> do<00:04:57.990> everything<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:58.770> had

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
because I wouldn't do everything I had

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.189 
because I wouldn't do everything I had
to<00:04:59.009> do<00:04:59.160> to<00:04:59.400> get<00:04:59.520> downloads<00:04:59.970> but<00:05:00.599> that's<00:05:01.080> not

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
to do to get downloads but that's not

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.620 
to do to get downloads but that's not
have<00:05:01.380> no<00:05:01.530> problem<00:05:02.009> you<00:05:02.160> know<00:05:02.310> it<00:05:03.120> would<00:05:03.449> make

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
have no problem you know it would make

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.850
