frame<00:01:23.140> for<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.530> I've<00:01:24.100> got<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.250> figure<00:01:24.460> out<00:01:24.580> a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
frame for it I've got to figure out a

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.910 
frame for it I've got to figure out a
way<00:01:24.820> where<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.030> can<00:01:25.210> quickly<00:01:25.690> remove<00:01:26.230> this<00:01:26.560> so

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
way where I can quickly remove this so

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.670 
way where I can quickly remove this so
in<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.160> event<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:27.880> I<00:01:28.060> ever<00:01:28.180> have<00:01:28.420> anything

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
in the event that I ever have anything

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.840 
in the event that I ever have anything
must<00:01:29.680> or<00:01:29.890> break<00:01:30.100> or<00:01:30.250> something<00:01:30.490> like<00:01:30.550> that<00:01:30.610> I

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
must or break or something like that I

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.570 
must or break or something like that I
can<00:01:31.030> just<00:01:31.180> pop<00:01:31.360> this<00:01:31.510> panel<00:01:31.900> off<00:01:32.050> so<00:01:32.890> I<00:01:33.280> thought

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
can just pop this panel off so I thought

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.550 
can just pop this panel off so I thought
I'd<00:01:33.730> leave<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:33.970> up<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.270> guys<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:35.230> diamond
