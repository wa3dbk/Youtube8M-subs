00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
for stuff like potato salad just depends

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.370 
for stuff like potato salad just depends
on<00:02:31.890> how<00:02:32.010> many<00:02:32.160> potatoes<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.390> cooked<00:02:33.959> that

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
on how many potatoes I have cooked that

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.470 
on how many potatoes I have cooked that
I<00:02:34.410> kind<00:02:34.739> of<00:02:34.830> just<00:02:35.130> play<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.489> by<00:02:35.640> ear<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.269> I

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
I kind of just play it by ear and I

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.740 
I kind of just play it by ear and I
don't<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:36.959> things<00:02:37.260> real<00:02:37.680> man<00:02:37.980> easy<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.750> you

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
don't like things real man easy so you

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.559 
don't like things real man easy so you
might<00:02:40.560> look<00:02:40.769> like<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:41.030> maybe<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.150> cup<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.540> half

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
might look like a maybe a cup and a half

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.750 
might look like a maybe a cup and a half
for<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.019> many<00:02:43.290> potatoes<00:02:44.630> go<00:02:45.630> okay<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.950> so

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
for that many potatoes go okay and so

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.940 
for that many potatoes go okay and so
that's<00:02:50.760> probably<00:02:50.910> about<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.269> cup<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.810> half

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
that's probably about a cup and a half

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.380 
that's probably about a cup and a half
and<00:02:52.950> then<00:02:53.340> we're<00:02:53.730> going<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:53.970> add<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> little

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
and then we're going to add a little

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.680 
and then we're going to add a little
Dijon<00:02:54.750> mustard<00:02:56.989> probably<00:02:57.989> at<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.260> hell<00:02:59.510> it<00:03:00.510> is

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
Dijon mustard probably at the hell it is

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.289 
Dijon mustard probably at the hell it is
created<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.230> hump<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.820> doesn't<00:03:02.820> really<00:03:02.940> get<00:03:03.180> it

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
created a hump it doesn't really get it

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:03.830 
created a hump it doesn't really get it
all<00:03:03.390> together

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
all together

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.479 
all together
okay<00:03:04.320> stops<00:03:04.650> we<00:03:05.070> good<00:03:05.220> right<00:03:05.810> worrying<00:03:06.810> about

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
okay stops we good right worrying about

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.670 
okay stops we good right worrying about
the<00:03:08.489> tablespoon<00:03:09.060> or<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:09.440> Dijon<00:03:10.440> mustard<00:03:12.680> to

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
this salt directly to the potatoes I did

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.920 
this salt directly to the potatoes I did
add<00:03:25.140> some<00:03:25.200> salt<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.190> water<00:03:26.310> as<00:03:26.670> they<00:03:26.850> were

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
boiling because that will add to the the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.509 
boiling because that will add to the the
saltiness<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> potatoes<00:03:31.859> as<00:03:32.040> they<00:03:32.220> boil

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
that together I don't have a lot of

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.640 
that together I don't have a lot of
mayonnaise<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.030> think<00:04:36.509> I<00:04:36.810> like<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.169> potatoes

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
mayonnaise I think I like the potatoes

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.460 
mayonnaise I think I like the potatoes
and<00:04:38.210> vegetables<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.479> be<00:04:39.509> the<00:04:39.750> star<00:04:40.020> not<00:04:40.289> the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
and vegetables to be the star not the

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.560 
and vegetables to be the star not the
mayonnaise<00:04:40.699> so<00:04:41.699> this<00:04:41.849> looks<00:04:42.060> pretty<00:04:42.300> good

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
mayonnaise so this looks pretty good

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.360 
mayonnaise so this looks pretty good
really<00:04:42.810> so<00:04:43.500> we're<00:04:43.590> about<00:04:43.650> ready<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.979> add<00:04:44.070> the

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
really so we're about ready to add the

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:52.879

I<00:04:53.190> made<00:04:54.060> sure<00:04:54.330> we're<00:04:54.510> nice<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:54.690> crisp<00:04:55.229> and
