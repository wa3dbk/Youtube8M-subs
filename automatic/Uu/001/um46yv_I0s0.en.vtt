00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
throughout the whole lineup and then

definitely<00:01:19.899> the<00:01:20.110> battery<00:01:20.530> life<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:21.009> the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
definitely the battery life and the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.930 
definitely the battery life and the
environmental<00:01:22.500> specifications<00:01:23.500> are<00:01:24.100> amazing

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
that the probably the most

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.740 
that the probably the most
environmentally<00:01:26.880> faithful<00:01:27.880> products<00:01:28.660> out

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
environmentally faithful products out

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.910 
environmentally faithful products out
there<00:01:28.810> on<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.140> market<00:01:29.320> right<00:01:29.500> now<00:01:29.619> and

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
there on the market right now and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.889 
there on the market right now and
definitely<00:01:30.789> women<00:01:31.030> by<00:01:31.149> a<00:01:31.179> long<00:01:31.420> shot<00:01:31.450> so

definitely women by a long shot so

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.020 
definitely women by a long shot so
consistency<00:01:32.500> is<00:01:32.770> great<00:01:33.369> and<00:01:33.550> I<00:01:33.610> think<00:01:33.850> that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
consistency is great and I think that

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.910 
consistency is great and I think that
lets<00:01:34.539> consumers<00:01:35.080> know<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.710> tech

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
lets consumers know and the tech

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.770 
lets consumers know and the tech
community<00:01:36.070> know<00:01:36.399> and<00:01:36.610> Apple<00:01:36.940> users<00:01:37.210> know<00:01:37.360> it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
community know and Apple users know it

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.840 
community know and Apple users know it
lets<00:01:38.050> them<00:01:38.140> know<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.590> Apple<00:01:39.369> is<00:01:39.520> going<00:01:39.700> to
