00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
although all the characters in the game

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.969 
although all the characters in the game
we<00:01:49.030> really<00:01:49.330> look<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.720> improve<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.650> creatures

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
we really look to improve the creatures

we really look to improve the creatures
in<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.220> game<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:52.180> main<00:01:52.409> difference<00:01:53.409> I<00:01:53.560> think

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
in this game the main difference I think

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.320 
in this game the main difference I think
is<00:01:53.920> we<00:01:54.040> really<00:01:54.280> tried<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.640> route<00:01:54.880> them<00:01:55.090> into

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
is we really tried to route them into

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.120 
is we really tried to route them into
this<00:01:55.479> world<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:56.110> should<00:01:56.409> be<00:01:56.619> able<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.800> look<00:01:57.009> at

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
this world you should be able to look at

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.100 
this world you should be able to look at
a<00:01:57.159> creature<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.700> know<00:01:57.909> you<00:01:58.570> know<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.840> lives

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
a creature and know you know it lives

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.899 
a creature and know you know it lives
there<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.770> makes<00:01:59.950> sense<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.460> be<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.700> this

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
there and it makes sense to be in this

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.609 
there and it makes sense to be in this
location<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.720> it<00:02:01.869> stands<00:02:02.170> out<00:02:02.380> from<00:02:02.530> the

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
location and it stands out from the

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.190 
location and it stands out from the
other<00:02:02.860> creatures<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.700> its<00:02:03.970> behavior<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:04.780> why

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
other creatures and its behavior and why

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.109 
other creatures and its behavior and why
it's<00:02:05.409> there<00:02:05.649> we<00:02:06.070> like<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.340> balance<00:02:06.670> things<00:02:06.850> out

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
it's there we like to balance things out

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.910 
it's there we like to balance things out
so<00:02:07.330> you<00:02:07.390> have<00:02:07.479> creatures<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:08.350> can<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:08.830> know

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
so you have creatures that can you know

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.830 
so you have creatures that can you know
go<00:02:09.100> all<00:02:09.250> over<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.729> different<00:02:10.060> areas<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.750> the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
go all over the different areas of the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.570 
go all over the different areas of the
world<00:02:11.050> some<00:02:11.380> fit<00:02:11.560> in<00:02:11.650> dungeons<00:02:12.070> some<00:02:12.280> fit<00:02:12.489> in

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
world some fit in dungeons some fit in

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.540 
world some fit in dungeons some fit in
exterior<00:02:13.470> but<00:02:14.470> ultimately<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.340> world

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
exterior but ultimately it's the world

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.430 
exterior but ultimately it's the world

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
that sort of ends up defining who lives

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.699 
that sort of ends up defining who lives
in<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:18.630> well<00:02:19.630> most<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.080> ideas<00:02:20.410> for<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
in it well most of the ideas for the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
game honestly start taking root here in

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.890 
game honestly start taking root here in
this<00:02:23.410> room<00:02:23.700> we<00:02:24.700> have<00:02:24.730> everything<00:02:25.120> drawn<00:02:25.569> from

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
this room we have everything drawn from

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.140 
this room we have everything drawn from

dungeons everything it's all in here
we've<00:02:30.220> done<00:02:30.370> more<00:02:30.550> concepts<00:02:31.030> for<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.269> game

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
we've done more concepts for this game

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.630 
we've done more concepts for this game
than<00:02:31.630> we<00:02:31.660> have<00:02:31.870> any<00:02:32.380> other<00:02:33.010> game<00:02:33.220> we've<00:02:33.370> ever

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
than we have any other game we've ever

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.910 
than we have any other game we've ever
worked<00:02:33.880> on<00:02:34.150> we<00:02:34.720> have<00:02:34.810> lots<00:02:34.989> of<00:02:35.110> fun<00:02:35.319> meetings

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
worked on we have lots of fun meetings

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.990 
worked on we have lots of fun meetings
in<00:02:36.040> here<00:02:36.220> where<00:02:36.370> we're<00:02:36.459> trying<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.700> figure<00:02:36.790> out

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
in here where we're trying to figure out

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.059 
in here where we're trying to figure out
how<00:02:37.360> everything<00:02:37.540> looks<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.769> is<00:02:38.860> going<00:02:39.010> to

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
how everything looks and is going to

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.360 
how everything looks and is going to
work<00:02:39.250> in<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.489> game<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:40.000> it's<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:41.380> know<00:02:41.440> we

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
work in the game and it's a you know we

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.710 
work in the game and it's a you know we
all<00:02:42.459> sort<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.730> work<00:02:42.880> together<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.630> know

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
all sort of work together on it you know

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.810 
all sort of work together on it you know
ray<00:02:44.260> will<00:02:44.440> be<00:02:44.560> drawing<00:02:44.890> something<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.670> then

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
ray will be drawing something and then

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.490 
ray will be drawing something and then
Todd<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.630> some<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.870> designers<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.410> I

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
Todd and some of the designers and I

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.930 
Todd and some of the designers and I
will<00:02:47.709> sit<00:02:48.070> down<00:02:48.100> with<00:02:48.459> them<00:02:48.579> and<00:02:48.700> try<00:02:48.850> and

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
will sit down with them and try and

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.580 
will sit down with them and try and
figure<00:02:49.060> out<00:02:49.180> what<00:02:49.390> we<00:02:49.540> want<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.840> do<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.200> how

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
figure out what we want to do and how

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.319 
figure out what we want to do and how
it's<00:02:50.739> going<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:50.890> work<00:02:51.070> in<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.310> game<00:02:51.459> but<00:02:52.269> we

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
it's going to work in the game but we

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.330 
it's going to work in the game but we
really<00:02:52.570> like<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:52.750> plan<00:02:53.049> out<00:02:53.230> as<00:02:53.380> much<00:02:53.860> stuff<00:02:54.160> as

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
really like to plan out as much stuff as

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.210 
really like to plan out as much stuff as
we<00:02:55.120> can<00:02:55.150> as<00:02:55.720> early<00:02:56.079> as<00:02:56.140> we<00:02:56.260> can<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:56.829> it<00:02:56.950> makes<00:02:57.130> it

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
we can as early as we can so it makes it

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.920 
we can as early as we can so it makes it
clear<00:02:57.519> for<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.880> team<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.480> what<00:02:58.690> we're<00:02:58.840> gonna

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
clear for the team and what we're gonna

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.650 
clear for the team and what we're gonna
end<00:02:59.049> up<00:02:59.290> making<00:02:59.790> if<00:03:00.790> we<00:03:00.910> don't<00:03:01.090> have<00:03:01.299> clear

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
end up making if we don't have clear

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.210 
end up making if we don't have clear
concepts<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.260> lot<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.470> times<00:03:02.620> we<00:03:02.769> find<00:03:03.010> we'll

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
concepts a lot of times we find we'll

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.190 
concepts a lot of times we find we'll
you<00:03:03.730> know<00:03:03.790> golf<00:03:04.060> in<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.269> wrong<00:03:04.480> direction<00:03:04.690> or

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
you know golf in the wrong direction or

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.599 
you know golf in the wrong direction or
spend<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.560> lot<00:03:05.709> of<00:03:05.739> wasted<00:03:06.100> time<00:03:06.220> on<00:03:06.280> something

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
spend a lot of wasted time on something

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.310 
spend a lot of wasted time on something
that<00:03:06.760> if<00:03:06.940> we<00:03:07.060> had<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.209> really<00:03:07.480> strong<00:03:07.690> image<00:03:08.170> in

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
that if we had a really strong image in

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.110 
that if we had a really strong image in
the<00:03:08.380> beginning<00:03:08.799> we<00:03:09.549> would<00:03:09.700> have<00:03:09.790> nailed<00:03:09.970> it

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
the beginning we would have nailed it

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.770 
the beginning we would have nailed it
right<00:03:10.150> away

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
right away

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.259 
right away
so<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.980> concept<00:03:12.280> piece<00:03:12.519> Ray's<00:03:12.850> working<00:03:13.180> on

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
so the concept piece Ray's working on

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.630 
so the concept piece Ray's working on
right<00:03:13.420> now<00:03:13.600> is<00:03:13.859> one<00:03:14.859> of<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.040> statues<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.459> the

modeling and immediately and then as
soon<00:03:33.790> as<00:03:33.940> that's<00:03:34.060> done<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.630> gets<00:03:34.810> textured<00:03:35.230> and

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.720 
soon as that's done it gets textured and
goes<00:03:35.500> right<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.859> game<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.250> then<00:03:36.340> we<00:03:36.459> look

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
goes right in the game and then we look

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.580 
goes right in the game and then we look
and<00:03:37.060> make<00:03:37.510> sure<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:37.810> working<00:03:38.110> for<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.349> space
