here's how they hook up goes start with

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.680 
here's how they hook up goes start with
the<00:01:44.380> white<00:01:45.369> wire<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:48.250> will<00:01:48.490> go<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:48.820> the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
the white wire and that will go to the

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.550 
the white wire and that will go to the
black<00:01:50.140> wire<00:01:51.840> look<00:01:52.840> for<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.080> black<00:01:53.259> wire

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
black wire look for the black wire

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.670 
black wire look for the black wire
that's<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:54.009> ground<00:01:56.579> okay<00:01:57.579> now<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.030> next<00:01:58.180> wire

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
that's the ground okay now the next wire

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.870 
that's the ground okay now the next wire
will<00:01:59.680> be<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.250> brown<00:02:00.840> wire<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:03.520> will<00:02:03.729> go

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
will be the brown wire and that will go

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.740 
will be the brown wire and that will go
to<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.329> brown<00:02:04.689> wire<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.939> vehicle<00:02:06.939> the

vehicle Brown wire and the one from the
the<00:02:12.390> trailer<00:02:13.390> hookup<00:02:13.860> go<00:02:14.860> together<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:15.519> that

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
the trailer hookup go together and that

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.430 
the trailer hookup go together and that
is<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.600> taillight<00:02:17.910> now<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.000> next<00:02:19.299> one<00:02:19.450> will

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
is the taillight now the next one will

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.890 
is the taillight now the next one will
be<00:02:21.570> yellow<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:23.110> yellow<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:25.360> will<00:02:25.540> be<00:02:25.690> the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.250 
be yellow to yellow that will be the
left<00:02:26.380> directional

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.309 

and<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:33.249> one<00:02:33.549> right<00:02:33.909> here<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:35.319> red<00:02:35.739> wire

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
and this one right here is the red wire

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.629 
and this one right here is the red wire
from<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:39.900> trailer<00:02:40.900> connector<00:02:41.469> and<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:42.430> will

right

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
right

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.449 
right
directional<00:03:09.810> now<00:03:10.810> what<00:03:11.079> I've<00:03:11.199> done<00:03:11.230> is<00:03:11.739> I

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
directional now what I've done is I

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.129 
directional now what I've done is I
remove<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.569> rear<00:03:13.870> package<00:03:14.620> shelf<00:03:14.919> and<00:03:16.139> I'm

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
remove the rear package shelf and I'm

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.349 
remove the rear package shelf and I'm
going<00:03:17.439> to<00:03:17.500> splice<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.280> wire<00:03:18.519> in<00:03:18.879> underneath

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
going to splice the wire in underneath

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.629 
going to splice the wire in underneath
the<00:03:19.510> shelf<00:03:22.319> now<00:03:23.319> underneath<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:24.069> package

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
the shelf now underneath the package

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.869 
the shelf now underneath the package
shelf<00:03:24.939> the<00:03:25.719> doc<00:03:26.230> green<00:03:26.560> wire<00:03:26.889> from<00:03:26.919> the<00:03:27.459> right

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.649 
shelf the doc green wire from the right
directional<00:03:28.599> will<00:03:29.439> go<00:03:29.620> over<00:03:30.159> to<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:31.359> left

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
directional will go over to the left

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.770 
directional will go over to the left
side<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.169> vehicle<00:03:32.349> and<00:03:32.799> you<00:03:33.310> can<00:03:34.269> tap<00:03:34.569> it

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
tapped a another wire you'll have to

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.469 
tapped a another wire you'll have to
find<00:03:42.729> another<00:03:43.629> piece<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.989> wire<00:03:45.150> tap<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.329> into

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
find another piece of wire tap it into

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.439 
find another piece of wire tap it into
the<00:03:46.599> dark<00:03:46.930> green<00:03:47.409> wire<00:03:48.250> which<00:03:48.549> is<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:49.000> right

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:49.449 
the dark green wire which is the right

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:55.679 
the dark green wire which is the right
directional<00:03:50.049> and<00:03:51.599> then<00:03:52.599> it<00:03:52.989> will<00:03:53.400> run<00:03:54.689> right

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
directional and then it will run right

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:01.850 
directional and then it will run right
down<00:03:55.959> here

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.440 

and<00:04:02.010> then<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.150> will<00:04:03.300> go<00:04:03.540> into<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.350> trunk<00:04:04.710> area

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.080 

now<00:04:09.450> here's<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.840> look<00:04:10.140> at<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.800> wire<00:04:11.100> coming

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
now here's a look at the wire coming

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.320 
now here's a look at the wire coming
through<00:04:12.510> into<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.960> trunk<00:04:13.230> area<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:14.330> you'll

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
through into the trunk area and you'll

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:22.030 
through into the trunk area and you'll
wrap<00:04:15.630> it<00:04:15.780> around<00:04:15.900> this<00:04:16.410> bundle<00:04:16.799> right<00:04:17.190> here

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.780 

and<00:04:23.040> then<00:04:23.340> you'll<00:04:25.040> put<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.160> underneath<00:04:26.460> this

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
and then you'll put it underneath this

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:35.620 
and then you'll put it underneath this
piece<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:30.110> it<00:04:31.110> will<00:04:31.230> come<00:04:31.530> down<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:33.000> bundle

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.270 

and<00:04:36.630> you'll<00:04:36.960> come<00:04:37.320> over<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:39.330> your<00:04:40.040> area<00:04:41.040> where

and you'll come over to your area where
you<00:04:41.340> spliced<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:46.070> you'll<00:04:47.070> splice<00:04:47.520> that

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
you spliced it and you'll splice that

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.910 
you spliced it and you'll splice that
wire<00:04:48.920> into<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:50.550> green<00:04:51.180> wire<00:04:51.860> from<00:04:52.860> the

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
wire into the green wire from the

00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:00.880
