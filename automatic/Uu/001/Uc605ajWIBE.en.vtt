in Florida in the mid nineties and then

the<00:00:25.810> reports<00:00:26.349> of<00:00:27.599> appearances<00:00:28.599> were<00:00:29.109> pretty

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:29.499 
the reports of appearances were pretty

the reports of appearances were pretty
much<00:00:29.710> restricted<00:00:30.640> to<00:00:30.909> Florida<00:00:31.509> and<00:00:31.720> maybe

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
much restricted to Florida and maybe

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.680 
much restricted to Florida and maybe
South<00:00:32.980> Carolina<00:00:33.400> a<00:00:33.550> little<00:00:33.790> bit<00:00:33.910> for<00:00:34.120> five<00:00:34.360> to

six<00:00:34.900> years<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.290> then<00:00:35.470> after<00:00:35.590> that<00:00:35.860> when<00:00:36.430> they

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
six years and then after that when they

crossed to the Bahamas they exploded
throughout<00:00:39.219> the<00:00:39.370> Caribbean<00:00:39.730> so<00:00:40.690> far<00:00:41.020> they're

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
throughout the Caribbean so far they're

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.979 
throughout the Caribbean so far they're
pretty<00:00:41.800> much<00:00:41.980> able<00:00:42.460> to<00:00:42.579> run<00:00:42.789> wild<00:00:43.000> which<00:00:43.960> is

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
pretty much able to run wild which is

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.200 
pretty much able to run wild which is
not<00:00:44.350> good<00:00:44.649> news<00:00:44.680> for<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.250> native<00:00:45.670> fish<00:00:45.910> in

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
not good news for the native fish in

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.290 
not good news for the native fish in
these<00:00:46.329> areas<00:00:46.899> small<00:00:47.769> fish<00:00:48.280> like<00:00:48.309> the<00:00:48.789> social

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
these areas small fish like the social

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.720 
these areas small fish like the social
wrasse<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.590> social<00:00:50.890> rest<00:00:51.070> is<00:00:51.219> a<00:00:51.250> very

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
wrasse the social rest is a very

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.430 
wrasse the social rest is a very
important<00:00:52.149> functional<00:00:52.660> role<00:00:52.960> in<00:00:53.230> the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
important functional role in the

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.709 
important functional role in the
habitats<00:00:53.920> they<00:00:54.760> go<00:00:54.910> out<00:00:55.059> of<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:55.390> reef<00:00:55.510> they

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
habitats they go out of the reef they

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.270 
habitats they go out of the reef they
pick<00:00:55.929> the<00:00:56.050> plant<00:00:56.289> on<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:56.559> come<00:00:56.769> back<00:00:56.890> in<00:00:57.070> but

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
pick the plant on and come back in but

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.590 
pick the plant on and come back in but
they<00:00:57.460> spend<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.879> rest<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.120> their<00:00:58.239> lives<00:00:58.390> in

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
they spend the rest of their lives in

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.389 
they spend the rest of their lives in
the<00:00:58.690> reef<00:00:58.839> so<00:00:59.109> they<00:00:59.230> fertilize<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.890> reefs<00:01:00.070> and

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
the reef so they fertilize the reefs and

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.799 
the reef so they fertilize the reefs and
when<00:01:00.699> they<00:01:00.820> die<00:01:00.969> their<00:01:01.300> bodies

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
when they die their bodies

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:02.939 
when they die their bodies
settle<00:01:02.109> down<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.410> trees<00:01:02.620> so<00:01:02.800> they're

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
settle down the trees so they're

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.560 
settle down the trees so they're
effectively<00:01:03.429> transferring<00:01:03.969> nutrients<00:01:04.449> from

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
effectively transferring nutrients from

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.900 
effectively transferring nutrients from
one<00:01:04.870> habitat<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.770> pelagic<00:01:06.010> habitats<00:01:06.550> to<00:01:06.790> the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
one habitat the pelagic habitats to the

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.790 
one habitat the pelagic habitats to the
other<00:01:07.060> which<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.630> reef<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:08.380> if<00:01:08.470> they<00:01:08.620> go

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
other which is the reef so if they go

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.249 
other which is the reef so if they go
extinct<00:01:09.369> we<00:01:10.270> don't<00:01:10.450> know<00:01:10.540> exactly<00:01:10.689> what<00:01:11.110> is

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
extinct we don't know exactly what is

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.810 
extinct we don't know exactly what is
going<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.470> happen<00:01:11.619> but<00:01:11.860> we<00:01:12.040> do<00:01:12.100> know<00:01:12.430> that<00:01:12.460> it's

going to happen but we do know that it's

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.850 
going to happen but we do know that it's

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
gonna have negative consequences to be

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.249 
gonna have negative consequences to be
active<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.270> recently<00:01:16.270> Louise<00:01:16.750> headed<00:01:17.140> to

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
active that recently Louise headed to

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.140 
active that recently Louise headed to
Belize<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:18.040> see<00:01:18.189> if<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.430> fish<00:01:18.700> had<00:01:18.970> reached

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
Belize to see if the fish had reached

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.810 
Belize to see if the fish had reached
that<00:01:19.360> far<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.619> see<00:01:20.799> how<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.009> social<00:01:21.549> rafts

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
that far and to see how the social rafts

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.630 
that far and to see how the social rafts
were<00:01:22.180> faring<00:01:22.659> we<00:01:23.350> found<00:01:23.680> that<00:01:23.950> lionfish<00:01:24.310> are

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
were faring we found that lionfish are

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.730 
were faring we found that lionfish are
everywhere<00:01:25.060> they're<00:01:25.299> very<00:01:25.540> common<00:01:25.899> very<00:01:26.140> high

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
everywhere they're very common very high

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.550 
everywhere they're very common very high
numbers<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.369> they<00:01:27.939> are<00:01:28.119> eating<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.810> social

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
numbers and they are eating the social

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.830 
numbers and they are eating the social
races<00:01:29.890> in<00:01:30.040> large<00:01:30.220> numbers<00:01:30.610> also<00:01:30.759> to<00:01:31.659> determine

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
races in large numbers also to determine

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.580 
races in large numbers also to determine
this<00:01:32.350> Louise<00:01:32.979> had<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.369> go<00:01:33.490> lionfish<00:01:33.909> hunting

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this Louise had to go lionfish hunting

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.929 
this Louise had to go lionfish hunting
catching<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.799> lionfish<00:01:36.070> is<00:01:36.340> extremely<00:01:36.880> easy

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
catching the lionfish is extremely easy

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.969 
catching the lionfish is extremely easy
what's<00:01:37.299> tricky<00:01:37.630> is<00:01:37.780> handling<00:01:38.380> them<00:01:38.530> after<00:01:38.890> you

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
what's tricky is handling them after you

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.310 
what's tricky is handling them after you
catch<00:01:39.189> them<00:01:39.460> so<00:01:40.149> they<00:01:40.570> have<00:01:40.810> very<00:01:40.840> poisonous

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
catch them so they have very poisonous

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.789 
catch them so they have very poisonous
flies<00:01:41.740> along<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.159> door<00:01:42.340> so<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.969> anal<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:43.960> the

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
flies along the door so the anal and the

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.999 
flies along the door so the anal and the
ventral<00:01:45.159> fins<00:01:45.369> and<00:01:45.700> if<00:01:46.570> you<00:01:46.750> just<00:01:46.960> barely<00:01:47.560> cut

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
ventral fins and if you just barely cut

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.529 
ventral fins and if you just barely cut
your<00:01:48.189> skin<00:01:48.430> with<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.759> spine<00:01:49.240> you're<00:01:49.390> gonna

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
your skin with the spine you're gonna

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:50.760 
your skin with the spine you're gonna
feel<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.869> venom<00:01:50.020> that<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.380> they're

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
feel the venom that you they're

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.130 
feel the venom that you they're
punctured<00:01:51.310> really<00:01:52.090> deep<00:01:52.299> then<00:01:52.630> it's<00:01:52.899> gonna<00:01:53.049> be

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
punctured really deep then it's gonna be

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.969 
punctured really deep then it's gonna be
painful

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
painful

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.209 
painful
I<00:01:54.189> had<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:54.969> close<00:01:55.450> encounter<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:56.259> it<00:01:56.770> was<00:01:57.039> an
