00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.649

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.549
 photofact is generally felt well kapets 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.020
 felt very small 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.710
 after two months of using iphone 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.369

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 my hand a second before i phone 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.070

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.590
 said this phone i used the year you 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.390
 You know , this was my first iphone 7 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.740
 on iphone 5s was first and with that 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.630
 he had no telephone in total 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.549
 problems that is, it just worked and 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.069
 he worked all this time so 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.409
 safely without hanging up there 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.080
 everything was fine with him 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.569
 iphone 6 and 6 between two months and i can 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.950
 say that from such ease the phone from 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.350
 the fact that he is such a small yazu from 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.630
 but this unaccustomed know here and so is 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.009
 take iphone 5s in hand i feel 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.049
 some kind of solidity 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.569
 and confidence in the grip of such a safaris 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.310
 Unfortunately there is not even let my and this with 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.170
 already in the case was received but however 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.840
 iphone 5s is something even more 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.019
 iphone 5s and it feels like you were 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.140
 born the phone hands became the figure 6 i 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.750
 see said no I don't know 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.390
 true but it feels very cool but 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.769
 it feels very small regret i 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.750
 can't turn it off now because 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.590
 the battery sat completely at 0 but needed 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.400
 recharge it 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.570
 and you know, I don't see the screen now, but 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.670
 such a kan and I already unfortunately too 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.130
 lost the habit and don't know if I can switch to 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.109
 a generation ago because even during 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.200
 viewing was evil not to return garden n 6 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:48.060
 on iphone 5s but in the video which one will be here 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.970

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.660
 good you get used to fast iphone screen 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.890
 6 is certainly better than the iphone 5s. 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.109
 the fact that he has more and more information 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.299
 fits more visible therefore 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.930
