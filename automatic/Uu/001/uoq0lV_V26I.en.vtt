00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:11.210
 good good food has 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.990
 new senses already training super 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.369
 strong right now being in the mornings 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.050
 but to the I have a limiting factor are 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.439
 Carbohydrates and working on them 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.550
 quite taking care with them 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.800
 working hard of sense enough 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 changes has gone very well for me and in the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.509
 all times and if dodging the weight 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.009
 suffered a cutting stage and the truth yes 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.780
 I find it very hard because I need 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.610
 say the energy but if I the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.489
 formal approval of the deficit stage 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.489
 caloric you will always feel weak 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.489
 so 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.310
 It has already passed and we Llanes 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.310
 like me protein 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.280
 and oil that was lost are entering 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.280
 categorize 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.920
 hello such friends welcome once 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.630
 more to a new chapter of breaking 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.310
 myths my name andrés my name is 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.470
 thiago and today we will respond 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.020
 the question is really necessary 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.490
 eat every three hours good from the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.770
 older bodybuilders and 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.360
 surely you have heard them 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.640
 they have always been preaching from 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.100
 that it is necessary as a norm to eat each 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.630
 two or three hours and do six or more 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.119
 meals during the day and that's going to 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.680
 be the most optimal what you most 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.479
 will lead to gain muscle mass and what 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.899
 that surely many of them do 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.390
 even the bodybuilding champions without 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.630
 many of them are still doing this 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.759
 they do it under basically three 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.140
 reasons that they believe is that they are 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.210
 which 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.940
 and support this eating every three hours 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.390
 The first is that it will accelerate your 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.610
 metabolism as a second is going to improve you 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.520
 protein absorption and as a third party 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.270
 will avoid as 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.310
 André the catabolism now these three 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.280
 reasons I 'm going to apply each one 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.010
 because they are not as well as they say 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.190
 because the first one that all the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.049
 metabolism that the metabolism responds 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.000
 more than all the amount of meals that 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.489
 had more in the day and the amount of 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.739
 protein then it does not matter if you eat 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.680
 the same amount of calorie food 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.390
 and proteins in three or four meals like that 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.069
 you eat them in six or more meals 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.730
 eating at the end of the day the same 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.160
 quantity 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.700
 then the metabolism will respond 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.530
 in the same way as second the part 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.130
 of protein absorption 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.440
 although logically it is better to eat more 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.060
 of some meal of the day normally in 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.640
 three or four meals a day tends to 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.010
 be a good figure and distribute the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.299
 protein as equitable as possible in 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.180
 those meals 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:01.840
 it is not necessary to do it more that they are more 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.129
 of 45 meals already reaches a point in 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.660
 that protein absorption is not going to 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.670
 improve then the mother for the 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.590
 Most people eat three or 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.020
 Up to four meals a day will be 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.150
 more than optimal for 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.310
 and as the last part of Catholicism 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.650
 yes they do not really have any 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.580
 foundation for you really 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.790
 categorize your body needs 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.460
 basically being hungry for 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.900
 many hours possibly more than a day 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.880
 enduring hunger and I think for the 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.560
 most of us this is not going to be a 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.810
 problem we should worry about 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.090
 that is, believe me in three hours 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.520
 will not categorize besides have in 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.740
 mind that food lasts much longer than 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.710
 work adhering yes had consumes 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.170
 a meal high in protein and 25 30 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.630
 grams of protein in a meal was 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.930
 It can last up to 6 7 to 8 hours 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.670
 digesting it then you do not have to why 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.620
 worry that your body already knows 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.500
 all the reserves and is destroying your 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.780
 muscle mass yes it is true that we 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.610
 we recommend our advisors to eat 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.500
 from four to six months a day this 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.510
 we do giving it a little more focus 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.240
 Functional to control three points 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.190
 keys first the second anxiety that 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.800
 fits your schedule and second and 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.239
 third the digestion in anxiety the 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.199
 you can control 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.919
 4 to 6 times daily because it is difficult 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:25.150
 spend a long period without eating and not 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.580
 avoid the temptations that present themselves 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.340
 in your daily life now as to the 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.590
 schedule is easier to accommodate 46 meals 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.479
 actuaries whether they work in a 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.599
 office if you study whatever it is 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.639
 your daily activity and as for the 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.220
 digestion for a person who is in 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.800
 stage of muscular gain would be very 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.630
 difficult to eat 3000 calories or more 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.300
 of 3000 calories and just three 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.840
 meals this is why sometimes you 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.400
 we recommend eating 4 to 5 those from 4 to 6 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.169
 Daily meals to our advisors 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.300
 good friends you know they do not have 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:02.570
 to worry about always eating each 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.449
 three hours make your diet more flexible 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.740
 the flexible diet supports a lot that's why 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.930
 that it is not necessary to eat every three 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.229
 hours simply adapt the amount of 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.520
 meals to your lifestyle good I hope 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.470

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.320
 three hours
