00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
hacking and I'm gonna show you one of my

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.740 
hacking and I'm gonna show you one of my
most<00:00:17.039> effective<00:00:17.310> strategies<00:00:18.270> when<00:00:18.449> hacking

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
most effective strategies when hacking

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.130 
most effective strategies when hacking
at<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> place<00:00:19.939> in<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.210> strategy<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.810> make<00:00:21.960> use

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
at a place in this strategy we make use

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.529 
at a place in this strategy we make use
of<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.560> overhead<00:00:23.010> train<00:00:23.369> more<00:00:23.939> specifically

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
of the overhead train more specifically

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.330 
of the overhead train more specifically
the<00:00:24.720> train<00:00:24.990> stations<00:00:25.529> now<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.890> reason<00:00:26.189> why<00:00:26.310> I

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the train stations now the reason why I

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.009 
the train stations now the reason why I
like<00:00:26.580> using<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.970> train<00:00:27.180> stations<00:00:27.599> because

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
like using the train stations because

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.169 
like using the train stations because
they're<00:00:28.590> littered<00:00:28.949> throughout<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.910> entire

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
they're littered throughout the entire

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.569 
they're littered throughout the entire
map<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:31.109> more<00:00:31.289> often<00:00:31.500> than<00:00:31.769> not<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.309> find

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
map so more often than not you can find

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.549 
map so more often than not you can find
one<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.940> range<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> player<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.380> you're

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
one in range of the player that you're

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.900 
one in range of the player that you're
trying<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.920> hack<00:00:35.130> another<00:00:35.460> reason<00:00:35.730> why<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
trying to hack another reason why is

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.060 
trying to hack another reason why is
because<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.510> vertical<00:00:36.690> play<00:00:37.140> when

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
because of the vertical play when

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.510 
because of the vertical play when
hacking<00:00:38.550> people<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.090> lot<00:00:39.270> easier<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:40.520> hide

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
hacking people it's a lot easier to hide

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.670 
hacking people it's a lot easier to hide
in<00:00:41.730> areas<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.510> multiple<00:00:43.020> levels<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.469> search

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
in areas with multiple levels to search

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.799 
in areas with multiple levels to search
like<00:00:43.860> parking<00:00:44.309> garages<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.090> train<00:00:45.329> stations

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
like parking garages the train stations

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.619 
like parking garages the train stations
buildings<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.469> stairs<00:00:46.739> stuff<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.370> that

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
buildings with stairs stuff like that

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.970 
buildings with stairs stuff like that
versus<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.899> street<00:00:49.140> they<00:00:49.379> search<00:00:49.739> one

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
versus just a street they search one

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.100 
versus just a street they search one
level<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.340> find<00:00:50.550> easy<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.449> right<00:00:51.719> now<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> just

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
level they find easy so right now I just

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.709 
level they find easy so right now I just
profile<00:00:52.980> them<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.489> number<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.030> objective

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
profile them so my number one objective

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.020 
profile them so my number one objective
is<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> nearest<00:00:55.649> station

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.360 

see<00:01:01.719> one<00:01:01.870> on<00:01:01.899> my<00:01:02.109> map<00:01:02.410> it's<00:01:02.649> up<00:01:02.829> north<00:01:03.160> but<00:01:03.309> I

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
see one on my map it's up north but I

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.799 
see one on my map it's up north but I
can't<00:01:03.670> drive<00:01:03.879> up<00:01:04.030> that<00:01:04.210> road<00:01:04.390> as<00:01:04.510> a<00:01:04.540> player

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
can't drive up that road as a player

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.450 
can't drive up that road as a player
just<00:01:04.869> drop<00:01:05.259> down<00:01:05.440> into<00:01:05.650> it<00:01:05.860> I'm<00:01:06.040> gonna<00:01:06.159> drive

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
just drop down into it I'm gonna drive

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:15.860 
just drop down into it I'm gonna drive
around

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.240 

and<00:01:16.870> this<00:01:17.020> is<00:01:17.110> what<00:01:17.260> you<00:01:17.380> don't<00:01:17.590> want<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.890> do<00:01:17.979> is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
and this is what you don't want to do is

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.860 
and this is what you don't want to do is
make<00:01:18.460> an<00:01:18.580> ass<00:01:18.760> of<00:01:18.940> yourself<00:01:19.000> running<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.570> cars

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
make an ass of yourself running the cars

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.850 
make an ass of yourself running the cars
and<00:01:20.530> fences<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:21.310> garbage<00:01:22.290> I'm<00:01:23.290> not<00:01:23.680> always

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
and fences and garbage I'm not always

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.320 
and fences and garbage I'm not always
the<00:01:24.070> best<00:01:24.280> when<00:01:24.490> it<00:01:24.550> comes<00:01:24.729> to<00:01:24.850> not<00:01:25.030> running

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
the best when it comes to not running

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.109 
the best when it comes to not running
into<00:01:25.450> shit<00:01:25.750> but<00:01:25.990> I'm<00:01:26.619> I<00:01:26.950> think<00:01:27.790> I'm<00:01:27.940> pretty

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
into shit but I'm I think I'm pretty

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.820 
into shit but I'm I think I'm pretty
good<00:01:28.300> at<00:01:28.360> hacking<00:01:28.810> more<00:01:28.990> often<00:01:29.229> or<00:01:29.380> not<00:01:29.500> I<00:01:29.530> get

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
good at hacking more often or not I get

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.010 
good at hacking more often or not I get
successful<00:01:30.340> hacks<00:01:30.670> and<00:01:30.940> failed<00:01:31.180> ones<00:01:31.420> so

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
successful hacks and failed ones so

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.450 
successful hacks and failed ones so
Madden<00:01:32.350> here<00:01:32.500> at<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.710> station<00:01:32.920> I'm<00:01:33.130> gonna<00:01:33.310> go

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
Madden here at the station I'm gonna go

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.890 
Madden here at the station I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:33.580> and<00:01:33.670> initiate<00:01:33.970> first<00:01:34.450> thing<00:01:34.690> I'm<00:01:34.810> gonna

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
ahead and initiate first thing I'm gonna

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.960 
ahead and initiate first thing I'm gonna
do<00:01:35.229> is<00:01:35.619> I'm<00:01:36.280> gonna<00:01:36.400> run<00:01:36.640> upstairs<00:01:41.580> now<00:01:42.580> this<00:01:42.820> is

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
do is I'm gonna run upstairs now this is

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.399 
do is I'm gonna run upstairs now this is
where<00:01:43.150> it<00:01:43.210> gets<00:01:43.270> clever<00:01:43.690> I'm<00:01:43.930> gonna<00:01:44.140> run<00:01:44.380> to

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
where it gets clever I'm gonna run to

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.219 
where it gets clever I'm gonna run to
the<00:01:44.560> other<00:01:44.770> side<00:01:45.100> here<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:46.180> I'm<00:01:46.659> gonna<00:01:46.869> hop

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
the other side here and I'm gonna hop

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.200 
the other side here and I'm gonna hop
over<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:47.979> fence<00:01:48.280> sometimes<00:01:48.729> it's<00:01:48.910> a<00:01:48.970> rail

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
over this fence sometimes it's a rail

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.510 
over this fence sometimes it's a rail
sometimes<00:01:49.690> you<00:01:49.840> can't<00:01:50.020> even<00:01:50.080> do<00:01:50.320> that<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
sometimes you can't even do that and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.219 
sometimes you can't even do that and
then<00:01:51.700> I'm<00:01:51.789> gonna<00:01:51.940> hide<00:01:52.210> up<00:01:52.450> here<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:52.990> roof

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
then I'm gonna hide up here on the roof

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.440 
then I'm gonna hide up here on the roof
very<00:01:53.740> few<00:01:54.160> people<00:01:54.369> know<00:01:54.729> how<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.000> get<00:01:55.149> up<00:01:55.300> on

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
very few people know how to get up on

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.240 
very few people know how to get up on
this<00:01:55.539> roof<00:01:55.720> and<00:01:56.259> now<00:01:56.440> all<00:01:56.649> of<00:01:56.680> them<00:01:56.890> have<00:01:57.070> this

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
from this point on I'm just gonna use

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.180 
from this point on I'm just gonna use
the<00:02:01.929> cameras<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.380> keep<00:02:02.530> eyes<00:02:02.740> on<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.009> player

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
as it's always a good idea to keep eyes

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.690 
as it's always a good idea to keep eyes
on<00:02:05.350> them<00:02:05.470> just<00:02:05.679> to<00:02:05.860> see<00:02:06.009> where<00:02:06.220> he's<00:02:06.369> at<00:02:06.490> and

where he's at and I caught a brief
glimpse<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:21.010> him<00:02:21.160> right<00:02:21.489> there<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.910> looks<00:02:22.060> like

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
glimpse of him right there it looks like

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.270 
glimpse of him right there it looks like
he's<00:02:22.360> on<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.750> station<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.739> I'm<00:02:23.829> gonna<00:02:23.920> exit

out and make sure he doesn't know how to
get<00:02:25.510> up<00:02:25.570> here<00:02:25.720> I've<00:02:25.840> only<00:02:25.930> had<00:02:26.200> one<00:02:26.260> other

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.630 
player and know how to get up here and I
just<00:02:28.180> move<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.690> sometimes<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.079> have<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.260> move

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
just move so sometimes you have to move

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.890 
just move so sometimes you have to move
like<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.670> said<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:30.910> probably<00:02:31.030> don't<00:02:31.209> have<00:02:31.299> 12

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
like I said I probably don't have 12

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.050 
like I said I probably don't have 12
with<00:02:32.079> 20<00:02:32.350> times<00:02:32.560> only<00:02:33.340> having<00:02:33.610> one<00:02:33.670> player

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
with 20 times only having one player

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.580 
with 20 times only having one player
know<00:02:34.299> about<00:02:34.540> how<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.810> get<00:02:34.959> up<00:02:35.049> here<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:38.380> right

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
know about how to get up here so right

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.560 
know about how to get up here so right
now<00:02:38.799> I'm<00:02:39.100> just<00:02:39.250> gonna<00:02:39.370> hack<00:02:39.700> random<00:02:40.060> items<00:02:40.420> so

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
now I'm just gonna hack random items so

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.060 
now I'm just gonna hack random items so
it's<00:02:40.660> another<00:02:40.840> strategy<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.290> used<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.739> get<00:02:41.890> his

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
it's another strategy I used to get his

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.069 
it's another strategy I used to get his
attention<00:02:42.280> towards<00:02:42.970> those<00:02:43.150> items<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.810> off<00:02:44.049> of

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
attention towards those items and off of

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.130 
attention towards those items and off of
where<00:02:44.410> I'm<00:02:44.530> hiding<00:02:45.570> if<00:02:46.570> you<00:02:46.720> get<00:02:46.870> really

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
where I'm hiding if you get really

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.479 
where I'm hiding if you get really
clever<00:02:47.440> with<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:47.950> depending<00:02:48.250> on<00:02:48.340> what

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
clever with this and depending on what

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.090 
clever with this and depending on what
you<00:02:48.579> can<00:02:48.730> hack<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.209> can<00:02:49.360> lead<00:02:49.570> players<00:02:50.100> way

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
you can hack you can lead players way

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.150 
you can hack you can lead players way
far<00:02:51.489> away<00:02:51.700> from<00:02:51.760> you

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
far away from you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.500 
far away from you
so<00:02:54.160> again<00:02:54.370> using<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.730> cameras<00:02:55.150> looks<00:02:55.360> like

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
so again using the cameras looks like

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.110 
so again using the cameras looks like
that<00:02:55.690> steam<00:02:55.959> pipe<00:02:56.170> kinda<00:02:56.470> distracted<00:02:57.040> him<00:02:57.160> you

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
that steam pipe kinda distracted him you

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.490 
that steam pipe kinda distracted him you
gotta<00:02:58.269> be<00:02:58.360> careful<00:02:58.660> though<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:58.930> had<00:02:59.049> one<00:02:59.290> player

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
gotta be careful though I had one player

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.289 
gotta be careful though I had one player
spot<00:03:00.160> me<00:03:00.280> from<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.519> street<00:03:00.790> down<00:03:00.970> there<00:03:01.180> and
