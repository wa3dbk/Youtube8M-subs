00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.880
 so on emilie I will show you 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.010
 how to define the loops give the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.600
 flexibility to his hair in order to have 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.500
 a much freer hairstyle and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.750
 much more in volume 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.180
 I will modify the hair using 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.000
 of a water spray then I'm going 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.870
 apply the building cream me 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.480
 to solidify my loop and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.070
 give a structure to give a strength 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.070
 to the whole of the hair 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.530
 so I dry naturally giving 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.899
 circular movements in order to 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.670
 release the loop and give again 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.850
 once all the flexibility and all 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.100
 elegance and I will end in crinkling 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.489
 using the hand as a 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.039
 brush 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.049
 but on some wick I will use 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.140
 also the brush so I give 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.939
 a lot of scale my gesture I twist 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.680
 around my brush to give still 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.229
 once a definition a little more 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.509
 perfect for some of them 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.000
 to condition or 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.860
 structure a little bit more the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.110
 hair and of course to give again 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.340
 once shine and this aspect 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.380
 cosmetics 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.200
 next step i'm going to use a paste 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.900
 in order to more precisely define and 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.430
 place the locks around the face so 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.350
 to give a little more style a little 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.520
 more than 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.009
 consistency a little over 2 of textures 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.310
 with border wicks or some 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.470
 wicks chooses so use the pac 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.759
 in the hand and redefining simply 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:53.600
 with taste and harmony in finish I 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.940
 will use a spray then a spray 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.130
 fogger again to give 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.310
 not something so much 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.799
 fixing but rather the two soups 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.020
 accompanying the entire texture 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.670
 to get shine of course 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.280
 but also a hairstyle that goes 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.280
 to move and who will live in life
