00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that that's currently not possible and I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.319 
that that's currently not possible and I

also believe there is no option to add
multiple<00:01:03.899> accounts<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.820> but<00:01:05.869> for<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
multiple accounts in that but for a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.039 
multiple accounts in that but for a
single<00:01:07.290> user<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.130> quite<00:01:08.430> good<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.049> one

you go then you can scroll in zoom in

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.810 
you go then you can scroll in zoom in
zoom<00:04:10.720> out<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.650> thinks<00:04:11.920> of<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.070> from<00:04:12.640> this

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
zoom out and thinks of that from this

zoom out and thinks of that from this
small<00:04:13.180> window<00:04:13.570> here<00:04:13.600> so<00:04:14.560> that's<00:04:14.800> quite<00:04:14.980> cool

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
small window here so that's quite cool

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.280 
small window here so that's quite cool
it's<00:04:15.520> quite<00:04:15.730> unique<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.390> this<00:04:16.510> app<00:04:16.720> I<00:04:16.900> think<00:04:17.140> I

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
it's quite unique to this app I think I

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.630 
it's quite unique to this app I think I
haven't<00:04:17.530> seen<00:04:17.709> this<00:04:17.920> in<00:04:17.980> some<00:04:18.370> of<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.520> other
