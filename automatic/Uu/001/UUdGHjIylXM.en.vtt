00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.120
 get excited 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.220
 the website where all this will be 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.930
 take place is in the description 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.820
 if you click on us on the site then you can 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.620
 you already choose ten or so and you can find us there 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.510
 also order figurines as a promotion 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.820
 next item or actual item 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.010
 plan because these are two things 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.780
 van der valk hotel in vianen very often 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.600
 when i'm in hotel i like it 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.760
 the poli lotion bottles the hubble parties 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.470
 things you all get there 100 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.690
 because that is kind of like that 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.100
 reminder is I am not using it but 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.930
 I just label such a bottle of land too 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.280
 and then finally I want to go 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.480
 at the end just wanted to live 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.760
 in a number of years I probably 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.720
 that there are also a few bottles of one 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.160
 different hotels 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.630
 this is from when we were mine last year 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.190
 Went to celebrate birthday but i did too 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.440
 still bottles from when I was in hotel new 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.239
 york will with sass child is 9 so that too 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.110
 again just ago i don't know 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.520
 you this too 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.470
 You also take things with you to the hotels 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.390
 just as a reminder and I have it 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.340
 about free things that make you a TV 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.590
 you take it as a fun and then finally 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.840
 and quite a large item namely this 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.480
 dress and this is a dress what not now 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.820
 really fits my style 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.890
 used to be our glass alternative and I have 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.019
 I think this dress when I was ten 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.780
 I got a photo shoot done in it 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.850
 with my sister i love in it around 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.989
 summer days and even though I'm going this shirt 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.269
 you probably never wear it again 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.890
 I just can't do it for real 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.180
 because he was l you don't need this 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.560
 misunderstand because I am 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.019
 of course another child but this reminds me 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.519
 just very reminiscent of the past and 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.980
 indeed to my somewhat young people 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.290
 childhood because I just like this dress 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.970
 incredibly beautiful and nice I wore 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.170
 especially not your skater-like clothing 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.239
 to be quot I suppose I also liked 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.070
 nice in this of course was really yes 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.110
 ideal the make sure he is meanwhile 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.340
 almost 8 years old and I still went 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.600
 just very nice to see 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.040
 You must also have an object 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.600
 my story and if you want that 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.609
 like to know in the comments 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.790
 plus whether you are going to watch live shows 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.330
 and of course if you did 10 CDs that was 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.310
 him 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.310
 and now no weather outside of you
