ribbon fold it in half this is my center
point<00:00:47.090> and<00:00:48.090> I'm<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.420> form<00:00:48.810> the<00:00:48.990> crease

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
point and I'm going to form the crease

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.880 
point and I'm going to form the crease
I'm<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.400> to<00:00:50.490> start<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.150> a<00:00:51.620> mountain<00:00:52.620> down

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
I'm going to start with a mountain down

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.920 
I'm going to start with a mountain down
crease<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.520> actually<00:00:53.760> get<00:00:54.060> that<00:00:54.270> by<00:00:54.420> making<00:00:54.690> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
crease I actually get that by making a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.930 
crease I actually get that by making a
mountain<00:00:55.290> up<00:00:55.470> pinching<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.280> together<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
mountain up pinching it together and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.820 
mountain up pinching it together and
flipping<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.840> over<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.560> the<00:00:58.650> most

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
flipping it over it's just the most

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.400 
flipping it over it's just the most
natural<00:00:59.340> way<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.910> me<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.150> make<00:01:00.540> it<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.200> it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
natural way for me to make it and it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.290 
natural way for me to make it and it
gives<00:01:01.560> you<00:01:01.680> nice<00:01:01.890> creases<00:01:02.460> both<00:01:02.730> front<00:01:03.150> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
gives you nice creases both front and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.479 
gives you nice creases both front and
back<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> your<00:01:03.870> bow<00:01:04.049> when<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.860> say<00:01:05.040> mountain

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
back of your bow when you say mountain

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.679 
back of your bow when you say mountain
up<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:05.880> because<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.420> looks<00:01:06.630> like

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
up it's just because it looks like

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.940 
up it's just because it looks like
there's<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> little<00:01:07.229> mountain<00:01:07.530> envision

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
there's a little mountain envision

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.160 
there's a little mountain envision
because<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:09.000> very<00:01:09.240> creative<00:01:09.539> naming<00:01:10.079> it

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
because I was very creative naming it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.289 
because I was very creative naming it
but<00:01:10.350> yes<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.770> looks<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> mountain<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.969> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
but yes it looks like a mountain up and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.260 
but yes it looks like a mountain up and
and<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:13.350> helps<00:01:13.770> remind<00:01:14.340> me<00:01:14.579> every<00:01:14.820> time<00:01:14.969> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and it helps remind me every time to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.819 
and it helps remind me every time to
make<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.630> creases<00:01:15.899> and<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.560> really

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
make the creases and it just really

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.050 
make the creases and it just really
makes<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.999> bow<00:01:18.179> to<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.109> creases<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.310> it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
makes the bow to have the creases and it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.749 
makes the bow to have the creases and it
is<00:01:21.359> important<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.619> very<00:01:22.890> important<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.579> adds

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
is important it's very important it adds

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.469 
is important it's very important it adds
you<00:01:24.539> know<00:01:24.569> that<00:01:24.780> extra<00:01:25.079> style<00:01:25.469> to<00:01:25.829> your<00:01:25.950> bow

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
you know that extra style to your bow

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.200 
you know that extra style to your bow
and<00:01:27.479> give<00:01:27.659> them<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.990> nice<00:01:28.499> boutique<00:01:29.009> look<00:01:29.429> well

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
and give them a nice boutique look well

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.230 
and give them a nice boutique look well
looks<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.899> off<00:01:31.219> absolutely

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
looks like it's all off absolutely

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.789 
looks like it's all off absolutely
absolutely<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.450> we're<00:01:33.600> using<00:01:33.749> satin<00:01:34.409> ribbon

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
absolutely and we're using satin ribbon

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.289 
absolutely and we're using satin ribbon
which<00:01:37.069> can<00:01:38.069> kind<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.549> move<00:01:38.729> around<00:01:38.819> a<00:01:39.179> little

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
which can kind of move around a little

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.510 
which can kind of move around a little
bit<00:01:39.539> so<00:01:39.810> we<00:01:40.049> really<00:01:40.409> want<00:01:40.649> to<00:01:40.740> utilize<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
bit so we really want to utilize the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.120 
bit so we really want to utilize the
towers<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.179> pushed<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.109> down<00:01:43.139> into<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:43.950> mini

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
towers and pushed it down into the mini

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.429 
towers and pushed it down into the mini
bowdabra<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.600> starts<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.869> slip<00:01:46.139> up<00:01:46.319> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
bowdabra and if it starts to slip up you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.190 
bowdabra and if it starts to slip up you
can<00:01:46.590> even<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.639> wand<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.689> push<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.049> down

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
can even use your wand to push it down

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.330 
can even use your wand to push it down
and<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.530> probably<00:01:49.709> will<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.069> to<00:01:50.189> do<00:01:50.310> that

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
and I probably will have to do that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.919 
and I probably will have to do that
throughout<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.999> bow<00:01:51.209> just<00:01:51.509> because<00:01:51.780> we're

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
throughout the bow just because we're

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.219 
throughout the bow just because we're
making<00:01:52.049> such<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> large<00:01:53.069> bow<00:01:53.459> to<00:01:54.270> get<00:01:54.539> a<00:01:54.569> 5<00:01:55.020> inch

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
making such a large bow to get a 5 inch

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
making such a large bow to get a 5 inch
wide<00:01:55.560> bow<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.159> need<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> make<00:01:56.670> two<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> half

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
wide bow I need to make two and a half

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.349 
wide bow I need to make two and a half
inch<00:01:57.539> loops<00:01:57.929> on<00:01:58.229> either<00:01:58.530> side<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.670> I'm<00:01:59.909> making

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
inch loops on either side and I'm making

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.739 
inch loops on either side and I'm making
eight<00:02:01.049> loops<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.639> pretty<00:02:03.029> big<00:02:03.420> bow

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:03.749 
eight loops so this is a pretty big bow

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:08.440 
eight loops so this is a pretty big bow
it'd<00:02:04.709> be<00:02:04.950> perfect<00:02:05.639> for<00:02:06.420> prom<00:02:06.779> or<00:02:07.429> even

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
cheerleading because it's the satin it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.059 
cheerleading because it's the satin it
really<00:02:14.069> has<00:02:14.370> such<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> nice<00:02:14.970> texture<00:02:15.689> and<00:02:16.069> looks

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069

hair going along making my
two-and-a-half-inch<00:02:21.710> loops<00:02:22.280> kind<00:02:22.640> of

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
two-and-a-half-inch loops kind of

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.760 
two-and-a-half-inch loops kind of
adjusting<00:02:23.180> along<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.600> way<00:02:23.720> I'm<00:02:24.590> going<00:02:24.710> to

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
adjusting along the way I'm going to

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.620 
adjusting along the way I'm going to
scrunch<00:02:25.070> down<00:02:25.190> again<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.120> keep<00:02:26.330> that

satin ribbon down inside yeah the center

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.730 
satin ribbon down inside yeah the center
is<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:29.810> slippery<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:31.510> exactly<00:02:32.510> exactly<00:02:32.840> so

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
is so slippery it is exactly exactly so

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.520 
is so slippery it is exactly exactly so
now<00:02:33.770> for<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.430> final<00:02:34.670> one<00:02:35.150> kind<00:02:36.080> of<00:02:36.200> probably

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
now for the final one kind of probably

satin ribbon together and keep it from
moving<00:03:11.810> around<00:03:12.170> satin<00:03:12.850> can<00:03:13.850> be<00:03:14.060> hard<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.450> work

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
moving around satin can be hard to work

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.020 
moving around satin can be hard to work
with<00:03:14.870> but<00:03:15.140> really<00:03:16.100> them<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.640> mini<00:03:16.820> bowdabra

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
with but really them the mini bowdabra

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.330 
with but really them the mini bowdabra
just<00:03:17.600> makes<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:18.020> so<00:03:18.410> easy<00:03:18.440> it's<00:03:19.040> one<00:03:19.160> of<00:03:19.250> the

just makes it so easy it's one of the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.290 
just makes it so easy it's one of the
harder<00:03:19.730> bows<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.390> make<00:03:21.910> but<00:03:22.910> as<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.150> can<00:03:23.240> see

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
harder bows to make but as you can see

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.330 
harder bows to make but as you can see
between<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.960> mini<00:03:24.110> bowdabra<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.860> ruler<00:03:25.160> and

the back and tie it off this is my final

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.520 
the back and tie it off this is my final
knot<00:03:36.230> just<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.650> pull<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.010> all<00:03:37.190> together<00:03:38.530> pull

it<00:03:39.650> tightly<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.370> then<00:03:42.700> I'm<00:03:43.700> going<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:43.910> add<00:03:44.770> the

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
it tightly and then I'm going to add the

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.340 
it tightly and then I'm going to add the
hardware<00:03:47.410> which<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.530> have<00:03:48.770> an<00:03:48.950> alligator<00:03:49.490> clip

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350

ribbon<00:03:55.400> because<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.670> just<00:03:55.820> thought<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.180> would

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
ribbon because I just thought it would

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.290 
ribbon because I just thought it would
make<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.860> fuchsia<00:03:58.250> pop<00:03:59.620> attached<00:04:00.620> here

the<00:04:17.430> interactive<00:04:17.970> CD<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:19.830> I<00:04:19.920> trim<00:04:20.310> away<00:04:20.459> the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
the interactive CD and I trim away the

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.200 
the interactive CD and I trim away the
extra<00:04:21.720> wire<00:04:24.740> okay<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:26.040> I<00:04:26.400> have<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.640> matching

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
extra wire okay and I have a matching

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.420 
extra wire okay and I have a matching
bow<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.720> then<00:04:27.900> should<00:04:28.200> hide<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.770> wire<00:04:28.980> which

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
bow and then should hide the wire which

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.280 
bow and then should hide the wire which
you<00:04:29.580> can<00:04:29.760> do<00:04:29.880> if<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.180> want<00:04:30.210> or<00:04:30.690> you<00:04:30.780> can<00:04:30.810> leave

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
you can do if you want or you can leave

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.060 
you can do if you want or you can leave
the<00:04:31.530> wire

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
the wire

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.930 
the wire
it<00:04:32.700> is<00:04:33.390> pretty<00:04:33.870> it's<00:04:34.860> definitely<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.460> personal

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
it is pretty it's definitely a personal

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.700 
it is pretty it's definitely a personal
choice<00:04:36.270> whether<00:04:36.750> you<00:04:36.930> want<00:04:37.140> to<00:04:37.230> hide<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.590> or

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
choice whether you want to hide it or

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.460 
choice whether you want to hide it or
not<00:04:37.950> I<00:04:38.280> use<00:04:38.880> glue<00:04:39.060> dots<00:04:39.180> because<00:04:39.810> they<00:04:40.080> stick

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
not I use glue dots because they stick

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.760 
not I use glue dots because they stick
really<00:04:40.920> well<00:04:41.070> actually<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.360> wire<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:43.020> so

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
really well actually to the wire and so

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.040 
really well actually to the wire and so
I<00:04:43.800> just<00:04:44.070> kind<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.640> run<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:44.970> along<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.300> wire<00:04:45.690> and

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
I just kind of run it along the wire and

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.550 
I just kind of run it along the wire and
then<00:04:46.890> I<00:04:47.160> have<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.940> piece<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:48.900> ribbon<00:04:49.290> that<00:04:49.410> I

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
then I have a piece of ribbon that I

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.650 
then I have a piece of ribbon that I
knot<00:04:49.920> it<00:04:50.070> in<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.280> center<00:04:50.670> I'm<00:04:51.450> going<00:04:51.600> to

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
knot it in the center I'm going to

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.100 
knot it in the center I'm going to
attach<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:52.110> here<00:04:53.240> bring<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:54.270> around<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:54.840> back

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
attach it here bring it around the back

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.580 
attach it here bring it around the back
and<00:04:55.790> then<00:04:56.790> just<00:04:57.570> kind<00:04:57.810> of<00:04:57.870> trim<00:04:58.200> it<00:04:58.230> up<00:04:58.410> a

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
and then just kind of trim it up a

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.850 
and then just kind of trim it up a
little<00:04:58.770> bit<00:04:59.120> and<00:05:00.120> I'll<00:05:00.330> use<00:05:00.660> some<00:05:01.080> final<00:05:01.560> glue

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
little bit and I'll use some final glue

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.990 
little bit and I'll use some final glue
dots<00:05:02.100> to<00:05:03.080> hold<00:05:04.080> it<00:05:04.200> in<00:05:04.350> place<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:05.580> just<00:05:05.760> cover

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
dots to hold it in place and just cover

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.560 
dots to hold it in place and just cover
up<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.360> wire<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:07.710> give<00:05:07.950> you<00:05:08.130> a<00:05:08.430> nice<00:05:08.850> finished

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570
