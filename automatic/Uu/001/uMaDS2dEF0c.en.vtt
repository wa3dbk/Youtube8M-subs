any<00:00:35.070> patches<00:00:35.450> so<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> guns<00:00:36.809> may<00:00:37.290> change

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
any patches so the guns may change

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.840 
any patches so the guns may change
somewhat<00:00:37.980> by<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> time<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.640> watch<00:00:38.790> this

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
somewhat by the time you watch this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.530 
somewhat by the time you watch this
video<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.770> as<00:00:40.770> an<00:00:41.010> FYI<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.969> series<00:00:42.390> was

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
video and as an FYI this series was

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.959 
video and as an FYI this series was
filmed<00:00:42.780> before<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.260> had<00:00:43.440> prestiged<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.399> this

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
filmed before I had prestiged and this

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.490 
filmed before I had prestiged and this
obviously<00:00:45.149> didn't<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> weapons

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
obviously didn't have all the weapons

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.520 
obviously didn't have all the weapons
available<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.550> compare<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.870> most<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
also all weapons in this series will

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.720 
also all weapons in this series will
have<00:00:55.050> like-for-like<00:00:55.829> attachments<00:00:56.520> where

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and without any further ado let's do it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.470 
and without any further ado let's do it
to<00:01:05.850> it

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.030 

the<00:01:13.080> first<00:01:13.320> handgun<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.890> review<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.730> the<00:01:14.790> m9a1

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
the first handgun to review is the m9a1

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.860 
the first handgun to review is the m9a1
this<00:01:17.040> feels<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.550> very<00:01:17.880> well-rounded<00:01:18.420> gun

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870

handguns and furthermore is a pleasure
to<00:01:31.620> use

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.980 

the<00:01:39.740> crash<00:01:40.010> is<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.340> solid<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.000> balanced<00:01:41.450> pistol

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.320

as<00:01:44.900> standard<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:45.890> has<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.700> highest<00:01:47.090> fire

rate in its class the first three

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.750 
rate in its class the first three
handguns<00:01:50.300> are<00:01:50.600> all<00:01:50.780> very<00:01:51.140> similar<00:01:51.619> weapons<00:01:52.010> so

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
handguns are all very similar weapons so

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.490 
handguns are all very similar weapons so
which<00:01:52.940> one<00:01:53.180> suits<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:53.570> better<00:01:53.840> it's<00:01:54.229> more<00:01:54.470> a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
which one suits you better it's more a

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.260 
which one suits you better it's more a
matter<00:01:54.770> of<00:01:54.920> preference<00:01:55.280> than<00:01:55.729> anything<00:01:56.090> else

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
matter of preference than anything else

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.170 
matter of preference than anything else
but<00:01:57.229> for<00:01:57.410> me<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.220> least<00:01:58.490> satisfying

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
but for me this is the least satisfying

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.390 
but for me this is the least satisfying
going<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.570> use<00:01:59.840> as<00:02:00.110> it's<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.710> little<00:02:00.979> weak<00:02:01.190> and

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
going to use as it's a little weak and

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.730 
going to use as it's a little weak and
feels<00:02:01.910> cheap<00:02:02.270> compared<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.930> most<00:02:03.110> of<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.500> guns

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
feels cheap compared to most of the guns

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.730 
feels cheap compared to most of the guns
in<00:02:04.040> this<00:02:04.220> category<00:02:04.690> thus<00:02:05.690> ends<00:02:06.229> up<00:02:06.320> feeling

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
in this category thus ends up feeling

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:18.080 
in this category thus ends up feeling
like<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.950> poor<00:02:07.310> man's<00:02:07.360> p226

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.740 

the<00:02:18.690> p226<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> very<00:02:20.310> balanced<00:02:20.819> weapon<00:02:21.239> with

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
the p226 is a very balanced weapon with

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.350 
the p226 is a very balanced weapon with
the<00:02:21.870> largest<00:02:22.200> magazine<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:22.920> all<00:02:23.099> pistols<00:02:23.700> and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
the largest magazine of all pistols and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.290 
the largest magazine of all pistols and
comes<00:02:24.569> great<00:02:25.019> damage<00:02:25.319> range<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.519> furthermore

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
comes great damage range and furthermore

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.440 
comes great damage range and furthermore
it's<00:02:27.690> very<00:02:28.019> satisfying<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.920> use<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.489> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
it's very satisfying to use on the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.710 
it's very satisfying to use on the
downside<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.230> has<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> fair<00:02:31.920> amount<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.370> recoil

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
downside it has a fair amount of recoil

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.050 
downside it has a fair amount of recoil
but<00:02:33.720> organs<00:02:34.200> aside<00:02:34.620> from<00:02:34.799> one<00:02:35.069> handgun<00:02:35.519> has

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
but organs aside from one handgun has

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.809 
but organs aside from one handgun has
recalled<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.019> easily<00:02:37.500> manageable<00:02:38.010> so

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
recalled it it's easily manageable so

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:49.809 
recalled it it's easily manageable so
this<00:02:39.000> really<00:02:39.269> isn't<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:40.019> big<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.440> an<00:02:40.560> issue

however those points are kind of

holds this weapon back is the

unmanageable amount of recoil which

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.150

this<00:03:20.819> gun<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.120> kind<00:03:21.599> of<00:03:21.720> meant<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.989> be<00:03:22.139> a<00:03:22.170> bit<00:03:22.590> of

a novelty and this probably isn't a

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
secondary weapon to rely on but it's

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.990

most<00:03:28.290> definitely<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.950> go-to<00:03:29.190> choice<00:03:29.370> if<00:03:29.940> you

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
most definitely the go-to choice if you

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
really work as it's not all that

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.840 
really work as it's not all that

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.170 
powerful and the fire rate between each
burst<00:04:06.150> is<00:04:06.450> really<00:04:06.810> slut<00:04:07.550> also<00:04:08.550> due<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:08.940> the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
burst is really slut also due to the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.910 
burst is really slut also due to the
fact<00:04:09.390> that<00:04:09.510> you're<00:04:09.690> firing<00:04:09.990> three<00:04:10.410> rounds<00:04:10.800> at

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
fact that you're firing three rounds at

fact that you're firing three rounds at
a<00:04:10.980> time<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.850> clip<00:04:12.090> capacity<00:04:12.720> is<00:04:12.900> more<00:04:13.110> like

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
a time the clip capacity is more like

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.890 
a time the clip capacity is more like
seven<00:04:13.710> rounds<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.220> magazine<00:04:14.400> instead<00:04:15.300> of<00:04:15.420> 18

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
seven rounds in a magazine instead of 18

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.470 
seven rounds in a magazine instead of 18
and<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.890> top<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.130> off<00:04:17.400> this<00:04:17.700> gun<00:04:17.940> isn't<00:04:18.150> all

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
and to top it off this gun isn't all

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.590 
and to top it off this gun isn't all
that<00:04:18.510> fun<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:18.959> use<00:04:19.350> so<00:04:20.340> in<00:04:20.670> my<00:04:20.970> opinion<00:04:21.299> I'd

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
that fun to use so in my opinion I'd

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.510 
that fun to use so in my opinion I'd
steer<00:04:21.989> clear<00:04:22.020> unless<00:04:22.710> this<00:04:22.920> weapon<00:04:23.310> gets

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
steer clear unless this weapon gets

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:37.030 
steer clear unless this weapon gets
booked<00:04:23.790> at<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.090> later<00:04:24.420> date

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.530 

so<00:04:38.040> that's<00:04:38.220> my<00:04:38.430> thoughts<00:04:38.700> and<00:04:38.880> analysis<00:04:39.510> of

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
so that's my thoughts and analysis of

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.650 
so that's my thoughts and analysis of
the<00:04:39.900> Hangang<00:04:40.320> class<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:40.890> far<00:04:41.220> this<00:04:42.120> category

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
the Hangang class so far this category

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.440 
the Hangang class so far this category
can<00:04:42.840> be<00:04:42.960> genuinely<00:04:43.560> useful<00:04:44.010> as<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.850> secondary

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
can be genuinely useful as a secondary

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.020 
can be genuinely useful as a secondary
weapon<00:04:45.840> or<00:04:46.050> even<00:04:46.500> as<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.650> primary<00:04:47.070> in<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.820> right

situations<00:04:48.890> assuming<00:04:49.890> you<00:04:50.040> have<00:04:50.190> set<00:04:50.400> up<00:04:50.550> your

this<00:04:59.070> decision<00:04:59.610> is<00:04:59.760> purely<00:05:00.150> up<00:05:00.510> to<00:05:00.660> personal
