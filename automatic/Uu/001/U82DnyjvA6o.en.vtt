00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.179
 not only the usual location I am in 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.960
 I stole my baby's room 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.610
 corner because the light is perfect today 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.670

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.970
 I do n't want to put lights on and so on 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 because it looks like a lion I know 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.680

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.689

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.570

 let's say this scrub for this face 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.700
 I had put this night's photo up alone 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.079

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.789

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.969
 I apply the same cream lately 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.039
 day use just a little more 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.010
 abundantly it came to maintain 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.570
 skin moisturized even at night 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.010
 I was looking for a cream that cost little 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.650
 with a good in c 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.660
 to help my skin with the veil 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.970
 problem pimples I do not have a problem 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.780
 of acne an acute problem of pimples 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.810
 but someone for a while and this cream me 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.090
 is helping I have to say I use it 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.490
 also on the eye contour and contour 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.310
 lips because it is very very light and 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.790
 hydrates a lot without giving any kind 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.320
 no oil burning problem 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.530
 very sensitive and 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:41.860
 I tell you that this is very suitable for me 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:44.390
 This is a purifying face cream gel 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.790
 that should just retract without 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.790
 grease etc. 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.840
 really little on 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.900
 really little thing on the 67 euros 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.750
 in short, that price range and this 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.170
 mark given that to many other types of 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.480
 cream for first wrinkles and I have given 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.850
 a kit I made with different creams 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.759
 of this brand on the first wrinkles for 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.830
 my aunt is rehearsing and said it is 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.890
 really beautiful has not yet seen the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.500
 effects on wrinkles but it stunts the face 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:23.080
 really more grated, more fleshed out 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:28.360
 almost to a very good inci I have 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.730
 checked and really bio this e 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.500
 to the mail and to bamboo has a very good 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.650
 perfume 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.200
 as you see 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.150
 gel cream texture therefore it is 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.590
 I find it very fresh 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.360
 to the summer and it is just helping me with 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.250
 I don't know if the pimples had to pass 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.590
 however, I tell you that I have tried 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.709
 a lot of moisturizing cream lately among the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.659
 which one of the biotherm that I was 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.709
 helping a lot my fingers though and 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.750
 so I decided to try 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.049
 something else than that a texture 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.879
 similar to this and I tried one of the 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.690
 bike that I set aside immediately because 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.430
 I do not do very well and so 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.440
 I passed this time just spending 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.510
 so much money try to get something 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.590
 cheaper and I'm very happy e 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.739
 this cream and I'm also trying the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.819
 purifying and even facial scrub mask 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.819
 I really like this one because 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.170
 purifies the skin by removing the cells 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:34.110
 however, everything is not aggressive 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:37.900
 they were not too big, not red 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.170
 so for me, mixed and sensitive skin is 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.340
 perfect I recommend this 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.900
 marchini I found it from the water e 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.790
 soap so I think in the drugstores 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.500
 more or less there is in the supermarket not 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.390
 I found it, however, the soap water did 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.060
 so I recommend you try it try it 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.490
 the line because I really remained 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.960
 really excited especially 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:04.090
 lynx and results obviously okay 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.460
 I send you a big kiss I hope the review 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.530
 it was helpful to you to give you a 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.890
 I recommend maybe if you are looking for a 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.830
 cream suitable mixed skins with some 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.630
 little problem of pimples mimicking rubber 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.630
 bye Bye
