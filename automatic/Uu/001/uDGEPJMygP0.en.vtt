00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.850
 hello youtube friends in 1989 with a 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.270
 new video tutorial and in this case it 's 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.460
 to solve the problem of minecraft 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.820
 left the c4 to lower the rebate and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.949
 a java problem 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.060
 well it's not a problem but 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:38.920
 minecraft while pirate 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:43.660
 only works for java 32 bits 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.540
 so if you have java 64 bits no no 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.520
 will start and well what is the fault 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.370
 can justito when I open it I get it 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:56.230
 this tab 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:59.680
 vm is the 4 j s 4 j has worked for 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:05.170
 down then what I have to have to 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.780
 do is install java says 32 bits by 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.070
 that you go to the link we know the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.070
 description 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.200
 and the page of java and you will come 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.690
 will set java for windows windows offline 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.910
 32.1 offline 64 bit us 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.110
 we download 32 bits 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:29.940
 if you have more then this 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.480
 and the rest like that since 2000 always 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.850
 but of course if you say if my computer 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.640
 It's 64 bits 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.240
 I happen to have 32 bits or you install 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.880
 also in the logical 64 bits as you know 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.430
 your computer is 64 bits because 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.490
 download windows control panel click 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.060
 right me opera computer right click and 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.320
 properties 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.320
 use this page and put here in system 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.380
 puts system type operating system 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.240
 64 bits 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.240
 and well this does not win 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:14.580
 There is not much time left once we open this 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.580
 the file that has been downloaded 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.480
 and it will make us welcome, saba le 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.800
 We give to install 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.800
 and it starts to install 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.670
 good 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.290
 he told me he was going to go very fast but 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.500
 I'm going to pause the video 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.580

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.580
 lot of time 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.150

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.830

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.880
 correctly we give it to close 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:53.140

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.140
 try to open in key 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.130

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.310
