gets<00:01:53.020> weld<00:01:53.229> on<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.469> outside<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.039> frame

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
gets weld on the outside of the frame

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.010 
gets weld on the outside of the frame
you<00:01:54.700> see<00:01:54.939> there<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.920> side<00:01:57.159> as<00:01:57.340> well<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.960> top

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
you see there this side as well on top

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.760 
you see there this side as well on top
of<00:01:59.469> the<00:01:59.560> frame<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:00.929> also<00:02:01.929> on<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.140> inside<00:02:02.319> of

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
of the frame and also on the inside of

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.940 
of the frame and also on the inside of
the<00:02:02.859> frame<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.810> welded<00:02:05.020> all<00:02:05.319> the<00:02:05.829> way<00:02:05.950> around

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the frame it's welded all the way around

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.200 
the frame it's welded all the way around
one<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.100> strongest<00:02:09.520> notches<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.119> the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
one of the strongest notches on the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.229 
one of the strongest notches on the
market

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
market

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.640 
market
so<00:02:13.239> that's<00:02:13.420> what<00:02:13.599> I<00:02:13.629> mean<00:02:13.780> by<00:02:13.959> under-bed<00:02:14.500> notch

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
so that's what I mean by under-bed notch

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.920 
so that's what I mean by under-bed notch
if<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:14.950> see<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:16.299> other<00:02:16.450> side<00:02:16.599> is<00:02:16.719> done<00:02:16.840> this

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
if you see the other side is done this

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.030 
if you see the other side is done this
one<00:02:17.140> if<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:17.829> see<00:02:18.810> they<00:02:19.810> rises<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> little<00:02:20.920> bit

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
one if you see they rises a little bit

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.670 
one if you see they rises a little bit
which<00:02:21.189> is<00:02:21.219> exactly<00:02:21.730> about<00:02:21.849> two<00:02:22.180> inches<00:02:22.719> so<00:02:23.530> it

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
which is exactly about two inches so it

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.020 
which is exactly about two inches so it
allows<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.129> for<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.400> be<00:02:24.489> underneath<00:02:24.849> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
allows it for it to be underneath the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.380 
allows it for it to be underneath the
bed<00:02:25.530> without<00:02:26.530> having<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.950> cut<00:02:27.219> the<00:02:27.370> bed<00:02:27.579> but<00:02:28.299> it

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
bed without having to cut the bed but it

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.729 
bed without having to cut the bed but it
allows<00:02:28.540> for<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.840> maximum<00:02:29.379> amount<00:02:29.590> of

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
allows for the maximum amount of

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.880 
allows for the maximum amount of
clearance<00:02:31.019> all<00:02:32.019> we<00:02:32.200> got<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.379> do<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.560> remove<00:02:32.709> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
clearance all we got to do is remove the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.910 
clearance all we got to do is remove the
center<00:02:33.220> plate<00:02:33.549> it<00:02:33.730> weld<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.150> grind<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.920> clean

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
center plate it weld it grind it clean

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.539 
center plate it weld it grind it clean
up<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.129> welds<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:37.170> then<00:02:38.170> undercoat<00:02:38.769> it<00:02:38.920> to

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
up the welds and then undercoat it to

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.550 
up the welds and then undercoat it to
protect<00:02:39.879> against<00:02:40.150> rust<00:02:40.389> in<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.780> last<00:02:41.049> four<00:02:41.469> is

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
protect against rust in the last four is

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.809 
protect against rust in the last four is
the<00:02:41.769> flip<00:02:42.010> kit<00:02:42.250> there<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:43.319> then<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:45.310> shackles

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
the flip kit there and then the shackles

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.069 
the flip kit there and then the shackles
there<00:02:47.819> flip<00:02:48.819> kit<00:02:49.090> reason<00:02:49.720> it's<00:02:49.840> called<00:02:49.900> the

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
there flip kit reason it's called the

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.050 
there flip kit reason it's called the
flip<00:02:50.290> kid<00:02:50.530> because<00:02:50.859> basically<00:02:51.280> what<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.879> do

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
flip kid because basically what you do

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.190 
flip kid because basically what you do
is<00:02:52.230> flip<00:02:53.230> your<00:02:53.590> leaf<00:02:53.799> springs<00:02:54.629> here<00:02:55.629> and<00:02:56.049> put

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
is flip your leaf springs here and put

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.190 
is flip your leaf springs here and put
them<00:02:56.290> underneath<00:02:56.530> your<00:02:57.010> axle<00:02:57.689> which<00:02:58.689> is<00:02:58.930> there

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
them underneath your axle which is there

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.800 
them underneath your axle which is there
that's<00:03:00.099> part<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.549> flip<00:03:00.760> get<00:03:00.879> there<00:03:01.150> so

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
that's part of the flip get there so

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.190 
that's part of the flip get there so
that<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.959> clean<00:03:02.169> it<00:03:02.319> up<00:03:02.470> when<00:03:03.159> you<00:03:03.250> weld<00:03:04.200> grinder

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
that I clean it up when you weld grinder

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.569 
that I clean it up when you weld grinder
makes<00:03:05.349> a<00:03:05.439> big<00:03:05.590> mess<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:05.980> we<00:03:06.010> clean<00:03:06.280> all<00:03:06.459> this

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
makes a big mess so we clean all this

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.670 
makes a big mess so we clean all this
stuff<00:03:06.639> up<00:03:06.939> before<00:03:07.269> we<00:03:07.359> turn<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.659> in<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.500> that's

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
stuff up before we turn it in and that's

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.300 
stuff up before we turn it in and that's
the<00:03:08.799> shuffles<00:03:09.280> there<00:03:09.629> so<00:03:10.629> together<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:12.040> flip

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
the shuffles there so together the flip

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.879 
the shuffles there so together the flip
Kent<00:03:12.579> gives<00:03:13.419> you<00:03:13.510> seven<00:03:13.870> inches<00:03:14.139> of<00:03:14.319> worth<00:03:14.739> the

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
Kent gives you seven inches of worth the

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.280 
Kent gives you seven inches of worth the
drop<00:03:15.159> and<00:03:15.430> now<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.359> shackles<00:03:16.900> give<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:17.139> two

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
drop and now the shackles give you two

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.869 
drop and now the shackles give you two
inches<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:17.650> combined<00:03:18.190> it's<00:03:18.430> nine<00:03:18.609> inches

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
inches so combined it's nine inches

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.360 
inches so combined it's nine inches
worth<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.180> drop<00:03:19.680> that's<00:03:20.680> where<00:03:20.919> we<00:03:21.010> get<00:03:21.159> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
worth the drop that's where we get the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.979 
worth the drop that's where we get the
figure<00:03:21.699> of<00:03:21.819> nine<00:03:22.030> inches<00:03:22.209> in<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.599> back<00:03:22.629> we

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
figure of nine inches in the back we

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.240 
figure of nine inches in the back we
only<00:03:23.139> use<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.409> numbers<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:24.010> actual

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
only use the numbers of actual

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.569 
only use the numbers of actual
suspension<00:03:25.090> drop<00:03:25.840> we<00:03:26.440> don't<00:03:26.650> calculate

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
suspension drop we don't calculate

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.219 
suspension drop we don't calculate
anything<00:03:27.849> other<00:03:28.150> than<00:03:28.359> actual<00:03:28.690> suspension

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:29.229 
anything other than actual suspension

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.949 
anything other than actual suspension
parts<00:03:29.560> when<00:03:30.430> we<00:03:30.549> say<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:31.180> truck<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:31.900> a

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
parts when we say a truck is that a

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.539 
parts when we say a truck is that a
search<00:03:32.169> drop<00:03:32.500> that's<00:03:32.799> just<00:03:32.979> the<00:03:33.040> way<00:03:33.129> we<00:03:33.280> do<00:03:33.400> it

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
search drop that's just the way we do it

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.819 
search drop that's just the way we do it
some<00:03:34.299> people<00:03:34.569> base<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.989> on<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.229> distance<00:03:35.680> of

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
some people base it on the distance of

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.530 
some people base it on the distance of
the<00:03:35.919> fender<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.489> ground<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.150> all<00:03:37.359> this

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
the fender to the ground and all this

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.599 
the fender to the ground and all this
stuff<00:03:37.780> we<00:03:37.930> base<00:03:38.109> it<00:03:38.139> on<00:03:38.349> strictly<00:03:39.190> nothing<00:03:39.489> but

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
stuff we base it on strictly nothing but

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.610 
stuff we base it on strictly nothing but
suspension<00:03:40.090> parts<00:03:40.359> okay<00:03:41.079> so<00:03:41.139> this<00:03:41.319> will<00:03:41.530> we

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
suspension parts okay so this will we

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.409 
suspension parts okay so this will we
have<00:03:41.739> for<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:41.949> front<00:03:42.220> upper<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.329> lower

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
have for the front upper and lower

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.899 
have for the front upper and lower
control<00:03:43.750> arms<00:03:44.139> for<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.769> total<00:03:45.069> four<00:03:45.280> inches<00:03:45.669> and

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
control arms for a total four inches and

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.629 
control arms for a total four inches and
then<00:03:46.540> two<00:03:47.470> inches<00:03:47.799> from<00:03:47.919> the<00:03:48.069> spindle<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.489> can

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
then two inches from the spindle you can

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.030 
then two inches from the spindle you can
see<00:03:48.760> part<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:49.329> there<00:03:49.540> by<00:03:50.409> the<00:03:50.470> tie<00:03:50.709> rod<00:03:50.889> end

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
see part of it there by the tie rod end

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.800 
see part of it there by the tie rod end
so<00:03:51.639> that's<00:03:51.729> how<00:03:51.879> we<00:03:51.970> get<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.150> total<00:03:52.449> of<00:03:52.510> six

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
so that's how we get a total of six

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.500 
so that's how we get a total of six
inches<00:03:53.139> for<00:03:53.889> the<00:03:54.040> front<00:03:54.340> four<00:03:55.060> out<00:03:55.299> of<00:03:55.329> the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
inches for the front four out of the

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.360 
inches for the front four out of the
lower<00:03:55.659> control<00:03:55.870> arm<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:56.709> upper<00:03:57.010> one<00:03:57.129> is<00:03:57.189> used

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
lower control arm the upper one is used

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.939 
lower control arm the upper one is used
predominantly<00:03:57.639> for<00:03:58.269> alignment<00:03:58.540> then<00:03:59.409> two

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
predominantly for alignment then two

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.539 
predominantly for alignment then two
inches<00:04:00.220> out<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.519> spindle<00:04:01.379> so<00:04:02.379> we<00:04:02.919> get<00:04:03.069> asked<00:04:03.459> a

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
inches out the spindle so we get asked a

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.149 
inches out the spindle so we get asked a
lot<00:04:03.579> how<00:04:03.939> to<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.329> truck<00:04:04.599> ride<00:04:04.870> with<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:05.739> six

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
lot how to the truck ride with a six

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.550 
lot how to the truck ride with a six
inch<00:04:06.370> drop<00:04:06.489> up<00:04:06.849> front<00:04:07.120> as<00:04:07.299> you<00:04:07.689> can<00:04:07.989> see<00:04:08.199> the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
inch drop up front as you can see the

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.449 
inch drop up front as you can see the
factory<00:04:08.919> strut<00:04:09.340> which<00:04:10.269> is<00:04:10.479> there<00:04:11.129> right<00:04:12.129> here

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
factory strut which is there right here

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.390 
factory strut which is there right here
and<00:04:12.639> the<00:04:13.090> spring<00:04:13.419> which<00:04:13.720> is<00:04:13.750> there<00:04:14.109> are<00:04:14.709> still

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
and the spring which is there are still

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.279 
and the spring which is there are still
maintained<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:16.359> it<00:04:16.509> gives<00:04:16.659> you<00:04:16.780> a<00:04:16.810> real<00:04:17.019> close

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
maintained so it gives you a real close

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.409 
maintained so it gives you a real close
to<00:04:17.470> factory<00:04:17.859> ride<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.400> not<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.030> hundred<00:04:19.269> percent

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
to factory ride is not a hundred percent

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.230 
to factory ride is not a hundred percent
exactly<00:04:19.870> as<00:04:20.409> factory<00:04:21.340> but<00:04:21.579> it's<00:04:21.700> very<00:04:21.820> very

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
exactly as factory but it's very very

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.050 
exactly as factory but it's very very
close<00:04:22.979> you<00:04:23.979> know<00:04:24.099> nothing<00:04:24.460> really<00:04:24.550> changes

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
close you know nothing really changes

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.710 
close you know nothing really changes
out<00:04:25.210> of<00:04:25.240> these

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
out of these

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.780 
out of these
the<00:04:26.080> spindles<00:04:26.500> maintain<00:04:26.830> pretty<00:04:27.580> much<00:04:27.760> a

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
the spindles maintain pretty much a

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.540 
the spindles maintain pretty much a
factory<00:04:28.420> alignment<00:04:29.380> all<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:30.010> does<00:04:30.160> move<00:04:30.460> the

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
factory alignment all it does move the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.130 
factory alignment all it does move the
hub<00:04:30.730> up<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:31.030> little<00:04:31.210> bit<00:04:31.390> so<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:31.600> can<00:04:31.660> get<00:04:31.870> the

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
hub up a little bit so you can get the

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.870 
hub up a little bit so you can get the
two<00:04:32.320> inches<00:04:32.530> worth<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.800> drop<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.730> lower

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
two inches worth to drop the lower

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.270 
two inches worth to drop the lower
controller<00:04:34.330> all<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.260> does<00:04:35.410> is<00:04:35.560> drop<00:04:35.770> down<00:04:36.040> the

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
controller all it does is drop down the

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.630 
controller all it does is drop down the
original<00:04:36.850> mount<00:04:37.840> location<00:04:38.410> of<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:39.100> strut<00:04:39.430> so

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
original mount location of the strut so

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.160 
original mount location of the strut so
that's<00:04:39.790> it<00:04:40.000> pretty<00:04:40.210> basic<00:04:40.480> to<00:04:40.750> be<00:04:40.840> honest<00:04:41.080> with

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
that's it pretty basic to be honest with

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.500 
that's it pretty basic to be honest with
you<00:04:41.340> so<00:04:42.340> that<00:04:42.520> kind<00:04:42.700> of<00:04:42.760> answers<00:04:43.420> the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
you so that kind of answers the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.910 
you so that kind of answers the
questions<00:04:43.870> about<00:04:43.990> how<00:04:44.290> it<00:04:44.320> rides<00:04:44.650> up<00:04:44.860> front

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
questions about how it rides up front

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.370 
questions about how it rides up front
okay<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.940> bedroom<00:04:46.240> that<00:04:46.450> was<00:04:46.600> there<00:04:46.840> has

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
okay so the bedroom that was there has

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.310 
okay so the bedroom that was there has
been<00:04:47.560> removed<00:04:47.860> and<00:04:48.100> now<00:04:48.160> it's<00:04:48.490> undercoat

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
been removed and now it's undercoat

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.800 
been removed and now it's undercoat
so<00:04:50.320> I'm<00:04:50.550> not<00:04:51.550> protective<00:04:52.090> for<00:04:52.270> years<00:04:52.510> to<00:04:52.630> come

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
so I'm not protective for years to come

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.540 
so I'm not protective for years to come
against<00:04:53.350> rust<00:04:54.600> nobody<00:04:55.600> will<00:04:55.750> ever<00:04:55.900> see<00:04:56.170> this

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
against rust nobody will ever see this

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.470 
against rust nobody will ever see this
you<00:04:57.550> know<00:04:57.580> it's<00:04:57.760> underneath<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.090> bed<00:04:58.360> you

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
you know it's underneath the bed you

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.550 
you know it's underneath the bed you
have<00:04:58.540> to<00:04:58.660> literally<00:04:59.020> be<00:04:59.200> underneath<00:04:59.500> the

have to literally be underneath the
truck<00:04:59.860> or<00:05:00.180> you<00:05:01.180> know<00:05:01.270> if<00:05:01.360> it's<00:05:01.510> on<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.690> Left

somewhere so you can check to see this
but<00:05:03.400> we<00:05:04.030> still<00:05:04.240> undercoat<00:05:04.720> it<00:05:04.840> it's<00:05:05.080> just<00:05:05.290> one

smooth not sure if you can tell but that

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.670 
smooth not sure if you can tell but that
front<00:05:29.890> valence<00:05:30.370> is<00:05:30.520> literally<00:05:30.820> about<00:05:31.680> two

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
front valence is literally about two

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.800 
front valence is literally about two
inches<00:05:33.160> above<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:33.550> ground<00:05:33.730> so<00:05:34.300> it<00:05:34.330> does

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
inches above the ground so it does

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.570 
inches above the ground so it does
scrape<00:05:35.140> everywhere<00:05:35.620> not<00:05:36.250> sure<00:05:36.400> we're<00:05:36.520> gonna

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
scrape everywhere not sure we're gonna

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.310 
scrape everywhere not sure we're gonna
have<00:05:36.700> to<00:05:36.880> lift<00:05:37.030> it<00:05:37.180> up<00:05:37.240> a<00:05:37.330> little<00:05:37.450> bit<00:05:37.690> but<00:05:38.290> I
