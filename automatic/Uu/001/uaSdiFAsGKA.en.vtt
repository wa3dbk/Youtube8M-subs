right<00:03:57.920> we'll<00:03:58.489> start<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.880> navigation<00:03:59.510> if

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
right we'll start the navigation if

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.449 
right we'll start the navigation if
currently<00:04:00.440> never<00:04:00.650> getting<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.010> another<00:04:01.250> play

point which yeah sure what else I'll go

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.460 
point which yeah sure what else I'll go
there<00:04:04.040> instead<00:04:04.300> all<00:04:05.300> right<00:04:05.480> so<00:04:05.780> it<00:04:06.050> just<00:04:06.350> shows

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
you a straight line you know no

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.290 
you a straight line you know no
turn-by-turn<00:04:08.600> navigation<00:04:08.870> as<00:04:09.830> I<00:04:09.980> said<00:04:10.310> just<00:04:11.180> a

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
turn-by-turn navigation as I said just a

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.300 
turn-by-turn navigation as I said just a
straight<00:04:11.630> line<00:04:12.220> -<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:14.050> said<00:04:15.050> Washington<00:04:15.800> and

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
straight line - I said Washington and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.340 
straight line - I said Washington and
you're<00:04:16.489> taking<00:04:16.850> me<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:18.190> Indiana<00:04:19.190> whoo

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
you're taking me to Indiana whoo

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.110 
you're taking me to Indiana whoo
different<00:04:21.350> locations<00:04:21.760> all<00:04:22.760> right

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
different locations all right

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.600 
different locations all right
anyway<00:04:23.480> so<00:04:24.140> you<00:04:24.410> know<00:04:24.440> I<00:04:24.740> would<00:04:25.190> give<00:04:25.370> this<00:04:25.550> a

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
anyway so you know I would give this a

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.840 
anyway so you know I would give this a
4.5<00:04:26.570> out<00:04:26.870> of<00:04:26.900> 5<00:04:27.080> just<00:04:27.770> because<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.460> does<00:04:28.640> not

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
4.5 out of 5 just because it does not

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.090 
4.5 out of 5 just because it does not
have<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.480> built-in<00:04:30.100> turn-by-turn

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
have the built-in turn-by-turn

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.250 
have the built-in turn-by-turn
navigation<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:32.360> it<00:04:32.480> might<00:04:32.630> be<00:04:32.660> misleading

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
navigation and it might be misleading

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.510 
navigation and it might be misleading
the<00:04:33.470> people<00:04:33.620> who<00:04:33.890> do<00:04:34.160> think<00:04:34.640> that<00:04:35.919> it<00:04:36.919> is<00:04:36.979> a

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
the people who do think that it is a

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.340 
the people who do think that it is a
turn-by-turn<00:04:37.970> navigation<00:04:38.229> system<00:04:39.229> now

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
turn-by-turn navigation system now

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.620 
turn-by-turn navigation system now
motion<00:04:39.740> X<00:04:39.919> does<00:04:40.190> have<00:04:40.430> another<00:04:40.669> one<00:04:40.910> which<00:04:41.390> I

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
motion X does have another one which I

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.440 
motion X does have another one which I
will<00:04:41.840> review<00:04:42.140> later<00:04:42.229> its<00:04:42.710> motion<00:04:43.130> X<00:04:43.280> GPS<00:04:43.850> drive

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
will review later its motion X GPS drive

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.719 
will review later its motion X GPS drive
and<00:04:44.870> there's<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.800> difference<00:04:46.190> between<00:04:46.310> these

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
and there's a difference between these

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.600 
and there's a difference between these
two<00:04:47.060> as<00:04:47.270> you<00:04:47.300> will<00:04:47.720> see<00:04:47.960> but<00:04:48.470> anyway<00:04:48.830> anyway

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
two as you will see but anyway anyway

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.630 
two as you will see but anyway anyway
