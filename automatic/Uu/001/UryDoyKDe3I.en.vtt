00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
would you be playing right now not a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.139 
would you be playing right now not a
game<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.920> don't<00:00:41.550> know<00:00:41.700> if<00:00:41.790> I'd<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:41.969> doing

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
game I don't know if I'd be doing

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.610 
game I don't know if I'd be doing
YouTube<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.570> be<00:00:42.600> honest<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.500> was

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
YouTube to be honest because that was

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.869 
YouTube to be honest because that was
like<00:00:43.739> VD<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.129> kind<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.280> got<00:00:44.399> me<00:00:44.550> into<00:00:44.789> it

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
like VD and that kind of got me into it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.369 
like VD and that kind of got me into it
but<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.120> would<00:00:45.390> probably<00:00:45.600> still<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.079> playing

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
but I would probably still be playing

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.920 
but I would probably still be playing
like<00:00:46.590> Call<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.860> Duty<00:00:47.149> or<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> would<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.600> into

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
like Call of Duty or I would be into

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
like Call of Duty or I would be into
like<00:00:48.960> black<00:00:49.500> ops<00:00:49.739> or<00:00:50.010> something<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.399> that

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
like black ops or something like that

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.310 
like black ops or something like that
because<00:00:50.700> that's<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.239> into<00:00:51.449> upwards

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.300 
I'm the queen spot so the thing that
they're<00:02:43.170> against<00:02:43.440> they<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.769> let<00:02:43.950> me<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.190> so

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
they're against they just let me and so

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.550 
they're against they just let me and so
I<00:02:44.340> get<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.600> game<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.110> played<00:02:46.380> them

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
I get it so the game that I played them

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.530 
I get it so the game that I played them
at<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:46.829> the<00:02:46.950> most<00:02:47.130> actually<00:02:47.700> black<00:02:47.970> ops<00:02:48.209> 3

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
at like the most actually black ops 3

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.020 
at like the most actually black ops 3
like<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.930> thought<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.440> jumping

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
like I thought that jumping

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.309 
like I thought that jumping
running<00:02:50.360> out<00:02:50.450> walls<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.930> going<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.140> be<00:02:51.200> too

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
running out walls is going to be too

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.770 
running out walls is going to be too
much<00:02:51.440> like<00:02:51.620> titanfall<00:02:51.980> but<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:52.970> wasn't<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.630> was

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
much like titanfall but it wasn't it was

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.449 
much like titanfall but it wasn't it was
just<00:02:54.050> awesome<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:54.709> there's<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.130> can't<00:02:55.370> really

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
just awesome like there's I can't really

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.590 
just awesome like there's I can't really
give<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.790> too<00:02:55.940> much<00:02:56.060> features<00:02:56.420> because<00:02:56.569> I

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
give you too much features because I

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.030 
give you too much features because I
don't<00:02:56.780> know<00:02:56.840> if<00:02:56.900> allowed<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.290> do<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.709> since

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
don't know if allowed to do that since

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.260 
don't know if allowed to do that since
you<00:02:58.160> guys<00:02:58.280> haven't<00:02:58.550> played<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.850> or<00:02:58.970> seen<00:02:59.120> it

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
you guys haven't played it or seen it

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.270 
you guys haven't played it or seen it
but<00:02:59.750> there<00:02:59.900> was<00:02:59.990> just<00:03:00.020> so<00:03:00.410> much<00:03:00.590> like<00:03:00.800> added<00:03:01.190> in

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
but there was just so much like added in

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.949 
but there was just so much like added in
craziness<00:03:01.819> that<00:03:02.000> made<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.480> ton<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.690> fun<00:03:02.930> I

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
craziness that made it a ton of fun I

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.600 
craziness that made it a ton of fun I
think<00:03:03.050> it<00:03:03.319> might<00:03:03.500> get<00:03:03.620> chaotic<00:03:04.130> but

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
think it might get chaotic but

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.040 
think it might get chaotic but
graphically<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.240> was<00:03:05.330> beautiful<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:05.870> like

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
graphically it was beautiful and like

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.360 
graphically it was beautiful and like
the<00:03:06.319> hip<00:03:06.500> markers<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.010> everything<00:03:07.280> were

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
the hip markers and everything were

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.400 
the hip markers and everything were
better<00:03:07.550> than<00:03:07.730> other<00:03:07.940> :<00:03:08.300> duties<00:03:08.510> up<00:03:08.660> plays<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.380> I

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
better than other : duties up plays so I

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.690 
better than other : duties up plays so I
really<00:03:09.650> like<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:09.980> played<00:03:10.280> this<00:03:10.370> game<00:03:10.520> Club

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
really like that I played this game Club

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.880 
really like that I played this game Club
Rainbow<00:03:11.060> six<00:03:11.330> siege<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:12.350> was<00:03:12.500> actually

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
Rainbow six siege and it was actually

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.170 
Rainbow six siege and it was actually
pretty<00:03:13.100> sick<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:13.550> was<00:03:13.640> like<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.819> thing<00:03:13.970> we<00:03:14.090> had

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
pretty sick it was like the thing we had

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.550 
pretty sick it was like the thing we had
like<00:03:14.360> set<00:03:14.569> up<00:03:14.600> barricade<00:03:15.140> we<00:03:15.319> stopped<00:03:15.500> people

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
like set up barricade we stopped people

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.990 
like set up barricade we stopped people
from<00:03:15.770> coming<00:03:16.040> in<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.430> gotta<00:03:16.580> attack<00:03:16.819> him

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
from coming in and you gotta attack him

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.030 
from coming in and you gotta attack him

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.250 
so that was awesome those were the two
games<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.370> think<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:19.640> like<00:03:19.819> Pez<00:03:20.480> actually<00:03:21.110> had

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
games I think I like Pez actually had

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.680 
games I think I like Pez actually had
like<00:03:21.380> a<00:03:21.410> step<00:03:21.739> up<00:03:21.950> from<00:03:22.580> last<00:03:23.150> year's<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.630> the

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
like a step up from last year's and the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.970 
like a step up from last year's and the
graphics<00:03:24.140> were<00:03:24.260> really<00:03:24.500> good<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:24.890> the

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
graphics were really good and the

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.830 
graphics were really good and the
gameplay<00:03:25.430> was<00:03:25.580> very<00:03:25.820> fluid<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.420> might<00:03:26.660> give

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
gameplay was very fluid so I might give

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.150
