speaker is uncovered it is a pretty nice

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.080 
speaker is uncovered it is a pretty nice
case<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.020> gotta<00:02:04.200> say<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.979> doesn't<00:02:05.610> move<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
case I gotta say it doesn't move on the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
case I gotta say it doesn't move on the
device<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:07.160> security<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.360> case<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.050> you

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
device it's security in the case so you

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.470 
device it's security in the case so you
don't<00:02:10.500> have<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.770> worry<00:02:10.979> about<00:02:11.129> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
don't have to worry about that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.000 
don't have to worry about that
and<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:13.020> think<00:02:13.230> I'm<00:02:13.319> gonna<00:02:13.410> keep<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:13.920> my

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
and I think I'm gonna keep it on my

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.920 
and I think I'm gonna keep it on my
device<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.550> should<00:02:14.730> keep<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.090> safe<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.750> also

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
device it should keep it safe it also

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.900 
device it should keep it safe it also
offers<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.410> little<00:02:16.709> bit<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.099> lip<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
offers a little bit of a lip on the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.509 
offers a little bit of a lip on the
front<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.560> device<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:20.069> not<00:02:20.190> going<00:02:20.430> to

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
front so the device is not going to

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.990 
front so the device is not going to
scratch<00:02:20.910> one<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.330> nice<00:02:21.629> flat<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:23.489> at<00:02:23.730> first

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
scratch one a nice flat so at first

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.180 
scratch one a nice flat so at first

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
device nicely maybe just tiny little

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.289 
device nicely maybe just tiny little
movement<00:02:37.620> over<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.580> here<00:02:38.880> but<00:02:39.150> that's
