00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:08.639
 Hi, people here are from here on the channel. 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.130
 nothing but the truth and people came to me 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.889
 a thing in my head the thought stayed 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.410
 thinking of third pressing 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.910
 I imagined going back to this one. 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.460
 Good, I have a tablet here. 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.970
 this tablet I use the original charger 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.560
 to carry only that I have and 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:34.050
 these people here that the car calls 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.510
 people is one has several several several in 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.300
 box to load cell phone 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:46.860
 so I thought I might put the entrance 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.610
 tablet usb in usb port also quits 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.100
 a current rushes into the USB socket 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.210
 So I thought the following I say I'm going 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.180
 try to make the tablet 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:06.689
 standalone it even if recharged 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:09.600
 without having to call 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.979
 into the outlet then see only the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:18.210
 It's like he's here in this town. 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.780
 is a recess that serves the internal 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.720
 to carry it here then I will have 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.270
 to put here in the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.920
 loading is a loading table 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.189
 even light that which is the business was a 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.189
 screw 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.790
 well then I call the people like these 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.399
 cables so connected with this usb dock 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.310
 I call it simply sb shot 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.850
 scoreboard 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.680
 so have light placed if the light and 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.450
 battery you see that the battery 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.860
 different is the battery charge 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.860
 returns to him 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:09.899
 the battery here charge the tablet itself 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.480
 It's coming back from the battery so it's me. 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.810
 I have not tested the battery yet 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.720
 so you can go back to the video that you 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.659
 will see that he goes up that monster 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.940
 as if it had recharged 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:28.720
 but he is not himself 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.849
 reloading okay, this is a great idea 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.819
 for you to have more durability in the 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.530
 The battery of your team can leave you 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.349
 use it without fear that it will stay 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.150
 always to the load bar coming out of it 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.420
 returns to him so he will be 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.849
 refilled 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.250
 so I did not test how much 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.400
 if you really have the economy if you go 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.250
 stay a long time so I do not know anymore 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.680
 I am testing the will post SBAC 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.269
 kinda crazy level in the head I'm 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.280
 show it to you 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.280
 I do at home and then see the result 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.629
 there comes a difference is that I'm seeing 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.349
 here it is half flashing the middle screen 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:15.670
 trembling but nothing that hinders its use 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:19.690
 here it is working normally then 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.849
 You can see there if it works and I'll 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.099
 see how it's going to be there as it is 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:29.739
 that works like this the durability of 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:34.000
 load I got on the head of the pit is 12 6 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:39.299
 and 12 do not leave 3.7 return here and here 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.299
 carries with 3.7 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:46.840
 so I can take three goals and from here 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.940
 place the same function as the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.730
 charger does not change anything but does not 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:56.169
 I'll do it because it's the team so far. 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.760
 it's self recharging is 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.069
 working right 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.870
 I do not know how long I'm gonna let go 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.620
 to see 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.190
 make it return your tablet and 100% 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.840
 sustainable 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.370
 You're not going to need it anymore. 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.780
 reloading it straight you will power 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.030
 leaving you come here to say you let 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.769
 connected here, how are you ready? 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.090
 charging I do not need a power outlet when 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.550
 you give it a general charge on it 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.460
 charger you connect this here you 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.069
 You can even buy a serve 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.330
 cut these wires to stop and leave here 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.160
 connected 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.960
 because this is what the team will have 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.120
 much longer life 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.280
 he is self recharging for him 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.650
 be consuming the energy that he himself 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.750
 produces that, that 's what we want . 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.479
 which is alienated car to load a 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.580
 Direct tablet in making direct in making 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.539
 but because I was that it discharges 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.520
 fast 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:55.930
 it will last little if you have a camera 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.389
 linked to that beautiful discharge that is this 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.400
 This works for me, guys. 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.080
 work that is not bulging not like it does 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.889
 some guys who make a video placed in the 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.930
 internet that the cooker lighter is 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.889
 infinite energy 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.050
 this is the love of the internet and 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.199
 inventing things here is here 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.349
 infinite that is infinite even a movie 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.349
 really do it here put it to 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.060
 you see if it does not work 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:28.659
 I bet more that you want it here. 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.370
 works that is 100% wifi is connected here 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.580
 I'll go online to see you. 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:38.919
 How is it working normally? 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:47.409
 bullet, it's not okay, okay, it was the tube. 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:52.860
 let's go, carry the battery 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.860
 with the dollar here 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.880
 OK 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:11.100
 here we have annoying zinha interference but 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.820
 I'm testing is still valid 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:19.350
 battery I took now Connected is the battery 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:31.530
 it's there we'll see if we win and do 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:35.669
 a process not loading on 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:39.000
 That's it. Just carry it with him. 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.080
 is that's it I can do it there to here 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.910
 leave the result 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.370
 zÃ© and whether or not it works for me 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.479
 did not work 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.479
 Thank you, it's only really worth it.
