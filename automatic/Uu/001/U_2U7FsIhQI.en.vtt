noisemaker<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.729> open<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.299> you've

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
noisemaker you can open it up and you've

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.399 
noisemaker you can open it up and you've
got<00:01:36.540> some<00:01:36.689> peanuts<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.110> don't<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
got some peanuts and you don't have to

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.890 
got some peanuts and you don't have to
pay<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.560> them<00:01:37.799> at<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> show<00:01:38.100> now<00:01:38.790> along<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
pay for them at the show now along the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.749 
pay for them at the show now along the
inner<00:01:40.079> circle<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.070> outside<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.640> I'm

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
inner circle like just outside of it I'm

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.730 
inner circle like just outside of it I'm
gonna<00:01:41.880> cut<00:01:42.150> some<00:01:42.180> some<00:01:42.810> slits<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
gonna cut some some slits here and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.819 
gonna cut some some slits here and
you'll<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.130> why<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.579> second<00:01:45.560> there<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.710> go

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
you'll see why in a second there we go

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.300 
you'll see why in a second there we go
there<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:47.640> go<00:01:48.649> I'm<00:01:49.649> probably<00:01:49.890> gonna<00:01:50.070> end<00:01:50.159> up

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
there we go I'm probably gonna end up

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.819 
there we go I'm probably gonna end up
cutting<00:01:50.490> about<00:01:50.759> eight<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.869> we'll<00:01:52.350> cut<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
cutting about eight so we'll cut the

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.080 
cutting about eight so we'll cut the
basically<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> plus<00:01:56.189> sign<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.850> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
basically a plus sign and a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.630 
basically a plus sign and a
multiplication<00:01:57.719> sign<00:01:58.079> into<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.520> we

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
multiplication sign into this just so we

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.200 
multiplication sign into this just so we
have<00:01:59.670> enough<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:01.460> they're<00:02:02.460> gonna<00:02:02.610> fold<00:02:02.939> up

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
have enough that they're gonna fold up

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.660 
have enough that they're gonna fold up
without<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:04.110> interfering<00:02:04.680> too<00:02:04.950> much<00:02:04.979> with

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
without really interfering too much with

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.479 
without really interfering too much with
the<00:02:05.850> basic<00:02:06.210> shape<00:02:06.420> itself<00:02:06.979> okay<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.250> now<00:02:08.369> what

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
the basic shape itself okay so now what

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.550 
the basic shape itself okay so now what
we<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:09.300> we<00:02:09.509> grab<00:02:09.660> our<00:02:09.869> toilet<00:02:10.140> paper<00:02:10.289> roll

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
we do is we grab our toilet paper roll

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.860 
we do is we grab our toilet paper roll
and<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.580> fold<00:02:11.970> each<00:02:12.300> one<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.569> these<00:02:12.660> up

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
and we fold each one of these up

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.940 
and we fold each one of these up
individually

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
individually

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.840 
individually
and<00:02:14.950> we<00:02:15.670> duct<00:02:15.910> tape<00:02:16.150> them<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.660> bottom<00:02:16.990> here

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
and we duct tape them to the bottom here

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.050 
and we duct tape them to the bottom here
okay

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
okay

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.440 
okay
so<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.540> grab<00:02:19.750> your<00:02:19.870> roll<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.050> duct<00:02:20.260> tape<00:02:21.450> and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
so you grab your roll of duct tape and

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.160 
so you grab your roll of duct tape and
I'm<00:02:22.600> just<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:22.960> to<00:02:24.150> put<00:02:25.150> this<00:02:25.270> on<00:02:25.450> top<00:02:25.690> and

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
I'm just going to put this on top and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.410 
I'm just going to put this on top and
just<00:02:26.200> start<00:02:26.650> I'm<00:02:27.580> actually<00:02:27.730> gonna<00:02:27.970> start<00:02:28.300> it

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
just start I'm actually gonna start it

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.420 
just start I'm actually gonna start it
off<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.890> then<00:02:30.310> put<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.700> roll<00:02:30.880> on<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:33.220> I'm

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
off and then put the roll on and I'm

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.450 
off and then put the roll on and I'm
gonna<00:02:33.550> do<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.850> first<00:02:34.030> foot<00:02:34.360> first<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.460> then

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
gonna do the first foot first and then

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.720 
gonna do the first foot first and then
just<00:02:36.640> kind<00:02:36.820> of<00:02:37.170> come<00:02:38.170> around<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.620> here

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:54.360 

tape<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.880> down<00:02:43.030> as<00:02:43.210> I<00:02:43.330> go<00:02:43.560> one<00:02:44.560> at<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.740> time

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.100 

now<00:02:54.940> if<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.150> didn't<00:02:55.360> cut<00:02:55.540> these<00:02:55.660> little<00:02:55.840> holes

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
now if we didn't cut these little holes

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.559 
now if we didn't cut these little holes
in<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.349> it<00:02:56.530> would<00:02:56.620> be<00:02:56.769> really<00:02:56.800> really<00:02:57.280> hard<00:02:57.760> to

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
in it it would be really really hard to

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.380 
in it it would be really really hard to
actually<00:02:58.810> get<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.379> to<00:02:59.440> stay<00:02:59.709> down<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:01.120> since

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
actually get this to stay down but since

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.940 
actually get this to stay down but since
we've<00:03:01.540> cut<00:03:01.720> these<00:03:01.840> holes<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.349> it's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
we've cut these holes in it it's

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:12.240 
we've cut these holes in it it's
actually<00:03:03.129> quite<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.610> bit<00:03:03.819> easier<00:03:10.830> there<00:03:11.830> we<00:03:12.069> go

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
actually quite a bit easier there we go

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.509 
actually quite a bit easier there we go
and<00:03:12.670> alright<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:14.739> now<00:03:14.830> we<00:03:14.890> got<00:03:15.099> a<00:03:15.129> bottom<00:03:15.430> on

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
and alright so now we got a bottom on

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.860 
and alright so now we got a bottom on
there<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.090> can<00:03:16.209> take<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.390> thicker<00:03:16.660> piece

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
there and you can take a thicker piece

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.210 
there and you can take a thicker piece
of<00:03:16.989> duct<00:03:17.140> tape<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.500> go<00:03:17.620> around<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.099> make<00:03:18.160> it

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
of duct tape and go around and make it

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.770 
of duct tape and go around and make it
look<00:03:18.340> look<00:03:18.879> real<00:03:19.060> nice<00:03:19.180> we're<00:03:19.420> not<00:03:19.510> gonna<00:03:19.599> do

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
look look real nice we're not gonna do

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.820 
look look real nice we're not gonna do
that<00:03:19.810> right<00:03:20.049> now<00:03:20.170> but<00:03:20.349> now<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.500> see<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:20.799> have

that right now but now you see you have
a<00:03:20.980> nice<00:03:21.160> open<00:03:22.090> area<00:03:22.269> right<00:03:22.840> here<00:03:23.379> on<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.530> top

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
a nice open area right here on the top
