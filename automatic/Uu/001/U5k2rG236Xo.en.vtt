gentlemen<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:28.980> what<00:02:29.129> happens<00:02:29.659> when<00:02:30.659> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
gentlemen this is what happens when the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.960 
gentlemen this is what happens when the
Vitamix<00:02:31.230> takes<00:02:31.530> too<00:02:31.680> much<00:02:31.799> pressure<00:02:32.069> we'll<00:02:32.879> be

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
Vitamix takes too much pressure we'll be

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.210 
Vitamix takes too much pressure we'll be
back<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.360> minute<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:34.049> we're<00:02:34.799> back<00:02:34.980> guys

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
back in a minute and we're back guys

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.699 
back in a minute and we're back guys
look<00:02:35.579> sometimes<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.209> Vitamix<00:02:36.629> under<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
look sometimes the Vitamix under the

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.350 
look sometimes the Vitamix under the
extreme<00:02:38.190> pressure<00:02:38.370> will<00:02:38.730> kind<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.030> switch<00:02:39.209> off

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
extreme pressure will kind of switch off

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.000 
extreme pressure will kind of switch off
for<00:02:39.510> about<00:02:39.629> five<00:02:39.840> or<00:02:39.870> ten<00:02:40.140> minutes<00:02:40.379> just<00:02:40.890> let

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
for about five or ten minutes just let

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.740 
for about five or ten minutes just let
it<00:02:41.129> cool<00:02:41.250> down<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.700> turn<00:02:41.879> it<00:02:41.970> back<00:02:42.060> on<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.659> what

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
it cool down and turn it back on so what

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.640 
it cool down and turn it back on so what
we're<00:02:42.840> gonna<00:02:42.900> do

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
we're gonna do

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.020 
we're gonna do
we've<00:02:44.010> mixed<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.340> up<00:02:44.459> it's<00:02:44.609> kind<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.879> same

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
we've mixed it up it's kind of the same

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.089 
we've mixed it up it's kind of the same
consistency<00:02:45.959> now<00:02:46.170> put<00:02:46.650> on<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.890> highest

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
consistency now put on the highest

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.229 
consistency now put on the highest
setting<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:47.730> we're<00:02:47.849> gonna<00:02:47.940> go<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
setting and we're gonna go to the

00:02:48.239 --> 00:03:01.240 
setting and we're gonna go to the
highest<00:02:48.450> setting<00:02:48.720> fingers<00:02:49.709> crossed

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:14.750 

brilliant<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:03.239> what<00:03:03.420> happens<00:03:04.459> that<00:03:13.519> is<00:03:14.519> how

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
brilliant and what happens that is how

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.729 
brilliant and what happens that is how
you<00:03:14.819> do<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:15.420> what<00:03:16.139> you<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.379> do<00:03:16.500> here<00:03:16.709> you

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
you do it so what you can do here you

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.259 
you do it so what you can do here you
can<00:03:17.010> either<00:03:17.159> push<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.549> down<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.939> lay<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.180> out

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
can either push it down and lay it out

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.569 
can either push it down and lay it out
flat<00:03:18.540> cut<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.290> into<00:03:19.409> little<00:03:19.709> slices<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.430> put

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
flat cut it into little slices and put

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.190 
flat cut it into little slices and put
it<00:03:20.670> into<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:20.939> ziplock<00:03:21.359> bags<00:03:21.629> and<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.930> fridge

going to do you can actually roll them

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.099 
going to do you can actually roll them
into<00:03:29.000> particular<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.359> know<00:03:30.480> you've<00:03:30.840> probably

fine<00:03:44.280> if<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.239> want<00:03:45.329> to<00:03:45.480> coat<00:03:45.659> them<00:03:45.810> in<00:03:46.849> check

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
fine if you want to coat them in check

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:57.729 
fine if you want to coat them in check
this<00:03:47.969> out<00:03:54.109> put<00:03:55.109> them<00:03:55.260> in<00:03:56.419> desiccated<00:03:57.419> coconut

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
this out put them in desiccated coconut

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.399 
this out put them in desiccated coconut
things<00:03:58.739> like<00:03:58.919> that<00:03:59.419> there<00:04:00.419> we<00:04:00.510> go<00:04:00.629> and<00:04:00.840> though

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
things like that there we go and though

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.580 
things like that there we go and though
as<00:04:01.709> they<00:04:02.220> cool<00:04:02.459> down<00:04:02.519> they'll<00:04:03.120> set<00:04:03.510> more<00:04:03.780> and

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
as they cool down they'll set more and

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.289 
as they cool down they'll set more and
there'll<00:04:05.340> be<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.430> lot<00:04:05.609> harder<00:04:05.790> in<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.060> fridge

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
there'll be a lot harder in the fridge

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.640 
there'll be a lot harder in the fridge
you<00:04:06.750> know<00:04:06.840> set<00:04:07.019> them<00:04:07.109> in<00:04:07.169> the<00:04:07.229> fridge<00:04:07.409> or<00:04:07.620> the

that's how you make chlorella bliss

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.620 
that's how you make chlorella bliss
balls<00:04:21.539> enjoy<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:25.789> know<00:04:26.789> if<00:04:26.880> you've<00:04:27.000> noticed<00:04:27.210> but

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
balls enjoy I know if you've noticed but

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.839 
balls enjoy I know if you've noticed but
these<00:04:28.110> days<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.680> lot<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.009> protein<00:04:29.400> powders

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
these days a lot of the protein powders

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.029 
these days a lot of the protein powders
and<00:04:30.030> protein<00:04:30.419> bars<00:04:30.630> have<00:04:31.259> a<00:04:31.320> lot<00:04:31.440> of<00:04:31.530> synthetic

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
and protein bars have a lot of synthetic

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.589 
and protein bars have a lot of synthetic
protein<00:04:32.759> in<00:04:32.909> them<00:04:33.030> which<00:04:33.210> means<00:04:33.449> they're

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
protein in them which means they're

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.779 
protein in them which means they're
man-made<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.199> not<00:04:34.320> natural<00:04:34.470> so<00:04:35.220> when<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.610> body

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
man-made and not natural so when I body

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.670 
man-made and not natural so when I body
ingest<00:04:36.180> something<00:04:36.449> that's<00:04:36.599> not<00:04:36.720> real<00:04:37.349> it's

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
ingest something that's not real it's

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.080 
ingest something that's not real it's
not<00:04:37.860> natural<00:04:38.099> our<00:04:38.490> body<00:04:38.669> really<00:04:38.909> doesn't

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
not natural our body really doesn't

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.460 
not natural our body really doesn't
recognize<00:04:39.570> it<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:39.810> it's<00:04:39.930> not<00:04:40.080> too<00:04:40.229> good<00:04:40.440> for

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
recognize it and it's not too good for

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.740 
recognize it and it's not too good for
it
