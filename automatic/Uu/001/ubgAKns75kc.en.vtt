00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
direct line of sight so check this out

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.150 
direct line of sight so check this out
it<00:01:52.330> works<00:01:53.330> with<00:01:53.569> two<00:01:53.750> controllers<00:01:54.289> so<00:01:55.069> you

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
it works with two controllers so you

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.650

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
the next logical question anybody might

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.440 
the next logical question anybody might
have<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.770> will<00:03:50.920> it<00:03:51.040> work<00:03:51.070> on<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.430> model<00:03:51.880> 2<00:03:52.120> Sega

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
have is will it work on the model 2 Sega

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.950 
have is will it work on the model 2 Sega
Genesis<00:03:53.080> as<00:03:53.290> well<00:03:53.500> as<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.770> model<00:03:54.070> 1<00:03:54.780> yes<00:03:55.780> it

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
Genesis as well as the model 1 yes it

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.760 
Genesis as well as the model 1 yes it
does<00:03:56.320> so<00:03:57.130> let's<00:03:57.280> take<00:03:57.490> a<00:03:57.520> look<00:03:57.730> at<00:03:57.820> that<00:03:58.770> the

does so let's take a look at that the

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.620 
does so let's take a look at that the
spacing<00:04:00.280> between<00:04:00.460> these<00:04:00.820> two<00:04:00.880> plugs<00:04:01.360> is

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
spacing between these two plugs is

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.120 
spacing between these two plugs is
identical<00:04:02.350> on<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:04.780> model<00:04:05.110> 2<00:04:05.260> Sega<00:04:05.560> Genesis

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130
