it if you left them on too long so i

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.710 
it if you left them on too long so i

you<00:01:51.509> would<00:01:51.659> go<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.289> lead<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.649> train

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
you would go to do it lead to a train

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.720 
you would go to do it lead to a train
yard<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.600> shelve<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:54.990> Guardian

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730

and<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.360> comes<00:01:57.510> right<00:01:57.630> back<00:01:57.840> out<00:01:58.190> that's<00:01:59.190> just

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and it comes right back out that's just

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.980 
and it comes right back out that's just
the<00:01:59.580> start<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.940> mechanism<00:02:00.420> without<00:02:00.660> having

the start the mechanism without having

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.710 
the start the mechanism without having
an<00:02:01.140> infinite<00:02:01.560> loop<00:02:01.790> that<00:02:02.790> constantly<00:02:03.450> breaks

then<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:04.410> you<00:02:04.500> want<00:02:04.650> minecraft<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.430> stand<00:02:05.700> on

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
then if you want minecraft you stand on

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.809 
then if you want minecraft you stand on
this<00:02:05.910> plate<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.650> comes<00:02:07.680> out

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.110 

it's<00:02:11.359> not<00:02:11.510> not<00:02:11.780> anything<00:02:12.079> yet<00:02:12.379> but<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:13.249> will<00:02:13.310> be

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.899 

so<00:02:16.750> when<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:16.989> come<00:02:17.110> back<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.730> meant

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
so when you come back in this is meant

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.750 
so when you come back in this is meant
to<00:02:19.000> be<00:02:19.060> going<00:02:19.360> back<00:02:19.569> in<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.810> full<00:02:20.019> speed

you<00:02:32.030> peel<00:02:32.990> away<00:02:33.280> had<00:02:34.280> those<00:02:34.430> mine<00:02:34.610> carts<00:02:34.640> and

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
you peel away had those mine carts and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.780 
you peel away had those mine carts and
it<00:02:35.360> chunks<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.840> mine<00:02:36.800> car<00:02:37.040> back<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
it chunks the mine car back in the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.300 
it chunks the mine car back in the
moment<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.300> step<00:02:38.810> out<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.160> goes<00:02:40.280> back

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
moment you step out and it goes back

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.540 
moment you step out and it goes back
into<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.790> system<00:02:41.030> everything<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:41.990> recycled

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.060 

yep<00:02:46.150> what<00:02:46.690> I'm<00:02:46.840> on<00:02:46.990> car<00:02:47.230> over<00:02:47.380> there<00:02:47.530> does<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
yep what I'm on car over there does the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.070 
yep what I'm on car over there does the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
one you shove in is they comes over here

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.120 
one you shove in is they comes over here
hits<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.070> booster<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.640> then<00:02:52.230> Q's<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.500> minecart

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
hits the booster and then Q's a minecart

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.920 
hits the booster and then Q's a minecart
off<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:54.520> stack<00:02:54.820> and<00:02:55.060> goes<00:02:55.330> back<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.870> it

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
off this stack and goes back and it

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.130 
off this stack and goes back and it
recycles<00:02:56.410> itself<00:02:57.090> once<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:58.240> mod<00:02:58.450> card<00:02:58.750> goes

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
recycles itself once this mod card goes

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.670 
recycles itself once this mod card goes
off<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.470> goes<00:02:59.500> into<00:02:59.830> a<00:02:59.980> small<00:03:00.250> loop<00:03:00.720> with<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:02.050> be

off it goes into a small loop with to be

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.940 
off it goes into a small loop with to be
with<00:03:03.070> two<00:03:03.880> boosters<00:03:04.330> then<00:03:05.200> when<00:03:05.320> you<00:03:05.410> step<00:03:05.860> on

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
with two boosters then when you step on

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.720 
with two boosters then when you step on
the<00:03:06.010> pressure<00:03:06.220> plate<00:03:06.370> releases<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:08.370> now<00:03:09.370> when

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
the pressure plate releases it now when

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.030 
the pressure plate releases it now when
you're<00:03:09.880> coming<00:03:10.180> in<00:03:10.300> what<00:03:10.570> happens<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:14.040> do

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
you're coming in what happens is I do

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.830 
you're coming in what happens is I do
not<00:03:15.070> come<00:03:15.490> in<00:03:15.520> at<00:03:15.760> full<00:03:15.940> speed<00:03:16.210> that's<00:03:16.660> why

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
not come in at full speed that's why

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.710 
not come in at full speed that's why
sometimes<00:03:17.850> breaks<00:03:18.850> it's<00:03:19.150> not<00:03:19.300> hooked<00:03:19.420> up<00:03:19.600> to

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
sometimes breaks it's not hooked up to

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.170 
sometimes breaks it's not hooked up to
anything<00:03:19.780> yet<00:03:20.190> what<00:03:21.190> happens<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.730> when<00:03:22.090> you

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
anything yet what happens is when you

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.290 
anything yet what happens is when you
come<00:03:22.330> in<00:03:22.480> your<00:03:23.380> queue<00:03:23.740> away<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.280> minecart<00:03:25.090> from

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
come in your queue away a minecart from

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.810 
come in your queue away a minecart from
this<00:03:25.450> stack<00:03:27.210> show<00:03:28.210> this<00:03:28.360> in<00:03:28.510> there<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:29.700> once<00:03:30.700> I

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
this stack show this in there and once I

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.230 
this stack show this in there and once I
happens<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.630> comes<00:03:32.320> out<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:33.580> comes<00:03:33.790> out<00:03:33.940> of

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
happens it comes out it comes out of

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.740 
happens it comes out it comes out of
their<00:03:34.540> hits<00:03:35.350> this<00:03:35.620> booster<00:03:36.070> right<00:03:36.220> here<00:03:36.490> and

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
their hits this booster right here and

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.330 
their hits this booster right here and
then<00:03:37.750> both<00:03:38.020> are<00:03:38.200> hits<00:03:38.410> another<00:03:38.590> booster<00:03:39.100> this

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
then both are hits another booster this

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.730 
then both are hits another booster this
gives<00:03:39.580> us<00:03:39.670> some<00:03:39.850> time<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:40.570> it<00:03:41.230> goes<00:03:41.320> out

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
gives us some time to it and it goes out

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.460 
gives us some time to it and it goes out
and<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.480> pushes<00:03:43.480> your<00:03:43.690> mind<00:03:43.930> card<00:03:44.170> into<00:03:44.380> the

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
and it pushes your mind card into the

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.890 
and it pushes your mind card into the
system<00:03:44.950> a<00:03:45.160> certain<00:03:45.790> number<00:03:45.850> seconds<00:03:46.540> after

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
system a certain number seconds after

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.450 
system a certain number seconds after
you<00:03:46.930> got<00:03:47.140> out<00:03:47.170> of<00:03:47.320> it<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:47.950> it<00:03:48.010> gives<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.280> some

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
you got out of it so it gives you some

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.570 
you got out of it so it gives you some
time<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:48.670> get<00:03:48.850> help<00:03:49.680> then<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.950> comes<00:03:51.100> over<00:03:51.370> here

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
time to get help then it comes over here

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.720 
time to get help then it comes over here
it's<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.630> booster<00:03:52.989> it's<00:03:53.830> another<00:03:54.070> booster<00:03:54.520> and

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
it's a booster it's another booster and

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.300 
it's a booster it's another booster and
gets<00:03:55.300> recycled<00:03:55.570> again<00:03:55.840> back<00:03:56.170> into<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.560> stack

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
gets recycled again back into the stack

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.760 
gets recycled again back into the stack
well<00:03:58.970> your<00:03:59.090> mind<00:03:59.330> cards<00:03:59.599> does<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.530> one<00:04:00.650> you

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
well your mind cards does the one you

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.949 
well your mind cards does the one you
just<00:04:00.800> got<00:04:01.130> out<00:04:01.280> of<00:04:01.310> if<00:04:01.700> they<00:04:02.270> comes<00:04:02.480> in<00:04:02.630> here<00:04:02.810> in

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
just got out of if they comes in here in

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.400 
just got out of if they comes in here in
Cebu<00:04:03.200> stir<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:03.770> goes<00:04:04.489> into<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.910> stack<00:04:05.410> that

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
Cebu stir and goes into the stack that

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.150 
Cebu stir and goes into the stack that
goes<00:04:06.709> into<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.099> engine<00:04:08.230> or<00:04:09.230> here<00:04:09.590> so

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
goes into the engine or here so

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.190 
goes into the engine or here so
everything's<00:04:10.520> recycled<00:04:10.640> it's<00:04:11.330> pretty<00:04:11.930> clean
