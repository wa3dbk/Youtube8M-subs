we<00:01:19.659> tend<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.080> effort<00:01:20.860> doing<00:01:21.040> stuff<00:01:21.430> that's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
we tend to effort doing stuff that's

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.760 
we tend to effort doing stuff that's
maybe<00:01:21.850> over<00:01:22.240> some<00:01:22.270> 100<00:01:22.899> tons<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.350> peaceful

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
maybe over some 100 tons of peaceful

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.889 
maybe over some 100 tons of peaceful
usable<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.610> just<00:01:25.119> as<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.360> Roman<00:01:25.690> will<00:01:25.780> be

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
usable and just as a Roman will be

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.130 
usable and just as a Roman will be
interned<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:27.520> less<00:01:27.759> likely<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.179> -<00:01:28.690> great<00:01:28.929> job

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
interned it's less likely to - great job

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.279 
interned it's less likely to - great job
so<00:01:30.149> you<00:01:31.149> can<00:01:31.300> take<00:01:31.570> this<00:01:31.720> one<00:01:31.929> it<00:01:32.110> doesn't

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
so you can take this one it doesn't

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:39.570 
so you can take this one it doesn't
actually<00:01:32.440> mean<00:01:36.300> and<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.920> is<00:01:39.070> very<00:01:39.369> different

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
actually mean and it is very different

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.190 
actually mean and it is very different
for<00:01:39.880> G<00:01:40.149> so<00:01:40.330> this<00:01:40.450> is<00:01:40.630> hard<00:01:40.840> for<00:01:40.990> us<00:01:41.050> because

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
for G so this is hard for us because

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.900 
for G so this is hard for us because
I've<00:01:41.530> been<00:01:41.679> used<00:01:41.890> Salah<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.640> I'm<00:01:42.729> going<00:01:42.880> to

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.080 

the<00:01:49.140> hard<00:01:49.740> drive<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.070> Mustafa<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.730> what<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.910> want

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the hard drive is Mustafa so what I want

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.120 
the hard drive is Mustafa so what I want
to<00:01:51.150> do<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.480> create<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.170> dome-shaped

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
to do is create a dome-shaped
