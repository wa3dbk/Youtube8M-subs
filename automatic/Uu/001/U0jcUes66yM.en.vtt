first we're going to dice a fresh mango
you<00:00:22.930> have<00:00:23.050> to<00:00:23.169> cut<00:00:23.439> to<00:00:23.529> the<00:00:23.619> left<00:00:23.919> and<00:00:24.130> right<00:00:24.369> of

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
you have to cut to the left and right of

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.310 
you have to cut to the left and right of
the<00:00:24.699> pit<00:00:25.090> and<00:00:25.630> we're<00:00:25.750> going<00:00:25.869> to<00:00:25.900> perform<00:00:26.020> a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
the pit and we're going to perform a

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.620 
the pit and we're going to perform a
hedgehog<00:00:26.860> cut<00:00:27.130> so<00:00:28.060> we're<00:00:28.150> going<00:00:28.269> up<00:00:28.390> with<00:00:28.539> our

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
hedgehog cut so we're going up with our

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.990 
hedgehog cut so we're going up with our
two<00:00:28.929> sides<00:00:29.259> and<00:00:29.589> the<00:00:29.949> core<00:00:30.220> you<00:00:30.609> can<00:00:30.759> cut<00:00:30.910> the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
two sides and the core you can cut the

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.939 
two sides and the core you can cut the
edges<00:00:31.179> off<00:00:31.419> the<00:00:31.570> core<00:00:31.839> and<00:00:32.050> dice<00:00:32.349> it<00:00:32.379> normally

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
edges off the core and dice it normally

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.530 
edges off the core and dice it normally
and<00:00:33.129> then<00:00:33.730> we're<00:00:33.850> going<00:00:33.940> to<00:00:34.000> switch<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:34.330> a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
and then we're going to switch to a

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.689 
and then we're going to switch to a
paring<00:00:35.080> knife<00:00:35.110> and<00:00:35.440> perform<00:00:36.220> the<00:00:36.339> hedgehog

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
paring knife and perform the hedgehog

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.549 
paring knife and perform the hedgehog
cut<00:00:36.970> we're<00:00:37.750> going<00:00:37.870> to<00:00:37.930> use<00:00:38.019> the<00:00:38.140> paring<00:00:38.440> knife

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
cut we're going to use the paring knife

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.200 
cut we're going to use the paring knife
to<00:00:38.680> slice<00:00:38.890> through<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.129> flesh<00:00:39.579> of<00:00:39.850> the<00:00:40.030> mango

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
to slice through the flesh of the mango

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.380 
to slice through the flesh of the mango
in<00:00:40.690> a<00:00:41.230> checkerboard<00:00:41.890> type<00:00:42.339> pattern<00:00:42.730> there<00:00:42.940> but

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
in a checkerboard type pattern there but

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.180 
in a checkerboard type pattern there but
not<00:00:43.720> through<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.140> skin<00:00:44.440> so<00:00:44.680> you'd<00:00:44.949> be<00:00:45.039> very

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
not through the skin so you'd be very

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.500 
not through the skin so you'd be very
careful<00:00:45.610> not<00:00:45.699> to<00:00:45.760> go<00:00:45.940> all<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.239> way<00:00:46.270> through

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
careful not to go all the way through

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.439 
careful not to go all the way through
just<00:00:46.750> enough<00:00:47.680> to<00:00:48.129> cut<00:00:48.340> through<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.610> flesh<00:00:48.850> to

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
just enough to cut through the flesh to

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.150 
just enough to cut through the flesh to
the<00:00:49.690> skin<00:00:49.989> we're<00:00:50.710> gonna<00:00:50.859> go<00:00:50.920> ahead<00:00:50.980> and

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
the skin we're gonna go ahead and

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.950 
the skin we're gonna go ahead and
perform<00:00:51.250> that<00:00:51.489> on<00:00:51.609> both<00:00:51.940> halves<00:00:52.329> of<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.600> mango

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
perform that on both halves of the mango

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.209 
perform that on both halves of the mango
and<00:00:53.140> then<00:00:53.410> you're<00:00:53.530> simply<00:00:53.800> going<00:00:53.949> to<00:00:54.010> turn

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
and then you're simply going to turn

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.090 
and then you're simply going to turn
them<00:00:54.399> inside<00:00:54.640> out<00:00:55.420> by<00:00:56.079> applying<00:00:56.379> pressure<00:00:56.559> on

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
them inside out by applying pressure on

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.310 
them inside out by applying pressure on
the<00:00:57.460> bottom<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.239> edges<00:00:58.600> in<00:00:58.809> opposite

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
the bottom and the edges in opposite

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.229 
the bottom and the edges in opposite
directions<00:00:59.489> then<00:01:00.489> you<00:01:00.579> can<00:01:00.670> simply<00:01:00.940> pull

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
directions then you can simply pull

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.240 
directions then you can simply pull
these<00:01:01.359> off<00:01:01.420> or<00:01:01.840> cut<00:01:02.109> them<00:01:02.320> if<00:01:02.500> you<00:01:02.710> did<00:01:02.859> not<00:01:02.980> cut

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
these off or cut them if you did not cut

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.600 
these off or cut them if you did not cut
all<00:01:03.429> the<00:01:03.519> way<00:01:03.579> through<00:01:03.609> to<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:05.140> skin<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
all the way through to the skin the

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.240 
all the way through to the skin the
exact<00:01:06.970> shape<00:01:07.360> of<00:01:07.539> the<00:01:07.630> diced<00:01:08.110> mango<00:01:08.649> doesn't
