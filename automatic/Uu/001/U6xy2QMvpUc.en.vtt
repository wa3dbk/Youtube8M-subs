stands<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.170> plane<00:01:07.470> switching<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.490> has

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
stands for in plane switching which has

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.820 
stands for in plane switching which has
several<00:01:09.030> benefits<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.049> color<00:01:10.290> depth<00:01:10.560> and

how thin that this monitor actually is

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.930 
how thin that this monitor actually is
does<00:04:19.950> pop<00:04:20.160> out<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.340> little<00:04:20.430> bit<00:04:20.640> here<00:04:20.789> in<00:04:20.880> the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
does pop out a little bit here in the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.409 
does pop out a little bit here in the
back<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.359> it<00:04:21.510> that<00:04:21.539> gives<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.320> more<00:04:22.530> sturdy

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
back of it that gives it a more sturdy

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.850 
back of it that gives it a more sturdy
attachment<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.690> base<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:25.530> does<00:04:25.680> have<00:04:25.830> a

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
attachment to the base it does have a

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.750 
attachment to the base it does have a
tilt<00:04:26.099> function<00:04:26.250> so

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
tilt function so

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.040 
tilt function so
if<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.120> want<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.360> adjust<00:04:27.420> you<00:04:27.780> can<00:04:27.840> do

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
if you want to adjust you can do

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.720 
if you want to adjust you can do
negative<00:04:28.230> tilt<00:04:28.590> down<00:04:28.710> there<00:04:28.950> you<00:04:29.310> can<00:04:29.460> tilt<00:04:29.670> it

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
negative tilt down there you can tilt it

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.120 
negative tilt down there you can tilt it
back<00:04:29.940> about<00:04:30.540> that<00:04:30.750> far<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:31.560> also<00:04:31.680> noticed

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
back about that far you also noticed

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.770 
back about that far you also noticed
there<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.460> some<00:04:32.640> texture<00:04:33.090> here<00:04:33.300> on<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.600> back

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
there is some texture here on the back

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.740 
there is some texture here on the back
which<00:04:34.710> again<00:04:34.980> adds<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.760> look<00:04:35.910> you<00:04:36.510> have<00:04:36.660> an
