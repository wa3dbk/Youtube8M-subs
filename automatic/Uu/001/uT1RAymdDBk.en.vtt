00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
balloon get it onto this so it's past so

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.780 
balloon get it onto this so it's past so
its<00:02:59.190> up<00:02:59.340> past<00:02:59.850> where<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.920> white<00:03:01.920> thing<00:03:02.459> was

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
its up past where the white thing was

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.640 
its up past where the white thing was
and<00:03:03.709> get<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.920> on<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.510> part<00:03:06.900> where<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.380> lid

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
and get it on to the part where the lid

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.729 
and get it on to the part where the lid
screws<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.930> got<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.200> do<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:12.739> this

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
screws on so you got to do that this

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:26.640 
screws on so you got to do that this
might<00:03:14.040> take<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.370> second<00:03:15.060> or<00:03:15.209> two

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:38.700 

might<00:03:27.650> take<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:27.950> second<00:03:28.640> to

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:48.200 

you

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.730 

should<00:03:48.840> end<00:03:49.170> out<00:03:49.380> looking<00:03:49.980> like<00:03:50.190> this<00:03:51.740> look

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
should end out looking like this look

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.990 
should end out looking like this look
exactly<00:03:53.490> like<00:03:53.520> this<00:03:54.830> so<00:03:55.830> it's<00:03:56.070> got<00:03:56.730> enough

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
exactly like this so it's got enough

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.810 
exactly like this so it's got enough
power<00:03:57.330> just<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.810> go<00:03:57.990> with<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.550> without<00:03:59.550> the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
power just to go with that without the

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.390 
power just to go with that without the
elastic<00:04:00.800> then<00:04:01.800> third<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:03.150> take<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.630> elastic

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
elastic then third you take the elastic

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.120 
elastic then third you take the elastic
wrap<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.660> very<00:04:06.960> tip<00:04:07.440> where<00:04:07.920> the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
wrap it to the very tip where the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.990 
wrap it to the very tip where the
balloon<00:04:08.430> was<00:04:09.020> then<00:04:10.020> wrap<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.650> around<00:04:11.070> as<00:04:11.610> much

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
balloon was then wrap it around as much

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.780 
balloon was then wrap it around as much
as<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.480> can<00:04:15.500> wrap<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.530> around<00:04:16.800> as<00:04:17.250> much<00:04:17.430> as<00:04:17.670> you

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
as you can wrap it around as much as you

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.730 
as you can wrap it around as much as you
can<00:04:18.030> until<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:20.450> pretty<00:04:21.450> tight<00:04:21.810> so<00:04:22.620> the

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
can until it's pretty tight so the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.640 
can until it's pretty tight so the
balloon<00:04:23.040> won't<00:04:23.220> fly<00:04:23.640> off<00:04:23.880> while<00:04:24.270> you're

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
balloon won't fly off while you're

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:38.800 
balloon won't fly off while you're
shooting<00:04:27.680> so<00:04:28.680> it's<00:04:29.040> pretty<00:04:29.370> basic<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:33.650> yeah

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:05:06.550 

let<00:04:39.810> me<00:04:40.020> take<00:04:40.230> a<00:04:40.260> couple<00:04:40.620> seconds<00:04:41.160> to

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.550 

chit<00:05:07.560> end<00:05:07.770> out<00:05:07.980> looking<00:05:08.520> like<00:05:08.550> this<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:10.440> it's

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
chit end out looking like this so it's

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.960 
chit end out looking like this so it's
got<00:05:10.740> enough<00:05:10.980> power<00:05:11.250> just<00:05:13.310> join<00:05:14.310> a<00:05:14.490> part<00:05:14.820> of
