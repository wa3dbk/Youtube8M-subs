00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
hitting the power button for three

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.990 
hitting the power button for three
seconds<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.070> then<00:02:04.160> i<00:02:04.220> had<00:02:04.399> just<00:02:04.520> added<00:02:04.759> two

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000

seconds and then i had just added two
more<00:02:05.149> x's<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.050> if<00:02:06.140> i<00:02:06.229> hit<00:02:06.380> power<00:02:06.649> off<00:02:12.340> you'll

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
more x's so if i hit power off you'll

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.949 
more x's so if i hit power off you'll
see<00:02:13.550> that<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.820> automatically<00:02:14.239> powers<00:02:14.600> off<00:02:14.780> the

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
see that it automatically powers off the

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.180 
see that it automatically powers off the
ps3<00:02:16.720> that's<00:02:17.720> all<00:02:17.900> for<00:02:18.080> now<00:02:18.110> stay<00:02:18.650> tuned<00:02:18.920> we'll
