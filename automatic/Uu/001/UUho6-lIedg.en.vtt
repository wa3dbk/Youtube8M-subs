00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.740
 My girlfriend at home hit the 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.740
 loaded with gravel 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.020
 ae 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.580
 i 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.340
 ae 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.720
 It's what you found of the vibe of the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.900
 Saturday 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.000
 is really surprising because the 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.900
 people did not expect that 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.030
 were 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.410
 the tickets sold out almost 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.630
 week earlier by an audience of 1,500 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.150
 adolescents 1,500 teens and thus 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.670
 The receptivity was total 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.000
 me and the vibe of the crowd when the people 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.209
 It's also amazing Bahia playing. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.860
 really is tied to music 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.019
 electronics that this was also 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.930
 surprising thing you always see 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.120
 things but I could not see that the girl 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.650
 really likes electronic music then 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.530
 surpassing the expectation 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.200
 exceeded exceeded because there is the george 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.299
 she is traveling right it makes parties in 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.940

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.420
 and this one was the first one here in 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.519
 savior 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.010
 but then we have terms of 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.170
 people, so I watched him for what? 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.510
 I heard from the others here exceeded the total 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.479
 so and for the next is that savior 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.100
 what the guys can expect then it's going to be 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.100
 because the parties are always themed 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.040
 So send a kiss to the guys now.
