subjective<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.540> but<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.530> think<00:01:55.800> at<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> end<00:01:55.979> of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
subjective and but I think at the end of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.010 
subjective and but I think at the end of
the<00:01:56.220> day<00:01:56.370> is<00:01:56.430> all<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.120> argument<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.720> really

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the day is all that argument is really

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.990 
the day is all that argument is really
putting<00:01:58.260> all<00:01:58.650> the<00:01:58.890> ideas<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.490> table<00:01:59.520> and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
putting all the ideas on the table and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.910 
putting all the ideas on the table and
the<00:02:00.090> best<00:02:00.330> idea<00:02:00.750> rises<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.350> top<00:02:01.440> while

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the best idea rises to the top while

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.040 
the best idea rises to the top while
we're<00:02:02.070> driven<00:02:02.280> by<00:02:02.550> is<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.940> making<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.540> best
