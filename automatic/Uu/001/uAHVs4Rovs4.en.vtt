the<00:00:29.130> mini<00:00:29.339> is<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.669> great<00:00:30.150> car<00:00:30.419> I<00:00:30.689> love<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
the mini is a great car I love it and

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.689 
the mini is a great car I love it and
now<00:00:31.410> they've<00:00:31.560> gone<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> made<00:00:32.070> an<00:00:32.279> electric

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
now they've gone and made an electric

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.910 
now they've gone and made an electric
model<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.420> mini<00:00:33.629> e<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.110> sounding<00:00:34.739> for

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
model the mini e is sounding for

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.700 
model the mini e is sounding for
electric<00:00:35.399> obviously<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:37.140> take<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:37.680> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
electric obviously it can take it for a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.540 
spin as well as that good-looking design
it<00:00:46.320> has<00:00:46.440> all<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.710> characteristic

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it has all the characteristic

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.610 
it has all the characteristic
performance<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> mini<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.449> famous<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.019> so<00:00:49.500> it

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
performance the mini is famous for so it

full charge which will take you around

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.249 
full charge which will take you around
eight<00:01:05.280> hours<00:01:05.790> using<00:01:06.030> any<00:01:06.299> standard<00:01:06.840> three<00:01:07.049> pin

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
eight hours using any standard three pin

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.770 
eight hours using any standard three pin
socket<00:01:07.590> or<00:01:07.890> four<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> half<00:01:08.700> using<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.509> charge

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
socket or four and a half using a charge

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.260 
socket or four and a half using a charge
point<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:11.040> gets<00:01:11.189> all<00:01:11.490> its<00:01:11.520> power<00:01:11.909> from<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
point it gets all its power from a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.840 
point it gets all its power from a
front-mounted<00:01:12.890> 150<00:01:13.890> kilo<00:01:14.159> electric<00:01:14.640> motor

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
front-mounted 150 kilo electric motor

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.090 
front-mounted 150 kilo electric motor
which<00:01:15.329> generates<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> equivalent<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.439> 201

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
which generates the equivalent of 201

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.969 
which generates the equivalent of 201
horsepower<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.750> mini<00:01:18.960> II<00:01:19.020> also<00:01:19.409> features

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
horsepower the mini II also features

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.590 
horsepower the mini II also features
regenerative<00:01:20.640> braking<00:01:21.090> which<00:01:21.210> basically

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
regenerative braking which basically

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.030 
regenerative braking which basically
means<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> battery<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.500> given<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.829> slight

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
means the battery is given a slight

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.789 
means the battery is given a slight
charge<00:01:23.250> every<00:01:23.670> time<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.970> slow<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.180> car<00:01:24.420> down

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
charge every time you slow the car down

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.469 
charge every time you slow the car down
like<00:01:25.799> all<00:01:25.979> electric<00:01:26.399> cars<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.850> really<00:01:27.240> cheap

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
like all electric cars it's really cheap

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.420 
like all electric cars it's really cheap
to<00:01:27.659> run<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.079> mini<00:01:28.320> claims<00:01:28.649> it<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.189> learnt

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
to run and mini claims it can be learnt

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.069 
to run and mini claims it can be learnt
a<00:01:29.549> percent<00:01:29.820> more<00:01:29.970> efficient<00:01:30.390> than<00:01:30.540> its<00:01:30.689> petrol

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
a percent more efficient than its petrol

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.440 
a percent more efficient than its petrol
counterpart<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:32.550> like<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> smart<00:01:33.060> car<00:01:33.240> it's

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
counterpart just like the smart car it's

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.270 
counterpart just like the smart car it's
not<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.810> out<00:01:33.930> yet<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.260> it's<00:01:34.530> still<00:01:34.830> in<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
not you out yet as it's still in the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.040 
not you out yet as it's still in the
trial<00:01:35.580> phase<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.510> fact<00:01:36.690> that<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:36.930> not

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
trial phase but the fact that it's not

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.810 
trial phase but the fact that it's not
that<00:01:37.110> restricted<00:01:37.830> by<00:01:37.950> speed<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.520> has<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that restricted by speed and has a

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
that restricted by speed and has a
really<00:01:39.090> good<00:01:39.240> range<00:01:39.659> means<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> bit

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
really good range means you can do a bit

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.500 
really good range means you can do a bit
for<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.950> planet<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:42.000> where<00:01:42.120> you<00:01:42.180> need<00:01:42.330> to

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
for the planet and get where you need to

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.420 
for the planet and get where you need to
go<00:01:42.540> I've<00:01:43.290> got<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.710> say<00:01:43.920> my<00:01:44.820> favorite<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.390> far
