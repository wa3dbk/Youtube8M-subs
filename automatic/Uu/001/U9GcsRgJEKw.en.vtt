and I say radios people go I think

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.319 
and I say radios people go I think
because<00:03:57.250> people<00:03:57.280> are<00:03:57.940> starting<00:03:58.299> to

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
because people are starting to

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.920 
because people are starting to
appreciate<00:03:59.040> that<00:04:00.150> they<00:04:01.150> resonate<00:04:01.450> with<00:04:01.900> a

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
appreciate that they resonate with a

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.750 
appreciate that they resonate with a
whole<00:04:02.109> lot<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.379> synchronicities<00:04:03.069> with<00:04:03.579> the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
whole lot of synchronicities with the

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.809 
whole lot of synchronicities with the
deco<00:04:04.389> era<00:04:04.629> through<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.980> rise<00:04:06.159> of<00:04:06.370> radio

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
deco era through the the rise of radio

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.849 
deco era through the the rise of radio
with<00:04:07.329> with<00:04:07.689> a<00:04:07.720> new<00:04:07.989> material<00:04:08.349> such<00:04:08.829> as

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
with with a new material such as

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.679 
with with a new material such as
bakelite<00:04:09.430> so<00:04:09.970> there<00:04:10.090> are<00:04:10.180> many<00:04:10.299> things<00:04:10.569> that

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
bakelite so there are many things that

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.569 
bakelite so there are many things that
went<00:04:10.959> together<00:04:11.109> to<00:04:11.530> make<00:04:11.680> these<00:04:12.189> particular

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
went together to make these particular

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.360 
went together to make these particular
radios<00:04:13.180> very<00:04:13.720> significant<00:04:14.349> and<00:04:14.620> I<00:04:15.069> was<00:04:15.250> in

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
radios very significant and I was in

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.360 
radios very significant and I was in
England<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:16.329> few<00:04:16.419> years<00:04:16.870> ago<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:18.160> saw

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
England a few years ago and and I saw

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.449 
England a few years ago and and I saw
this<00:04:18.609> radio<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.539> green<00:04:19.979> Emerson<00:04:20.979> I<00:04:21.220> was

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
this radio the the green Emerson I was

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.909 
this radio the the green Emerson I was
just<00:04:21.669> blown<00:04:21.849> away<00:04:21.880> by<00:04:22.150> them<00:04:22.539> and<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.620> thought

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
just blown away by them and I thought

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.320 
just blown away by them and I thought
that'd<00:04:24.310> be<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.430> nice<00:04:24.580> thing<00:04:24.759> to<00:04:24.849> collect<00:04:25.000> yeah

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
that'd be a nice thing to collect yeah

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.089 
that'd be a nice thing to collect yeah
it's<00:04:25.810> easy<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.199> see<00:04:26.380> why<00:04:26.560> you've<00:04:26.740> been<00:04:26.860> blown

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
it's easy to see why you've been blown

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:28.980 
it's easy to see why you've been blown
away<00:04:27.370> we've<00:04:27.639> all<00:04:27.789> been<00:04:27.970> blown<00:04:28.150> away<00:04:28.419> -<00:04:28.479> and

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
away we've all been blown away - and

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.750 
away we've all been blown away - and
we're<00:04:29.410> particularly<00:04:29.860> interested<00:04:30.550> by<00:04:30.699> the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
we're particularly interested by the

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.120 
we're particularly interested by the
design<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.240> them<00:04:31.630> it's<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:31.990> aesthetics<00:04:32.650> but

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
design of them it's the aesthetics but

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.529 
design of them it's the aesthetics but
we<00:04:33.280> know<00:04:33.460> that<00:04:33.699> there<00:04:33.849> are<00:04:33.880> collectors<00:04:34.270> out

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
we know that there are collectors out

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.050 
we know that there are collectors out
there<00:04:34.599> for<00:04:35.110> whom<00:04:35.289> it's<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.070> valves<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:36.849> the

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
there for whom it's the valves and the

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.960 
there for whom it's the valves and the
electrics<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.380> really<00:04:38.650> turn<00:04:38.919> them<00:04:39.159> on<00:04:39.280> what

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
electrics that really turn them on what

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.760 
electrics that really turn them on what
is<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.210> about<00:04:40.330> them<00:04:40.630> for<00:04:40.870> you<00:04:41.020> specifically

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
is it about them for you specifically

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.339 
is it about them for you specifically
I'm<00:04:42.159> completely<00:04:42.820> a<00:04:42.849> cabinet<00:04:43.240> guy<00:04:43.419> a<00:04:43.449> shape<00:04:43.930> the

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
I'm completely a cabinet guy a shape the

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.070 
I'm completely a cabinet guy a shape the
the<00:04:44.740> size<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.430> texture<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:46.510> field<00:04:46.780> that

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
the size the texture the field that

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.899 
the size the texture the field that
there<00:04:47.260> are<00:04:47.349> many<00:04:47.530> aspects<00:04:47.979> but<00:04:48.130> but<00:04:48.610> it's<00:04:48.729> that

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
there are many aspects but but it's that

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.270 
there are many aspects but but it's that
deco<00:04:49.270> design<00:04:49.659> that<00:04:49.870> machine<00:04:50.199> age<00:04:50.380> design<00:04:50.889> and

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
deco design that machine age design and

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.830 
deco design that machine age design and
and<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:51.970> fact<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.240> there's<00:04:52.479> such<00:04:52.659> a<00:04:52.690> variety

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
and the fact that there's such a variety

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.260 
and the fact that there's such a variety
and<00:04:53.620> there<00:04:53.979> are<00:04:54.070> so<00:04:54.250> many<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.610> them<00:04:54.789> and<00:04:54.940> then

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
and there are so many of them and then

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.600 
and there are so many of them and then
in<00:04:55.389> each<00:04:55.510> variety<00:04:55.810> there<00:04:56.289> are<00:04:56.500> a<00:04:56.530> set<00:04:56.889> do<00:04:57.580> I

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
in each variety there are a set do I

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.939 
in each variety there are a set do I
have<00:04:57.880> ten<00:04:58.120> colors<00:04:58.360> no<00:04:58.720> heartiness<00:04:59.050> it<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.620> so

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
have ten colors no heartiness it and so

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.700 
have ten colors no heartiness it and so
it's<00:05:00.490> not<00:05:00.610> just<00:05:00.760> getting<00:05:00.849> one<00:05:01.240> it<00:05:02.020> there's

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
it's not just getting one it there's

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.899 
it's not just getting one it there's
knit<00:05:02.919> but<00:05:03.010> there's<00:05:03.190> never<00:05:03.340> there's<00:05:03.760> never

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
knit but there's never there's never

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.310 
knit but there's never there's never
enough<00:05:04.210> there's<00:05:04.419> another<00:05:04.599> Miller<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.139> I'm

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
enough there's another Miller and I'm

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.279 
enough there's another Miller and I'm
I'm<00:05:05.710> intrigued<00:05:06.520> how<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.060> get<00:05:07.360> them<00:05:07.510> so<00:05:07.780> shiny

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
I'm intrigued how you get them so shiny

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:09.930 
I'm intrigued how you get them so shiny
because<00:05:08.860> most<00:05:09.099> of<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.280> radios<00:05:09.580> that<00:05:09.610> come

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
because most of the radios that come

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.850 
because most of the radios that come
through<00:05:10.060> my<00:05:10.240> hand<00:05:10.479> are<00:05:10.630> kind<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:10.840> dull<00:05:11.139> what's

at this and there's a guy in Sydney and
one<00:05:16.900> guy<00:05:17.080> in<00:05:17.229> Melbourne<00:05:17.620> who<00:05:17.979> specialized<00:05:18.520> in

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
one guy in Melbourne who specialized in

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.820 
one guy in Melbourne who specialized in
it<00:05:18.849> and<00:05:19.000> they<00:05:19.449> polish<00:05:19.840> them<00:05:19.870> and<00:05:20.169> I<00:05:20.260> hands<00:05:20.590> him

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
it and they polish them and I hands him

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.790 
it and they polish them and I hands him
up<00:05:21.010> by<00:05:21.220> hand<00:05:21.550> with<00:05:21.880> slate<00:05:22.659> abrasives<00:05:23.260> yes<00:05:23.560> they

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
up by hand with slate abrasives yes they

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.540 
up by hand with slate abrasives yes they
start<00:05:24.099> with<00:05:25.169> sandpaper<00:05:26.169> and<00:05:27.070> they<00:05:27.310> worked

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
start with sandpaper and they worked

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.219 
start with sandpaper and they worked
their<00:05:27.760> way<00:05:27.789> through<00:05:27.940> wet<00:05:28.360> and<00:05:28.539> dry<00:05:28.750> and<00:05:29.050> down

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
their way through wet and dry and down

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.440 
their way through wet and dry and down
to<00:05:29.380> brass<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:29.949> it's<00:05:30.580> not<00:05:30.789> like<00:05:30.969> furniture

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
to brass so it's not like furniture

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.480 
to brass so it's not like furniture
which<00:05:31.599> gathers<00:05:32.050> a<00:05:32.080> patina<00:05:32.560> which<00:05:32.860> would<00:05:33.340> be

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
which gathers a patina which would be

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.180 
which gathers a patina which would be
lost<00:05:33.700> if<00:05:33.880> you<00:05:33.940> took<00:05:34.180> it<00:05:34.330> back<00:05:34.510> to<00:05:34.539> where<00:05:34.810> it<00:05:34.840> was

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
lost if you took it back to where it was

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.980 
lost if you took it back to where it was
I<00:05:35.220> think<00:05:35.640> with<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:35.820> radios<00:05:36.180> this<00:05:36.720> this

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
I think with the radios this this

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.990 
I think with the radios this this
particular<00:05:37.320> Emerson<00:05:37.920> was<00:05:38.100> actually<00:05:38.490> brown

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
particular Emerson was actually brown

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.440 
particular Emerson was actually brown
and<00:05:39.300> green<00:05:39.570> and<00:05:40.320> recently<00:05:41.100> I<00:05:41.190> had<00:05:42.150> it<00:05:42.270> polished

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
and green and recently I had it polished

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.770 
and green and recently I had it polished
just<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:43.200> see<00:05:43.380> and<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:44.910> the<00:05:45.210> candy<00:05:45.570> of<00:05:45.690> the

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
just to see and the the the candy of the

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.560 
just to see and the the the candy of the
green<00:05:46.020> came<00:05:46.320> up<00:05:46.530> so<00:05:47.490> it<00:05:47.910> just<00:05:48.150> looks<00:05:48.300> so<00:05:48.450> much

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
green came up so it just looks so much

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.530 
green came up so it just looks so much
more<00:05:48.630> exact<00:05:49.110> you<00:05:49.260> know<00:05:50.160> Peter<00:05:50.640> a<00:05:51.090> lot<00:05:51.450> of

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
more exact you know Peter a lot of

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.060 
more exact you know Peter a lot of
people<00:05:51.720> are<00:05:51.780> going<00:05:51.870> to<00:05:51.930> be<00:05:52.050> thinking<00:05:52.410> those

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
people are going to be thinking those

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.180 
people are going to be thinking those
bright<00:05:53.580> colored<00:05:54.030> ones<00:05:54.300> are<00:05:54.510> just

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
bright colored ones are just

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.320 
bright colored ones are just
astonishingly<00:05:56.190> wonderful<00:05:56.880> I<00:05:57.030> mean<00:05:57.060> they're

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
astonishingly wonderful I mean they're

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.680 
astonishingly wonderful I mean they're
not<00:05:57.450> just<00:05:57.780> great<00:05:58.020> they<00:05:58.260> are<00:05:59.420> gobsmacking<00:06:00.420> ly

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
not just great they are gobsmacking ly

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.340 
not just great they are gobsmacking ly
great<00:06:01.880> why<00:06:02.880> didn't<00:06:03.330> they<00:06:03.420> take<00:06:03.720> off<00:06:03.990> do<00:06:04.260> you

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
great why didn't they take off do you

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.560 
great why didn't they take off do you
think<00:06:04.620> they<00:06:05.430> weren't<00:06:05.610> particularly<00:06:06.240> more

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
think they weren't particularly more

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.420 
think they weren't particularly more
expensive<00:06:07.050> than<00:06:07.320> the<00:06:07.530> brown<00:06:07.710> radios<00:06:08.160> they

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
expensive than the brown radios they
