there

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
there

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:16.500 
there
they're<00:02:07.180> hid<00:02:07.540> update<00:02:14.940> all<00:02:15.940> right<00:02:16.150> we're<00:02:16.420> going

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
they're hid update all right we're going

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.420 
they're hid update all right we're going
to<00:02:16.600> do<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.690> driving<00:02:17.680> test<00:02:17.800> this<00:02:18.010> will<00:02:18.190> be<00:02:18.280> on<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
to do a driving test this will be on the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.860 
to do a driving test this will be on the
side<00:02:18.670> mirror<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.120> think<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.390> might<00:02:19.480> show<00:02:19.720> up<00:02:19.750> a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
side mirror I think it might show up a

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.330 
side mirror I think it might show up a
little<00:02:19.930> bit<00:02:20.140> better<00:02:22.740> let<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.830> warm<00:02:23.980> up<00:02:24.130> and

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
little bit better let it warm up and

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:38.910 
little bit better let it warm up and
we'll<00:02:24.910> take<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.150> for<00:02:25.300> that

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:03:44.220 

the<00:02:39.310> guy
