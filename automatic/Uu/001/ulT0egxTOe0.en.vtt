00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
from the resources produced by the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.350 
from the resources produced by the
civilizations

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
civilizations

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.300 
civilizations
for<00:02:27.870> Babylon<00:02:28.260> they<00:02:28.530> actually<00:02:28.680> start<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.160> game

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
for Babylon they actually start the game

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.630 
for Babylon they actually start the game
with<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.580> ability<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:30.110> produce<00:02:31.110> brick<00:02:31.890> by

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
with the ability to produce brick by

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.970 
with the ability to produce brick by
acquiring<00:02:33.150> other<00:02:33.600> buildings<00:02:34.290> players<00:02:34.770> are

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
acquiring other buildings players are

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.430 
acquiring other buildings players are
able<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.820> increase<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.660> amount<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.990> resources

that<00:02:37.560> are<00:02:37.740> available<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.310> them<00:02:38.700> each<00:02:38.850> turn<00:02:39.180> I

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
that are available to them each turn I

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.490 
that are available to them each turn I
could<00:02:41.640> for<00:02:42.000> example<00:02:42.030> build<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.990> stone<00:02:43.200> pit

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
could for example build a stone pit

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.190 
could for example build a stone pit
which<00:02:44.460> would<00:02:44.910> go<00:02:45.090> into<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.390> resource<00:02:45.720> section

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
which would go into the resource section

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.370 
which would go into the resource section
of<00:02:46.380> my<00:02:46.980> civilization<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.570> every<00:02:48.960> turn<00:02:49.140> after

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
of my civilization so every turn after

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.590 
of my civilization so every turn after
this<00:02:49.650> I'd<00:02:49.890> be<00:02:50.130> able<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.370> produce<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.880> brick<00:02:51.360> and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
this I'd be able to produce a brick and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.230 
this I'd be able to produce a brick and
a<00:02:51.720> stone<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:52.200> neat<00:02:53.130> aspect<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:53.790> game<00:02:54.060> is

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
a stone a neat aspect to this game is

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.000 
a stone a neat aspect to this game is

want for example i could buy this glass
from<00:03:05.220> my<00:03:05.400> rightmost<00:03:06.330> player<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:07.950> here's<00:03:08.370> an

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
from my rightmost player so here's an

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.979 
from my rightmost player so here's an
example<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.940> how<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.150> game<00:03:09.390> actually<00:03:09.540> plays

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
example of how the game actually plays

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.580 
example of how the game actually plays
when<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.920> game<00:03:11.100> starts<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.670> get<00:03:12.510> seven<00:03:13.200> cards

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
when the game starts you get seven cards

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.380 
when the game starts you get seven cards
and<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:14.310> get<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.520> choose<00:03:14.730> which<00:03:15.060> one<00:03:15.270> you'd

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
and you get to choose which one you'd

and you get to choose which one you'd
like<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.600> play<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.810> table<00:03:16.380> so<00:03:17.370> here<00:03:18.150> I'm<00:03:18.360> going

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
like to play the table so here I'm going

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.320 
like to play the table so here I'm going
to<00:03:18.570> play<00:03:18.780> my<00:03:19.050> stockade<00:03:19.650> because<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.580> cost<00:03:21.180> me

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
to play my stockade because it cost me

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.470 
to play my stockade because it cost me
one<00:03:21.510> would<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.020> my<00:03:22.830> civilization<00:03:23.700> supplies

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
one would and my civilization supplies

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.170 
one would and my civilization supplies
me<00:03:24.660> with<00:03:24.690> one<00:03:25.110> would<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.340> simply<00:03:26.700> place<00:03:27.000> at

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
me with one would so I simply place at

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.050 
me with one would so I simply place at
the<00:03:27.300> table<00:03:27.510> when<00:03:28.350> all<00:03:28.739> my<00:03:29.070> opponents<00:03:29.550> also<00:03:29.700> do

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
the table when all my opponents also do

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.120 
the table when all my opponents also do
the<00:03:30.180> same<00:03:30.209> thing<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:30.780> then<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.620> passed<00:03:31.950> my<00:03:32.100> hand

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
the same thing and then I passed my hand

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.930 
the same thing and then I passed my hand
to<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.030> left<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:35.299> then<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:36.540> receive<00:03:37.610> six<00:03:38.610> cards

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
to the left and then I receive six cards

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.140 
to the left and then I receive six cards
and<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.530> again<00:03:41.160> choose<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.700> building<00:03:42.120> that

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
and so I again choose a building that

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.810 
and so I again choose a building that
I'd<00:03:42.390> like<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.720> play<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.920> I'm<00:03:44.040> going<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.190> play<00:03:44.430> my

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.220 
I'd like to play so I'm going to play my
stone<00:03:45.209> pit<00:03:45.480> which<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.940> free<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.959> put<00:03:49.140> this

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
stone pit which is free and I put this

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.690 
stone pit which is free and I put this
up<00:03:49.410> in<00:03:49.500> my<00:03:49.590> resource<00:03:49.980> section<00:03:52.430> that's<00:03:53.430> my<00:03:53.549> hand

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
up in my resource section that's my hand

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.960 
up in my resource section that's my hand
to<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.880> left<00:03:54.170> get<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.200> new<00:03:55.380> hand<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:56.760> game

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
to the left get a new hand the game

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.610 
to the left get a new hand the game
continues<00:03:57.269> like<00:03:57.570> this<00:03:57.600> for<00:03:58.049> three<00:03:58.320> separate

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
continues like this for three separate

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.470 
continues like this for three separate
rounds<00:03:58.830> of<00:03:59.160> seven<00:03:59.790> cards<00:04:00.060> each<00:04:00.239> for<00:04:00.450> each

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
rounds of seven cards each for each

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.050 
rounds of seven cards each for each
player<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.920> I'll<00:04:02.190> cut<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.549> chase<00:04:02.580> on<00:04:02.940> this

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
player so I'll cut to the chase on this

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.140 
player so I'll cut to the chase on this
one<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.390> absolutely<00:04:03.769> love<00:04:04.769> seven<00:04:05.370> wonders<00:04:05.730> the
