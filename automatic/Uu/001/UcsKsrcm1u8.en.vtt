in<00:00:14.650> last<00:00:14.740> year's<00:00:15.070> club<00:00:15.340> it<00:00:15.519> did<00:00:16.090> you

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:16.359 
in last year's club it did you

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.690 
in last year's club it did you
anticipate<00:00:17.170> that<00:00:17.710> kind<00:00:18.010> of<00:00:18.100> start<00:00:18.400> that<00:00:18.460> will

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
anticipate that kind of start that will

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.550 
anticipate that kind of start that will
be<00:00:18.850> for<00:00:19.060> the<00:00:19.119> way<00:00:19.360> the<00:00:19.510> balls<00:00:19.900> continue<00:00:20.470> to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
be for the way the balls continue to

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.540 
be for the way the balls continue to
move<00:00:20.650> around<00:00:20.800> for<00:00:21.480> men<00:00:23.160> you're<00:00:24.160> thinking

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
move around for men you're thinking

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.250 
move around for men you're thinking
about<00:00:24.699> that<00:00:24.910> they're<00:00:25.510> going<00:00:25.660> to<00:00:25.750> happen<00:00:26.050> that

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
about that they're going to happen that

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.410 
about that they're going to happen that
in<00:00:27.010> every<00:00:27.190> game<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:27.640> different<00:00:27.670> of<00:00:28.029> course<00:00:28.090> but

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
in every game is different of course but

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.349 
in every game is different of course but
I<00:00:29.170> think<00:00:29.770> so<00:00:30.070> the<00:00:30.189> first<00:00:30.430> quarter<00:00:30.640> was<00:00:30.699> amazing

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
I think so the first quarter was amazing

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:32.969 
I think so the first quarter was amazing
we're<00:00:31.570> moving<00:00:31.900> the<00:00:32.020> ball<00:00:32.199> hitting<00:00:32.680> shots

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:32.979 
we're moving the ball hitting shots

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:37.590 
we're moving the ball hitting shots
layups<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:34.920> unity<00:00:35.920> so<00:00:36.100> we<00:00:36.219> got<00:00:36.399> about<00:00:36.429> 12<00:00:37.420> 15

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
layups and unity so we got about 12 15

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.719 
layups and unity so we got about 12 15
points<00:00:38.109> late<00:00:38.350> but<00:00:38.829> then<00:00:39.039> they<00:00:39.219> catch<00:00:39.489> yourself

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:39.729 
points late but then they catch yourself

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.910 
points late but then they catch yourself
you<00:00:40.449> didn't<00:00:40.749> play<00:00:40.899> good<00:00:41.050> defense<00:00:41.109> in<00:00:41.530> the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
you didn't play good defense in the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.069 
you didn't play good defense in the
second<00:00:42.370> quarter<00:00:42.460> but<00:00:42.909> you<00:00:43.420> know<00:00:43.539> the<00:00:43.899> half

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
second quarter but you know the half

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.210 
second quarter but you know the half
time<00:00:44.109> you<00:00:45.100> start<00:00:45.429> step<00:00:46.179> together

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
time you start step together

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.640

here<00:01:08.750> he<00:01:08.780> goes<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:09.440> long<00:01:09.770> trees<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.580> he<00:01:10.850> was

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
here he goes and long trees and he was

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.390 
here he goes and long trees and he was
solid<00:01:11.420> in<00:01:11.540> defence<00:01:11.619> you<00:01:12.619> know<00:01:12.740> Kobe<00:01:13.130> Keegan

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
solid in defence you know Kobe Keegan

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.790 
solid in defence you know Kobe Keegan
score<00:01:13.640> 30<00:01:13.880> points<00:01:13.970> we're<00:01:14.510> not<00:01:15.020> he<00:01:15.260> take<00:01:15.500> a<00:01:15.530> lot

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
score 30 points we're not he take a lot

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.760 
score 30 points we're not he take a lot
of<00:01:15.830> shots<00:01:16.160> but<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:16.670> think<00:01:17.660> so<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.050> percentage

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
of shots but I think so the percentage

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.190 
of shots but I think so the percentage
was<00:01:18.890> not<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.280> do<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:19.640> but<00:01:19.970> that<00:01:20.479> what<00:01:20.690> we<00:01:20.840> wanted

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
was not to do so but that what we wanted

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.749 
was not to do so but that what we wanted
to<00:01:21.380> do<00:01:21.649> then<00:01:21.910> no<00:01:22.910> it<00:01:23.300> was<00:01:23.509> great<00:01:23.780> team<00:01:24.020> effort

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
to do then no it was great team effort

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.160 
to do then no it was great team effort
the<00:01:25.759> opponent<00:01:26.119> party<00:01:26.330> knife<00:01:26.479> figure<00:01:26.930> to<00:01:27.050> be<00:01:27.140> a

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
the opponent party knife figure to be a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.480 
the opponent party knife figure to be a
little<00:01:27.380> bit<00:01:27.470> more<00:01:27.710> difficult<00:01:27.920> just<00:01:28.310> talk

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
little bit more difficult just talk

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.920 
little bit more difficult just talk
about<00:01:28.640> defense<00:01:28.970> did<00:01:29.360> some<00:01:29.540> of<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.660> things<00:01:29.869> you

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
want to try to find all right yeah those

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.230 
want to try to find all right yeah those
easy<00:01:34.070> baskets<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.790> might<00:01:35.479> think<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:37.240> you're

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
easy baskets you might think so you're

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.960 
easy baskets you might think so you're
San<00:01:38.540> Antonio<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:39.289> the<00:01:39.649> the<00:01:40.369> world<00:01:40.550> champions

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
San Antonio the the the world champions

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.420 
San Antonio the the the world champions
and<00:01:41.180> they're<00:01:41.750> moving<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.140> ball<00:01:42.289> well<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:42.560> you

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
and they're moving the ball well so you

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.670 
and they're moving the ball well so you
need<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.729> be<00:01:43.850> solid<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.450> be<00:01:44.840> on<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.410> same<00:01:45.649> page

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
need to be solid to be on the same page

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.359 
need to be solid to be on the same page
you<00:01:46.670> know<00:01:46.970> they've<00:01:47.539> their<00:01:48.080> shots<00:01:48.350> we<00:01:48.710> need<00:01:49.250> to

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
you know they've their shots we need to

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.310 
you know they've their shots we need to
challenge<00:01:49.580> heavy<00:01:49.940> shots<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.479> when<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.140> shot

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
challenge heavy shots and when the shot

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.160 
challenge heavy shots and when the shot
goes<00:01:51.350> off<00:01:51.710> much<00:01:52.009> our<00:01:52.789> biggest<00:01:53.240> fear<00:01:53.569> is<00:01:53.690> 43

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
goes off much our biggest fear is 43

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.109 
goes off much our biggest fear is 43
money<00:01:54.410> we<00:01:54.770> need<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.280> get<00:01:55.429> those<00:01:55.610> rebounds<00:01:55.970> and

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
money we need to get those rebounds and

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.389 
money we need to get those rebounds and
if<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:56.539> do<00:01:56.869> that<00:01:57.080> I<00:01:57.110> think<00:01:57.440> so<00:01:57.590> then<00:01:58.220> we're

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
if you do that I think so then we're

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.100 
if you do that I think so then we're
going<00:01:58.550> to<00:01:58.610> be<00:01:58.729> fine<00:01:59.000> then<00:01:59.209> we<00:01:59.330> can<00:01:59.479> run<00:01:59.690> no

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
going to be fine then we can run no

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.960 
going to be fine then we can run no
