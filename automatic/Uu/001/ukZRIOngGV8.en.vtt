00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
a enigma datapack across from it so

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.780 
a enigma datapack across from it so
that's<00:02:06.740> one<00:02:07.010> way<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.190> know<00:02:07.430> you're<00:02:07.640> in<00:02:07.730> the

this particular plaque on the opposite
side<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:19.120> now<00:02:20.120> going<00:02:20.570> back<00:02:20.750> into<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.770> Bari<00:02:22.190> we

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
side so now going back into the Bari we

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.820 
side so now going back into the Bari we

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
basically so yeah I don't know why I

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.710 
basically so yeah I don't know why I
didn't<00:02:29.720> do<00:02:29.990> this<00:02:30.170> one<00:02:30.380> in<00:02:30.770> order<00:02:31.010> with<00:02:31.910> the

was<00:02:36.170> no<00:02:36.440> reason<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:36.920> guess<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.340> doesn't<00:02:37.490> really

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610
