reason I call it cymbal stands is that's
what<00:01:37.580> I<00:01:37.610> call<00:01:37.910> it<00:01:38.119> but<00:01:39.050> it's<00:01:39.229> actually<00:01:39.380> because

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
what I call it but it's actually because

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.740 
what I call it but it's actually because
I<00:01:39.950> mounted<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.369> rack<00:01:40.640> tom<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.450> cymbal

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
I mounted the rack tom to the cymbal

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.440 
I mounted the rack tom to the cymbal
stand<00:01:41.960> it's<00:01:42.110> all<00:01:42.229> based<00:01:42.440> off<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.800> rack<00:01:42.950> tom

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
stand it's all based off the rack tom

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.150 
stand it's all based off the rack tom
now<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.509> reason<00:01:44.780> I<00:01:44.869> chose<00:01:45.020> cymbal<00:01:45.380> stands<00:01:45.710> was

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
now the reason I chose cymbal stands was

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.680 
now the reason I chose cymbal stands was
because<00:01:46.460> this<00:01:46.610> is<00:01:46.789> something<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:47.149> already

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
because this is something you already

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.440 
because this is something you already
have<00:01:48.200> you<00:01:48.740> already<00:01:48.890> have<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:49.759> know<00:01:49.789> four<00:01:50.300> or

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
have you already have you know four or

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.820 
have you already have you know four or
five<00:01:50.630> cymbal<00:01:51.020> stands<00:01:51.229> whatever<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.679> may<00:01:51.800> be

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
five cymbal stands whatever it may be

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.040 
five cymbal stands whatever it may be
you<00:01:52.580> don't<00:01:52.700> need<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:53.090> necessarily<00:01:53.210> go<00:01:53.720> out<00:01:53.750> and

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
you don't need to necessarily go out and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.320 
you don't need to necessarily go out and

you can use to add symbols to your setup
to<00:02:00.920> spice<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.160> up<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.459> bit<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:01.970> let's<00:02:02.149> have<00:02:02.270> a

to spice it up a bit so let's have a

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.059 
to spice it up a bit so let's have a
look<00:02:02.539> at<00:02:02.660> how<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.810> stock<00:02:03.140> set<00:02:03.440> up<00:02:03.590> was

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
look at how the stock set up was

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.169 
look at how the stock set up was
modified<00:02:04.580> we<00:02:05.450> started<00:02:05.899> with<00:02:06.130> two<00:02:07.130> crashes<00:02:07.429> one

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179

in<00:03:08.000> between<00:03:08.480> both<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.050> above<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.890> do<00:03:10.520> that<00:03:10.790> I

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
in between both and above to do that I

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.020 
in between both and above to do that I
needed<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:12.050> boom<00:03:12.500> arm<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:13.670> would<00:03:13.790> give<00:03:14.000> me

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
needed a boom arm that would give me

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.390 
needed a boom arm that would give me
some<00:03:14.150> quirky<00:03:14.750> angles<00:03:15.110> I<00:03:15.319> needed<00:03:15.830> sort<00:03:16.099> of<00:03:16.220> at<00:03:16.310> a

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
some quirky angles I needed sort of at a

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.260 
some quirky angles I needed sort of at a
jigsaw<00:03:17.030> type<00:03:17.270> of<00:03:17.420> effect<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.290> I<00:03:18.730> used<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.880> SC

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
jigsaw type of effect so I used the SC

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.660 
jigsaw type of effect so I used the SC
you<00:03:20.540> see<00:03:20.750> B<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:20.989> has<00:03:21.380> two<00:03:21.770> ultra<00:03:22.190> just<00:03:22.489> ball

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
you see B it has two ultra just ball

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.820 
you see B it has two ultra just ball
joints<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:23.840> allows<00:03:24.020> me<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.230> zigzag

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
joints so that it allows me to zigzag

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.410 
joints so that it allows me to zigzag
the<00:03:25.010> boom<00:03:25.190> arm<00:03:25.370> whatever<00:03:25.670> I<00:03:25.730> need<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.090> on<00:03:26.300> my

right side I have my ride cymbal my

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.180 
right side I have my ride cymbal my
original<00:03:29.270> crash<00:03:29.500> they're<00:03:30.500> both<00:03:30.739> on<00:03:30.950> their<00:03:31.069> own

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
original crash they're both on their own

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.120 
original crash they're both on their own
stands<00:03:31.700> now<00:03:32.239> I<00:03:32.270> added<00:03:32.870> another<00:03:33.050> crash<00:03:33.739> cymbal

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
stands now I added another crash cymbal

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.509 
stands now I added another crash cymbal
and<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.730> has<00:03:34.910> its<00:03:35.090> own<00:03:35.209> stand<00:03:35.540> but<00:03:36.170> my<00:03:36.739> Chyna<00:03:37.069> is

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
and it has its own stand but my Chyna is

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.030 
and it has its own stand but my Chyna is
sharing<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.690> same<00:03:38.959> cymbal<00:03:39.530> stand<00:03:39.800> as<00:03:39.980> my

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
sharing the same cymbal stand as my

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.350 
sharing the same cymbal stand as my
added<00:03:40.790> crash

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
added crash

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.750 
added crash
I<00:03:41.390> used<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.350> boom<00:03:42.650> arm<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:43.310> SC<00:03:43.850> GC<00:03:44.660> abt<00:03:45.260> that

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
I used a boom arm the SC GC abt that

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.500 
I used a boom arm the SC GC abt that
allows<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.030> do<00:03:47.150> this

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
allows you to do this

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.229 
allows you to do this
clamps<00:03:48.049> directly<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.830> an<00:03:49.130> existing<00:03:49.970> cymbal

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
clamps directly to an existing cymbal

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.880 
clamps directly to an existing cymbal
stand<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.959> can<00:03:50.989> mount<00:03:51.319> it<00:03:51.440> off<00:03:51.620> at

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
stand and you can mount it off at

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.720 
stand and you can mount it off at
variable<00:03:52.580> angles<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.590> this<00:03:54.739> is<00:03:54.920> setup<00:03:55.280> option

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
variable angles so this is setup option

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.559 
variable angles so this is setup option
B<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.360> it's<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.110> single<00:03:57.380> tom<00:03:57.680> stand<00:03:58.010> setup

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
B and it's the single tom stand setup

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.210 
B and it's the single tom stand setup
now<00:03:59.569> the<00:03:59.630> reason<00:03:59.989> I<00:04:00.080> used<00:04:00.380> a<00:04:00.650> single<00:04:00.950> time

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
now the reason I used a single time

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.970 
now the reason I used a single time
stand<00:04:01.549> is<00:04:01.670> because<00:04:02.000> some<00:04:02.810> players<00:04:03.019> don't<00:04:03.799> like

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
stand is because some players don't like

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.530 
stand is because some players don't like
to<00:04:04.130> mount<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.400> rack<00:04:04.519> Tom<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:04.940> cymbal<00:04:05.299> stand

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
to mount the rack Tom to a cymbal stand

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.240 
to mount the rack Tom to a cymbal stand
they<00:04:05.810> feel<00:04:06.019> more<00:04:06.140> comfortable<00:04:06.380> when<00:04:07.130> it's

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
they feel more comfortable when it's

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.949 
they feel more comfortable when it's
actually<00:04:07.549> mounted<00:04:07.819> to<00:04:07.940> its<00:04:08.090> own<00:04:08.269> stand<00:04:08.690> and

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
actually mounted to its own stand and

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.500 
actually mounted to its own stand and
then<00:04:09.049> you<00:04:09.080> can<00:04:09.319> mount<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.590> cymbal<00:04:09.860> off<00:04:10.010> of<00:04:10.190> that

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
then you can mount a cymbal off of that

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.120 
then you can mount a cymbal off of that
now<00:04:11.510> what<00:04:11.720> we<00:04:11.840> did<00:04:12.049> was<00:04:12.350> we<00:04:12.500> kept<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.829> same

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
now what we did was we kept the same

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.310 
now what we did was we kept the same
symbol<00:04:13.880> configuration<00:04:14.600> but<00:04:14.780> we<00:04:14.870> just<00:04:15.049> changed

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
symbol configuration but we just changed

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.550 
symbol configuration but we just changed
a<00:04:15.410> couple<00:04:15.440> things<00:04:15.980> this<00:04:16.609> is<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.789> 67<00:04:17.570> 13<00:04:17.989> SP

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
a couple things this is the 67 13 SP

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.380

it's a single mount Tom stand that

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.480 
it's a single mount Tom stand that
allows<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.900> combine<00:04:21.109> a<00:04:21.470> rack<00:04:21.709> tom<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:22.190> a
