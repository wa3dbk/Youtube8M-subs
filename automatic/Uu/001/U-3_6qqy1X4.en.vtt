that far from a triple double although I

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.660 
that far from a triple double although I

don't really consider that a
triple-double<00:02:59.300> I<00:03:00.130> don't<00:03:01.130> know<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.250> just<00:03:01.280> it's

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
way I look at but I think there's a few

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.370 
way I look at but I think there's a few
things<00:03:10.670> going<00:03:11.060> on<00:03:11.239> with<00:03:11.390> LeBron<00:03:11.720> James<00:03:12.080> now

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
things going on with LeBron James now

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.420 
things going on with LeBron James now
and<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:14.380> lot<00:03:15.380> of<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.650> has<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.800> do<00:03:16.040> with<00:03:16.160> what<00:03:16.310> the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
and a lot of it has to do with what the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.610 
and a lot of it has to do with what the
media<00:03:16.640> stirred<00:03:17.180> up<00:03:17.390> i<00:03:17.570> think<00:03:17.600> that<00:03:18.019> LeBron<00:03:18.410> is

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
media stirred up i think that LeBron is

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.290 
media stirred up i think that LeBron is
getting<00:03:18.980> somewhat<00:03:19.370> worried<00:03:19.670> about<00:03:19.880> his<00:03:20.030> image

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
getting somewhat worried about his image

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.440 
getting somewhat worried about his image
LeBron<00:03:20.900> James<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.890> me<00:03:22.100> as<00:03:22.550> always<00:03:22.790> come<00:03:23.090> off<00:03:23.269> as

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.509 
LeBron James to me as always come off as
a<00:03:23.480> nice<00:03:23.690> guy<00:03:23.930> they<00:03:24.170> come<00:03:24.440> off<00:03:24.650> as<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:24.860> douche<00:03:25.160> bag

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
a nice guy they come off as a douche bag

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.050 
a nice guy they come off as a douche bag
in<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.060> decision<00:03:27.050> yeah<00:03:27.320> he<00:03:27.560> did<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:28.430> soul<00:03:28.670> out

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
in the decision yeah he did the soul out

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.759 
in the decision yeah he did the soul out
other<00:03:29.300> stars<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.050> no<00:03:30.170> one<00:03:30.320> holds<00:03:30.650> that

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
other stars and no one holds that

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.550 
other stars and no one holds that
against<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:34.250> think<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.700> he's<00:03:34.820> trying<00:03:35.180> to

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
against and I think that he's trying to

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.500 
against and I think that he's trying to
on<00:03:36.560> a<00:03:36.620> national<00:03:37.250> spot<00:03:37.400> like<00:03:37.790> not<00:03:38.030> look<00:03:38.269> like<00:03:38.480> a

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
on a national spot like not look like a

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.690 
on a national spot like not look like a
dick<00:03:38.840> because<00:03:39.380> I<00:03:39.560> don't<00:03:39.890> think<00:03:40.100> he<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.670> think

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
dick because I don't think he is I think

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.840 
dick because I don't think he is I think
he<00:03:40.940> thinks<00:03:41.870> i'm<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.290> nice<00:03:42.890> guy<00:03:43.220> I've<00:03:43.610> never

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
he thinks i'm a nice guy I've never

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.560 
he thinks i'm a nice guy I've never
really<00:03:44.300> gotten<00:03:44.540> in<00:03:45.170> trouble<00:03:45.380> in<00:03:45.799> this<00:03:45.950> league

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
really gotten in trouble in this league

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.500 
really gotten in trouble in this league
what<00:03:47.570> did<00:03:47.690> I<00:03:47.810> do<00:03:47.870> wrong<00:03:48.080> that<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:48.860> deserve<00:03:49.280> this

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
what did I do wrong that I deserve this

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.970 
what did I do wrong that I deserve this
and<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:50.690> think<00:03:50.750> on<00:03:51.049> it<00:03:51.080> if<00:03:51.260> he<00:03:51.410> looks<00:03:51.650> like<00:03:51.920> a

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
and I think on it if he looks like a

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
probably wrong but it was the best

don't<00:06:58.690> think<00:06:58.750> because<00:06:59.199> of<00:06:59.229> these<00:06:59.380> last<00:06:59.680> two

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
don't think because of these last two

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.100 
don't think because of these last two
games<00:07:00.100> I<00:07:00.340> don't<00:07:01.060> think<00:07:01.210> he<00:07:01.510> probably<00:07:01.720> is<00:07:01.960> going

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
games I don't think he probably is going

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.440 
games I don't think he probably is going
to<00:07:02.350> deserve<00:07:02.500> the<00:07:02.919> MVP<00:07:03.430> of<00:07:03.460> the<00:07:03.669> files<00:07:03.910> not<00:07:04.240> that

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
to deserve the MVP of the files not that

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.900 
to deserve the MVP of the files not that
he'll<00:07:04.600> win<00:07:04.750> it<00:07:04.870> anyway<00:07:05.250> but<00:07:06.250> he<00:07:06.340> can<00:07:06.520> get<00:07:06.610> a<00:07:06.669> lot

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:06.910 
he'll win it anyway but he can get a lot

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.450 
he'll win it anyway but he can get a lot
of<00:07:06.940> people<00:07:07.479> off<00:07:07.570> his<00:07:07.900> back<00:07:08.169> if<00:07:08.440> he<00:07:08.470> can<00:07:08.680> have<00:07:08.889> to

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
of people off his back if he can have to

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.820 
of people off his back if he can have to
like<00:07:09.820> really<00:07:10.450> really<00:07:10.780> good<00:07:11.050> games<00:07:11.290> like<00:07:11.500> 30

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:11.830 
like really really good games like 30

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.790 
like really really good games like 30
points<00:07:12.479> six<00:07:13.479> assists<00:07:14.050> and<00:07:14.290> eight<00:07:14.530> rebounds

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.490 
points six assists and eight rebounds
then<00:07:15.400> I<00:07:15.639> think<00:07:16.000> a<00:07:16.090> lot<00:07:16.360> of<00:07:16.389> people<00:07:16.540> will<00:07:17.320> just

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
then I think a lot of people will just

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.379 
then I think a lot of people will just
have<00:07:17.650> to<00:07:17.800> shut<00:07:18.040> up<00:07:18.190> because<00:07:18.310> you<00:07:18.550> can<00:07:18.700> say<00:07:18.880> war
