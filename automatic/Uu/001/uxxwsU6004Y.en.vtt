that<00:01:59.720> we<00:01:59.900> are<00:02:00.050> that<00:02:00.740> we<00:02:00.770> false<00:02:01.250> teachers<00:02:01.990> the

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
that we are that we false teachers the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.640 
that we are that we false teachers the
same<00:02:03.320> spirit<00:02:03.800> of<00:02:03.950> force<00:02:04.280> mayor<00:02:04.880> prophets<00:02:05.650> in

same spirit of force mayor prophets in
the<00:02:06.680> Old<00:02:06.910> will<00:02:07.910> be<00:02:08.030> mingled<00:02:08.539> with<00:02:08.869> false

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
the Old will be mingled with false

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.709 
the Old will be mingled with false
teacher<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.099> our<00:02:10.250> time<00:02:10.519> is<00:02:11.060> not<00:02:11.269> only<00:02:11.450> false

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:11.719

teachers

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.830 
teachers
and<00:02:15.319> I<00:02:15.470> believe<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:16.069> if<00:02:17.030> we<00:02:17.090> look<00:02:17.540> at<00:02:17.689> it

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
and I believe that if we look at it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.929 
and I believe that if we look at it
therefore<00:02:18.049> the<00:02:18.799> Common<00:02:19.189> Era<00:02:19.340> section<00:02:19.819> of
