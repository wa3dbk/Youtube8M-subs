working perfectly now there is some bugs
in<00:02:12.670> this<00:02:12.820> tool<00:02:13.000> like<00:02:13.830> when<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:14.920> dashboard<00:02:15.430> or

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
in this tool like when you dashboard or

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.580 
in this tool like when you dashboard or
sent<00:02:15.790> out<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:16.090> like<00:02:16.630> from<00:02:16.900> some<00:02:17.140> games<00:02:17.380> it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
sent out that like from some games it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.450 
sent out that like from some games it
might<00:02:17.800> crash<00:02:18.430> your<00:02:18.640> console

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
might crash your console

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.700

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
but then it happen now so that's good I

00:02:23.710 --> 00:03:02.680 
but then it happen now so that's good I
guess<00:02:23.800> let's<00:02:24.790> go<00:02:24.940> do<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.270> more4<00:02:25.480> -<00:02:25.780> now

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.480 

now<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.650> redesigned<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.370> tool<00:03:04.610> these<00:03:05.060> look<00:03:05.510> how

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
now I redesigned the tool these look how

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.490 
now I redesigned the tool these look how
ugly<00:03:07.490> and<00:03:07.820> stuff<00:03:08.150> had<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.630> lot<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.960> buttons<00:03:09.260> and

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
ugly and stuff had a lot of buttons and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.170 
ugly and stuff had a lot of buttons and
everything<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.100> just<00:03:10.280> put<00:03:10.460> everything<00:03:10.550> and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
everything so I just put everything and

a<00:03:11.300> couple<00:03:11.540> blocks<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:11.990> one<00:03:12.140> single<00:03:12.470> button<00:03:12.560> so

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
a couple blocks in one single button so

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.580 
a couple blocks in one single button so
you<00:03:14.360> know<00:03:14.480> how<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:15.430> struggle<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.730> guess<00:03:17.590> there
