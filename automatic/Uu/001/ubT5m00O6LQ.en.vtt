00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
have been some of my friends that have

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.900 
have been some of my friends that have
mentioned<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.230> this<00:04:39.860> dumps<00:04:40.340> down<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.700> game

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
mentioned that this dumps down the game

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.960 
mentioned that this dumps down the game
quite<00:04:41.210> a<00:04:41.270> bit<00:04:41.510> no<00:04:41.840> not<00:04:42.260> really<00:04:42.640> what<00:04:43.640> it<00:04:43.760> does

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
quite a bit no not really what it does

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.110 
quite a bit no not really what it does
is<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.210> makes<00:04:44.420> it<00:04:44.810> easy<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.350> balance<00:04:45.920> easier<00:04:46.910> to

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
is it makes it easy to balance easier to

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.910 
is it makes it easy to balance easier to
balance<00:04:47.240> which<00:04:47.750> actually<00:04:48.020> makes<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.620> game

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
balance which actually makes the game

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.870 
balance which actually makes the game
you<00:04:49.700> know<00:04:49.880> competitive<00:04:50.810> yes<00:04:51.290> in<00:04:51.880> challenging

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
you know competitive yes in challenging

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.380 
you know competitive yes in challenging
because<00:04:53.270> you<00:04:54.020> will<00:04:54.290> want<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.740> actually<00:04:55.390> stack

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
because you will want to actually stack

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.960 
because you will want to actually stack
up<00:04:56.600> on<00:04:56.810> stats<00:04:57.110> that<00:04:57.380> you<00:04:57.590> can<00:04:57.980> and<00:04:58.280> you<00:04:58.370> will

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
up on stats that you can and you will

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.230 
up on stats that you can and you will
use<00:04:59.660> to<00:05:00.500> make<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:01.460> give<00:05:01.700> yourself<00:05:02.090> an

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
use to make to give yourself an

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.750 
use to make to give yourself an
advantage<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:03.200> are<00:05:03.440> given<00:05:03.950> the<00:05:04.040> choice<00:05:04.280> for

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
advantage you are given the choice for

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.640 
advantage you are given the choice for
example<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.480> Barbarian<00:05:06.020> has<00:05:06.140> a<00:05:06.200> passive

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
example the Barbarian has a passive

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.490 
example the Barbarian has a passive
ability<00:05:07.130> called<00:05:07.310> nerves<00:05:07.640> of<00:05:07.940> steel<00:05:08.240> okay<00:05:08.660> what

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
ability called nerves of steel okay what

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.530 
ability called nerves of steel okay what
this<00:05:09.620> does<00:05:09.830> is<00:05:10.010> it<00:05:10.040> increases<00:05:10.880> your<00:05:10.910> defense

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
this does is it increases your defense

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.070 
this does is it increases your defense
by<00:05:11.750> twenty-five<00:05:12.410> percent<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.980> your<00:05:13.130> vitality

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
by twenty-five percent of your vitality

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.250 
by twenty-five percent of your vitality
so<00:05:15.080> if<00:05:15.320> you<00:05:15.500> stack<00:05:15.740> vitality<00:05:16.220> as<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.430> barbarian

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
so if you stack vitality as a barbarian

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.540 
so if you stack vitality as a barbarian
25%<00:05:18.260> of<00:05:18.320> it<00:05:18.440> is<00:05:18.590> going<00:05:18.830> into<00:05:19.070> your<00:05:19.190> defense

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
25% of it is going into your defense

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.520 
25% of it is going into your defense
which<00:05:20.060> reduces<00:05:20.419> the<00:05:20.690> damage<00:05:20.810> you<00:05:21.080> take<00:05:21.110> from

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
which reduces the damage you take from

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.950 
which reduces the damage you take from
both<00:05:21.800> magical<00:05:22.040> and<00:05:22.370> physical<00:05:23.120> damage

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
both magical and physical damage

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.600 
both magical and physical damage
incoming<00:05:24.650> alright<00:05:25.550> this<00:05:26.480> alone<00:05:27.440> makes<00:05:27.830> the

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
incoming alright this alone makes the

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.520 
incoming alright this alone makes the
Barbarian<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.270> hell<00:05:29.720> of<00:05:29.750> a<00:05:29.990> difficult

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
Barbarian a hell of a difficult

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.100 
Barbarian a hell of a difficult
character<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:31.070> kill<00:05:31.330> which<00:05:32.330> is<00:05:32.479> fine<00:05:32.720> because

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
character to kill which is fine because

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.650 
character to kill which is fine because
they<00:05:33.560> are<00:05:33.620> a<00:05:33.710> melee<00:05:33.919> character

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
they are a melee character

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.740 
they are a melee character
not<00:05:35.020> only<00:05:35.230> that<00:05:35.350> they<00:05:36.130> are<00:05:36.250> required<00:05:36.850> in<00:05:37.210> a<00:05:37.450> lot

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
not only that they are required in a lot

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.540 
not only that they are required in a lot
of<00:05:37.900> situations<00:05:38.110> to<00:05:38.740> be<00:05:38.860> surrounded<00:05:39.520> by

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
of situations to be surrounded by

can be affected by runes that's one

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.230 
can be affected by runes that's one
example<00:06:02.220> another<00:06:03.220> example<00:06:03.400> is<00:06:03.790> the<00:06:03.850> monk

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
example another example is the monk

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.060 
example another example is the monk
which<00:06:04.600> has<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:04.990> seized<00:06:05.350> the<00:06:05.740> initiative

which has the seized the initiative

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.700 
which has the seized the initiative
skill<00:06:06.910> which<00:06:07.510> is<00:06:07.660> also<00:06:07.900> a<00:06:07.930> passive<00:06:08.320> skill<00:06:08.560> is

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
skill which is also a passive skill is

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.500 
skill which is also a passive skill is
quite<00:06:08.980> high<00:06:09.160> level<00:06:09.520> so<00:06:09.760> I<00:06:09.790> don't<00:06:10.180> really<00:06:10.240> have

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
quite high level so I don't really have
