00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 When I talk because I think war games designed to discuss What do you think 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.150
 I thought I'd say that. 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.330
 I have to play games . 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.719
 How do you tell your son how to meet a son 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.910
 It's still in your life . But that's me . 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:24.270
 How easy it is to be in such a situation that you are not looking around 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.119
 I just want to see how much time I've had. 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:33.239
 Oh yeah Roberts nora da game or why is this why the child has it all the time 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:39.089
 Without enough money 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:43.440
 It is no good neither bad game. What's the essence of good 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.280
 I do not think it's a tool, but my concern is that parents and children 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.290
 People 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.570
 You're making a decision . 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:57.080
 Baby, this is bad. 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:01.310
 When you do that the children should have more right Halla other party 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:06.920
 Inde challenge challenging issues Looked not of the issue floor game or poison 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:11.600
 Smart platoon charm rather than thinking of them, 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.220
 When children are poisoned when controlling children with thoughtful thoughts, 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.880
 I'm floating more . 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.780
 Do I just have to believe in a child? How do I treat a child through it? 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.650
 The most important thing to solve the problem 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.220
 Not. 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.360
 I will brighten How neatly solve the problem, I tell their parents beating 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.570
 I want to ask 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:37.810
 How do you tell your parents that you are writing your smartphone in front of your kids? 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:43.670
 I do not know if I will tell you so completely, but once the children are 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.960
 It's been a long time to follow people and children to use such media and devices 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.190
 Being that they are 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.240
 If the play clock is also unaware call yourself ahead of its time that Bob 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.610
 I would not have. 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.350
 At that time, playing outside like this is enough to play and eat rice 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.700
 One of the children 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:07.490
 I bet you sit on the computer 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.050
 Thank you once again. I do not have a taxi . 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.519
 Hold on. 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.300
 I have used this body because of this experience. 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.110
 Dont you into the house, and it did not sit the way things sprouting more awesome 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.750
 It's funny. 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.160
 It's a lot like that. 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.560
 Come in 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:35.040
 This is not what the Andes is doing. 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:39.569
 Even with the skunk , we repeat the song again. 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.469
 Oh that's the only goto that can immunize now that song 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.530
