00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
as strong as I thought before hundred I

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.280 
as strong as I thought before hundred I
tried<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.549> was<00:01:27.360> barely<00:01:27.630> taking<00:01:28.049> any<00:01:28.140> damage

from<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.650> thing<00:01:28.829> but<00:01:29.159> well<00:01:29.340> um<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
from the thing but well um that I was a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.020 
from the thing but well um that I was a
bit<00:01:32.100> later<00:01:32.250> anyway<00:01:33.000> uh<00:01:33.290> yeah<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.850> armor<00:01:35.850> at

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
bit later anyway uh yeah the armor at

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.370 
bit later anyway uh yeah the armor at
least<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.329> gives<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.540> diamond<00:01:36.869> rated<00:01:37.110> armor

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
