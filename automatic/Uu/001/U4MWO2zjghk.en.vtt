00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
introduced to interfere six things so I

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.770 
introduced to interfere six things so I
just<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.370> looks<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:17.880> good<00:02:17.910> like<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.360> can't<00:02:18.660> wait

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
just it looks so good like I can't wait

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.230 
just it looks so good like I can't wait
to<00:02:18.810> play<00:02:19.080> through<00:02:19.230> 16<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.100> also<00:02:20.819> thinking

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
to play through 16 and also thinking

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.970 
to play through 16 and also thinking
about<00:02:21.510> my<00:02:21.780> team's<00:02:22.110> I'm<00:02:22.290> going<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.470> do<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.860> few

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
about my team's I'm going to do for few

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.400 
about my team's I'm going to do for few
16<00:02:23.490> because<00:02:24.480> last<00:02:24.750> year<00:02:24.930> start<00:02:25.170> off<00:02:25.260> with

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
16 because last year start off with

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.800 
16 because last year start off with
Arsenal<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.100> think<00:02:27.030> about<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.450> five

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
Arsenal and I think about a five

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.420 
Arsenal and I think about a five
eighteen<00:02:28.170> ninety-five<00:02:28.470> percent<00:02:28.680> certain

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
eighteen ninety-five percent certain

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.280 
eighteen ninety-five percent certain
i'll<00:02:29.760> start<00:02:30.270> with<00:02:30.390> Arsenal<00:02:30.780> yet<00:02:30.959> again

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
i'll start with Arsenal yet again

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.590 
i'll start with Arsenal yet again
because<00:02:31.650> it's<00:02:31.980> like<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> good<00:02:32.490> team<00:02:33.090> start<00:02:33.390> off

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
because it's like a good team start off

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.840 
because it's like a good team start off
with<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.050> trend<00:02:34.530> get<00:02:34.680> used<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.070> game<00:02:35.310> then

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
with the trend get used to the game then

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.430 
with the trend get used to the game then
it's<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> game<00:02:36.209> goes<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.750> move<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.260> lower

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
it's a game goes on you move on to lower

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.690 
it's a game goes on you move on to lower
teams<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.950> even<00:02:38.190> try<00:02:38.430> some<00:02:38.610> different

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
teams and even try some different

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.120 
teams and even try some different
players<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.200> I'm<00:02:40.290> going<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.500> start<00:02:40.590> operating

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.810 
pretty certain i'll start off with
Southampton<00:02:58.230> all<00:02:58.650> south<00:02:58.980> onto<00:02:59.190> with<00:02:59.400> Arsenal

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
Southampton all south onto with Arsenal

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.060 
Southampton all south onto with Arsenal
so<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.660> looks<00:03:00.900> like<00:03:00.959> way<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.230> start<00:03:01.560> off<00:03:01.739> and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
so it looks like way to start off and

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.009 
so it looks like way to start off and
the<00:03:02.340> cost<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.700> your<00:03:02.790> 15<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.360> coming<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.780> an<00:03:03.870> end

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
the cost of your 15 is coming to an end

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.050 
the cost of your 15 is coming to an end
