can pick them any major organ system and

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.869 
can pick them any major organ system and
no<00:01:55.079> amount<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.379> fewer<00:01:55.619> does<00:01:55.950> transplants<00:01:56.759> in

no amount of fewer does transplants in

no amount of fewer does transplants in

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
those areas we have a really well

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.790 

there's<00:02:07.909> lots<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.270> ample<00:02:08.600> opportunities<00:02:09.590> for

there's lots of ample opportunities for

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
between the basic science and clinical

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.180 
between the basic science and clinical
medicine<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.730> think<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:18.380> foundation

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
medicine so I think that the foundation

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.920 
medicine so I think that the foundation
is<00:02:19.250> very<00:02:19.490> strong<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.660> know<00:02:20.750> and

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
is very strong that you know and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.370 
is very strong that you know and
probably<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.380> find<00:02:22.690> some<00:02:23.690> similar<00:02:23.989> setups<00:02:24.260> at

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
probably you find some similar setups at

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.320 
probably you find some similar setups at
all<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.650> top-tier<00:02:25.310> programs<00:02:25.819> around<00:02:26.120> the

all the top-tier programs around the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.960 
all the top-tier programs around the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
us apart from those places though as I

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.860 
us apart from those places though as I
think<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.430> our<00:02:32.000> collaborative<00:02:32.450> efforts

that's sort of you know I guess I'm out
of<00:03:32.900> here<00:03:32.989> cardiology<00:03:33.680> is<00:03:33.709> most<00:03:33.950> famous<00:03:34.310> for

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
of here cardiology is most famous for

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.729 
of here cardiology is most famous for
but<00:03:34.790> i<00:03:34.970> think<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.660> cath<00:03:35.870> lab<00:03:35.900> is<00:03:36.230> very<00:03:36.440> strong

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
but i think the cath lab is very strong

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.250 
but i think the cath lab is very strong
and<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:37.099> non-invasive<00:03:37.430> imaging<00:03:38.019> has<00:03:39.019> always

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
and the non-invasive imaging has always

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.080 
and the non-invasive imaging has always
been<00:03:39.410> very<00:03:39.590> strong<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.220> now<00:03:40.700> with<00:03:40.850> our<00:03:41.000> new

and<00:04:25.790> I<00:04:25.850> think<00:04:26.090> that<00:04:26.210> we<00:04:26.330> also<00:04:26.510> provide<00:04:26.990> a<00:04:27.020> lot

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
and I think that we also provide a lot

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.410 
and I think that we also provide a lot
of<00:04:27.290> that<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:28.730> our<00:04:28.850> fellows<00:04:29.180> are

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
of that that that our fellows are

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.780 
of that that that our fellows are
fellows<00:04:29.950> you<00:04:30.950> know<00:04:31.070> when<00:04:31.850> they<00:04:31.970> graduate<00:04:32.450> all

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
fellows you know when they graduate all

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.220 
fellows you know when they graduate all
actually<00:04:34.790> can't<00:04:35.060> say<00:04:35.150> all<00:04:35.360> but<00:04:35.600> i<00:04:35.630> would<00:04:36.110> say

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
actually can't say all but i would say

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.620 
actually can't say all but i would say
the<00:04:36.410> vast<00:04:36.590> majority<00:04:36.710> are<00:04:37.360> extremely<00:04:38.360> pleased

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
the vast majority are extremely pleased

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.480 
the vast majority are extremely pleased
with<00:04:38.660> where<00:04:39.020> they<00:04:39.110> ended<00:04:39.380> up<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:39.740> then<00:04:40.370> we're

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
with where they ended up and then we're

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.890 
with where they ended up and then we're
able<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.820> provide<00:04:40.850> our<00:04:41.330> fellows<00:04:41.600> with<00:04:41.780> the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
able to provide our fellows with the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.210 
able to provide our fellows with the
experience<00:04:42.169> to<00:04:42.320> do<00:04:42.530> what<00:04:42.680> they<00:04:42.800> want<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.070> do

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
experience to do what they want to do

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.050 
experience to do what they want to do
when<00:04:43.490> they<00:04:43.940> graduate<00:04:44.450> is<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:45.650> I<00:04:45.890> think

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
when they graduate is this I think

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.640 
when they graduate is this I think
fantastic<00:04:48.070> you<00:04:49.070> know<00:04:49.190> when<00:04:50.150> NY<00:04:50.840> you<00:04:50.900> for<00:04:51.500> being

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
fantastic you know when NY you for being

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.680 
fantastic you know when NY you for being
a<00:04:51.710> great<00:04:51.830> program<00:04:52.100> did<00:04:52.580> miss<00:04:52.790> some<00:04:53.030> certain

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
a great program did miss some certain

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.140 
a great program did miss some certain
things<00:04:53.930> when<00:04:54.530> I<00:04:54.560> came<00:04:54.680> here<00:04:55.250> I<00:04:55.430> had<00:04:55.760> to

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
things when I came here I had to

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.600 
things when I came here I had to
virtually<00:04:56.840> train<00:04:57.080> myself<00:04:57.230> and

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
virtually train myself and

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.209 
virtually train myself and
and<00:05:00.330> heartfelt<00:05:00.750> heart<00:05:01.650> failure<00:05:02.039> and

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:02.219 
and heartfelt heart failure and

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.640 
and heartfelt heart failure and
transplant<00:05:02.909> and<00:05:03.330> left<00:05:04.169> ventricular<00:05:04.229> assist

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
transplant and left ventricular assist

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.379 
transplant and left ventricular assist
devices<00:05:05.129> because<00:05:05.729> that<00:05:05.969> was<00:05:06.120> something<00:05:06.150> that

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
devices because that was something that

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.929 
devices because that was something that
was<00:05:06.750> simply<00:05:07.080> not<00:05:07.199> done<00:05:07.439> at<00:05:07.620> NYU<00:05:07.949> at<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.789> time

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:08.939 
was simply not done at NYU at the time

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.809 
was simply not done at NYU at the time
when<00:05:09.120> I<00:05:09.150> was<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.360> fellow<00:05:09.629> there<00:05:10.129> so<00:05:11.129> i<00:05:11.460> think<00:05:11.639> the

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 
when I was a fellow there so i think the

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:13.399 
when I was a fellow there so i think the
diversity<00:05:12.419> of<00:05:12.449> experience<00:05:13.020> that<00:05:13.169> we<00:05:13.229> have

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
diversity of experience that we have

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.379 
diversity of experience that we have
here<00:05:13.590> maybe<00:05:13.949> a<00:05:14.039> little<00:05:14.250> bit<00:05:14.460> greater<00:05:14.699> because

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
here maybe a little bit greater because

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.670 
here maybe a little bit greater because
of<00:05:15.689> programs<00:05:16.409> like<00:05:16.650> that<00:05:17.360> so<00:05:18.469> that's<00:05:19.469> i<00:05:19.650> think

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
of programs like that so that's i think

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.499 
of programs like that so that's i think
it's<00:05:19.919> also<00:05:20.009> one<00:05:20.310> of<00:05:20.340> our<00:05:20.490> strengths<00:05:20.849> we<00:05:21.240> try<00:05:21.449> to

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
it's also one of our strengths we try to

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.189 
it's also one of our strengths we try to
keep<00:05:21.659> a<00:05:21.780> very<00:05:21.930> warm<00:05:23.659> like<00:05:24.659> sort<00:05:24.870> of<00:05:24.930> safe

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
keep a very warm like sort of safe

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.709 
keep a very warm like sort of safe
environment<00:05:26.099> for<00:05:26.129> our<00:05:26.310> fellows<00:05:26.610> we<00:05:27.479> try<00:05:27.659> to

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
environment for our fellows we try to

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.689 
environment for our fellows we try to
make<00:05:27.930> it<00:05:27.960> so<00:05:28.229> that<00:05:28.349> you<00:05:28.650> know<00:05:28.770> that<00:05:28.800> this<00:05:29.520> is

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
make it so that you know that this is

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.429 
make it so that you know that this is
