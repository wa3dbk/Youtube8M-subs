they really make it a lot easier then I
going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.220> scrape<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.640> all<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.849> stuff<00:00:27.060> out

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
going to scrape and all that stuff out

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.240 
going to scrape and all that stuff out
but<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:28.349> want<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.590> need<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> different<00:00:28.949> blade

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
but you want to need a different blade

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.710 
but you want to need a different blade
for<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.640> one<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.000> went<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.300> bought<00:00:30.359> this

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
for this one so I went and bought this

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.000 
for this one so I went and bought this
um<00:00:31.189> this<00:00:32.189> diamond<00:00:32.460> tip<00:00:32.730> blade<00:00:33.000> right<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:34.010> you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
um this diamond tip blade right here you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.639 
um this diamond tip blade right here you
want<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.219> get<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.960> diamond<00:00:36.960> tip<00:00:37.110> multi-tool

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
want to get the diamond tip multi-tool

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.459 
want to get the diamond tip multi-tool
blade<00:00:38.239> they<00:00:39.239> make<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> Halfmoon<00:00:39.690> ones<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.320> got

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
blade they make the Halfmoon ones I got

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.750 
blade they make the Halfmoon ones I got
the<00:00:40.590> round<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:40.950> because<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.309> cheaper<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the round one because it was cheaper and

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.160 
the round one because it was cheaper and
I<00:00:41.850> figured<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:43.020> got

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
I figured that like you know it's got

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.200 
I figured that like you know it's got
more<00:00:43.350> agents<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.879> rotate<00:00:45.030> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
more agents to it so I can rotate it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.700 
more agents to it so I can rotate it
around<00:00:45.420> whenever<00:00:45.840> one<00:00:46.050> inch<00:00:46.230> starts<00:00:46.500> getting

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
around whenever one inch starts getting

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.040 
around whenever one inch starts getting
worn<00:00:46.890> out<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:48.120> make<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> carp<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
worn out and they make the carp the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.660 
worn out and they make the carp the
carbon<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:51.120> carbon<00:00:51.230> itched<00:00:52.230> ones<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.460> those

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
carbon the carbon itched ones and those

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.770 
carbon the carbon itched ones and those
are<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:53.879> right<00:00:54.030> -<00:00:54.180> they're<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> lot<00:00:54.570> cheaper

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
are all right - they're a lot cheaper

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.270 
are all right - they're a lot cheaper
but<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> diamond<00:00:55.710> tipped<00:00:56.070> one

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
but if you get the diamond tipped one

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.830 
but if you get the diamond tipped one
it's<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> last<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.090> lot<00:00:57.180> longer<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it's going to last a lot longer and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.619 
it's going to last a lot longer and
hopefully<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.890> through<00:00:59.070> your<00:00:59.129> job

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
hopefully get you through your job

the<00:01:36.570> sink<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.110> almost<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.710> dude

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
the sink like I almost just dude

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.050 
the sink like I almost just dude
you<00:01:39.299> really<00:01:39.479> want<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> block<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.909> make<00:01:41.909> sure

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
you really want to block that make sure

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.289 
you really want to block that make sure
that<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.360> not<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.720> anywhere<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:45.149> you're

so<00:03:03.390> much<00:03:03.420> easier<00:03:03.629> I<00:03:04.280> mean<00:03:05.280> just<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.670> little

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
so much easier I mean just in a little

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.460 
so much easier I mean just in a little
short<00:03:06.180> bit<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.360> did<00:03:06.599> right<00:03:06.750> there<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.140> can<00:03:07.290> see

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
short bit I did right there you can see

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.100 
short bit I did right there you can see
how<00:03:07.769> much<00:03:07.890> grout<00:03:08.190> came<00:03:08.400> out<00:03:08.750> it's<00:03:09.750> going<00:03:09.930> down

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
how much grout came out it's going down

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.750 
how much grout came out it's going down
that<00:03:10.290> line<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:11.129> got<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.430> go<00:03:11.550> back<00:03:11.730> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
that line you got to go back and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.280 
that line you got to go back and
eventually<00:03:12.420> scraped<00:03:12.720> out<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> little<00:03:13.050> bit

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
extra spots here and there and go back

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.050 
extra spots here and there and go back
over<00:03:15.629> once<00:03:15.959> or<00:03:16.110> twice<00:03:16.290> but<00:03:16.610> without<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:17.819> tool
