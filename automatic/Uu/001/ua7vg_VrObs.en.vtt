00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
now we're gonna make this not like a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.090 
now we're gonna make this not like a
dough<00:02:15.820> but<00:02:16.060> like<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.270> batter<00:02:16.540> okay<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:20.530> you're

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
dough but like a batter okay and you're

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.800 
dough but like a batter okay and you're
going<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.340> beat<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.060> same<00:02:22.270> way<00:02:22.450> we<00:02:22.600> do

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
going to beat this the same way we do

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.100 
going to beat this the same way we do
with<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.440> gee<00:02:23.710> maybe<00:02:23.830> batter<00:02:24.870> okay

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
with the gee maybe batter okay

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.420 
with the gee maybe batter okay
whisk<00:02:27.070> helps<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:29.170> not<00:02:29.620> letting<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:30.130> form

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
whisk helps in not letting this form

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.240 
whisk helps in not letting this form
into<00:02:30.640> lumps<00:02:30.850> but<00:02:31.570> that's<00:02:31.810> okay<00:02:34.350> now<00:02:35.350> after

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
into lumps but that's okay now after

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.290 
into lumps but that's okay now after
adding<00:02:36.400> this<00:02:36.640> flour<00:02:36.910> look<00:02:37.090> at<00:02:37.210> the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
adding this flour look at the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.240 
adding this flour look at the
consistency<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:38.410> know<00:02:38.470> now<00:02:38.680> we're<00:02:38.890> going<00:02:39.160> to

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
consistency you know now we're going to

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.340 
consistency you know now we're going to
let<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.610> gluten<00:02:39.970> form<00:02:40.210> by<00:02:40.660> continuously

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
let the gluten form by continuously

you dropped it this will somehow turn
into<00:03:21.700> roundels<00:03:22.690> just<00:03:23.080> like<00:03:23.230> marbles<00:03:23.590> I'm

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
into roundels just like marbles I'm

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.290 
into roundels just like marbles I'm
going<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.220> add<00:03:24.370> some<00:03:24.670> more<00:03:24.989> okay<00:03:25.989> like<00:03:26.470> that
