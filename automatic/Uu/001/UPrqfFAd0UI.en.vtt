because<00:02:05.579> once<00:02:06.030> they<00:02:06.210> start<00:02:06.479> firing<00:02:07.700> more<00:02:08.700> even

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
because once they start firing more even

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.750 
because once they start firing more even
though<00:02:08.970> hehe<00:02:09.569> skills<00:02:10.020> with<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> chain<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.920> he

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
though hehe skills with the chain and he

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.110 
though hehe skills with the chain and he
blocks<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> bullets

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
blocks the bullets

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.559 
blocks the bullets
he<00:02:13.180> swings<00:02:13.540> them<00:02:13.900> back<00:02:14.670> jumps<00:02:15.670> jumps<00:02:16.239> up<00:02:16.540> to

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
he swings them back jumps jumps up to

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.119 
he swings them back jumps jumps up to
the<00:02:16.840> highest<00:02:17.049> vantage<00:02:17.409> point<00:02:17.950> which<00:02:18.099> is

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
the highest vantage point which is

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.699 
the highest vantage point which is
always<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:18.819> think<00:02:18.940> I'm<00:02:19.209> firing<00:02:19.530> because<00:02:20.530> if

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
always so I think I'm firing because if

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:21.930 
always so I think I'm firing because if
you<00:02:20.769> have<00:02:20.920> one<00:02:21.069> person<00:02:21.340> at<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.730> highest

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
you have one person at the highest

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.420 
you have one person at the highest
vantage<00:02:22.180> point<00:02:22.629> you<00:02:22.690> can<00:02:22.870> get<00:02:23.500> overall<00:02:24.069> view

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
vantage point you can get overall view

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.430 
vantage point you can get overall view
of<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.700> battle<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.209> see<00:02:25.840> what<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.409> happening

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
of the battle and see what is happening

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.619 
of the battle and see what is happening
and<00:02:27.099> then<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.580> can<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:27.970> know<00:02:28.090> go<00:02:28.299> ahead<00:02:28.420> of

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
and then you can you know go ahead of

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.009 
and then you can you know go ahead of
your<00:02:28.780> strategy<00:02:28.959> from<00:02:29.290> there<00:02:29.530> he<00:02:30.129> sees<00:02:30.459> that

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
your strategy from there he sees that

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.869 
your strategy from there he sees that
basically<00:02:32.019> an<00:02:32.530> end<00:02:32.829> user<00:02:33.069> must<00:02:33.640> be

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
basically an end user must be

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.199 
basically an end user must be
controlling<00:02:34.360> these<00:02:35.349> are<00:02:35.829> these<00:02:36.670> guys<00:02:36.909> are<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
controlling these are these guys are the

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.600 
controlling these are these guys are the
swords<00:02:37.599> and<00:02:37.720> guns<00:02:37.750> because<00:02:38.260> they're<00:02:38.769> not<00:02:39.340> only

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
swords and guns because they're not only

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.789 
swords and guns because they're not only
other<00:02:39.790> attack<00:02:40.120> patterns<00:02:40.690> really<00:02:40.989> basic<00:02:41.590> is

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
other attack patterns really basic is

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.059 
other attack patterns really basic is
like<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:43.150> know<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:44.079> like<00:02:44.140> they<00:02:44.650> felt<00:02:44.890> like

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
like you know it's like they felt like

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.160 
like you know it's like they felt like
AI<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.790> game<00:02:46.060> because<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.750> know<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.900> game

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
AI in the game because you know a game

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.020 
AI in the game because you know a game
sometimes<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:47.980> tend<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.549> get<00:02:48.700> stuck<00:02:48.760> on

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
sometimes a I tend to get stuck on

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.759 
sometimes a I tend to get stuck on
things<00:02:49.450> because<00:02:49.810> they're<00:02:50.170> just<00:02:50.410> trying<00:02:50.650> to

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
things because they're just trying to

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.140 
things because they're just trying to
hit<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.010> nearest<00:02:51.340> target<00:02:51.519> that's<00:02:51.849> what<00:02:52.030> was

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
hit the nearest target that's what was

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.270 
hit the nearest target that's what was
happening<00:02:52.180> they'll<00:02:53.109> try<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.470> hit<00:02:53.620> krupka<00:02:54.099> but

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
happening they'll try and hit krupka but

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.430 
happening they'll try and hit krupka but
they<00:02:54.370> won't<00:02:54.549> jump<00:02:54.819> over<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.209> him<00:02:55.540> like<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.109> human

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
they won't jump over to him like a human

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.289 
they won't jump over to him like a human
would<00:02:56.829> do<00:02:57.010> they<00:02:57.519> were<00:02:57.579> just<00:02:57.849> doing<00:02:58.180> like

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
would do they were just doing like

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.530 
would do they were just doing like
really<00:02:59.159> simple<00:03:00.159> movements<00:03:00.790> trying<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.269> attack

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
really simple movements trying to attack

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.979 
really simple movements trying to attack
him<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:02.230> wouldn't<00:03:02.560> work<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:03.720> then<00:03:04.720> wheels

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
him and it wouldn't work so then wheels

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.410 
him and it wouldn't work so then wheels
and<00:03:05.140> then<00:03:05.290> user<00:03:05.609> and<00:03:06.609> it<00:03:06.730> turned<00:03:06.970> out<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.239> lead

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
and then user and it turned out to lead

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.059 
and then user and it turned out to lead
the<00:03:07.540> guy<00:03:07.690> with<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.049> ginger<00:03:08.470> hair<00:03:08.650> with<00:03:08.980> the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
controlling them and we got to see all

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.050 
controlling them and we got to see all
of<00:03:14.709> them<00:03:14.829> fight<00:03:15.099> for<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> little<00:03:15.579> bit<00:03:15.730> which<00:03:15.909> was

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
of them fight for a little bit which was

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.680 
of them fight for a little bit which was
cool<00:03:16.380> but<00:03:17.380> what<00:03:17.650> happened<00:03:18.040> was<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.690> they

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
cool but what happened was is that they

cool but what happened was is that they
needed<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.079> decipher<00:03:20.769> who<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.069> second<00:03:22.349> plant

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
needed to decipher who the second plant

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.110 
needed to decipher who the second plant
was<00:03:23.650> because<00:03:23.980> he<00:03:24.160> was<00:03:24.340> he<00:03:24.639> was<00:03:24.760> obviously
