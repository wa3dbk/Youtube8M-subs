00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.210
 ah 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.560
 very good people what if you gamer 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.390
 Welcome to a new game of 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.820
 gifted I will teach you today the same 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.430
 that the other day a game a replay of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.439
 the highlight of my colleague sergio already 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.270
 you know that we play as a team always 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.250
 chose the blog even now it's going to 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.020
 comment him a little bit and the truth that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.230
 he did super super well 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.610
 sergio hello that such hello good if I took 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.380
 blogger because he is the hero that most 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.320
 like the game is a hero that is carry 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.290
 like those who already pay a little NATO 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.940
 carry is a character that is improving 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.770
 As the game progresses, you need 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.250
 money to put objects and be better 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.570
 later he is also a hero who 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.700
 specializes in surviving within the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.930
 jungle killing the neutral clips for 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.400
 get also that money that 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.680
 you need then it's a combination 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.720
 pretty good because you need 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.340
 money but you do not have to worry 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.750
 so much for killing the opponent's clips 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.210
 but you can get into the jungle 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.820
 when I'm sure pure it's also a 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.000
 hero that is based on whitening you have 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.350
 that kill the opposite and if you're not not 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.020
 doing your job well because they are your 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.869
 functions you're not even support in something else 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.159
 I avoid people who use blogs and who 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.509
 from the sides I like 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.340
 personally use the oxygen in the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.140
 center 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.600
 I do not get hurt though sometimes when 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.359
 I find a 9 with rank what happened 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.280
 rather hurried on the other hand the 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.009
 game is a game in which there was 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.549
 people who wanted to try heroes and I said 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.200
 that he would continue as usual to 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.770
 try to compensate a bit in case 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.819
 something failed the test of the new 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.549
 aspects of the rigidity item of 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.049
 fernando and says good I'm going to apply a 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.490
 little with racing I'm going to apply a little 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.470
 with fernando and I will try to do 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.630
 better numbers than him at the end of the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.030
 game will see the result and I do not know the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.310
 people who want to comment something if ricky 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.940
 or blogs iker that I mentioned in the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.950
 comments and vote 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.870
 Well, well, you know, this is a 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.340
 starting also in sergio team 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.710
 erected blogs iker as well has said has 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.020
 said quite remarkable information of 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.570
 his character and how he manages blogs 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.000
 iker and nothing we let you see the game and 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.660
 see you now now in a minute 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.660
 now 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.950
 good people want to see how it has been 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.530
 at the end then here you have the good the 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.900
 classification and let's say that the victims 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.790
 deaths assists a damn 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.220
 barbarity 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.770
 sergio sincerely you parted in this 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.480
 west the game better than mine with 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.860
 the phantom assassin and better that was from 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.530
 fernando with the rikimaru s 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.470
 very well not all so too 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.660
 we have very bad games but I think that 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.790
 that's not impossible, always winning 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.250
 fatal games there are games to throw 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.860
 of the hairs but another good aspect that 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.050
 I can tell from iker blogs is that although 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.050
 Start is a little bad if you work it out 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.490
 a little and look for the tickles at 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.530
 lateral because equal in the center of 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.540
 they dominate and you use the 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.760
 break you can take the tone of the 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.130
 game right away you can make a hero 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.140
 very good and be endure a very defense 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.180
 good and even tracing the game if 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.850
 you know how to go to the sides and 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.420
 get kill heroes and if fine art 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.970
 what is said as sergio says if you know 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.380
 handle it good almost like everything but if 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.209
 you know how to handle iker bots well 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.580
 truth that he has is a piece of hero 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.260
 a hero who plays a lot of balls and is 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.180
 very good what of each commented of 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.310
 rupture is a life that has enough 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.630
 puÃ±etera that if you move you start 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.850
 bleed and takes life away from you 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.530
 periodic and the truth that is fuck 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.730
 pretty fixed on the score also 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:20.570
 total of victims 854 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:26.010
 fucking barbarity is a beating and in the end 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:28.320
 He asked me a little bit and I wanted to catch you 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.760
 ricky because he had told me nothing if 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.610
 pillas enrique right now the villa san 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.790
 fernando and the one of recognizing that the me a 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.220
 little to the poor kids but from 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.470
 here to say how good I did it why not 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:46.320
 will only play if as fast as possible 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.539
 but good that we do not usually be here and 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.240
 ridiculing anyone but good that 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:54.930
 all ways doing that but deaths or 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.850
 be dead zero sergio and that's the 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.979
 charisma with the kind of life that also 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.169
 has zero deaths of itself good to 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.110
 everyone is that everyone made a good 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.300
 departure and good sergio de pointer 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.400
 players who wore their if 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.280
 they did good support and they notice the 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.380
 support numbers because if they are not 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.730
 characters to rank with who do their 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.830
 are doing the team a favor 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.960
 very big that is a mistake that has 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.820
 many people who say new to be a 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.110
 good game you have to kill a lot of me 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.910
 to do many deaths no no if you're 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.430
 a support and makes your portal that has 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.050
 that kill the game life as the yield 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.880
 Of course, the fact is that you have to 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.830
 get used to and good and know what is your 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.900
 function because many characters do not 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.480
 they have a kill kill kill function 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.410
 but simply to give support and point or 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.050
 be point because nothing people have here 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.300
 I'm teaching the game of blocks and 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.670
 that has more matches here has 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.410
 combat ryder omni night in short with a 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.300
 bunch of characters this is the 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.700
 history let's say of the items of 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.470
 gifted has a lot of pages that is 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.120
 that has a lot of games but 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.740
 well he just showed yours more 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.750
 highlighted with the iker blog character 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.090
 surely for the next game it 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.650
 I will teach another outstanding and it seems to me 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.390
 that I'm going to teach you some outstanding 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.680
 our friend Tony who also has 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.750
 some other and now that I'm not 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.409
 thinking could be also interesting 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.080
 teach 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.849
 character some of temper especially 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.129
 yes yes especially good tuning from 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.679
 perfectly also has some for 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:21.389
 there but good people, nothing said goodbye 

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:23.429
 I hope you liked it more 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.719
 highlight of the departure of sergio with the 

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:27.300
 breaker or commented 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:29.999
 perfectly function and good 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.860
 as he does with him and I do not expect anything 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:34.199
 you like how I say again if you want 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.639
 comment anything you already know a 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.300
