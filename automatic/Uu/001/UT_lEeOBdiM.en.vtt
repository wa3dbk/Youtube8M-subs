have to bend them around like a dip it
flat<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:28.180> might<00:02:28.360> be<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.540> little<00:02:28.690> bit<00:02:28.990> no<00:02:29.350> this

is a little sick of dirt I thought as an

is a little sick of dirt I thought as an
air<00:02:31.450> bubble<00:02:31.569> for<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.930> second<00:02:32.230> detail<00:02:33.220> on<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
air bubble for a second detail on the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.880 
air bubble for a second detail on the
face<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:34.840> really<00:02:35.080> nice

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.700 

and<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.819> can<00:02:39.940> really<00:02:40.120> tell<00:02:40.300> with<00:02:40.510> with<00:02:41.500> such

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
and you can really tell with with such

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.280 
and you can really tell with with such
small<00:02:42.040> details<00:02:42.460> like<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.790> chain<00:02:43.030> mail<00:02:43.240> or<00:02:44.080> the

small details like the chain mail or the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.520 
small details like the chain mail or the
little<00:02:44.500> beads<00:02:44.680> around<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.430> guys<00:02:45.580> gauntlet

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
little beads around the guys gauntlet

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.910 
little beads around the guys gauntlet
that<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:48.610> fine<00:02:48.819> cast<00:02:49.060> model<00:02:50.020> molding<00:02:50.500> process

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
that the fine cast model molding process

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.120 
that the fine cast model molding process
is<00:02:51.100> improved<00:02:51.700> since<00:02:52.180> its<00:02:52.390> initial<00:02:52.569> release

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
is improved since its initial release

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.260 
is improved since its initial release
and<00:02:55.020> in<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:57.040> way<00:02:57.130> that's<00:02:57.340> too<00:02:57.550> bad<00:02:57.700> because<00:02:57.880> I

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
and in a way that's too bad because I

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.420 
and in a way that's too bad because I
almost<00:02:58.630> would<00:02:59.110> order<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> second<00:02:59.860> figure<00:03:00.040> or

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
almost would order a second figure or

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.400 
almost would order a second figure or
called<00:03:00.730> GW<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.240> ask<00:03:01.360> for<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.600> second<00:03:01.900> figure<00:03:02.020> it

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
called GW and ask for a second figure it

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.960 
called GW and ask for a second figure it
if<00:03:02.650> if<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.580> could<00:03:03.840> comes<00:03:04.840> with<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:05.140> slot<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.500> base

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
if if I could comes with one slot a base

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.460 
if if I could comes with one slot a base
with<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.060> hole<00:03:07.239> inside<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:07.870> it's<00:03:08.050> meant<00:03:08.319> to<00:03:08.440> be

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
with the hole inside so it's meant to be

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.390 
with the hole inside so it's meant to be
angled<00:03:08.920> at<00:03:09.489> that<00:03:09.700> diagonal<00:03:10.770> facing<00:03:11.770> forward

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
angled at that diagonal facing forward

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.170 
angled at that diagonal facing forward
like<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:17.350> this<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.190> think<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:18.850> makes<00:03:19.090> it

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
like so so this I think this makes it

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.690 
like so so this I think this makes it
good<00:03:19.360> for<00:03:19.830> when<00:03:20.830> you're<00:03:21.040> trying<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.310> rank<00:03:21.519> him

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
good for when you're trying to rank him

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.630 
good for when you're trying to rank him
up<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.570> only<00:03:22.780> other<00:03:22.810> piece<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.459> his<00:03:24.459> back<00:03:26.640> this

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
up the only other piece is his back this

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.380 
up the only other piece is his back this
back<00:03:27.910> piece<00:03:30.750> which<00:03:31.750> goes

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.500 

great<00:03:34.960> over<00:03:35.110> there<00:03:35.260> behind<00:03:35.380> his<00:03:35.590> head<00:03:36.510> so

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
great over there behind his head so

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.480 
great over there behind his head so
let's<00:03:37.750> just<00:03:37.810> see<00:03:38.020> how<00:03:38.170> he<00:03:38.230> ranks<00:03:38.650> up<00:03:38.800> in<00:03:39.310> the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
let's just see how he ranks up in the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.460 
let's just see how he ranks up in the
slaughter<00:03:39.850> base<00:03:40.090> I've<00:03:41.050> got<00:03:41.260> some<00:03:43.470> zombies

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
slaughter base I've got some zombies

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:53.830 
slaughter base I've got some zombies
here<00:03:44.860> if<00:03:45.160> you<00:03:45.310> can<00:03:45.459> line<00:03:45.640> up<00:03:45.670> next<00:03:45.910> to

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.949 

on<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.959> side<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:56.270> with<00:03:57.270> all<00:03:57.510> things<00:03:57.720> in

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
on the side and with all things in

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.920 
on the side and with all things in
warhammer<00:03:58.490> fantasy<00:03:59.490> where<00:04:00.240> they<00:04:00.569> have<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.840> be

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
warhammer fantasy where they have to be

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.920 
warhammer fantasy where they have to be
ranked<00:04:01.230> up<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:02.459> hardest<00:04:02.819> thing<00:04:03.450> sometimes

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
ranked up the hardest thing sometimes

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.270 
ranked up the hardest thing sometimes
it's<00:04:04.140> going<00:04:04.319> to<00:04:04.410> be<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.930> rank<00:04:07.140> up<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:07.650> maybe

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
it's going to be to the rank up so maybe

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.740 
it's going to be to the rank up so maybe
you<00:04:08.400> just<00:04:08.550> need<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.790> find<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:11.250> best<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:12.600> best

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
you just need to find the best the best

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.349 
you just need to find the best the best
matchup<00:04:13.230> for<00:04:13.500> your<00:04:13.650> models

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.230 

that<00:04:19.359> work<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:20.350> that<00:04:20.799> will<00:04:20.919> that<00:04:21.160> will<00:04:21.250> do<00:04:21.400> so

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
that work and that will that will do so

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.110 
that work and that will that will do so
so<00:04:22.630> he<00:04:22.750> does<00:04:22.900> rank<00:04:23.200> up<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:24.520> just<00:04:24.730> need<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:24.970> do<00:04:25.090> a

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
so he does rank up you just need to do a

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.220 
so he does rank up you just need to do a
little<00:04:25.270> bit<00:04:25.450> of<00:04:25.480> fidgeting<00:04:25.870> with<00:04:25.930> them<00:04:26.169> and

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
little bit of fidgeting with them and

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.140 
little bit of fidgeting with them and
their<00:04:29.230> yes<00:04:29.470> so<00:04:30.070> I'm<00:04:30.340> going<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.610> take<00:04:30.910> him<00:04:31.030> away

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
their yes so I'm going to take him away

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.510 
their yes so I'm going to take him away
to<00:04:31.210> get<00:04:31.360> painted<00:04:31.780> I'll<00:04:32.320> do<00:04:32.680> another<00:04:32.950> warbots
