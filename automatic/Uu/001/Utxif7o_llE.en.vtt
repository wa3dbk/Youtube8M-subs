operating in a constant on fashion now

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.209 
operating in a constant on fashion now
this<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.990> pretty<00:00:13.410> going<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.740> be<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> pretty

straight<00:00:14.580> shot<00:00:14.969> once<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.570> round<00:00:16.520> coming<00:00:17.520> down

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
straight shot once we round coming down

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.599 
straight shot once we round coming down
a<00:00:17.760> hill<00:00:18.090> here<00:00:18.570> slight<00:00:19.380> grade<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.100> then<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
a hill here slight grade and then the

a hill here slight grade and then the
the<00:00:20.640> road<00:00:21.060> bears<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.900> right<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> little<00:00:22.260> bit

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
the road bears to the right a little bit

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.259 
the road bears to the right a little bit
hooks<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.949> right<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.820> then<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.090> pretty

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
much straight on to the drone sign so

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.480 
much straight on to the drone sign so
we've<00:00:27.480> got<00:00:27.689> these<00:00:27.900> for<00:00:28.170> detectives<00:00:28.800> operating

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
detectors alert to 34-7 drone as we

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.650 
detectors alert to 34-7 drone as we
drive<00:00:37.950> into<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.640> facing<00:00:39.030> us<00:00:39.210> now<00:00:39.420> is

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
drive into it it's facing us now is

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020 
drive into it it's facing us now is
instead<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.110> facing<00:00:40.290> away<00:00:40.730> let's<00:00:41.730> see<00:00:41.879> what

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
instead of facing away let's see what

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.940 
instead of facing away let's see what
kind<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.360> alert<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.809> get<00:00:43.020> from<00:00:43.170> these<00:00:43.320> these

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
kind of alert we get from these these

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.980 
kind of alert we get from these these
detectors

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.680 

velocity<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:51.950> about<00:00:52.160> 75<00:00:52.760> miles<00:00:53.030> an<00:00:53.300> hour<00:00:53.420> at

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
velocity is about 75 miles an hour at

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:02.670 
velocity is about 75 miles an hour at
the<00:00:53.810> moment

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.760 

okay<00:01:03.310> the<00:01:04.150> drones<00:01:04.449> going<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:04.989> be<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.170> little<00:01:05.650> bit

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
okay the drones going to be a little bit

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.520 
okay the drones going to be a little bit
off<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:06.160> our<00:01:06.310> left<00:01:06.340> here<00:01:06.790> this<00:01:06.970> road<00:01:07.320> curves<00:01:08.320> a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
off to our left here this road curves a

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.310 
off to our left here this road curves a
little<00:01:08.560> bit<00:01:08.800> to<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.010> left<00:01:09.040> up<00:01:09.430> ahead<00:01:09.580> here<00:01:10.320> so

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
little bit to the left up ahead here so

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.700 
little bit to the left up ahead here so
far<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.710> detector<00:01:12.100> was<00:01:12.250> silent

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.490 

okay<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.520> STI<00:01:16.880> are<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.450> CI<00:01:17.690> go<00:01:18.020> off<00:01:20.500> their

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
okay the STI are and a CI go off their

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.010 
okay the STI are and a CI go off their
alerting<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.760> red<00:01:22.970> line<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.479> Valentine

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
alerting the red line and the Valentine

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.230 
alerting the red line and the Valentine
are<00:01:24.170> quiet<00:01:24.409> now<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.710> red<00:01:24.979> line<00:01:28.240> indicating

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
are quiet now the red line indicating

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:37.899 
are quiet now the red line indicating
34-7<00:01:30.140> now<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.040> Valentine<00:01:31.729> one

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.610 

you<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.300> drone<00:01:39.570> sign<00:01:39.900> up<00:01:40.080> ahead<00:01:40.229> here

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
you can see the drone sign up ahead here

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:59.639 
you can see the drone sign up ahead here
in<00:01:40.740> 34-7<00:01:43.670> at<00:01:44.670> 500<00:01:45.210> feet<00:01:45.330> away<00:01:52.220> passing<00:01:53.220> it

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.139 

Valentine<00:02:00.649> let<00:02:00.890> go<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.880> they<00:02:02.000> all

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
Valentine let go of it and they all

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.370 
Valentine let go of it and they all
basically<00:02:02.329> let<00:02:02.689> go<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:03.020> about<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.350> same

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
basically let go of it about the same

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.690 
basically let go of it about the same
time<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:04.700> there<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:04.970> have<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.180> that's<00:02:05.570> 34<00:02:06.670> 7k<00:02:07.670> a

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
time so there you have it that's 34 7k a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.580 
time so there you have it that's 34 7k a
constant<00:02:08.569> on<00:02:09.399> facing<00:02:10.399> us
