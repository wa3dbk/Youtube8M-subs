00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
the lid not into the crease because you

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.250 
the lid not into the crease because you
will<00:01:06.460> have<00:01:06.580> a<00:01:06.640> harder<00:01:06.970> time<00:01:07.000> blending<00:01:07.420> if<00:01:07.780> you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
will have a harder time blending if you

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.630 
will have a harder time blending if you
put<00:01:08.440> this<00:01:08.560> on<00:01:08.680> in<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:08.890> wrong<00:01:09.040> area<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:09.610> just

reddish brown and i'm using that as my
crease<00:01:22.420> color<00:01:22.690> but<00:01:22.990> this<00:01:23.110> is<00:01:23.260> more<00:01:23.530> just<00:01:24.010> to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
crease color but this is more just to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
to be my main crease color so just use

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.750 
to be my main crease color so just use
this<00:01:29.140> with<00:01:29.500> any<00:01:29.740> brush<00:01:29.979> that<00:01:30.159> you<00:01:30.310> want<00:01:30.520> and
