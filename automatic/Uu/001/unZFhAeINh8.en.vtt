didn't tangle at all and I've gotten
I<00:02:11.650> think<00:02:12.040> maybe<00:02:12.250> our<00:02:12.510> bike<00:02:13.510> once<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.930> combed<00:02:14.230> it

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
I think maybe our bike once I combed it

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.289 
I think maybe our bike once I combed it
out<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.830> would<00:02:15.220> say<00:02:15.400> maybe<00:02:15.430> four<00:02:16.000> or<00:02:16.030> five
