00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
in to the second coat goes on much

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.999 
in to the second coat goes on much
easier<00:01:48.420> than<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:48.630> first<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:49.050> did<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.710> there

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
easier than the first one did so there

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.630 
easier than the first one did so there
is<00:01:50.160> two<00:01:50.340> coats<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.729> mysa

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.850 

the<00:01:57.180> next<00:01:57.360> one<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.510> believe<00:01:57.690> is<00:01:57.810> Vlad<00:01:58.440> well<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.800> do

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the next one I believe is Vlad well I do

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.350 
the next one I believe is Vlad well I do
actually<00:01:59.040> don't<00:01:59.400> I'm<00:01:59.550> sure<00:01:59.580> that's<00:01:59.940> wrong<00:02:00.150> but

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
actually don't I'm sure that's wrong but

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.450 
actually don't I'm sure that's wrong but
phonetically<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.229> valid<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.550> is<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:04.460> kind

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
phonetically it's valid this is a kind

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.969 
phonetically it's valid this is a kind
of<00:02:05.550> deeper<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.780> medium<00:02:07.170> green<00:02:07.409> with<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.650> ton

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
of deeper like medium green with a ton

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.630 
of deeper like medium green with a ton
of<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.250> gold<00:02:08.490> shimmer<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.840> here's<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.229> coat

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
of that gold shimmer so here's one coat

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.890 
of that gold shimmer so here's one coat
this<00:02:11.640> one<00:02:11.819> covers<00:02:12.060> really<00:02:12.330> well<00:02:12.480> on<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.690> first

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
this one covers really well on the first

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.690 
this one covers really well on the first
coat<00:02:13.140> it's<00:02:13.350> not<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> one<00:02:13.950> coder<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.550> does

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
coat it's not a one coder but it does

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.810 
coat it's not a one coder but it does
cover<00:02:14.880> well<00:02:15.150> again<00:02:15.930> fantastic<00:02:16.920> formula<00:02:17.370> so

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
cover well again fantastic formula so

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.820 
cover well again fantastic formula so
there<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.000> one<00:02:18.090> coat<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.170> here<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.350> two<00:02:19.650> coats

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
there is one coat so here is two coats

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.610 
there is one coat so here is two coats
this<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:20.910> covers<00:02:21.180> completely<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.780> two<00:02:22.020> so

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
this one covers completely in two so

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.230 
this one covers completely in two so
there<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.950> two<00:02:23.280> coats<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.730> valid

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.330 

so<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.870> next<00:02:29.990> polish<00:02:30.320> i<00:02:30.470> think<00:02:30.830> i<00:02:30.980> can<00:02:31.040> say

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
so the next polish i think i can say

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.890 
so the next polish i think i can say
properly<00:02:31.760> because<00:02:31.880> i<00:02:32.060> think<00:02:32.120> i've<00:02:32.480> heard<00:02:32.510> this

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
properly because i think i've heard this

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.810 
properly because i think i've heard this
before<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.470> I'm<00:02:33.590> putting<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.950> name<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.370> what

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
before and I'm putting the name to what

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.100 
before and I'm putting the name to what
I<00:02:34.850> think<00:02:35.120> I've<00:02:35.240> heard<00:02:35.270> out<00:02:35.570> loud<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:35.990> is

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
I think I've heard out loud and this is

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.040 
I think I've heard out loud and this is
Jack<00:02:36.320> arias<00:02:36.800> this<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:37.940> deep<00:02:38.300> kind<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.690> purply

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
Jack arias this is a deep kind of purply

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.590 
Jack arias this is a deep kind of purply
red<00:02:39.380> with<00:02:39.740> a<00:02:39.770> pink<00:02:40.190> shimmer<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.640> some<00:02:41.210> almost

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
red with a pink shimmer and some almost

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.140 
red with a pink shimmer and some almost
like<00:02:41.780> fiery<00:02:42.110> orange<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.920> micro<00:02:43.160> glitters<00:02:43.490> so

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
like fiery orange of micro glitters so

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.300 
like fiery orange of micro glitters so
here's<00:02:44.330> one<00:02:44.570> coat<00:02:46.630> this<00:02:47.630> one<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:47.960> almost<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:49.160> one

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
here's one coat this one is almost a one

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.040 
here's one coat this one is almost a one
code<00:02:49.520> or<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.700> think<00:02:49.880> if<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.090> do<00:02:50.450> really<00:02:50.750> thick

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
code or I think if you do really thick

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.780 
code or I think if you do really thick
coats<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.920> could<00:02:52.070> get<00:02:52.190> away<00:02:52.280> with<00:02:52.370> one<00:02:52.610> coat

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
coats you could get away with one coat

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.220 
coats you could get away with one coat
because<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.150> does<00:02:53.270> kind<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.480> go<00:02:53.630> on<00:02:53.810> thickly

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
because it does kind of go on thickly

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.200 
because it does kind of go on thickly
anyway<00:02:54.740> I'm<00:02:55.130> trying<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.520> thin<00:02:55.670> my<00:02:55.700> coats<00:02:56.030> out

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
anyway I'm trying to thin my coats out

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.400 
anyway I'm trying to thin my coats out
and<00:02:56.330> I've<00:02:56.390> got<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.540> little<00:02:56.750> bit<00:02:56.960> of<00:02:56.990> uneven

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
and I've got a little bit of uneven

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.720 
and I've got a little bit of uneven
coloring<00:02:57.800> so<00:02:57.950> I'm<00:02:58.010> going<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.190> do<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.340> second

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
coloring so I'm going to do a second

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.030 
coloring so I'm going to do a second
formula<00:02:59.450> on<00:02:59.570> this<00:02:59.690> one<00:02:59.840> is<00:03:00.080> fantastic<00:03:00.830> like<00:03:00.980> I

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
formula on this one is fantastic like I

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.080 
formula on this one is fantastic like I
said<00:03:01.220> it's<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.370> little<00:03:01.610> bit<00:03:01.700> on<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.880> thick<00:03:02.060> side

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
said it's a little bit on the thick side

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.240 
said it's a little bit on the thick side
I<00:03:02.300> tend<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.690> like<00:03:02.750> thicker<00:03:03.200> formulas<00:03:03.650> but<00:03:04.130> you

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
I tend to like thicker formulas but you

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.250 
I tend to like thicker formulas but you
will<00:03:04.430> end<00:03:04.580> up<00:03:04.640> having<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.240> take<00:03:05.690> some<00:03:06.140> of<00:03:06.200> the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
will end up having to take some of the

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.750 
will end up having to take some of the
polish<00:03:06.500> off<00:03:06.710> of<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.190> brush<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.520> put<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.670> back

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
polish off of the brush and put it back

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.090 
polish off of the brush and put it back
in<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:07.940> bottle<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:08.660> there<00:03:08.810> is<00:03:08.930> one<00:03:08.960> coat<00:03:09.350> so

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
in the bottle so there is one coat so

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.940 
in the bottle so there is one coat so
here<00:03:10.250> is<00:03:10.280> two<00:03:10.580> coats<00:03:11.590> this<00:03:12.590> one<00:03:12.710> covers

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
here is two coats this one covers

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.950 
here is two coats this one covers
completely<00:03:13.400> into<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:14.000> was<00:03:14.150> nearly<00:03:14.450> opaque

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
completely into that was nearly opaque

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.620 
completely into that was nearly opaque
in<00:03:15.110> one<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:15.800> one<00:03:16.160> dry<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.910> little<00:03:17.180> bit<00:03:17.300> Matt

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
in one this one dry is a little bit Matt

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.330 
in one this one dry is a little bit Matt
they<00:03:18.200> probably<00:03:18.380> all<00:03:18.620> do<00:03:18.800> it<00:03:18.920> because<00:03:19.100> this<00:03:19.220> one

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
they probably all do it because this one

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.070 
they probably all do it because this one
is<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:19.550> dark<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:19.940> stands<00:03:20.210> out<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.540> most<00:03:20.570> so<00:03:20.990> you

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
is so dark it stands out the most so you

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.840 
is so dark it stands out the most so you
will<00:03:21.230> want<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.440> top<00:03:21.620> coat<00:03:21.830> so<00:03:22.220> there<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.520> two

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
will want a top coat so there is two

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.980 
will want a top coat so there is two
coats<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.270> what<00:03:23.420> i<00:03:23.450> believe<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:23.840> Dirk<00:03:24.320> arias

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.030 

so<00:03:30.590> my<00:03:30.740> favorite<00:03:31.010> in<00:03:31.100> this<00:03:31.160> collection<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.760> I
