00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.750

 Year in recent years 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.990
 One has realized how can one say that that 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.810

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.030

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.720
 No, of course, percent 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.730
 the strongest group of the quality 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.800
 a total of 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.410

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.950
 yes every game with 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.600
 must be approached with one hundred percent 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.290
 the percent 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.080

 Percent Percent demanded for each game to be a top performer 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.399
