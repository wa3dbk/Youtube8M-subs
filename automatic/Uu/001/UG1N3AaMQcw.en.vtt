00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
almost get the vibe they designed this

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.979 
almost get the vibe they designed this
level<00:00:56.399> specifically<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> precursor<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
level specifically as a precursor to the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.660 
level specifically as a precursor to the
later<00:00:58.140> version<00:00:58.590> instead<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> stage<00:00:59.489> in

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
later version instead of as a stage in

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.490 
later version instead of as a stage in
its<00:00:59.730> own<00:00:59.940> right<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.930> could<00:01:01.109> possibly

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
its own right that could possibly

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.619 
its own right that could possibly
explain<00:01:01.829> why<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.579> dull<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:02.969> short

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
explain why it's so dull and short

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.359 
explain why it's so dull and short

bullets<00:01:27.390> at<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.530> Gemini<00:01:28.920> laser<00:01:29.310> is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
bullets at you the Gemini laser is

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.130 
bullets at you the Gemini laser is
designed<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.000> ricochet<00:01:30.240> around<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.900> room

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
designed to ricochet around the room

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
designed to ricochet around the room
which<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.680> great<00:01:32.009> because<00:01:32.220> needle<00:01:32.640> man<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.939> big

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
which is great because needle man is big

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.289 
which is great because needle man is big
and<00:01:33.509> fat<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:33.960> slow<00:01:34.710> even<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.670> missed<00:01:35.880> shot<00:01:35.970> is

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and fat and slow even a missed shot is

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.300 
and fat and slow even a missed shot is
liable<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.720> connect<00:01:36.990> sooner<00:01:37.320> or<00:01:37.439> later<00:01:37.560> the

downside<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.909> Gemini<00:01:39.270> laser<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.869> you

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
downside the Gemini laser is that you

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.630 
downside the Gemini laser is that you
can't<00:01:40.200> open<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.560> menu<00:01:40.799> with<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.400> your<00:01:41.490> own

it if you're low on health it can be
pretty<00:01:46.020> intense<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:46.920> you're<00:01:47.040> down<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> crumb

pretty intense if you're down to a crumb

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.460 
pretty intense if you're down to a crumb
of<00:01:47.820> energy<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.899> wait<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.229> laser

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
of energy and have to wait for the laser

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.770 
of energy and have to wait for the laser
to<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:49.799> away<00:01:50.040> before<00:01:50.250> chugging<00:01:50.790> an<00:01:50.880> e-tank

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
to go away before chugging an e-tank

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.930 
to go away before chugging an e-tank
so<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.470> wraps<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.830> this<00:01:53.040> bite-sized<00:01:53.520> chapter
