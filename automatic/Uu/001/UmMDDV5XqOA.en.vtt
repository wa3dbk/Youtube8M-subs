00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.020 

open<00:00:36.980> that<00:00:37.070> up<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:37.339> you<00:00:37.429> can<00:00:37.579> seem<00:00:37.789> a<00:00:37.879> little

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
open that up so you can seem a little

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.650 
open that up so you can seem a little
better<00:00:38.589> these<00:00:39.589> are<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.829> purebred<00:00:40.730> coturnix

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
better these are the purebred coturnix

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.729 
better these are the purebred coturnix
and<00:00:42.609> a<00:00:43.609> breeding<00:00:44.059> trio<00:00:44.449> and<00:00:44.750> we're<00:00:45.320> using<00:00:45.500> them

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
and a breeding trio and we're using them

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.479 
and a breeding trio and we're using them
to<00:00:46.329> course<00:00:47.329> breed<00:00:47.629> up<00:00:47.780> some<00:00:47.960> more<00:00:48.399> using<00:00:49.399> the

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
to course breed up some more using the

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.240 
to course breed up some more using the
incubator<00:00:52.449> putting<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:53.539> water<00:00:54.159> putting<00:00:55.159> the

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
incubator putting the water putting the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.759 
incubator putting the water putting the
water<00:00:55.369> up<00:00:55.670> on<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:55.930> block<00:00:56.930> like<00:00:57.140> that<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:57.619> having

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
water up on a block like that and having

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.289 
water up on a block like that and having
a<00:00:57.920> divider<00:00:58.219> that<00:00:58.909> sure<00:00:59.449> helps<00:00:59.659> keep<00:01:00.469> them<00:01:00.649> from

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
a divider that sure helps keep them from

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.130 
a divider that sure helps keep them from
scratching<00:01:02.299> food<00:01:02.510> into<00:01:02.809> their<00:01:02.930> water<00:01:05.140> and

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
scratching food into their water and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.050 
scratching food into their water and
then<00:01:06.380> kind<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:07.039> remind<00:01:07.310> me<00:01:07.369> of<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:07.549> bobwhite

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.080 

then<00:01:11.060> up<00:01:11.360> here<00:01:12.369> we<00:01:13.369> have<00:01:13.670> am<00:01:14.569> females<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:15.470> this

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
then up here we have am females and this

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.529 
then up here we have am females and this
somewhat<00:01:17.090> noisy<00:01:17.710> coturnix<00:01:18.710> male<00:01:19.330> so<00:01:20.330> these

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
somewhat noisy coturnix male so these

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.950 
somewhat noisy coturnix male so these
three<00:01:21.080> make<00:01:21.500> our<00:01:21.770> third<00:01:22.039> breeding<00:01:22.460> trio<00:01:22.960> so

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
three make our third breeding trio so

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.559 
three make our third breeding trio so
that<00:01:24.140> we<00:01:24.229> can<00:01:24.380> have<00:01:24.500> hybrids<00:01:25.390> so<00:01:26.920> hybrids<00:01:28.569> pure

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
that we can have hybrids so hybrids pure

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:37.180 
that we can have hybrids so hybrids pure
coturnix<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:31.569> pure<00:01:32.569> Texas<00:01:32.959> am<00:01:33.549> and<00:01:36.190> it's

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
coturnix and pure Texas am and it's

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.710 
coturnix and pure Texas am and it's
really<00:01:37.369> easy<00:01:37.520> for<00:01:37.850> me<00:01:37.909> to<00:01:37.940> stand<00:01:38.270> fertilized

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
really easy for me to stand fertilized

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.279 
really easy for me to stand fertilized
eggs<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:40.100> anybody<00:01:40.489> if<00:01:40.729> you<00:01:41.209> want<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.509> breed

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
eggs to anybody if you want to breed

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.930 
eggs to anybody if you want to breed
your<00:01:42.440> own<00:01:42.560> quail<00:01:43.450> these<00:01:44.450> guys<00:01:44.720> are<00:01:45.580> about<00:01:46.580> six

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
your own quail these guys are about six

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.050 
your own quail these guys are about six
weeks<00:01:47.119> old<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:49.610> should<00:01:49.759> start

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
weeks old and so this should start

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.240 
weeks old and so this should start
laying<00:01:50.270> eggs<00:01:50.569> any<00:01:51.140> time<00:01:52.179> starting<00:01:53.179> our<00:01:54.250> line

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
laying eggs any time starting our line

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.499 
laying eggs any time starting our line
of<00:01:55.280> hybrid<00:01:56.229> quails<00:01:57.489> but<00:01:58.489> I'll<00:01:58.970> back<00:01:59.179> up<00:01:59.330> and

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
of hybrid quails but I'll back up and

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.109 
of hybrid quails but I'll back up and
show<00:01:59.690> you<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.050> size<00:02:00.319> of<00:02:00.500> these<00:02:00.590> cages<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:01.310> think

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
show you the size of these cages I think

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.889 
show you the size of these cages I think
three<00:02:02.869> in<00:02:02.989> a<00:02:03.080> cage<00:02:03.289> that<00:02:03.560> size<00:02:03.800> is<00:02:04.569> enough<00:02:05.569> room

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
three in a cage that size is enough room

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.100 
three in a cage that size is enough room
and<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:07.340> there's<00:02:07.519> a<00:02:07.580> three<00:02:08.030> or<00:02:08.869> three

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
and so there's a three or three

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.710 
and so there's a three or three
bloodlines<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.830> quail<00:02:10.160> there<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.879> am's<00:02:11.330> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
bloodlines of quail there the am's the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.009 
bloodlines of quail there the am's the
coturnix<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.739> hybrids<00:02:13.750> I'll<00:02:14.750> show<00:02:14.959> you

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
coturnix and the hybrids I'll show you

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.760 
coturnix and the hybrids I'll show you
some<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.230> our<00:02:15.319> babies

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
some of our babies

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.730 
some of our babies
before<00:02:17.640> we<00:02:17.730> look<00:02:17.850> at<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.060> baby<00:02:18.240> chicks<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.930> was

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
before we look at the baby chicks I was

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.150 
before we look at the baby chicks I was
going<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.980> show<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.220> how<00:02:20.990> neatly<00:02:21.990> they<00:02:22.260> filter

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
going to show you how neatly they filter

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.770 
going to show you how neatly they filter
out<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.520> eggs<00:02:23.960> then<00:02:24.960> they<00:02:25.200> hatch<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:26.780> then

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
out of the eggs then they hatch and then

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.800 
out of the eggs then they hatch and then
there<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:29.840> an<00:02:30.840> actual<00:02:31.200> edge<00:02:33.020> it's<00:02:34.020> a

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
there is an actual edge it's a

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.020 
there is an actual edge it's a
abnormally<00:02:36.810> small<00:02:37.020> egg<00:02:37.730> smaller<00:02:38.730> than<00:02:38.910> my

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
abnormally small egg smaller than my

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.860 
abnormally small egg smaller than my
thumbnail<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.730> cover<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.940> fairy<00:02:42.240> egg<00:02:42.540> or<00:02:42.840> a

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
thumbnail and cover the fairy egg or a

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.540 
thumbnail and cover the fairy egg or a
fart<00:02:43.500> egg<00:02:43.820> but<00:02:44.820> I've<00:02:45.600> never<00:02:45.780> seen<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.170> coil<00:02:46.550> do

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
fart egg but I've never seen the coil do

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.460 
fart egg but I've never seen the coil do
that<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.790> think<00:02:47.880> chickens<00:02:48.390> do<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.810> haven't

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
that I think chickens do that haven't

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.980 
that I think chickens do that haven't
had<00:02:49.590> Krell<00:02:49.890> wrong<00:02:50.760> chickens<00:02:51.270> but<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.780> guess

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
had Krell wrong chickens but I guess

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.420 
had Krell wrong chickens but I guess
they'll<00:02:52.170> do<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.470> too<00:02:52.680> all<00:02:53.100> right<00:02:53.250> have<00:02:53.370> to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
they'll do that too all right have to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.560 
they'll do that too all right have to
look<00:02:53.610> at<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.990> little<00:02:54.990> baby<00:02:55.200> chick<00:02:56.570> there's

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
look at the little baby chick there's

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.550 
look at the little baby chick there's
some<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.070> little<00:02:59.070> baby<00:02:59.340> quail<00:02:59.700> chicks<00:03:00.560> we

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
some of the little baby quail chicks we

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.630 
some of the little baby quail chicks we
hatched<00:03:01.590> out<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.100> our<00:03:02.220> incubator<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:07.640> the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
hatched out of our incubator and the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.050 
hatched out of our incubator and the
