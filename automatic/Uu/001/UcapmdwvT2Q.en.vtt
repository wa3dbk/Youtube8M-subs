00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
tough tough starter in Italy but you

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.600 
tough tough starter in Italy but you
know<00:03:12.660> great<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.260> get<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.410> start<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.890> get<00:03:14.099> a<00:03:14.400> win

know great to get a start to get a win
over<00:03:14.640> there<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.239> think<00:03:17.420> they<00:03:18.420> did<00:03:18.600> probably<00:03:18.780> a

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
over there I think they did probably a

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.319 
over there I think they did probably a
couple<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.260> years<00:03:19.380> ago<00:03:19.530> when<00:03:19.739> they<00:03:19.829> lost<00:03:20.329> but

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
couple of years ago when they lost but

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.330 
couple of years ago when they lost but
this<00:03:21.480> was<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.989> massive<00:03:22.350> game<00:03:22.680> for<00:03:22.920> them<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.100> think

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
this was a massive game for them I think

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.440 
this was a massive game for them I think
you<00:03:23.489> know<00:03:23.579> putting<00:03:23.730> in<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.880> great<00:03:24.030> performance

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
you know putting in a great performance

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.539 
you know putting in a great performance
