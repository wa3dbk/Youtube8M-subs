to trim your basil plants regularly
because<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.320> harvestable<00:01:01.890> part<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.489> actually

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
because the harvestable part is actually

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.329 
because the harvestable part is actually
the<00:01:03.030> leaf<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.350> more<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.890> trim<00:01:05.190> the

the leaf and the more that you trim the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.210 
the leaf and the more that you trim the
plant<00:01:05.610> back<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.560> more<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
looking for now the big question is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
looking for now the big question is
where<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> plant<00:01:14.760> are<00:01:14.940> you<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> cut

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
where on the plant are you going to cut

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.920 
where on the plant are you going to cut
so<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.979> take<00:01:17.280> off<00:01:17.600> what<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.689> need

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
so that you can take off what you need

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.190 
so that you can take off what you need
and<00:01:19.170> still<00:01:19.500> provide<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.010> plant<00:01:20.720> with<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:22.080> it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
and still provide the plant with what it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.649 
and still provide the plant with what it
needs<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.650> continue<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.520> grow<00:01:23.670> well<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.450> best

give you an idea of a sense of how the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.030 
give you an idea of a sense of how the
plant<00:01:29.610> wants<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.090> grow<00:01:30.409> if<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.619> look<00:01:31.830> if<00:01:32.009> you

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
plant wants to grow if you look if you

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.219 
plant wants to grow if you look if you
notice<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> stem<00:01:33.030> you're<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> have

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
notice on the stem you're going to have

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.789 
notice on the stem you're going to have
points<00:01:34.920> at<00:01:35.400> which<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.900> plant<00:01:37.470> will<00:01:37.770> produce

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
points at which the plant will produce

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.190 
points at which the plant will produce
side<00:01:38.580> shoots<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.299> those<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:39.600> called<00:01:39.780> nodes

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
side shoots and those are called nodes

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.740 
side shoots and those are called nodes
and<00:01:40.680> they're<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.700> sectioned<00:01:42.210> off<00:01:42.330> if<00:01:42.659> you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and they're it's sectioned off if you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.690 
and they're it's sectioned off if you
look<00:01:42.960> through<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.650> length<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.189> any<00:01:44.340> given

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
look through the the length of any given

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.969 
look through the the length of any given
limb<00:01:45.119> you'll<00:01:45.720> see<00:01:45.990> places<00:01:46.350> where<00:01:46.619> though

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
limb you'll see places where though

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.780 
limb you'll see places where though
where<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:47.460> happening<00:01:48.030> now<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.860> key<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
where that's happening now the key is to

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.859 
where that's happening now the key is to
harvest<00:01:51.060> close<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> node<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.680> above<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.869> so

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
harvest close to a node just above it so

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.380 
harvest close to a node just above it so
that<00:01:55.140> at<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.890> point<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.520> will<00:01:56.670> stimulate<00:01:56.970> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
that at that point it will stimulate the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.929 
that at that point it will stimulate the
plant<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.500> divide<00:01:58.860> its<00:01:59.100> energy<00:01:59.490> and

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
plant to to divide its energy and

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.850 
plant to to divide its energy and
produce<00:02:00.180> two<00:02:00.659> more<00:02:00.869> limbs<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.500> where<00:02:01.710> there

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
produce two more limbs as where there

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.039 
produce two more limbs as where there
was<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.280> main<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.720> I'm<00:02:03.810> going<00:02:03.960> to

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
was one main one and so I'm going to

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.590 
was one main one and so I'm going to
take<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.350> plant<00:02:04.649> here<00:02:05.009> at<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.310> node<00:02:05.610> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
take this plant here at this node and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.359 
take this plant here at this node and
I'm<00:02:07.530> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.710> use<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> tips<00:02:08.219> of<00:02:08.309> my

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
I'm going to use the tips of my

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.809 
I'm going to use the tips of my
fingernails<00:02:09.029> to<00:02:09.389> pinch<00:02:09.629> off<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.169> tip<00:02:10.819> just

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
fingernails to pinch off this tip just

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.059 
fingernails to pinch off this tip just
carefully<00:02:12.359> you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.079> use<00:02:13.349> a

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
carefully you can use a

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.330 
carefully you can use a
knife<00:02:14.970> or<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.480> can<00:02:15.659> use<00:02:15.810> some<00:02:16.590> some<00:02:16.980> gardening

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
knife or you can use some some gardening

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.059 
knife or you can use some some gardening
shears<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.959> tips<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.290> your<00:02:19.349> fingernails<00:02:19.830> work

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
shears the tips of your fingernails work

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.619 
shears the tips of your fingernails work
well<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.549> can<00:02:20.700> see<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.060> I've<00:02:21.239> left<00:02:21.540> two

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
well and you can see that I've left two

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.360 
well and you can see that I've left two
branches<00:02:24.629> that<00:02:24.690> will<00:02:25.049> take<00:02:25.379> out<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.860> place<00:02:26.099> of

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
branches that will take out the place of

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.039 
branches that will take out the place of
the<00:02:26.489> one<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.909> I've<00:02:27.030> had<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.599> kind<00:02:27.930> of

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
the one that I've had and I kind of

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.309 
the one that I've had and I kind of
brought<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:29.069> down<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.209> core<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.810> then

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
brought this down to the core and then

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.949 
brought this down to the core and then
again<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.680> would<00:02:31.950> probably<00:02:32.099> do<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.670> same<00:02:32.700> thing

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
again I would probably do the same thing

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.320 
again I would probably do the same thing
by<00:02:33.959> coming<00:02:34.349> back<00:02:34.500> here<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.129> node<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.790> I

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
by coming back here to this node and I

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.979 
by coming back here to this node and I
can<00:02:36.540> pinch<00:02:36.810> off<00:02:37.970> carefully<00:02:38.970> pinch<00:02:39.480> off<00:02:39.690> a

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
can pinch off carefully pinch off a

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.630 
can pinch off carefully pinch off a
piece<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.989> branch<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.560> need<00:02:43.890> and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
piece of the the branch that I need and

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.940 
piece of the the branch that I need and
in<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.629> doing<00:02:45.659> you're<00:02:46.200> both<00:02:46.379> trimming<00:02:46.860> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
in so doing you're both trimming the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.150 
in so doing you're both trimming the
plant<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.489> harvesting<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:49.170> provide<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
plant and harvesting and you provide the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.869 
plant and harvesting and you provide the
plant<00:02:50.489> with<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:52.170> energy<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.799> keep<00:02:53.040> moving<00:02:53.730> at

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
plant with with energy to keep moving at

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.270 
plant with with energy to keep moving at
its<00:02:54.090> pace<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.780> keep<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.470> production<00:02:55.739> of

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
its pace and keep the production of

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.009 
its pace and keep the production of
leaves<00:02:56.670> as<00:02:56.970> opposed<00:02:57.329> to<00:02:57.980> going<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.099> see

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
leaves as opposed to going to see

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.630 
leaves as opposed to going to see
because<00:03:01.019> that's<00:03:01.410> that's<00:03:01.920> all<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.250> she<00:03:02.430> wrote

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
because that's that's all that she wrote

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.580 
because that's that's all that she wrote
when<00:03:02.910> she<00:03:03.120> goes<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.299> see<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.840> plant<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.290> done

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
when she goes to see the plant is done

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.599 
when she goes to see the plant is done
for<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.310> year

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
for the year

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.410 
for the year
and<00:03:06.379> so<00:03:07.379> if<00:03:07.530> subsequent<00:03:08.430> cuttings<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.239> want

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
and so if subsequent cuttings you want

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.699 
and so if subsequent cuttings you want
to<00:03:09.510> bring<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.780> down<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.079> never<00:03:10.290> want<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.590> go

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
to bring it down you never want to go

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.770 
to bring it down you never want to go
all<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:10.950> way<00:03:10.980> down<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.489> base<00:03:11.670> that's<00:03:12.480> just

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
all the way down to the base that's just

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.930 
all the way down to the base that's just
too<00:03:12.959> much<00:03:13.079> you<00:03:13.349> want<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.620> leave<00:03:13.859> leaves<00:03:14.579> so

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
too much you want to leave leaves so

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.949 
too much you want to leave leaves so
that<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.180> plant<00:03:15.390> can<00:03:15.569> continue<00:03:15.900> to

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
that the plant can continue to

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.589 
that the plant can continue to
