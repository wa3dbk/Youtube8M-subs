00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.190
 there are almost 17 degrees of temperature in a 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.070
 nice day of Friday a day of time 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.330
 player practically if there was any 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.769
 possibility of rains seems that it is not 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.630
 for the weekend so it's still very 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.130

 your marcela good day of good rod 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.160
 Good morning, a very nice note 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.650
 you know that nowadays the figures are 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.869
 alarming of the alzheimer cast due to 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.640
 which is an epidemic and within 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.470
 many measures that have to do with 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.050
 example with gymnastics or with diet 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.989
 special as preventive measures and is 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.640
 this to put to work the neurons or 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.000
 At least do activities during 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.260
 the life that they make us 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.550
 let's strengthen our head and our 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.420
 neurons good yesterday we were together 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.760
 with a group of people that meets with 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.649
 two therapists to do this kind of 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.420
 gymnastics we see it and then he tells you 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.520
 Go ahead 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.520
 [Music] 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.070
 how about how are you that is nimbly 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.320
 nimbly is a gymnastics workshop 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.300
 mental for adults that we come 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.000
 coordinating with 'alicia my partner from 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.310
 about four years ago and well we 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.979
 we meet weekly with adults and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.100
 Older adults to solve together 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.350
 word games reduction games 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.350
 visual memory games 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.860
 how the idea of this group came about 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.570
 nimbly as one grows 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.870
 that some time goes by 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.850
 neurons are burning and one is the one 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.490
 can make those that are left 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.040
 replace and how it is done 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.410
 activating the ones having the stimulated ones 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.940
 excited and that's where we enter 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.470
 us as we went 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.140
 working with people we are giving 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.840
 account that has in addition to the benefit 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.600
 of mental gymnastics the plus of 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.930
 social activity the fact that there 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.020
 People who maybe hit loses 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.260
 friends are retiring in their homes and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.300
 they have a day when they leave the one that 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.350
 they prepare to get ready for 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.350
 meet people 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.819
 November arrives October and says do not go 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.500
 to go on vacation 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.510
 and we the truth that we work hard 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.640
 and even the whole year and the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.550
 we enjoyed but we made one that is a 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.830
 week two they want us they do not want or that 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.560
 please tell them a lot of homework to 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.150
 that those days that we are not 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.209
 they can continue working and they too 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.459
 they return us because it is for 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.450
 of year they do not always have us in 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.940
 account and keep us in mind with or with 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.180
 words or with a gift there is always a 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.180
 return 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.040
 but what 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.870
 beyond the workshop you can make another 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.540
 type of activities to exercise 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.790
 neuron in daily life for example 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.129
 for example go to the supermarket with the 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.379
 list and do not take it out of the portfolio haha is 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.290
 a challenge is Paul's challenge for 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.730
 young people I just do that you go 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.989
 grabbing things and then when 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.700
 you are because now you approach the 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.080
 little paper to see that you forgot of course 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.610
 and every time he'll keep forgetting 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.219
 less because you're exercising your head 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.219
 [Music] 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.920
 when my husband died I was not going to 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.070
 nowhere 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.010
 and since I started it gave me strength to 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.140
 follow is a reason to see Arabic 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.190
 but the time to come because I do not 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.290
 here live NomÃ¡s 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.439
 history and media that I am here 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.590
 well you do not know what this meant 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:54.019
 it produces so much tenderness accompanies me 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.540
 So much is so important and vital to me 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:03.170
 life you do not know I'm very lonely 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.420
 very lonely then this has given me not you 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.470
 I say if you have given a meaning to my life 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:17.209
 A) Yes 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:20.549
 [Music] 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.039
 and I say it's very touching the 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.600
 last lady that I speak was about 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.900
 to cry because people do not just 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.940
 look for this that prepare your neurons and 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.759
 everyone has a good return, they say 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.320
 that over time 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:37.919
 they are more attentive they really remember 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.720
 more things are more agile nimbly the 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.729
 part is a place where socially 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.560
 you can find all handled the 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.370
 social networks that were still in 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.009
 Facebook 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.600
 they sent mails and 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.430
 really like this lady said i'm 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.250
 so alone but this is a reason for 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.870
 go out dressing up and at least have 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.229
 new friends really seems to me 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:02.039
 fantastic is a beautiful moment like that 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:05.160
 what precautions really is important 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:07.260
 in one's life 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.920
 do things that keep us 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.420
 productive that keep us alert and 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.890
 of course always have new 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.530
 projects because they are the ones that keep 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.260
 these young people know that the projects 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.530
 although they are boys there is always a new 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.010
 start and a new tomorrow thanks to the 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.010
 Grandma
