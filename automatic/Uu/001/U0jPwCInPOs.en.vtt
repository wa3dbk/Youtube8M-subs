him what happened there at the end right

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.880

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
and yeah I think I might have used them

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.220 
and yeah I think I might have used them
early<00:03:59.340> on<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.850> then<00:04:00.030> put<00:04:00.420> tires<00:04:00.660> on<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.019> track
