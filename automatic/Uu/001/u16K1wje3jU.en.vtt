00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.620
 jong ajax played the away match against jong the county last night 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.029
 stadium the pond mountain 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.429
 the pieter huistra team took the lead 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.490
 with only one point ahead of young PSV and young Sparta 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.470
 so a good result had to be achieved 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.140
 what if the county started this match well 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.210
 less than thirteen minutes a free kick for theaters 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.390
 comes in sixteen 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.010
 and then the referee whistles for hands 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.010
 and the county receives a penalty 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 many protests therefrom directly 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.340
 then also the yellow cards for deniz aslan 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.740
 the estimate of the moment 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.200
 not good to see makes the referee stood nearby penalty 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200
 for el hassnoui and who scores 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.850
 the demand for a goal for the county by ten minutes 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.610
 only four minutes later another attack of gas more expensive 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
 then thalassemia again though now my path is coming drama 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.290
 I had to offer 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.820
 kennedy disappears 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.910
 and then the question is seventeen minutes 2 0 for the county 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.360
 quite a damper for the front runner 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.410
 the home team team tried to enter the game 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.260
 but that was very difficult 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.370
 mobile the county road 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.890
 knew the ball were 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.350
 chance for eleven more than seven people on the pole he came away young ajax on foot 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.980
 the escaped a 3 0 behind 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.490
 then the rest 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.420
 a very different young ajax 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.920
 source anp 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.520
 the 65th minute 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.870
 ball on sailor and he scores 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.030
 2 marvin sailor 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.980
 the connection goal 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.980
 that is why the home team still has 25 minutes 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.180
 to go hunting for the equalizer thanks to this marvin hit 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.649
 sea ​​urchin 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.749
 the team source 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:14.759
 he sat with him 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.759
 bonevacia 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:21.869
 aras özbiliz 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:24.869
 you get a free kick 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:26.719
 özbiliz 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.719
 I think first and in the side net 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.499
 one of the options for young ajax 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.399
 the team of pieter huistra who was anything but satisfied 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:39.649
 on the performance of his team 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:40.909
 nathaniel will 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.629
 on sailor 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.129
 two men ahead 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.539
 marvin sailor 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.299
 gets the ball in front 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.579
 sea ​​urchin 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.949
 over everything and everyone 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.949
 then daylon claasen invader the south african the action makes mortar stopped 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.869
 win by goalkeeper gamers 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:02.039
 from the county 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.039
 that his team only came out little in the second half 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.419
 team that fights relegation 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.719
 the young ajax again 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:12.889
 vlietstra ball 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.649
 but seagull pechtold 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:17.989
 he sees young blood start the substitute another young man 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.439
 volley and a good rescue the kick-off 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.439
 you can equalize there 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.719
 and again young ajax 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.099
 eagerly hunting 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.959
 but the 2 2 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.959
 and then the free kick 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.809
 that's a nice job for tommy overtoom the midfielder the man with a 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:42.169
 8 overtoom and through the bar 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.649
 what the ball is fighting over for overtoom and young ajax 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.619
 that was a bit the last possibility is a fine of which the 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.499
 parents serve 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.409
 it was not allowed anymore 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.790
 Young Ajax seems to be an expensive defeat to the county and not just the loss 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.189
 the competition but was in the lead 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.299
 The town of Achtkarspelen before the county became available 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:05.789
 year 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.239
 who want to be wild who starts to do beautiful 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.119
 she wanted to play football this applies to this opponent who does not lend themselves there 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.969
 to score 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:18.159
 this was very much a matter of winning hands to the duels today 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.389
 it doesn't 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.020
 nicely succeeds but in a different way beh 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.949
 qatar came 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.229
 the foot and then it becomes difficult 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.229
 walking on the youth teams 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.799
 for the avro the code orange both times 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:39.330
 also called after three competitions approach from the government 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.180
 this amount can be with its competitors 4 how do you estimate the chances for one has 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.740
 championship still in but I remain optimistic we do not have it in our own 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.740
 hand but we still have three great matches 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.779
 and I heard him turn the euro 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.500
 the trainer thinks that the competitors I have experienced you can of course 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.129
 for the world championships packaging cycle path plan the agency de open 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.619
 there was also a nice competition year we also hope to be a lot 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:10.479
 allow it to rise there
