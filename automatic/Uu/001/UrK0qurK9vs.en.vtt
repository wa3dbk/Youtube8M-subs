00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.029
 after the world tour proposed by sylvia marine last weekend the 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.000
 flamenco festival has entered its first big week with the 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.460
 recital of the Spanish singer maïté maritime always very 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.309
 appreciated in Nîmes and who gave himself on the stage of the theater in a 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.130
 program of the most intimate or like the king and like mop romeo tamarins 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.090
 sing the women of the tam dao there hailing from barcelona for me this n 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.090
 is not quite ask yourself the same question why is an advantage 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:28.919
 the green pole 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.699
 palace alain costes huge 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.230
 it's still not normal such a rise the flamenco festival like at 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.219
 each of my services I know to propose to the public palaces that do not 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.489
 are traditionally not interpreted during the flamenco festival 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.829
 his departure leaves some forgotten because the artists sing war 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.410
 I sang a reckless seniority 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.070
 but also a last time wonderful yet sick parreira 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.380
 loopholes reams titled cashier not the land I also 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.290
 interpreted gallo times that's another not local paid this is what I 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.000
 want to give the public something we're not used to hearing 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.670
 in most flamenco festivals these are truly 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.220
 precious music 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.760
 the word does not hide its hours 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.320
 a divine voice and who carried for more than an hour the assistance of the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.420
 Theater of Nîmes 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.190
 totally captivated by tanks to which maritime mastery I love everything 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.510
 especially lyon at bonal stage there 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.800
 mrs royal telephoned to be buried 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.009
 while he loves the melody and nuances that accompany these fields 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.570
 that's what I like in music and the general flamenco touched his 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.850
 shades in order to then put the blackout intensity 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.870
 we prefer that intel rise 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.550
 a champion in the intensity and depth of her voice 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.610
 always admires with a unique theme capable of expressing a 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.550
 infinite palette of feelings 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.550
 laurent elias 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.310
 the same effects that I played it is the height to upset in this concert 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.410
 village and I love what I do 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.550
 they will have public health was totally 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.559
 upset she returned to reverse the score we saw the end 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:14.909
 these applause that it was left only him this exit in the 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:15.809
 silence 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:19.219
 this was really our mark of great emotion at the tests 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.859
 yes absolutely subjugated by this concert 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.249
 the dangerous if for me it's a wonderful start 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.479
 and I am 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:31.679
 the real world very very happy this Basque night she really marks 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.579
 our attention 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.209
 on all the final phases 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.490
 who is good to reach to this purity this beauty this excellence 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.019
 in reality the whole idea is there 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.019
 and so tonight we had a whistle concentrate of m 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.949

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.059
 this year 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:02.169
 it is for this 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:05.939
 prayers have all come to an end after so many years without 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.989
 know in what street j I least flamenco record I think it is 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.689
 very important to be always asking so much in the different festivals 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.400
 everyone remembers me and mattel so that I participate and that I 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.769
 do today something else that is called to me I consider this as 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.719
 a mark of mutual respect 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:24.119
 your console 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:27.119

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:46.000
 that it lasts 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.640

 dedicated to the poet de malaga manuel alcantara 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:55.310
 when I set some of his writings to music 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.850
 I would like to come back to these festivals to present this sector which has 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.410
 a real flamenco sound even if it does not really rest on the 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.560
 all flamenco palaces and it's a real flamenco sound and I would like it 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.169
 to discover the public of Nîmes 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.169
