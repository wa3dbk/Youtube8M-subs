00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:13.390
 Osteoporosis the name comes from porous 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.750
 Bone Osteoporosis is a corner 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.450
 the millions of people 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.690
 Europe is to be prevented 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.140
 always break most bones 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.340
 Breaking are the spine 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.230
 preferably the breast and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.690
 lumbar spine in osteoporosis 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.820
 or the thigh neck at this 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.610
 chart you can once a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.370
 spine look like a normal one 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.100
 vertebrae here looks like or like one 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.340
 broken vertebrae like this one 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.300
 Wedge vertebra is marked here 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.930
 You will see that at this point 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.820
 the vertebral bodies are porous that is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.230
 so that the bones which the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.180
 so-called jump biosa is perforated 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.630
 But it is also important that the frame 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.680
 of the vertebral body at this point the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.350
 so-called compact is it is stable 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.990
 by no means so that osteoporosis only 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.090
 Women affects about one in five 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.439
 Osteoporosis patient is a man 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.970
 Patients with osteoporosis 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.770
 from different disciplines 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.490
 Treated by orthopedic trauma surgeons 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.750
 or internists specifically 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.110
 Endocrinologists dealing with hormones and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.180
 to deal with metabolic diseases 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.450
 The most common reason for osteoporosis 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.700
 the woman is the estrogen deficiency after the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.829
 alternate years 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.170
 analogous to this , a man of one 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.540
 Testosterone deficiency has a shortage 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.810
 of the male hormone too 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.150
 develop osteoporosis 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.100
 since the man but until the end of life 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.439
 his testosterone mirrors who still 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.560
 but lower here are men 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:09.509
 less of a hormone-related 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.670
 diagnosed osteoporosis affected 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.670
 the osteoporosis is caused by a 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.459
 Bone density measurement should be after 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.120
 World Health Organization recommendation 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.640
 by a so-called dx a method 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.440
 respectively 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.260
 Alternatively, a so-called q 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.020
 ct method be performed 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.170
 the radiation load at one 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.069
 Bone density measurement according to the dx method 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.879
 is very small and can be in the area 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.950
 almost neglected 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.410
 one has the suspicion of a profession or 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.200
 fracture so should one here 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.310
 Radiograph a ct or a 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.280
 magnetic resonance imaging 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.629
 in addition to the hormone deficiency-related 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.330
 osteoporosis, for example, up to the 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.430
 lack of women, there are also secondary 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.920
 forms of osteoporosis 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.989
 although they are much less common to the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.269
 but must always be thought along 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.030
 so can a disturbance of 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.670
 Parathyroid, for example, with a 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.690
 accompanying calcium 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.349
 metabolic disorder also a 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.129
 osteoporosis condition can also e 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:26.489
 mobility a bedridden or even 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:31.319
 a avoid of sunlight one 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:34.739
 Osteoporosis is caused to be treated 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.129
 the osteoporosis primarily by a 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.230
 first aid in case of breakage 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:43.080
 painkillers and then in the wake of 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.330
 prevention of a book by the gift 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.959
 of vitamin d 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:53.410
 The calcium intake in addition to the 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.170
 Application of vitamin D should only 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.450
 then take place when the food is not 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.730
 it is necessary to have enough calcium 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.400
 So not basically one 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.030
 combination of vitamin D and calcium 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.760
 be given tablet 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.060
 in addition to this basic therapy of 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.790
 Osteoporosis with vitamin D and possibly 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.790
 There is special osteoporosis calcium 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.760
 Medications were one of the first 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.370
 so-called bisphosphonates such as 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.270
 example, all threaten acid or in the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.889
 Follow solid acid of these medications 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.130
 can be in tablet form daily 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:36.180
 weekly as a month's infusion or 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.250
 even be given as a year infusion 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.030
 new ones have come in recent years 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.880
 Medicines add so-called antibodies 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.070
 which in the bone metabolism very much 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:54.210
 can specifically intervene and the 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.210
 strengthen bone structure 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.419
 one of these to 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:04.080
 is for example denosumab this 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:06.210
 drug every six months as 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.660
 inject an insulin or heparin 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.199
 injected 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:16.550
 So you can see that the therapy 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:21.440
 the osteoporosis is very diverse and 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:24.500
 that they cause the patients 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.539
 should be treated individually 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.060
 this is something to think about, for example 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:33.000
 in a man of a testosterone deficiency 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.720
 this may also be too 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.750
 replace or substitute or at 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.030
 patients undergoing cortisone therapy 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.479
 get here too the possibility 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.250
 to think of an osteoporosis and the 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.800
 dose only as low as possible 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.389
 choose 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.509
 there are also genetic causes of 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:57.990
 osteoporosis or osteoporosis of the 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:00.900
 These children must all together 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.780
 with pediatricians orthopedists and 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.380
 Endocrinologists cared for and recognized 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.380
 be treated
