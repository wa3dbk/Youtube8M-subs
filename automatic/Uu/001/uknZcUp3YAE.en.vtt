dividing it up our magic making it
organized<00:01:17.600> so<00:01:18.600> let's<00:01:19.259> start<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.950> have

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
organized so let's start here we have

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.030 
organized so let's start here we have
all<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> wall<00:01:20.520> all<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.630> possible<00:01:22.259> colors<00:01:22.830> of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
all the wall all the possible colors of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.700 
all the wall all the possible colors of
little<00:01:23.310> gradients<00:01:23.880> coming<00:01:24.180> over<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.810> got

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
little gradients coming over here I got

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.899 
little gradients coming over here I got
a<00:01:25.740> little<00:01:25.860> sign<00:01:26.159> here<00:01:26.310> saying<00:01:26.580> welcome<00:01:26.790> to

every<00:01:27.240> blog<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:28.170> next<00:01:28.409> part<00:01:28.619> here<00:01:28.920> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
every blog this next part here is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.700 
every blog this next part here is
basically<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.820> surface<00:01:30.270> world<00:01:30.630> or<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
basically the surface world or the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.620 
basically the surface world or the
outside<00:01:32.189> area<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:32.970> we've<00:01:33.150> got<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> trees

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
outside area so here we've got the trees

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.240 
outside area so here we've got the trees
is<00:01:33.869> pretty<00:01:34.079> different<00:01:34.320> woods<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> lead

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
is pretty different woods in the lead

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.969 
is pretty different woods in the lead
then<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> dirt<00:01:36.659> block<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.380> snow<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.770> top

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
then this is a dirt block or snow on top

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.149 
then this is a dirt block or snow on top
and<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.850> course<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> whole<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:40.159> guess

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and of course the whole I guess

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.219 
and of course the whole I guess
surrounding<00:01:41.310> area<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.030> actually<00:01:42.630> made<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.170> of

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
surrounding area is actually made up of

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.609 
surrounding area is actually made up of
snow<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.810> got<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> grass<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.500> got

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
snow and then you got the grass you got

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.370 
snow and then you got the grass you got
tall<00:01:46.860> grass<00:01:46.890> flowers<00:01:47.430> etc<00:01:47.909> because<00:01:48.509> pumpkin

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
tall grass flowers etc because pumpkin

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.889 
tall grass flowers etc because pumpkin
and<00:01:49.649> then<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.729> also<00:01:50.850> got<00:01:51.090> jack<00:01:51.390> o<00:01:51.420> lanterns

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and then you also got jack o lanterns

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.429 
and then you also got jack o lanterns
which<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.710> little<00:01:53.009> buddy<00:01:53.340> right<00:01:53.610> okay
