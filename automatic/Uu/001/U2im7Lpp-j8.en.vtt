welcome to Krim safe talking tech I'm
here<00:00:25.869> in<00:00:25.990> Harrison<00:00:26.380> from<00:00:26.619> triple-a<00:00:27.009> tracing

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
here in Harrison from triple-a tracing

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:37.139 
here in Harrison from triple-a tracing
and<00:00:27.669> this<00:00:27.909> is<00:00:28.089> a<00:00:28.119> British<00:00:28.900> Touring<00:00:29.349> Car<00:00:36.149> well

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
and this is a British Touring Car well

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.119 
and this is a British Touring Car well
the<00:00:37.210> whole<00:00:37.329> idea<00:00:37.420> of<00:00:37.690> NGTC<00:00:38.260> was<00:00:38.649> to<00:00:38.800> keep<00:00:38.949> the

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
the whole idea of NGTC was to keep the

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.740 
the whole idea of NGTC was to keep the
costs<00:00:39.430> under<00:00:39.579> control<00:00:39.670> basically<00:00:40.390> we<00:00:40.629> were

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
costs under control basically we were

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.580 
costs under control basically we were
running<00:00:41.109> FIA<00:00:41.940> s2000<00:00:42.940> cars<00:00:43.149> up<00:00:43.960> until<00:00:44.320> their

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
running FIA s2000 cars up until their

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.900 
running FIA s2000 cars up until their
four<00:00:44.829> years<00:00:45.039> ago<00:00:45.300> now<00:00:46.300> we've<00:00:46.510> got<00:00:47.429> NGTC<00:00:48.429> which

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
four years ago now we've got NGTC which

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.459 
four years ago now we've got NGTC which
is<00:00:49.090> next<00:00:49.329> generation<00:00:49.780> touring<00:00:50.079> car<00:00:50.260> which<00:00:50.350> is

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
is next generation touring car which is

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.680 
is next generation touring car which is
a<00:00:50.500> bit<00:00:50.679> out<00:00:50.829> of<00:00:50.859> date<00:00:51.010> now<00:00:51.390> there<00:00:52.390> should<00:00:52.570> be

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
a bit out of date now there should be

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.020 
a bit out of date now there should be
just<00:00:52.870> called<00:00:53.170> this<00:00:53.769> generation<00:00:54.429> Tirico<00:00:54.879> or

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
just called this generation Tirico or

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.619 
just called this generation Tirico or
something<00:00:55.300> but<00:00:55.480> we've<00:00:56.140> got<00:00:56.320> 30<00:00:56.949> Kart<00:00:57.280> grid

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
something but we've got 30 Kart grid

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.910 
something but we've got 30 Kart grid
what<00:00:58.629> it<00:00:58.749> means<00:00:58.929> is<00:00:59.109> there's<00:00:59.289> a<00:00:59.350> lot<00:00:59.499> of<00:00:59.620> common

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
what it means is there's a lot of common

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.009 
what it means is there's a lot of common
parts<00:01:00.249> on<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.519> car<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:01.510> cars<00:01:01.749> are<00:01:01.929> basically

parts on the car the cars are basically

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.149 
parts on the car the cars are basically
a<00:01:02.589> 2-liter<00:01:03.429> turbo<00:01:03.910> producing<00:01:04.900> about<00:01:05.159> 380

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.500 

now<00:01:27.380> after<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:27.710> cars<00:01:27.950> are<00:01:28.100> built<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.940> running

now after the cars are built the running
costs<00:01:29.750> for<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.960> cars<00:01:30.170> are<00:01:30.380> quite<00:01:30.470> cheap<00:01:30.940> which

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
costs for the cars are quite cheap which

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.969 
costs for the cars are quite cheap which
has<00:01:32.090> given<00:01:32.360> us<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.840> opportunity<00:01:32.869> that<00:01:33.560> have<00:01:33.710> a

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
has given us the opportunity that have a

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.460 
has given us the opportunity that have a
full<00:01:34.460> grid<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.540> people<00:01:35.960> waiting<00:01:36.140> in<00:01:36.350> the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
full grid and people waiting in the

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.600 
full grid and people waiting in the
background<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:37.100> actually<00:01:37.400> join<00:01:37.580> the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
background to actually join the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.420 
background to actually join the
championship<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:38.619> while<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.830> principle<00:01:40.340> of

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
championship so while the principle of

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.490 
championship so while the principle of
v8<00:01:40.759> supercars<00:01:41.330> is<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.659> same<00:01:41.869> in<00:01:42.080> terms<00:01:42.229> of

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
v8 supercars is the same in terms of

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.590 
v8 supercars is the same in terms of
commonality<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.220> parts<00:01:43.640> we've<00:01:44.180> gone<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.390> lot

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
commonality of parts we've gone a lot

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.370 
commonality of parts we've gone a lot
further<00:01:44.659> than<00:01:45.290> than<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.369> v8<00:01:46.610> supercar<00:01:47.090> has

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.219 

at<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> moment<00:01:53.460> we've<00:01:53.700> got<00:01:54.360> half<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.630> greed<00:01:55.080> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
at the moment we've got half the greed I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.710 
at the moment we've got half the greed I
guess<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:56.220> NGTC<00:01:56.790> engine<00:01:57.330> which<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
guess on an NGTC engine which is the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.719 
guess on an NGTC engine which is the
toker<00:01:58.080> engine<00:01:58.439> which<00:01:59.220> is<00:01:59.250> based<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.670> a

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
toker engine which is based on a

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.420 
toker engine which is based on a
two-liter<00:02:00.180> GM<00:02:01.250> engine<00:02:02.250> which<00:02:02.400> is

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
two-liter GM engine which is

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.480 
two-liter GM engine which is
turbocharged<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.450> 2-liter<00:02:03.869> its<00:02:04.710> 2-liter<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
turbocharged it's 2-liter its 2-liter to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.419 
turbocharged it's 2-liter its 2-liter to
give<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.759> stability<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.960> longevity<00:02:07.280> we<00:02:08.280> can

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
give it stability and longevity we can

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.910 
give it stability and longevity we can
do<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> whole<00:02:08.729> season<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.420> no<00:02:09.869> rebuilds<00:02:10.440> nor

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
do the whole season with no rebuilds nor

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.170 
do the whole season with no rebuilds nor
with<00:02:11.160> one<00:02:11.430> refresh<00:02:12.390> midseason<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:14.819> costs

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
with one refresh midseason and the costs

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.520 
with one refresh midseason and the costs
for<00:02:15.330> doing<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.930> know<00:02:16.290> you're<00:02:16.440> looking

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
for doing that you know you're looking

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.490 
for doing that you know you're looking
at<00:02:16.800> fifty<00:02:17.489> thousand<00:02:17.880> dollars<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.420> year

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
at fifty thousand dollars for the year

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.199 
at fifty thousand dollars for the year
per<00:02:19.500> car<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:20.130> it's<00:02:20.610> really<00:02:20.819> cost-effective

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
per car so it's really cost-effective

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.059 
per car so it's really cost-effective
thing<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:22.020> something<00:02:22.200> that's<00:02:22.530> chucking<00:02:22.950> out

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
thing for something that's chucking out

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.030 
thing for something that's chucking out
nearly<00:02:23.340> 380<00:02:24.060> horsepower<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.800> half<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
nearly 380 horsepower so half the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.800 
nearly 380 horsepower so half the
Greater<00:02:26.340> run<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.790> engine<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.690> other

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
Greater run in that engine and the other

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.420 
Greater run in that engine and the other
half<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.260> grid<00:02:28.470> use<00:02:28.650> their<00:02:28.860> own<00:02:28.980> version

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
half of the grid use their own version

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.580 
half of the grid use their own version
of<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.120> if<00:02:30.390> you've<00:02:30.510> got<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.660> BMW<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.410> run<00:02:31.560> a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
of that so if you've got a BMW you run a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.940 
of that so if you've got a BMW you run a
BMW<00:02:32.130> engine<00:02:32.459> or<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.900> Volkswagen<00:02:34.680> has<00:02:34.769> got<00:02:34.920> a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
BMW engine or a Volkswagen has got a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.370 
BMW engine or a Volkswagen has got a
Volkswagen<00:02:35.310> engine<00:02:35.970> or<00:02:36.060> whatever<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:37.050> people

Volkswagen engine or whatever so people

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.660 
Volkswagen engine or whatever so people
are<00:02:37.470> allowed<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.769> do<00:02:37.920> their<00:02:38.100> own<00:02:38.130> but<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:38.550> on

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
are allowed to do their own but it's on

the<00:02:38.760> 2-liter<00:02:38.970> concept<00:02:40.220> parity<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.550> really

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the 2-liter concept parity is really

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.940 
the 2-liter concept parity is really
well<00:02:42.630> done<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> say<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:43.650> one<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.890> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
well done I have to say it's one of the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.670 
well done I have to say it's one of the
best<00:02:44.130> things<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.700> we've<00:02:44.850> ever<00:02:44.970> done<00:02:45.680> and

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
best things that we've ever done and

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.090 
best things that we've ever done and
we've<00:02:46.860> got<00:02:47.100> really<00:02:47.310> good<00:02:47.400> common<00:02:49.100> performance

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
we've got really good common performance

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.770 
we've got really good common performance
if<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.310> like<00:02:50.580> everybody's<00:02:51.450> balanced

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
if you like everybody's balanced

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.559 
if you like everybody's balanced
performance<00:02:52.410> over<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.890> field<00:02:53.549> means<00:02:54.239> that

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.680 

now<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.340> biggest<00:03:07.580> problem<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:08.210> to<00:03:08.420> try<00:03:08.450> and

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
now the biggest problem is to try and

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.140 
now the biggest problem is to try and
limit<00:03:09.080> Lymon<00:03:09.560> 8<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.800> dragon<00:03:10.250> tracks<00:03:11.000> the

limit Lymon 8 the dragon tracks the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.430 
limit Lymon 8 the dragon tracks the
biggest<00:03:11.480> issue

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
biggest issue

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.860 
biggest issue
unlike<00:03:13.190> v8<00:03:13.520> supercars<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.330> know<00:03:14.480> we're<00:03:14.690> not

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
unlike v8 supercars you know we're not

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.590 
unlike v8 supercars you know we're not
running<00:03:15.110> with<00:03:15.440> their<00:03:15.740> big<00:03:15.980> downforce<00:03:16.550> and<00:03:16.880> big

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
running with their big downforce and big

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.650 
running with their big downforce and big
arrow<00:03:18.820> kicks<00:03:19.820> on<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.150> cars

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
arrow kicks on the cars

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.720 
arrow kicks on the cars
mainly<00:03:21.020> because<00:03:21.140> we<00:03:21.320> don't<00:03:21.500> want<00:03:21.740> them<00:03:21.920> there

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
mainly because we don't want them there

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.490 
mainly because we don't want them there
the<00:03:22.820> cars<00:03:23.060> raced<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.510> lot<00:03:23.570> better<00:03:23.930> if<00:03:24.320> they

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
the cars raced a lot better if they

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.670 
the cars raced a lot better if they
haven't<00:03:24.740> got<00:03:24.890> arrow<00:03:25.900> as<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.959> consequence<00:03:27.500> of

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
haven't got arrow as a consequence of

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.070 
haven't got arrow as a consequence of
that<00:03:27.800> you<00:03:28.400> know<00:03:28.520> the<00:03:28.640> v8<00:03:28.850> supercars<00:03:29.390> is<00:03:29.600> as<00:03:30.050> a

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
that you know the v8 supercars is as a

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.380 
that you know the v8 supercars is as a
as<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.740> vehicle<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.340> very<00:03:31.610> spectacular

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
as a vehicle a very spectacular

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.740 
as a vehicle a very spectacular
you<00:03:33.140> know<00:03:33.260> ours<00:03:33.470> as<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:33.890> field<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.610> think<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.600> more

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
you know ours as a field I think a more

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.630 
you know ours as a field I think a more
spectacularly<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.620> racing<00:03:37.040> is<00:03:37.220> actually

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
spectacularly the racing is actually

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.290 
spectacularly the racing is actually
better<00:03:37.850> than<00:03:38.230> in<00:03:39.230> most<00:03:39.550> circuit<00:03:40.550> based

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
better than in most circuit based

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.170 
better than in most circuit based
Touring<00:03:42.110> Car<00:03:42.290> championships<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:43.910> lot<00:03:44.060> of

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
Touring Car championships and a lot of

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.610 
Touring Car championships and a lot of
that's<00:03:44.300> got<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.600> do<00:03:44.750> with<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.080> the<00:03:45.110> cars<00:03:45.470> are

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
that's got to do with the the cars are

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.220 
that's got to do with the the cars are
quite<00:03:45.770> simple<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.090> cars<00:03:47.330> are<00:03:47.480> low

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
quite simple and the cars are low

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.370 
quite simple and the cars are low
downforce<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:49.489> close<00:03:49.910> racing<00:03:50.330> is<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.600> nature<00:03:51.320> of

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
downforce so close racing is a nature of

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.220 
downforce so close racing is a nature of
the<00:03:51.500> game<00:03:51.650> really

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.949 

I<00:03:56.670> think<00:03:57.670> going<00:03:57.819> forward<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.420> biggest<00:03:58.720> thing

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
I think going forward the biggest thing

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.559 
I think going forward the biggest thing
will<00:03:59.170> be<00:03:59.349> for<00:03:59.909> we<00:04:00.909> may<00:04:01.060> come<00:04:01.330> under<00:04:01.450> pressure

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
will be for we may come under pressure

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.320 
will be for we may come under pressure
from<00:04:02.019> various<00:04:02.470> manufacturers<00:04:03.129> I<00:04:03.340> guess<00:04:03.549> to

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
from various manufacturers I guess to

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.479 
from various manufacturers I guess to
run<00:04:04.510> something<00:04:04.959> it's<00:04:05.080> smaller<00:04:05.440> like<00:04:05.799> a<00:04:05.830> 1.6

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
run something it's smaller like a 1.6

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.320 
run something it's smaller like a 1.6
liter<00:04:06.790> engine<00:04:06.989> for<00:04:07.989> 1.5<00:04:08.879> but<00:04:09.879> we'll<00:04:10.030> try<00:04:10.209> and

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
liter engine for 1.5 but we'll try and

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.900 
liter engine for 1.5 but we'll try and
resist<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.780> think<00:04:11.019> because<00:04:11.910> stability

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
resist that I think because stability

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.630 
resist that I think because stability
herbs<00:04:13.120> or<00:04:13.390> reliability<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:15.400> cost

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
herbs or reliability and cost

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.979 
herbs or reliability and cost
effectiveness<00:04:16.180> is<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.449> key<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:16.900> the

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
effectiveness is the key to the

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.539 
effectiveness is the key to the
championship<00:04:20.010> we<00:04:21.010> used<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.280> have<00:04:21.400> eight

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
championship we used to have eight

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.620 
championship we used to have eight
engineers<00:04:22.120> now<00:04:22.389> we<00:04:22.570> have<00:04:22.720> two<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:25.060> they<00:04:25.570> do

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
engineers now we have two and they do

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.879 
engineers now we have two and they do
different<00:04:25.960> jobs<00:04:26.199> they're<00:04:26.620> not<00:04:26.650> did

different jobs they're not did

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
next door in the next team so you

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.840 
next door in the next team so you
haven't<00:04:32.080> got<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.199> load<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.440> people<00:04:32.889> spending<00:04:33.580> a

haven't got a load of people spending a

haven't got a load of people spending a

load of money trying to develop the same
part<00:04:37.050> and<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.139> think<00:04:38.289> everybody<00:04:38.650> realizes<00:04:39.220> that

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
part and I think everybody realizes that

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.330 
part and I think everybody realizes that
you<00:04:39.669> know<00:04:40.600> in<00:04:40.720> this<00:04:40.810> day<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.169> age<00:04:41.260> it's<00:04:42.220> all

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
you know in this day and age it's all

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.310
