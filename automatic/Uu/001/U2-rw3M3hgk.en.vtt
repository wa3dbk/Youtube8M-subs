00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.210
First there was pencil and paper.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.980
Then came the lines, arcs, and circles of
CAD which transformed labor-intensive drafting

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.230
into efficient
electronic documentation.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.670
And then CAD went 3D

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.360
and now it's all about BIM.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.690
What is BIM?

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.320
BIM is an intelligent model-based process
for planning, designing, building, and managing

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.480
buildings
and infrastructure

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.530
BIM creates more than just digital 2D or 3D
models.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.200
BIM models use objects that have intelligence:
geometry and data.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.220
If a model element is changed, BIM software
coordinates the change in all views that display

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.560
that element, because they are all views
of the same underlying information.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.100
Architects, structural engineers, contractors
can work more collaboratively accessing and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.190
updating the design, and the information is
captured in the model and remains consistent

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.290
and coordinated

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.620
But what makes BIM really exciting is what
you can DO with all that information in the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.620
model.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.420
The power of BIM lies in the information.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.430
At any point in the lifecycle of the project,
the information is there, accurate to help

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.740
reduce time consuming errors and rework; accessible
from virtually anywhere at anytime by all

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.290
the project stakeholders; and actionable to
help inform your decision making with simulation

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.940
and analysis

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.410
BIM helps everyone working on a project to
coordinate and communicate seamlessly

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.140
With all project team members working on the
same building information model, knowledge

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.860
transfer is streamlined.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.280
This leads to improved accuracy and reduced
rework.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.020
BIM helps to convey design intent from the
office to the field, reducing change orders

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.729
and field coordination problems.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.390
BIM solutions from Autodesk form a comprehensive
portfolio of tools that help you capture more

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.369
value for every phase of your work
