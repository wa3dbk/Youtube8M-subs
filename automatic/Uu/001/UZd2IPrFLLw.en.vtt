00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.160 
hands a bit longer in front than most
people<00:01:04.549> do<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.390> you<00:01:05.449> want<00:01:05.659> to<00:01:05.720> leave<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.960> hand

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
people do so you want to leave the hand

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.380 
people do so you want to leave the hand
in<00:01:06.320> front<00:01:06.560> until<00:01:06.979> just<00:01:07.280> before<00:01:07.430> this<00:01:07.790> one<00:01:08.030> hits

the<00:01:08.540> water<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:09.020> then<00:01:09.650> catch<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.850> that<00:01:11.000> you're

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
the water and then catch so that you're

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.149 
the water and then catch so that you're
not<00:01:11.150> catching<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:12.020> doing<00:01:12.320> windmills<00:01:12.799> because

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
not catching and doing windmills because

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.160 
not catching and doing windmills because
you'll<00:01:13.280> lose<00:01:13.490> all<00:01:13.670> your<00:01:13.729> momentum<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:14.960> if<00:01:15.050> you

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
you'll lose all your momentum so if you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.710 
you'll lose all your momentum so if you
can<00:01:15.320> practice<00:01:15.800> doing<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.280> like<00:01:16.580> a<00:01:16.610> catch<00:01:16.940> up<00:01:17.210> or

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
can practice doing a like a catch up or

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.600 
can practice doing a like a catch up or
you<00:01:17.870> leave<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.200> hand<00:01:18.440> in<00:01:18.560> front<00:01:18.800> you'll<00:01:19.370> find

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
you leave the hand in front you'll find

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.800 
you leave the hand in front you'll find

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
rhythm I talked about technique in our

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.990 
rhythm I talked about technique in our
other<00:01:23.720> tip<00:01:24.050> having<00:01:24.800> relaxed<00:01:25.220> recovery<00:01:25.790> and

bending the wrist and elbow to catch the
other<00:01:28.760> important<00:01:29.270> thing<00:01:29.300> is<00:01:29.570> being

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
other important thing is being

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.350 
other important thing is being
streamlined<00:01:30.310> keeping<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.400> body<00:01:31.580> strong<00:01:32.120> and
