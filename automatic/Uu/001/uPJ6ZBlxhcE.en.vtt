00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the sense three days but I still find

the sense three days but I still find
that<00:00:34.260> even<00:00:34.559> though<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.770> relatively

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that even though it's relatively

things<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.010> find<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.370> when<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.579> go

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
things like that I find that when I go

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.850 
things like that I find that when I go
into<00:00:38.910> detailed<00:00:39.390> areas<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:40.410> see<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> little

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
into detailed areas I just see a little

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.860 
into detailed areas I just see a little
bit<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.100> lag<00:00:41.700> much<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.210> right<00:00:42.420> there<00:00:42.629> how<00:00:42.840> I

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
bit of lag much like right there how I

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.360 
bit of lag much like right there how I
took<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.290> second<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.680> go<00:00:43.860> into<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> settings

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
took a second to go into the settings

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.369 
took a second to go into the settings
now<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:45.149> may<00:00:45.300> not<00:00:45.329> seem<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.750> much<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.260> when

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
now that may not seem like much but when

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.750 
now that may not seem like much but when
you<00:00:46.440> consider<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> fact<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.370> phone<00:00:47.610> is

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
you consider the fact that this phone is

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.029 
you consider the fact that this phone is
powered<00:00:47.969> by<00:00:48.149> quad-core<00:00:48.800> 1.7<00:00:49.800> gigahertz

NVIDIA Tegra 3 cpu you can see that that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
gets a little bit old and even though

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.959 
gets a little bit old and even though
HTC<00:00:55.379> said<00:00:55.710> they<00:00:55.860> paired<00:00:56.250> back<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.699> some<00:00:56.940> of
