would no we've come out with our own

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.450 
would no we've come out with our own
range<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.690> rods<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:07.379> how<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.010> sort<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.280> came

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
range of rods so how it sort of came

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.730 
range of rods so how it sort of came
about<00:00:08.610> standardly<00:00:09.510> on<00:00:09.599> Facebook<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:10.260> also<00:00:10.380> all

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
rods all of a sudden a few months later

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.250 
rods all of a sudden a few months later
we've<00:00:17.640> got<00:00:17.820> our<00:00:17.910> own<00:00:18.029> range<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.359> rods<00:00:18.539> out<00:00:18.690> now

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
we've got our own range of rods out now

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.200 
we've got our own range of rods out now
it's<00:00:19.680> been<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> while<00:00:20.100> since<00:00:20.369> then<00:00:20.640> till<00:00:20.970> now

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
photographing on the store and had a bit

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960 
photographing on the store and had a bit
of<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.230> play<00:00:25.439> with<00:00:25.619> him<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:25.949> that's<00:00:26.609> what<00:00:26.849> we're

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
of a play with him so that's what we're

of a play with him so that's what we're
coming<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> use<00:00:27.390> today<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:27.660> we've<00:00:27.900> finally<00:00:28.199> got

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
coming to use today so we've finally got

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.160 
coming to use today so we've finally got
them<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.619> front<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.010> place<00:00:29.189> right<00:00:29.490> now<00:00:30.170> first

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
them in front of a place right now first

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.690 
them in front of a place right now first
one<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> wave<00:00:31.800> flick<00:00:32.009> brembo<00:00:32.399> now

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
one is the wave flick brembo now

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.580 
one is the wave flick brembo now
obviously<00:00:33.210> hence<00:00:33.510> by<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.780> name<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> brim

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
obviously hence by the name is a brim

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.260 
obviously hence by the name is a brim
designed<00:00:35.040> rod<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.790> also<00:00:35.910> wanted

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
designed rod but we also wanted

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.100 
designed rod but we also wanted
something<00:00:36.329> that's<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.960> able<00:00:37.020> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
something that's going to be able to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.840 
something that's going to be able to
tackle<00:00:37.320> all<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> other<00:00:37.829> s3<00:00:38.160> species<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.700> it's

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
tackle all the other s3 species so it's

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.880 
tackle all the other s3 species so it's
a<00:00:38.879> great<00:00:39.090> all-rounder<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.809> few<00:00:40.649> different

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
a great all-rounder a few different

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.560 
a great all-rounder a few different
features<00:00:41.040> what<00:00:41.340> we've<00:00:41.489> used<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.969> most<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
features what we've used on most of the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.720 
features what we've used on most of the
rods<00:00:42.780> first<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> matagi<00:00:44.399> weight

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
rods first one is the matagi weight

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.790 
rods first one is the matagi weight
balancing<00:00:45.210> system<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.230> see<00:00:46.469> here

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
balancing system now you can see here

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.440 
balancing system now you can see here
there's<00:00:47.309> two<00:00:47.460> weighted<00:00:47.820> discs<00:00:48.120> right<00:00:48.270> here

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
there's two weighted discs right here

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.889 
there's two weighted discs right here
now<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.800> concept<00:00:50.309> behind<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.910> generally

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
now the concept behind it is generally

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.720 
now the concept behind it is generally
when<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.079> go<00:00:52.230> get<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> rod<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.829> reel<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.579> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
when I go get a rod and reel I like to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.700 
when I go get a rod and reel I like to
have<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:54.030> balancing<00:00:54.480> point<00:00:54.660> if<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.289> was<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> real

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
have my balancing point if it was a real

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.529 
have my balancing point if it was a real
on<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> balancing<00:00:56.610> point<00:00:56.820> where<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.449> I

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
on here a balancing point where if I

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.720 
on here a balancing point where if I
hold<00:00:57.780> my<00:00:57.870> finger<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.579> rod

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
hold my finger like this if the rod

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
hold my finger like this if the rod
won't<00:00:59.969> go<00:01:00.090> forward<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.570> back<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
won't go forward or back it's it's that

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.709 
won't go forward or back it's it's that
beautifully<00:01:01.800> balanced<00:01:02.250> now<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.180> issue<00:01:03.359> most

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
beautifully balanced now the issue most

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.539 
beautifully balanced now the issue most
the<00:01:03.870> time<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.530> put<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> 1000<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.460> you

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the time is if you put a 1000 on it you

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.370 
the time is if you put a 1000 on it you
might<00:01:05.700> find<00:01:05.729> something<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.170> put

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
might find something and it's get on put

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.990 
might find something and it's get on put
1,000<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.310> balances<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.760> right

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
1,000 on it and it balances out right

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.700 
1,000 on it and it balances out right
but<00:01:09.150> then<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.330> go<00:01:09.420> put<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> 2500<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
but then you go put a 2500 on it and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
but then you go put a 2500 on it and
it's<00:01:10.830> sort<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.010> out<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.549> balance<00:01:11.820> well<00:01:12.060> that's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's sort of out of balance well that's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.240 
it's sort of out of balance well that's
where<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> weighted<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.920> weighted

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250

know about those micro guides well I've
had<00:02:03.450> some<00:02:03.509> rods<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:03.990> micros<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.560> them<00:02:04.680> if

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
had some rods with micros on them if

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.499 
had some rods with micros on them if
they<00:02:04.950> were<00:02:05.009> actually<00:02:05.549> pinned<00:02:05.880> up<00:02:06.030> micros

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
they were actually pinned up micros

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.360 
they were actually pinned up micros
they're<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.930> small

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
they're not that small
