00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
this is probably the best way to do it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.440 
this is probably the best way to do it
so<00:01:38.250> first<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.240> all<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> grass

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.510 
so first of all you know I have a grass
bulk<00:01:42.720> here<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.799> any<00:01:43.979> block<00:01:44.220> but

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
bulk here and you can have any block but

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.399 
bulk here and you can have any block but
also<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.329> you're<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.630> survival<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.259> just

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
also if you're in survival you can just

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.420 
also if you're in survival you can just
pick<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> water<00:01:46.950> block<00:01:47.159> again

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
immediately after placing it out but you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.350 
immediately after placing it out but you
have<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.189> kind<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.430> wait<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.149> flow<00:01:51.329> out

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
have to kind of wait for it to flow out

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.090 
have to kind of wait for it to flow out
a<00:01:51.540> bit<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.079> kill<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.759> you<00:01:53.759> know<00:01:53.880> the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
water buckets now this is one thing that

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.830 
water buckets now this is one thing that
makes<00:03:08.849> everything<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.329> much<00:03:09.389> easier<00:03:09.689> when

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
makes everything so much easier when

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.440 
makes everything so much easier when
building<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.549> now<00:03:11.549> as<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.970> see<00:03:12.120> we<00:03:12.269> have<00:03:12.419> a

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
building and now as you see we have a

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.580 
building and now as you see we have a
pretty<00:03:12.810> good<00:03:13.019> flat<00:03:13.379> land<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:14.250> build<00:03:14.549> on<00:03:14.849> but

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
pretty good flat land to build on but

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.259 
pretty good flat land to build on but
yeah<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.829> this<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.549> recommend<00:03:17.909> using<00:03:18.030> this

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
yeah and this I recommend using this

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.180 
yeah and this I recommend using this
unlike<00:03:18.479> big<00:03:18.750> flat<00:03:19.079> places<00:03:19.440> like<00:03:19.739> this<00:03:19.979> one

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
unlike big flat places like this one
