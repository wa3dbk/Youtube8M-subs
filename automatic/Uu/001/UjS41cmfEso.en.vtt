00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.299
 Last year we had a separate room to view the game's rules 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.359
 Amsterdam various surfaces 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.359
 we are negotiating for the role 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.059
 to be heard last summer and winter tires 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.150
 and did you get it done 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.750
 and yes the design 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.439
 from last year it has changed slightly 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.499
 because we were quite something 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.229
 since undone 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:32.030
 respond to this 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.770
 it was very difficult for teachers at that time to determine which 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.580
 subjects they had to do to both players 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.440
 and the question what of 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.900
 Japan does in July is let them first designated 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.130
 or pictures that asia 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.020
 however, whether making is not the question at all 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.690
 therefore has a fixed format of 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.160
 show the image 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.610
 let them ask 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.330
 enschede anp 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.680
 So when we thought the boy from Almere then it was just true 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.020
 good is a pity you have to do it too 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.350
 so we again have children asking 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.010
 and can be supported on screen with written questions 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.480
 we have chosen two young people this year which we think 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.890
 that the hope is that you demand an explanation 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.540
 the need 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.550
 for instance 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.930
 the concepts carelessly scored on Saturday 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.580
 the experiences of 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.630
 on this day exactly the past and the difference between the biggest nonsense 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.550
 participate in the research 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.270
 and also have 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.760
 chosen to be transferred to third parties 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.230
 because that also sometimes an explanation and a test with referees 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.730
 what may or may not drive that anymore 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.680
 the referee 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.680
 the press present fitness test 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.890
 as a full-fledged one in which they reason following only 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.490
 and that is getting a bit of text and explanation about the rules
