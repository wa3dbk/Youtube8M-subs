00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.670
 in front of the cup Matthew has a few hours of course that does not matter 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.410
 I noticed that I turned over for a moment three now I have to say that was 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.609
 a leak festival at its finest so we really have 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:14.049
 I tried here the opponent and I the melt bidder and was anyway 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.779
 always ten minutes behind so I've had to keep clicking everything constantly 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.099
 something happened here 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.149
 my watch has counted as never before i thought i was really cool 

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:25.689
 to heart attack i thought so if i am now loser due to timeout it 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.800
 can not be true then partly folded boxes so partially 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.119
 Djibouti Müller EM im 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.370
 the first round there was not much going on his opponent had 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.330
 he has hardly defended himself he has few in Vienna 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.350
 percentage of things played out but so in a game was good on the case 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.780
 So there was nothing going on and around 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.970
 in the other games I do not even know it's windy in 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.940
 Eick remembered that no longer in a lake me fire what 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.380
 I am interesting, however 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.340
 The theater man had almost only rain in Vienna 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.480
 seen botanically 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.019
 he has a cool first 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.899
 if the assortment of second division 1 3 then already cost I'm one again 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.820
 get some light one day you can the deity off-roader is then 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.740
 something created that I could still slow him down 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.590
 Above all, that does not let Sainz make the order of God again 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.030
 therefore had to be brought in five lives after that he had directly dropped off Curse 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.030
 of dance 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.590
 but the five lemgo who did not make the ranks here either way 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.590
 but the mike we manage to make things run even harder 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.520
 and then but in the 2 the belt he luckily did not show up there was one 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.369
 Place where I had that steel Zischler he had in Petersdorf and that was all 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.330
 White 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.760
 which, of course, pulled me off for a cool tour 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.250
 all were green and white 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.630
 and then 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.750
 but for the first time he has a blue Macs Hockey League 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.200
 However, that is very good, I want to prove that Foht should be the plus 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.480
 is unpacked 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.020
 maybe still would have 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.540
 with the glamor scene out 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.740
 instead of service, however, only God listens to his misfortune that worries shift 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.590
 should 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.500
 and that meant to Colin if he still go percent God Head of Voice 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.090
 refilled now but he had only four islands I wanted to push and me 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.840
 I thought I'm just doing the removal he does not have the Goethe there yet 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.340
 drawn and in the three is still not quite out of their minds 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.670
 I drove over it happily all over because just no time Peters 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.609
 has put down 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.280
 At some point you can do something and also had 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.259
 Vice President already laid three 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:17.799
 and again he also can put on the belt we also nothing happened 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.689
 a job but then still off 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:24.529
 with a 2 2 and 3 3 again, the Mannheimers want 1 1 and 2 2 1 to be 1 1 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.339
 then guilty again I had the height of the victory 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.679
 the one to that of course he exchanged good on this button and l 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.919
 I had purpose processes I had a lot of brewing on the Connichi 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:34.649
 do 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:38.149
 in the final then I do not know if they had seen everything 8 4 the 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:40.560
 Splits possibilities official flash 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.030
 are no longer implemented that means the finale will have to be on everyone 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.979
 Play case 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:48.659
 that is center Antar still reasonably compensated the winner gets everyone 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.260
 contribution 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.790
 I tried to sell it but can give more for a ticket four times 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.299
 At the beginning there were a few tickets left 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.299
 so far nothing more value so really not the speech value 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:01.039
 So you have to play it off 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:05.589
 Of course you can try to do so young boy suddenly comes dragging one 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:07.960
 Concise brother and son Erich I already have 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.019
 I have already thought if the opponent does not run out that not on it 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.329
 Platter v did not speak at all I've heard he's all Sotomo 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.339
 Rothenfluh so small and so 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:20.599
 He learned that if Johnson had, he would make him a ratzfatz 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.989
 after perfect coup meters fifth one expanded during the game 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.200
 with me always good thanks has not shown so often in which a scanner even 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.449
 have not spent past Wasserburg 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.349
 another two sheets of Marca Mentor 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.369
 and I looked at it with a banquet and I just could not 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:35.580
 the bases vl 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.489
 he had the creatures a wall from what should Cretu I could not do anything 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.449
 and then at some point what did he play? 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:46.709
 is the marriage end Hunts also for the guys were is also his sleeve too 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.140
 his dead man track 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.000
 And that's never quite festive with stairs because you're just in front of the gate 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.189
 and almost two tons on labor income 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.119
 and there was just an end 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:58.239
 but to that extent 2 luckily the manager had not had him over 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:02.909
 he had i know it so exactly what he did say he had 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:03.939
 in your 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.709
 More about requests for mine that may be in the only gene 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.039
 he definitely did not have that much i do not know for sure 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:14.219
 he solves he was the change works but on the contrary Aquarius 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.819
 had spectacular m 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.699
 he had definitely played in the beginning or not so much 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.229
 so quickly under pressure 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.110
 but then still in part 4 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.509
 the percent 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.509
 For this reason Marburg was like the whole year 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.340
 but that's not just where it gets no idea 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.320
 and then he's got a percent then a fifth super on top of that I might come 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.710
 ten times a present I luckily had already counted on him what that had 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.680
 on the bike then turned off immediately 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.590
 there you can not do so much anymore 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.499
 At some point he will have it 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:45.529
 but let out sound 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:49.159
 fascinating i thought and i have all the way to the crossbar are his composure 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.539
 had it brought me only once and Peter Weck had been dead so had mine 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.449
 If you want to pick up the whole word you have a bit of it, Haxter goes after that, too 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.389
 he complained about the noise of the depth he wanted the sky market 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:00.090
 oil 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.340
 how to say exactly if a marketed two on mine 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.180
 you good on my Tönis 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.449
 That's why I still had it was cheap because had three countries had 8 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.979
 he has just been five to one had pulled the Rhine 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.069
 but he was not bad he was suffering and I still had the handful of me 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.150
 had still five drops Topic and quite play 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.089
 but it has been filed in the meantime 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:19.520
 June 9 percent 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.999
 Skibbe me up to 8 percent 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:25.069
 the taillights still tightened it fit exactly and then as i8 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.159
 Show apartment even the avatar 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.159
 so i can have been satisfied with the index 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.129
 Of course I would like 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.699
 Unfortunately, Singulus did not play it 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.089
 did not leave so much to conclude 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:39.589
 instead, still 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.989
 the white Greutert Modern Start Trading had tots and of course I would 

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:45.120
 gladly had a little more Thurks 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.230
 but down to one it just went well anyway i think that 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.830
 two purposes process was four cases, he gives the nine so far really good 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.349
 and I smell a rat 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.879
 no players or come along impresses the Sharks suffers was glad that good 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.439
 Boxer has to win over the nothing meanwhile in the tubes but with 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:04.839
 Percent a bit of luck in any case build otherwise I should say 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:05.950
 great example 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.919
 Sun succeeded, but I say goodbye today 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.930
 Next week, Gasser will be reading from her again 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.409
 Actual what to hear instead 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.659
 but in the water his with her also not exactly 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.619
 if he always has suggestions because so in the comments I think 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:21.789
 Of course, what are you thinking about? 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.460
 Rewe mistakes percent rely on him and percent of the world on him 7 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.389
 not only because it was so clear before I said that 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:29.960
 format 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.790
 is now finally bled is not bad 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.510
 Well, every pond is already coming back Gradually a few weeks, that's it 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.509
 again thrillers 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:39.860
 Of course there I am back and then there's almost always 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.000
 in the area Euler and which then also wanted to be really important because 

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:44.839
 every year on the enamel one 

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:47.999
 to be played in the middle with this day but of course a solo concert 

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.580
 also 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.379
 and around DarkOrbit a clasp Sacher I'm curious about Conviction Sell 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:53.159
 give 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:55.839
 what should we see there? 

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:59.389
 it remains to be seen I say goodbye to you guys we'll see you then 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:02.039
 a lot of fun and financial system but to hear 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:02.749
 until next week
