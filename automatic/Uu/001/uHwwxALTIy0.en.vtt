00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
be getting ahead of ourselves a little

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.590 
be getting ahead of ourselves a little
bit<00:00:35.190> though<00:00:35.430> talking<00:00:35.910> about<00:00:36.120> how<00:00:36.239> great<00:00:36.420> they

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
bit though talking about how great they

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.900 
bit though talking about how great they
are<00:00:36.630> some<00:00:37.559> people<00:00:37.800> might<00:00:37.920> want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> know<00:00:38.190> why

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
are some people might want to know why

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.340 
are some people might want to know why
they<00:00:39.360> should<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.629> an<00:00:39.719> amp<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:39.989> their<00:00:40.079> car<00:00:40.230> in

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
they should have an amp in their car in

the<00:01:12.869> volume<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.380> too<00:01:13.590> far<00:01:13.860> yeah<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.400> you've<00:01:14.580> got

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the volume up too far yeah if you've got

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.820 
the volume up too far yeah if you've got
an<00:01:14.909> amp<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.270> got<00:01:15.390> power<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> control<00:01:16.470> you're

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
an amp it's got power and control you're

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.249 
an amp it's got power and control you're
gonna<00:01:16.920> work<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.520> speaker<00:01:18.060> properly<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.840> get

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
you can you can hear that detail not

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.359 
you can you can hear that detail not
only<00:01:23.909> at<00:01:24.030> loud<00:01:24.330> volumes<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.530> even<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.040> quiet

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
only at loud volumes but even at quiet

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.010 
only at loud volumes but even at quiet
passages<00:01:27.000> you'll<00:01:27.180> hear<00:01:27.390> more<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.689> your<00:01:27.900> music

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
passages you'll hear more of your music

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.990 
passages you'll hear more of your music
yeah<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.829> listen<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.280> classical<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
yeah I like to listen to classical and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.370 
yeah I like to listen to classical and
it's<00:01:30.119> important<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> detail<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it's important to get the detail and the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.859 
it's important to get the detail and the
quiet<00:01:31.650> passages<00:01:32.220> plus<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> loud<00:01:33.329> stuff<00:01:33.689> that

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
quiet passages plus the loud stuff that

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.260 
quiet passages plus the loud stuff that
I<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.320> absolutely<00:01:34.950> yeah<00:01:35.729> these<00:01:36.030> V

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.390 
I like it's absolutely yeah these V
power<00:01:36.479> amps<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> lot<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> features<00:01:38.159> built

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
power amps have a lot of features built

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.039 
power amps have a lot of features built
in<00:01:38.520> too<00:01:38.700> don't<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.540> example<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
in too don't they for example the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.450 
in too don't they for example the
variable<00:01:40.439> high-pass<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.100> low-pass

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
variable high-pass and low-pass

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.179 
variable high-pass and low-pass
crossover<00:01:41.960> allows<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.409> dial<00:01:43.829> in

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
crossover allows you to really dial in

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.039 
crossover allows you to really dial in
with<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> knob<00:01:44.790> exactly<00:01:45.600> where<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.869> want

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
with a knob exactly where you want

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.170 
with a knob exactly where you want
across<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.500> amplifier<00:01:46.950> over<00:01:47.130> yeah<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:48.090> other

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
across the amplifier over yeah in other

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.609 
across the amplifier over yeah in other
words<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.540> high<00:01:48.750> frequencies<00:01:49.170> go<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> small

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
words the high frequencies go the small

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.530 
words the high frequencies go the small
speakers<00:01:50.009> hey<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.549> low<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.880> go<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.299> low

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
speakers hey the low is go to the low

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.710 
speakers hey the low is go to the low
the<00:01:51.780> big<00:01:51.899> speakers<00:01:52.229> exactly

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
the big speakers exactly

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.090 
the big speakers exactly
you<00:01:54.720> know<00:01:54.840> another<00:01:55.140> feature<00:01:55.409> these<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.890> that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
you know another feature these have that

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
you know another feature these have that
I<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.700> speaker<00:01:57.270> level<00:01:57.540> inputs

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
I like is speaker level inputs

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.380 
I like is speaker level inputs
absolutely<00:01:58.619> if<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> factory<00:02:00.000> stereo

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
absolutely if you have a factory stereo

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.550 
absolutely if you have a factory stereo
and<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.750> add<00:02:00.810> an<00:02:00.899> amp<00:02:01.049> you've<00:02:01.259> got<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and one and add an amp you've got to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.440 
and one and add an amp you've got to
have<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.369> all<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:02.969> case<00:02:03.030> is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
have that and all you do in this case is

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.859 
have that and all you do in this case is
connect<00:02:04.200> your<00:02:05.210> speaker<00:02:06.210> leads<00:02:06.390> from<00:02:06.540> your<00:02:06.659> car

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
connect your speaker leads from your car

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.160 
connect your speaker leads from your car
up<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.380> plug<00:02:08.420> hook<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.569> into<00:02:09.780> there<00:02:09.959> and

up to this plug hook it into there and

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.930 
up to this plug hook it into there and
your<00:02:10.890> factory<00:02:11.250> system<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.610> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> sound

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
your factory system is going to sound

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.770 
your factory system is going to sound
better<00:02:12.270> than<00:02:12.450> you

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
better than you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.110 
better than you
