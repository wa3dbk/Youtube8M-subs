kids<00:00:44.170> to<00:00:45.040> put<00:00:45.190> it<00:00:45.340> by<00:00:45.760> my<00:00:45.790> my<00:00:46.240> own<00:00:46.390> bike<00:00:46.570> that<00:00:47.530> I

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
kids to put it by my my own bike that I

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.840 
kids to put it by my my own bike that I
can<00:00:47.770> go<00:00:48.610> faster<00:00:49.030> with<00:00:49.180> them<00:00:50.010> okay<00:00:51.010> spare<00:00:51.579> parts

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.430 
right now I'm doing apples and they're
pretty<00:02:36.810> much<00:02:36.900> ready<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.760> also<00:02:42.170> at<00:02:43.170> first

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
pretty much ready and also at first

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.770 
pretty much ready and also at first
they're<00:02:43.980> nowhere<00:02:44.280> near<00:02:44.430> ready<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.120> yet<00:02:45.540> I

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
they're nowhere near ready and yet I

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.110 
they're nowhere near ready and yet I
know<00:02:45.900> it'll<00:02:46.170> taste<00:02:46.410> funny<00:02:46.940> apples<00:02:47.940> with

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
know it'll taste funny apples with

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.199 
know it'll taste funny apples with
peppers<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.570> I'm<00:02:49.500> just<00:02:49.740> testing<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.160> out<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:51.180> I

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
peppers and I'm just testing it out so I

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.640 
peppers and I'm just testing it out so I
have<00:02:51.480> six<00:02:52.050> trays<00:02:53.930> hopefully<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.200> won't<00:02:55.350> taste

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
have six trays hopefully it won't taste

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.510 
have six trays hopefully it won't taste
like<00:02:56.630> plywood<00:02:57.800> there's<00:02:58.800> some<00:02:59.040> glue<00:02:59.220> in<00:02:59.250> there

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
like plywood there's some glue in there

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.670 
like plywood there's some glue in there
and<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.239> don't<00:03:00.390> think<00:03:00.630> it'll<00:03:01.019> affect<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.410> taste

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
and I don't think it'll affect the taste

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.180 
and I don't think it'll affect the taste
very<00:03:02.040> much<00:03:02.360> but<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.450> could<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.959> if<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:04.980> was

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
very much but it could and if I was

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.400 
very much but it could and if I was
running<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.610> at<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.880> higher<00:03:06.330> temperature<00:03:06.410> then

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
running it at a higher temperature then

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.960 
running it at a higher temperature then
I<00:03:08.100> guess<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.870> could<00:03:10.140> taste<00:03:10.350> for<00:03:10.910> I'm<00:03:11.910> just

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
I guess it could taste for I'm just

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.150 
I guess it could taste for I'm just
saying<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.870> still<00:03:13.500> need<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.709> test<00:03:13.950> it

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
saying that I still need to test it

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.670 
saying that I still need to test it
right<00:03:14.820> now<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.060> know<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.630> works<00:03:15.930> because<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.440> D

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
right now I know it works because I D

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.140 
right now I know it works because I D
hydrated<00:03:17.280> my<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:18.600> batch<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.050> peppers<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:20.150> this

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
hydrated my a batch of peppers and this

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.210 
hydrated my a batch of peppers and this
is<00:03:21.300> what<00:03:21.450> I'll<00:03:21.540> use<00:03:21.570> for<00:03:21.959> pies<00:03:22.140> when<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:22.890> figure

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
is what I'll use for pies when I figure

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.800 
is what I'll use for pies when I figure
out<00:03:23.250> how<00:03:23.459> many<00:03:23.550> lies<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.790> really<00:03:24.390> need<00:03:24.480> eyes<00:03:24.600> or

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
out how many lies I really need eyes or

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.640 
out how many lies I really need eyes or
wonderful<00:03:25.170> or<00:03:25.350> -<00:03:25.880> oh<00:03:26.880> yeah<00:03:27.690> yes<00:03:28.230> whether

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
wonderful or - oh yeah yes whether

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.030 
wonderful or - oh yeah yes whether
sitting<00:03:29.160> in<00:03:29.250> my<00:03:29.340> garage<00:03:30.140> I'll<00:03:31.140> just<00:03:31.290> close

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
sitting in my garage I'll just close

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.220 
sitting in my garage I'll just close
this<00:03:32.250> better<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.820> guess<00:03:33.000> yeah<00:03:33.450> doesn't<00:03:33.870> matter

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
this better I guess yeah doesn't matter

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.670 
this better I guess yeah doesn't matter
as<00:03:35.130> long<00:03:35.220> as<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.580> works<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.110> make<00:03:37.260> fruit

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
as long as it works so I can make fruit

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.350 
as long as it works so I can make fruit
leather<00:03:37.890> food<00:03:38.580> vegetables<00:03:38.880> beef<00:03:39.630> jerky<00:03:41.360> so

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
leather food vegetables beef jerky so

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.000 
leather food vegetables beef jerky so
this<00:03:42.540> way<00:03:42.720> I'll<00:03:43.019> probably<00:03:43.500> save<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.800> bit<00:03:43.980> of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
this way I'll probably save a bit of

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.130 
this way I'll probably save a bit of
money<00:03:44.130> when<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.580> go<00:03:44.790> hiking<00:03:45.300> camping<00:03:45.810> with<00:03:46.050> the
