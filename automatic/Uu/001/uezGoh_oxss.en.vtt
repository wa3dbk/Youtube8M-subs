00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
a head mounted computer concept it

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.050 
a head mounted computer concept it
allows<00:00:16.619> for<00:00:16.800> hands-free<00:00:17.039> mobile<00:00:17.640> computing

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
allows for hands-free mobile computing

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.720 
allows for hands-free mobile computing
when<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.020> look<00:00:19.230> through<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.680> optics<00:00:20.189> pod<00:00:20.430> I

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
when I look through the optics pod I

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.759 
when I look through the optics pod I
have<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> same<00:00:21.270> experience<00:00:21.840> as<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> 15-inch

the ability to pan information in
real-time<00:00:33.890> 360<00:00:34.890> degrees<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.850> view

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
real-time 360 degrees so I can view

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.619 
real-time 360 degrees so I can view
large<00:00:36.989> documents<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.829> schematics<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.629> we're

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
large documents and schematics I we're

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.420 
large documents and schematics I we're
testing<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.170> concept<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.100> trying<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
testing this concept and trying to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.069 
testing this concept and trying to
understand<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.210> would<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.510> like<00:00:42.719> for

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
understand what it would be like for

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.319 
understand what it would be like for
mobile<00:00:43.410> field<00:00:43.710> workers<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> future<00:00:44.489> yeah

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
mobile field workers of the future yeah

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.310 
mobile field workers of the future yeah
so<00:00:45.750> industry<00:00:46.910> utilities<00:00:47.910> telecom<00:00:48.660> service

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
so industry utilities telecom service

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.229 
so industry utilities telecom service
maintenance<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.890> repair<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.879> would<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.120> you

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
maintenance and repair what would if you

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.939 
maintenance and repair what would if you
like<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.020> your<00:00:52.140> hands-free<00:00:52.590> while

yeah or I can leverage my Wi-Fi
connection<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.280> go<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.700> let's<00:01:45.119> say<00:01:45.270> over<00:01:45.479> my

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
connection and go out let's say over my

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.940 
connection and go out let's say over my
mobile<00:01:45.990> broadband<00:01:46.560> using<00:01:46.860> LTE<00:01:47.189> okay<00:01:48.170> there<00:01:49.170> I

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
mobile broadband using LTE okay there I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.080 
mobile broadband using LTE okay there I
don't<00:01:50.520> know

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
don't know

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.149 
don't know
yours<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.990> see<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.470> something<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.950> here

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
yours can see there is something in here

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
close one eye to focus on that we knew

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.030 
close one eye to focus on that we knew
you<00:03:12.340> could<00:03:12.370> do<00:03:12.639> it<00:03:12.819> this<00:03:13.510> pod<00:03:13.900> comes<00:03:14.230> off<00:03:14.469> and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
you could do it this pod comes off and

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.949 
you could do it this pod comes off and
if<00:03:15.219> we<00:03:15.310> go<00:03:15.459> on<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.790> other<00:03:15.819> side<00:03:16.209> everyone

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
if we go on to the other side everyone

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.800 
if we go on to the other side everyone
has<00:03:17.169> an<00:03:17.709> ID<00:03:18.099> arm<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.549> a<00:03:18.730> night<00:03:19.030> dominant<00:03:19.480> eye<00:03:19.540> or

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
everyone has an eye preference so you

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.250 
everyone has an eye preference so you
don't<00:03:22.269> think<00:03:22.359> that<00:03:22.540> everybody<00:03:22.900> will<00:03:23.019> use<00:03:23.049> it

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
don't think that everybody will use it

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.599 
don't think that everybody will use it
in<00:03:23.349> society<00:03:23.739> everywhere<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.250> like<00:03:24.459> in<00:03:24.579> a
