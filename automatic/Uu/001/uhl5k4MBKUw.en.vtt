00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 this is the main postcard here 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.109
 santa catarina mountains 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.280
 At this point we are about 1,400 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.750
 meters above sea level and in a 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.650
 altitude of this gives to have a notion 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.830
 there that beauty that is that postcard 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.410
 from santa catarina 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.980
 the range of the saw is about eight 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:31.289
 kilometers throughout this trio 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.530
 are about 250 curves 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.610
 the impression you have here is 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.930
 that these truck vehicles are 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:45.559
 practically hanging on the mountain is 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.760
 something awesome that engineering did 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.910
 here at that point the state of santa 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.910
 Catherine 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 We are starting our tour here. 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.309
 our descent down the mountain range of the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.170
 trail 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.460
 is an excerpt has extension of 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.680
 approximately 12 miles with 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.020
 many curves 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.650
 tourist information gives an account of 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.060
 that this section has about 250 curves 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.060
 in all its extension 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:21.300
 is a very radical outline and if this 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.479
 paving is actually not asphalt there 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:30.560
 a concrete was put in the decade of 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.560
 1980 for the information we received 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.049
 you can realize that it really is a 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:39.909
 very dangerous place has lots of 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.520
 humidity mainly in the winter of 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.100
 accumulation of snow and ice, which 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:51.490
 makes transit even more difficult here 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.109
 in this place the saw of the river of the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.359
 anyone who does not know is located between 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.439
 the municipalities of good mountain garden and 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.030
 lauro miller 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:04.530
 here in the southern state of Santa Catarina 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.530
 the cats along the mountain 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.640
 further embellishes the place, which leaves 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.940
 The place is even more dangerous. 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.950
 the fact that there is no shoreline 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.810
 in some places we find some 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.360
 points that it is possible to make stops 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.150
 thus practically naked in the large part of 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.800
 its extension on the shoulder 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.230
 This is a stopping point here in the mountains. 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.630
 of the Trail River and what impresses 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.670
 really the mountains here is one thing 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.560
 awesome to the height of these mountains 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.250
 and the way that road was 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.930
 built with a lot of green in the area 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.190
 permanent preservation with certainty in 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.940
 reason for the slopes and a wonder that 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.940
 state of santa catarina 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.540
 the vehicle comes down to accompany the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.540
 his stroke 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.330
 the truck coming up there and what 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.830
 I talked 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.080
 the impression you have is that these 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.080
 vehicles are hanging on the mountain 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:36.189
 notice how the closed curves 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.189
 economical exemption 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.010
 curves really very closed there comes 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.020
 one more truck 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.180
 just will not have space we both have to 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.200
 wait 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.200
 Look where you see. 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.440
 no spaces trucks really open 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.440
 clasp pick up practically the whole track 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.120
 and you have to face matching if 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:07.310
 you get packed in a spa curve 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:13.760
 a truck for sure the collision will 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:15.500
 two more trucks coming and going 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.109
 already honking that they do not 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.120
 coming up saw what's going on here 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:25.400
 so that staff can upload 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.610
 Look there it reveals I took all the 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.610
 track 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.569
 the key motors the horn one by one 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:44.300
 good distance for drivers 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:47.539
 still a safe and makes it possible 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.460
 pass them realize until the gps 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.460
 the trace he makes is something very curious 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.870
 you can have a notion of the GPS layout 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.169
 as this stretch is quite sinuous 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.110
 We already paid peace. 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.099
 all the time surrounded by mountains 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:24.270
 The Real Cliff South Vehicle Reach 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:28.080
 to drop here the removal of the 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.580
 victims will be something a very much 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.580
 big of difficulty
