00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
snowmobile set 600 32

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.730 
snowmobile set 600 32
it's<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.030> pretty<00:02:15.240> decent<00:02:15.660> set<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.020> only<00:02:16.260> about

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
it's a pretty decent set it's only about

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.300 
it's a pretty decent set it's only about
seven<00:02:17.430> dollars<00:02:17.760> us<00:02:18.210> so<00:02:18.960> this<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
seven dollars us so this is like the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.720 
seven dollars us so this is like the
