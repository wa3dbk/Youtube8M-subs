00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.240
 civilization is so easy to consider it itself 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.670
 we all of us take for granted every day 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.830
 we live in it and rely on it in essence 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.630
 modern life is closely connected with this 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.310
 social construction is difficult 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.759
 imagine life without modern 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.759
 of society 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.600
 but what if all this comes to an end 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.550
 imagine for a second that our days on 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.710
 the ground is numbered for example happened 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.000
 environmental disaster due to which a 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.150
 the land is more unsuitable for life 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.860
 humanity what can we do 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.080
 humbly die or commit 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.080
 leap to civilization beyond earth 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.390
 and turn to heaven looking for hope but 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.220
 how realistic this option can 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.589
 whether we really leave the earth and 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.589
 start over with a clean slate in another world 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.500
 Well, I first played in civilization yet 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.810
 little boy with his father and 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.619
 big brother and you know what this game 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.380
 taught me 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.390
 I learned the name of all the capitals learned that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.710
 magnetism is necessary for navigation to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.619
 build big ships 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.780
 but most importantly, I learned that despite 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.979
 to what they tell us on the history of gandhi 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.979
 I was in google ducks 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.800
 but can the last part of this series 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.390
 games will teach us colonization what am i 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.100
 contacted lewis dart chalk 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.590
 employees of a British company in 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.960
 space exploration and writer and asked him 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.880
 question if the days of mankind are on earth on 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.640
 can we really be credited 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.159
 save yourself beyond modern 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.700
 technology is not possible to cram 7 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.450
 billion people into a spaceship and 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.880
 travel with them not only by 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.560
 solar system but also on incredible 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.600
 great distance from star to star 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.150
 considering all the latest modern 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.010
 technology anyway travel to 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.250
 the nearest star would take dozens or 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.590
 even hundreds of thousands of years but also think that in 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.720
 In the future, we will definitely create such 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.610
 technologies maybe we will discover new ones 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.530
 laws of physics that allow you to create 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.080
 all these sci-fi things 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.300
 sort of wormhole warp engines and then 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.850
 maybe not all 7 billion, not all 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.700
 population of the planet a small group 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.800
 colonists and such a seed separated 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.600
 from the planet will create colonies on others 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.900
 planets may even be out of solar 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.900
 systems 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.140
 OK, let's imagine that we are part of this group. 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.340
 lucky members of this first 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.050
 expedition history 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.090
 if we actually manage to survive 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.010
 the death of the planet before we start 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.560
 build a new civilization we need 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.480
 will make sure that you know we 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.430
 don't die right away this aspect is 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.530
 the main thing first you will need 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.740
 ensure your own safety 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.060
 explore all the local life form i have 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.709
 in view of not only dinosaurs and others 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.959
 modeling logs that can come 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.350
 destroy your settlement and devour everyone 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.540
 you 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.400
 but also the bacteria will be necessary for you 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.620
 something like biological research 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.950
 which will show you nothing 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.180
 threatened in this environment 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.640
 Well, yes, the probability of catching up 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.170
 alien diseases and pests 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.760
 due to the fact that the human immune 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.950
 the system is so adapted to life 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.020
 on earth and as well as microbes living on it 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.000
 she protects very weakly if at all 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.820
 protects against microbes living in this 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.220
 new world but then after that 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.560
 let's say we did a study and all 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.850
 apparently okay how do we turn 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.459
 this alien world to our home when you 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.830
 already justify 100 the planet following your 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.130
 steps should be directed towards 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.510
 create a new extraterrestrial civilization then 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.799
 have you have to support yourself 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.000
 transportation system 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.950
 establish communication between the colonists 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.780
 well more importantly it will be necessary 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.500
 deal with natural resources on 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.810
 new planet 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.329
 find metal ore deposits 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.310
 determine whether to mine them melt 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.000
 in order to expand and build 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.000
 new settlements 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.240
 because the ship you are on 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.040
 flying can only provide you 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.080
 limited resources 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.850
 sooner or later you use them all and 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.490
 you will only have to rely on 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.590
 resources on the planet okay it's all very 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.060
 exciting but don't forget that in doing so 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.410
 it is completely incompatible with 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.210
 modern technology 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.130
 so let's get back to reality 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.690
 if we had to colonize 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.740
 another planet for example in our 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.020
 solar system 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.030
 if their possible variants and lanites are 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.260
 our solar system which 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.889
 mankind is soon 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:54.879
 most likely colonizes it max 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:56.949
 it is most likely if we are in the very 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.409
 Actually colonize Mars and appear 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.629
 population of mars then this will happen so 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.580
 first small ones will be sent there 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:06.879
 groups of people who lead children there 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.680
 top will already be real Martians 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.889
 during the colonization of Mars is ahead of us 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.539
 solve another problem and this 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.520
 need to reform how to get out 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.409
 beyond living artificial environment 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.509
 sealed dome where you can 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.449
 grow food in indoor greenhouses and 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:24.310
 go to the next step flashing without 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.650
 1st dome live exactly on the most 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:31.599
 surface of mars how to approximate conditions 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.789
 on mars to habitual earth and with the help 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.099
 technology that these people say 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.539
 problems will be solved 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:39.279
 will create an atmosphere on mars with 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.199
 sufficient atmospheric pressure 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:44.259
 so that the water could flow through basis 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.539
 surfaces and probably in the martian 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:48.639
 plants will be planted along with 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.560
 bacteria that can survive in any 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.330
 hostile conditions and start 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.389
 producing oxygen is necessary for 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.439
 the appearance of air and one day people will be able 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.439
 breathe outside the dome 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.120
 so the prospect of colonization of mars 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.700
 definitely looks possible but when 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.120
 will we witness this 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.620
 or may even become participants 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.110
 I hope that the first mission will have to 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.000
 my view of ours 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.860
 but due to the fact that mars is so far away mission 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.510
 it will be very long take a minimum 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.550
 two years to go to mars and 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.420
 come back as you understand it all will 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.310
 not very fast 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.260
 also this mission will surely be very 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.690
 complicated and very expensive and will require 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.430
 application of effort from all countries roughly 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.530
 as well as creating international 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.590
 space station but now for 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:39.380
 launching a ship to another planet so 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.900
 way Europeans Americans maybe 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.520
 Chinese Russian all they will need to 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.710
 work together to build 2 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.330
 interplanetary ship that can 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.240
 first fly with people on board to 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.610
 another world and you know that it can 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.020
 happen even earlier project under 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.820
 the name mars one became a star 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.740
 headlines and for news about what 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.360
 nonprofit organization in the netherlands 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.400
 and a huge number of enterprises 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.800
 jointly going to send first 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.560
 colonists to mars as early as 2023 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.870
 absolutely the whole process from the selection stage 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.120
 before landing on the planet and on will be 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.720
 broadcast on tv with sounds 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.940
 madly 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.860
 a kind of big brother in space for 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.890
 except that the colonists from him 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.020
 never get rid yes just so mars 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.090
 one is a one way trip 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.830
 but how much is it realistic and will it pass 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:30.590
 the launch of the ship will actually show 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:32.600
 only time and so would you like to be 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.040
 one of the volunteers to participate in this 

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.510
 one way trip 

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.100
 or would you like to be behind 

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.920
 outside the solar system 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.810
 write in the comments under the video of the past 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.790
 the reality test release I talked about 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.440
 krayzis style invisibility among 

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.370
 comments on youtube and user 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.400
 flip barking or 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.200
 wrote this dude and weight conditionally 

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.660
 injection of intelligence right into the brain 

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.760
 Thanks for the great compliment and if 

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.340
 you are not familiar with visos necessarily 

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.440
 look though it's not about the game but its 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.600
 episode whether the color is red for you 

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.120
 and for me definitely one of my 

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.600
 youtube favorite videos thanks for
