especially in the cool of spring for
green<00:00:25.010> manure<00:00:25.250> crops<00:00:25.580> too<00:00:26.140> after<00:00:27.140> they've

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
green manure crops too after they've

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.259 
green manure crops too after they've
been<00:00:27.560> turned<00:00:27.800> over<00:00:28.010> as<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.220> six<00:00:28.760> weeks<00:00:28.970> time

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
been turned over as the six weeks time

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.370 
been turned over as the six weeks time
to<00:00:29.630> decompose<00:00:30.289> before<00:00:30.830> I<00:00:30.859> actually<00:00:31.870> put<00:00:32.870> new

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
to decompose before I actually put new

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.400 
to decompose before I actually put new
plants<00:00:33.860> or<00:00:34.010> seed<00:00:34.280> up<00:00:34.430> a<00:00:34.550> bed<00:00:34.790> if<00:00:35.660> you<00:00:35.870> plant

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
plants or seed up a bed if you plant

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.580 
plants or seed up a bed if you plant
seeds<00:00:37.100> or<00:00:38.030> even<00:00:38.270> transplants<00:00:38.840> too<00:00:38.990> soon<00:00:39.230> after

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
seeds or even transplants too soon after

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.930 
seeds or even transplants too soon after
you<00:00:40.340> have<00:00:42.010> turned<00:00:43.010> over<00:00:43.130> the<00:00:43.460> green<00:00:43.640> manure

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
you have turned over the green manure

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.790 
you have turned over the green manure
crop<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.450> decomposition<00:00:44.960> process<00:00:45.230> actually

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
crop the decomposition process actually

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.150 
crop the decomposition process actually
makes<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.730> germination<00:00:47.150> not<00:00:47.480> go<00:00:47.660> very<00:00:47.870> well

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
makes the germination not go very well

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.380 
makes the germination not go very well
so<00:00:49.160> today<00:00:49.400> I'm<00:00:49.700> going<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:49.910> spend<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:50.270> few

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
so today I'm going to spend a few

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.790 
so today I'm going to spend a few
minutes<00:00:50.630> I've<00:00:50.720> actually<00:00:50.870> got<00:00:51.110> started<00:00:51.590> but<00:00:51.740> I

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
minutes I've actually got started but I

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.010 
minutes I've actually got started but I
thought<00:00:51.950> I'd<00:00:52.100> give<00:00:52.130> you<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.760> quick<00:00:53.420> overview<00:00:53.540> on

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
thought I'd give you a quick overview on

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.290 
thought I'd give you a quick overview on
how<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.290> do<00:00:54.650> this<00:00:54.830> a<00:00:55.130> lot<00:00:55.580> of<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:55.790> have<00:00:56.060> done

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
how to do this a lot of you have done

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.910 
how to do this a lot of you have done
this<00:00:56.420> before<00:00:56.630> but<00:00:57.110> I<00:00:57.170> know<00:00:57.260> if<00:00:57.500> you<00:00:57.620> have<00:00:57.770> not

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
this before but I know if you have not

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.570 
this before but I know if you have not
I'm<00:00:58.850> going<00:00:59.000> to<00:00:59.410> focus<00:01:00.410> in<00:01:00.680> here<00:01:01.010> if<00:01:01.190> I<00:01:01.280> can<00:01:01.490> get

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
I'm going to focus in here if I can get

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.990 
I'm going to focus in here if I can get
the<00:01:01.700> camera<00:01:01.940> down<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:03.620> step<00:01:03.950> over<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.400> turn

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
the camera down and step over and turn

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.550 
the camera down and step over and turn
over<00:01:05.269> a<00:01:05.299> few<00:01:05.570> of<00:01:05.660> this<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.050> show<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:06.170> how<00:01:06.410> it's

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
over a few of this and show you how it's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.800 
over a few of this and show you how it's
done

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
done

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.240 
done
the<00:01:08.810> idea<00:01:09.110> is<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:11.140> basically<00:01:12.140> invert<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.980> soil

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
the idea is to basically invert the soil

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.090 
the idea is to basically invert the soil
so<00:01:13.760> that<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.120> roots<00:01:14.360> are<00:01:14.540> up<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:15.170> vegetation

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
so that the roots are up and vegetation

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.340 
so that the roots are up and vegetation
is<00:01:16.400> turned<00:01:16.640> over

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
is turned over

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.560 
is turned over
pretty<00:01:17.979> simple<00:01:18.189> the<00:01:18.549> soils<00:01:18.909> real<00:01:19.090> soft<00:01:19.390> this

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
pretty simple the soils real soft this

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.920 
pretty simple the soils real soft this
time<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:19.930> year<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:21.820> just<00:01:21.850> turn<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:22.750> flip

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
time of year and you just turn and flip

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.630 
time of year and you just turn and flip
don't<00:01:23.650> worry<00:01:23.890> if<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.040> got<00:01:24.189> a<00:01:24.220> few<00:01:24.400> stragglers

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
don't worry if you got a few stragglers

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.090 
don't worry if you got a few stragglers
sticking<00:01:25.210> up<00:01:25.500> you'll<00:01:26.500> just<00:01:26.530> chop<00:01:26.860> those<00:01:27.040> up

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
sticking up you'll just chop those up

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.539 
sticking up you'll just chop those up
with<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.369> hole<00:01:27.610> in<00:01:27.940> a<00:01:28.180> couple<00:01:28.450> weeks<00:01:29.100> main<00:01:30.100> ideas

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
with a hole in a couple weeks main ideas

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.359 
with a hole in a couple weeks main ideas
get<00:01:30.790> most<00:01:31.149> of<00:01:31.270> it<00:01:31.420> into<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.290> ground<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
get most of it into the ground and you

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.830 
get most of it into the ground and you
just<00:01:36.549> work<00:01:36.700> your<00:01:36.729> way<00:01:36.880> down<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.270> bed<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:40.600> was
