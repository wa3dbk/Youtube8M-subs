00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
really don't understand why that sort of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.010 
really don't understand why that sort of
a<00:00:38.850> man<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.030> coming<00:00:39.390> through<00:00:39.570> from<00:00:39.660> him<00:00:39.870> right

a man is coming through from him right
now<00:00:40.079> perhaps<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:41.040> something<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
now perhaps it's just something that the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.150 
now perhaps it's just something that the
EA<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.110> throw<00:00:43.320> out<00:00:43.440> Ewing<00:00:43.649> manager<00:00:44.040> mode

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160

EA like to throw out Ewing manager mode
but<00:00:44.430> you'd<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.670> thought<00:00:44.879> after<00:00:45.090> three<00:00:45.450> years

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
but you'd have thought after three years

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
but you'd have thought after three years
in<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> country<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> lot<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.070> Brazilian

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520

in the country with a lot of Brazilian
teammates<00:00:47.910> around<00:00:48.149> him<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.570> at<00:00:49.110> least

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
teammates around him or at least

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.900 
teammates around him or at least
portuguese-speaking<00:00:49.829> teammates<00:00:50.460> around<00:00:50.700> him

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
portuguese-speaking teammates around him

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
portuguese-speaking teammates around him
then<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.719> know<00:00:51.930> he<00:00:52.079> would<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.289> been<00:00:52.410> quite

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
then you know he would have been quite

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.410 
then you know he would have been quite
easily<00:00:52.890> or<00:00:53.309> quite<00:00:53.550> happily<00:00:53.879> settled<00:00:54.300> at<00:00:54.390> the

this<00:00:56.309> new<00:00:56.489> console<00:00:56.820> game<00:00:56.969> I'm<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.539> try

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
this new console game I'm going to try

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.360

and monitor that Oscar situation make

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.650 
and monitor that Oscar situation make
sure<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.640> doesn't<00:00:59.820> get<00:00:59.969> out<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.149> hand<00:01:00.300> because

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
sure it doesn't get out of hand because

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.689 
sure it doesn't get out of hand because
he<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.020> play<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.379> definitely<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:02.460> not

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
he is a play that I definitely do not

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.609 
he is a play that I definitely do not
want<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.239> lose<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.629> Moussa<00:01:03.930> Sissoko<00:01:03.989> has<00:01:04.589> a

great<00:01:04.920> effort<00:01:05.129> there<00:01:05.400> close<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.450> what's

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
great effort there close to what's

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.630 
great effort there close to what's

taking the lead Phil for a for Newcastle

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.370 
taking the lead Phil for a for Newcastle
they<00:01:08.700> obviously<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.479> other<00:01:09.720> team<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:09.960> ended

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
they obviously the other team that ended

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.320 
they obviously the other team that ended
are<00:01:10.530> unbeaten<00:01:11.040> run<00:01:11.250> last<00:01:11.729> year<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
are unbeaten run last year if you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.030 
are unbeaten run last year if you
remember<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.810> started<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.229> season<00:01:13.409> very<00:01:13.590> very

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
remember we started the season very very

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.460 
remember we started the season very very
well<00:01:14.189> indeed<00:01:14.490> at<00:01:15.150> last<00:01:15.390> season<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.110> we

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
well indeed at last season and we

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.770 
well indeed at last season and we
actually<00:01:16.619> were<00:01:17.340> unbeaten<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.060> at<00:01:18.150> least<00:01:18.240> 16

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
actually were unbeaten for at least 16

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.789 
actually were unbeaten for at least 16
games<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.470> Premier<00:01:19.770> League

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
games I think in the Premier League

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.620 
games I think in the Premier League
before<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.280> finally<00:01:20.670> met<00:01:20.790> defeat<00:01:21.150> against

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
before we finally met defeat against

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.240 
before we finally met defeat against
Newcastle<00:01:22.140> away<00:01:22.229> from<00:01:22.409> home<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.799> how<00:01:22.979> has

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
Newcastle away from home and how has

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.520 
Newcastle away from home and how has
Torres<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:23.820> scored<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.450> don't<00:01:24.930> know<00:01:25.170> he's<00:01:25.380> just

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
Torres not scored I don't know he's just

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.160 
Torres not scored I don't know he's just
easily<00:01:26.490> through<00:01:26.850> one-on-one<00:01:27.080> smashes<00:01:28.080> it

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
easily through one-on-one smashes it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.600 
easily through one-on-one smashes it
with<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> outsiders<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:28.799> over<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> barn<00:01:29.490> we

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
with the outsiders but over the barn we
