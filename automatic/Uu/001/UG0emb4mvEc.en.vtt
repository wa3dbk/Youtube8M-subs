00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
approximately half a length lead

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.450

of Germany there was just quite for 3 of

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.040 
of Germany there was just quite for 3 of
a<00:01:06.280> second<00:01:06.700> between<00:01:07.030> those<00:01:07.300> two<00:01:07.570> crews<00:01:07.870> in

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
a second between those two crews in

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.500 
a second between those two crews in
Lucerne<00:01:08.440> so<00:01:09.220> be<00:01:09.370> interesting<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.030> see<00:01:10.210> how

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
Lucerne so be interesting to see how

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.010 
Lucerne so be interesting to see how
much<00:01:10.750> each<00:01:11.590> crew<00:01:12.010> has<00:01:12.159> improved<00:01:12.610> over<00:01:13.060> the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
much each crew has improved over the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.700 
much each crew has improved over the
past<00:01:14.470> three<00:01:15.340> months<00:01:15.520> but<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.970> Italians<00:01:16.390> now

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
past three months but the Italians now

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.499 
past three months but the Italians now
really<00:01:17.710> pushing<00:01:18.100> on<00:01:18.250> coming<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.729> 500

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
really pushing on coming to the 500

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.200 
really pushing on coming to the 500
million<00:01:19.720> point<00:01:20.020> one<00:01:20.650> 2748<00:01:21.550> so<00:01:21.790> that's<00:01:21.940> pretty

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
million point one 2748 so that's pretty

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.780 
million point one 2748 so that's pretty
quick<00:01:22.479> for<00:01:22.509> the<00:01:22.780> first<00:01:22.960> 500<00:01:23.590> yes<00:01:24.130> that's<00:01:24.670> a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
quick for the first 500 yes that's a

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.430 
quick for the first 500 yes that's a
good<00:01:25.060> time<00:01:25.300> for<00:01:25.509> a<00:01:25.540> lightweight<00:01:25.840> combination

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
good time for a lightweight combination

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.990 
good time for a lightweight combination
I<00:01:26.619> think<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.160> interesting<00:01:27.400> point<00:01:27.700> is<00:01:27.880> going

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
I think the interesting point is going

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.219 
I think the interesting point is going
to<00:01:28.090> be<00:01:28.180> really<00:01:28.420> whether<00:01:28.660> this<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:28.990> too<00:01:29.200> much

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
to be really whether this is too much

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.780 
to be really whether this is too much
pace<00:01:29.619> too<00:01:29.830> quickly<00:01:30.070> for<00:01:30.190> this<00:01:30.430> Italian

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
pace too quickly for this Italian

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.090 
pace too quickly for this Italian
combination<00:01:31.300> now<00:01:31.869> those<00:01:32.080> athletes<00:01:32.470> have<00:01:32.920> got

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
combination now those athletes have got

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.889 
combination now those athletes have got
to<00:01:33.250> hold<00:01:33.430> on<00:01:33.610> now<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.240> it's<00:01:34.509> going<00:01:34.660> to<00:01:34.720> be<00:01:34.869> a

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
to hold on now and it's going to be a

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.870 
to hold on now and it's going to be a
tough<00:01:35.170> experience<00:01:35.440> for<00:01:35.920> them<00:01:36.039> and<00:01:36.490> we'll<00:01:36.670> see

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
tough experience for them and we'll see

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.100 
tough experience for them and we'll see
whether<00:01:37.090> they've<00:01:37.330> actually<00:01:37.539> gone<00:01:37.750> out<00:01:37.869> too

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
whether they've actually gone out too

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.320 
whether they've actually gone out too
fast<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.680> whether<00:01:39.190> they<00:01:39.430> can<00:01:39.490> maintain<00:01:39.759> the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
fast and whether they can maintain the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.820 
fast and whether they can maintain the
pressure<00:01:40.509> or<00:01:41.080> whether<00:01:41.380> they're<00:01:41.590> going<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.770> be

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
pressure or whether they're going to be

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.070 
pressure or whether they're going to be
