00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.150
 in the company of arsenic for you 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.679
 present the novelties of the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.719
 day of June sonillard scenic 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.670
 hi to you airways and so I'm 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.260
 happy to meet you for this 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.910
 presentation of the second part 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.350
 quickly before we do a little 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.240
 booster shot if for what was 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.130
 spent yesterday so for this case is not 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.720
 level 5 dragon tracking as you can 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.090
 see it on the screen available from 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.650
 the age of v10 levels 4 from 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.420
 the age of vnf so the exclusive info 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.399
 of the forum we will have a second thruster 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.140
 of air that will be available at the age of 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.540
 vnf the first being available at the age of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.640
 v8 and a second exclusive info we will have 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.469
 a new interface to launch our 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.149
 troops in the east in the barracks 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.710
 we will have fewer risks 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.420
 to be wrong by casting spells by 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.100
 example by speed etc 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.510
 so it's not bad so here we go 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.860
 found for the second part that goes 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.210
 relate to the leagues so I'm going to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.190
 let him start talking about it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.390
 the waters so here is second synpics that 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.890
 really is not the least since 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.300
 it's actually new lines that we 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.440
 going to have two new leagues with 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.850
 also the league change that is going 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.320
 now be divided into three lines 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.270
 distinct so champions three 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.070
 champions of is champion 1 so the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.439
 Champions league will run from 3200 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.729
 trophy at 4100 trophy plus a site in 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.229
 gold to lectin time with this beautiful 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.850
 emblem of the barbarian king arsenic I leave 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.619
 a small step in talking about it so well then in 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.470
 do we have just three others 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.270
 leagues that will be 4,000 are at 5,000 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.040
 trophy as you can see there I 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.650
 take brides from the chief video 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.600
 patent so and then after these four 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.390
 one thousand to five thousand we will really have the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.070
 ultimate league vasileios I leave you in 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.720
 talk will then be dengue and whey 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.549
 cca the ultimate league this will actually be the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.049
 league legend to more than 5000 trophy 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.579
 so it's really something 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.110
 very complex that we tried to 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.250
 understand with sonic art 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.540
 you will see that it is not so easy 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.040
 to understand that that's so we're going to 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.520
 explain a little bit about what we have 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.380
 including 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.270
 in fact the seasons we forgot to 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.159
 remember but the forum finally the sneak 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.540
 exclusive peek of the forum is that the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.520
 seasons will not last longer than two weeks 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.659
 now but a month and so like 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.079
 his seasons will last a month 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.920
 and the legend league will be celebrating 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.909
 reset every month this is only 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.020
 I leave a little bit to talk about it in the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.070
 detail because it can be a small 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.659
 little abstract for our players 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.460
 so here's actually I'm just taking 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.460
 a video flange always 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.709
 imany but come back first point so 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.959
 those who end up legend to her every 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.580
 season actually there it will be if you want 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.020
 somehow inscribed in the profile 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.209
 there will always be a traceability 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.740
 there on it actually people will even know 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.530
 if you are more legendary if you 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.600
 lower we'll know there will be really a 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.970
 annotation in your profile or it will be 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.430
 specified is actually those who are 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.630
 caption for example no more so to more 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.160
 of 5000 trophy there will be a 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.760
 reset ie six 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.790
 months and waters 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.550
 we arrive at 5300 trophy 1 cc utopian 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.739
 but we never know so we will beat 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.170
 if we will be automatically at the end of 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.570
 month reset to 5000 trophy 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.890
 this is for a new start fougeux 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.120
 it's not to revive a little bit 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.560
 thought a little difficult to explain 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.440
 like that huh but I think I have little 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.000
 close grabbed at the thing and lo and behold 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.260
 what I understood after we go 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.110
 to be able to speak a little bit in detail if 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.090
 you want fake post on the forum 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.560
 that's exactly it and so in fact the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.239
 league legend it will include 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.730
 legendary trophies pentax and he goes there 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.200
 have trophies that you go 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.390
 to be able to acquire while you are 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.519
 online rare legend makes them the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.320
 trophies for example I take someone 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.680
 who's at 5100 trophy at the end of the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.690
 season 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.340
 donkey who is 31 days and the season 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.130
 is going to be reset it's going to be 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.829
 reset so at 5000 trophy is in 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.959
 makes the difference between these lairs between 5000 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.670
 trophy and 5100 trophy ie these 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.620
 current trophies will be happy and in 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.090
 trophy of legend so without trophy of 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.320
 legend or is taken over and put on his 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.940
 profile if I understood correctly 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.220
 so in fact there are going to be trophies 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.230
 of legend to rank the players and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.549
 that's really what we understood 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.470
 but it's still a little crazy 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.730
 no, but that's it basically like we 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.940
 so said month and leonard yves to 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.920
 5300 we will be reset to 5000 but we 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.480
 will have a profit of 300 legendary trophy 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.010
 as you can see the insurer 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.180
 in the photo we may not have 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.310
 necessarily the same screen the Moyer 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.480
 men and those who look on my side 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.250
 in any case you can see there is 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.670
 189 trophy legend so that's 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.250
 the accumulation of 45 here 5045 so more 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.190
 the 15 of the season before and until 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.690
 reach the fans and 189 so that will be 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.370
 basically to a new brand actually 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.380
 a new value a new measure 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.060
 if we can say like that of the value 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.280
 of a player in terms of rock and 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.220
 knowing that every time all the 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.389
 world will be reset to 5000 trophy 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.970
 exactly one last little thing 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.350
 appreciated 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.000
 it's actually that you can 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.739
 see on the league people you can 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.880
 sometimes see numbers written then 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.650
 what do these numbers mean 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.570
 it's very simple actually the first 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.310
 player of the season who will arrive in 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.140
 league legend and well there will be marked 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.730
 a 1 on his coat of arms people will want it 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.700
 to say that this is the first person to 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.200
 having crossed the 5000 trophy mark at 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.210
 the new season is basically 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.530
 why did they do that we see well 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.360
 that there is a graph here actually is getting 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.260
 realized that before 3200 trophy 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.280
 I do not know if you remember the waters 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.650
 but it was ultimate 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.480
 a few years ago we said we were 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.040
 champion it's really ultimate is there 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.090
 now they've seen that in the end beats 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.860
 already there are a lot of people who 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.300
 formed and in the end it became a 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.700
 habit what could anyone 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.400
 arrive at 3200 trophy with a minimum 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.210
 index effects' perience so here it is 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.770
 now they have they wanted 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.910
 relaunch that we know that the clan thing 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.320
 often they revive a little bit the 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.820
 things when that finally I mean we 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.740
 was a little less 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.630
 news like that and so here's so 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.680
 the big raise on the leagues 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.970
 tell us what you think about it in 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.710
 comments is good to have 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.940
 your opinion maybe that we failed to 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.120
 to say something that you have you 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.830
 understood and you can share it on 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.000
 also waits you notice by 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.140
 report to that but I find a lot 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.850
 because it's a bit the same system 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.210
 than other games like hours stones 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.580
 etc. 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.770
 we will really have the classification the 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.150
 figure in the end for legends 1 but 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.850
 it will really represent a minority 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.680
 of people and especially we will have the 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.570
 blaze enrolled whose in the in the 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.180
 player profile notice what really 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.500
 will know who will have been legend or not so 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.120
 that's what I had to say for that 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.130
 that's exactly so we recap 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.770
 league change 3 to 1 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.229
 then the titan ict 3 to 1 and then 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.729
 legend league here thanks to all have 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.050
 watched this sneak peek number two 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.570
 mercenaries to have participated 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.460
 Thank you to me for inviting me

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.050
 actually like arsenic Monday to us 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.370
 add small details if you 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.850
 have understood things we did not
