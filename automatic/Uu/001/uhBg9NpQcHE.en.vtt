 popularize the operating system 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.150
 windows phone 8 in a market where 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.889
 other competitors seem to android 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.800
 to reign supreme 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.020
 will not be an easy task in the meantime 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.100
 even with less time together with 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.439
 consumers 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.150
 microsoft's mobile has succeeded 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.880
 find your space 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.320
 in addition to top-of-the-line 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.450
 models lk 1920 lume 820 from nokia a 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.130
 The Finnish company also 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.160
 attention to the devices considered 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.200
 with less robust resources 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.280
 but more affordable for 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.090
 consumer 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.610
 is the case of the nokia lumia 520 model 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.559
 with Microsoft's only 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.590
 be found in stores for about 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.789
 600 reais 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.399
 we analyze the main characteristics 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.230
 of the product that counts today with a price 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.760
 more accessible between models with 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.329
 windows phone 8 available on 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.329
 Brazilian market 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.180
 weighing only 124 grams 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.570
 the lumia 521 lightweight and quite 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.780
 anatomical 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.790
 the design is very close to the model 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.110
 620 providing an anatomical footprint 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.570
 is consistent 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.250
 the rounded edges help 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.960
 that the cell phone can move 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.330
 naturally in the hands 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.150
 another differential is due to the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.280
 interchangeable housings part 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.290
 rear of the appliance as well as its 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.600
 battery is removable 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.420
 just as the product is available in 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.320
 five colors yellow blue white red 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.810
 it's black 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.850
 buy new covers separately and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.950
 choose which color most matches with 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.720
 your style to have a cell phone always 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.180
 new in your hands 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.210
 the 4-inch screen is another point 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.659
 of the nokia handset even though the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.890
 its resolution is only 480 by 800 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.840
 pixels with a pixel density of 233 pp 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.969
 it is sufficient for running videos 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.369
 and games not compromising in any way 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.390
 performance in any type of 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.390
 assignment 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.460
 the screen sensitivity of the luminaire 520 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.640
 as well as all the products of the line 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.069
 lumia is among the best on the market 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.190
 response to ringtones is accurate and effective 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.959
 and the sound feedback system raps or 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.959
 physical information to the user that the 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.150
 command was accepted of course accurate 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.430
 nokia also informs that it is possible 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.680
 handle the product even if it is 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.820
 Gloves on hands that have been proven 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.890
 in our tests that windows phone 8 is 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.330
 an efficient operating system already 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.000
 proved 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.130
 however, the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.200
 nokia present in all its line of 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.670
 devices are a great differential for 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.310
 those who wish to acquire a 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.190
 product with a microsoft s 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.620
 among them we can highlight the resources 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.330
 and maps and wi fi network that add 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.500
 functions that are interesting to the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.480
 available on the operating system 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.150
 like the other line devices 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.070
 lumia the battery of the lumiar 520 and 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.180
 certainly will not let the consumer 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.850
 in hand 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.860
 in our tests with the highest stress in the 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.570
 product the battery life for 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.750
 video display with brightness and volume 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.739
 50% was about four hours and 10 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.840
 minutes 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.769
 already in standby by the device consumed 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.530
 only 1% in an hour 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.620
 the camera of the fire at 520 is exactly the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.360
 which we found in lumina 620 and 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.930
 for this reason there are not many surprises 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.390
 here neither positive nor negative within 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.340
 of the camera 's proposal of 5 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.260
 megapixels this is reasonably well 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.230
 small and 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.750
 forgivable despite the limitations 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.110
 dual core processor of 1 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.209
 ghz and 512 megabytes of ram 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.220
 the consumer will hardly have problems 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.040
 with the execution of software on the product 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.750
 for use on a daily basis with applications 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.940
 conventional productivity 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.380
 certainly you will not have any kind of 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.480
 problem 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.650
 if you analyze the settings of the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.780
 620 and the luminaire 520 will realize that 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.669
 they are practically identical 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.960
 the differences are due to the screen 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:26.050
 Largest 524-inch luminaire versus 3.8 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.010
 inches from lumina 620 and the absence of 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.860
 frontal camera 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.910
 and compatibility with nfc 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.400
 processor 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.710
 although it has the same characteristics 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:40.030
 1 ghz core is also slightly 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.520
 but while the lumia 620 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.590
 it costs about eight hundred and fifteen reais 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.340
 the lumia 520 reaches the Brazilian market 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.140
 for a considerable difference of 600 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.300
 we take into account that none of the items 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.400
 that we mention influence or performance 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.840
 of the product or the possibilities of 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.840
 consumer actions on a daily basis 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.560
 the complete absence of a camera 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.650
 may disappoint some users 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.230
 even a camera vg air as available 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.300
 the lumen 620 would be more than 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.340
 enough 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.740
 most users today use a 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.690
 notebook instead of a desktop and to 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.660
 they certainly will not be a 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.610
 problem though we can not let 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.440
 to mention the fact that the cable 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:33.160
 transfer of data from the device has 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:35.770
 only 20 centimeters cheaper 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.050
 between the options of the line luna or nokia 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.600
 520 is undoubtedly one of the most 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.880
 features made available by nokia in the 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.920
 Brazilian market its price range 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.360
 still places it as a smartphone for 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.700
 category entry 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.980
 in your settings can do with 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.040
 that it rivals in good 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.320
 models considered intermediate with 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.930
 1 ghz dual core processor 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.810
 the lumia 520 is able to fulfill the main 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.980
 functions with conventional applications 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.590
 presenting only a few limitations 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.490
 when it comes to running games that 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.410
 require a greater graphic potential 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.810
 however, titles compatible with the 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:18.240
 512 megabytes of RAM are 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.240
 performed without gagging or treatment 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.770
 lightweight anatomical and above all affordable 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.800
 lumia 520 is undoubtedly an option that 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.449
 presents an excellent cost-benefit ratio 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.069
 being the ideal model for those who do not yet 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:35.250
 knows the windows operating system 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:37.530
 phone 8 and is willing to migrate but 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.909
 spend a lot so it 's worth it 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.129
 closely check your
