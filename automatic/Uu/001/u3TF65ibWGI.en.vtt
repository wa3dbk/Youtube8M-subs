telling<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.870> same<00:02:59.019> story<00:02:59.319> over<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.620> over

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
telling the same story over and over

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.199 
telling the same story over and over

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
over again so for me it's stepping up

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:04.860 
over again so for me it's stepping up
doing<00:03:04.030> something<00:03:04.180> different<00:03:04.510> challenging

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870
