of<00:00:32.980> versatility<00:00:33.430> I<00:00:33.850> still<00:00:34.360> think<00:00:34.570> that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
of versatility I still think that

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.979 
of versatility I still think that
there's<00:00:34.840> a<00:00:34.899> large<00:00:35.860> percentage<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.460> market

shoppers<00:00:37.989> like<00:00:38.170> me<00:00:38.350> that<00:00:38.559> would<00:00:38.649> like<00:00:38.800> to<00:00:38.950> have

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
shoppers like me that would like to have

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.950 
shoppers like me that would like to have
a<00:00:39.340> four-door<00:00:39.880> and<00:00:40.059> that's<00:00:40.210> what<00:00:40.360> we<00:00:40.480> have<00:00:40.510> here

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
and I think the third time is the charm

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.110 
and I think the third time is the charm
this<00:00:43.450> is<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:44.109> mini<00:00:44.410> cooper<00:00:45.309> countryman<00:00:45.969> and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
it's the all four version which means

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.279 
it's the all four version which means

doors<00:01:47.140> just<00:01:47.530> makes<00:01:47.799> such<00:01:48.070> a<00:01:48.100> difference<00:01:48.189> and<00:01:48.789> I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
doors just makes such a difference and I

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.249 
doors just makes such a difference and I
think<00:01:49.570> it's<00:01:49.659> really<00:01:49.869> going<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.020> elevate

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
think it's really going to elevate

some<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:54.909> these<00:01:55.030> we<00:01:55.210> don't<00:01:55.390> like<00:01:55.570> about<00:01:55.840> this

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
some of these we don't like about this

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.319 
some of these we don't like about this

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670

equipped

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
equipped

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.680

the<00:02:25.290> double<00:02:25.770> sun<00:02:26.160> roof<00:02:26.370> which<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.180> nice<00:02:27.360> I

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the double sun roof which is nice I

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.940 
the double sun roof which is nice I
don't<00:02:27.900> know<00:02:27.959> if<00:02:28.020> I'd<00:02:28.110> spend<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.470> money<00:02:28.650> for<00:02:28.920> it

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
don't know if I'd spend the money for it

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.199 
don't know if I'd spend the money for it
but<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.280> certainly<00:02:29.459> adds<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.970> little<00:02:30.090> more

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
but it certainly adds a little more

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.660 
but it certainly adds a little more
style<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> vehicle<00:02:31.319> but<00:02:31.739> overall<00:02:32.069> just

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
style to the vehicle but overall just

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.400 
style to the vehicle but overall just
had<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.940> lot<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.120> fun<00:02:33.300> with<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.690> wouldn't<00:02:34.200> mind

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
had a lot of fun with it I wouldn't mind

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.930 
had a lot of fun with it I wouldn't mind
if<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.709> car<00:02:34.890> had<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.040> little<00:02:35.340> bit<00:02:35.489> more<00:02:35.670> space

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
if this car had a little bit more space

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.369 
if this car had a little bit more space
so<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.209> could<00:02:36.420> actually<00:02:36.569> fit<00:02:36.870> my<00:02:36.989> mountain<00:02:37.349> bike

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
so I could actually fit my mountain bike

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.070 
so I could actually fit my mountain bike
with<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.800> seats<00:02:38.010> folded<00:02:38.370> down<00:02:38.750> it's<00:02:39.750> still<00:02:40.019> a

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
with the seats folded down it's still a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.250 
with the seats folded down it's still a
small<00:02:40.319> car<00:02:40.739> but<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.880> has<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.390> ton<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.780> style
