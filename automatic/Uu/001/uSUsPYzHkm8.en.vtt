00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello everyone in this video I do 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.210
 see a very sweaty recipe is 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.450
 very easy to prepare it is 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.660
 this fact that cabbage black colors but 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.630
 leaves, that is, that you give an idea then on 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.510
 facebook page because we could have some 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.670
 this table we did n't know how 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.830
 always using let's know 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.600
 language nothing we wanted to do a lot of data 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.220
 different and we asked for some 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.210
 advice may be the worst eto'o 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.920
 try the pesto with this table 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.260
 we have proven that he knows very well 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.960
 so today we show you how 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.600
 first prepare clean the leaves 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.230
 of black cabbage by removing the stem 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.230
 cental 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.429
 add the boiling pot 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.469
 I love this minute for precisely now 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.229
 really simple because it will be enough 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.659
 put in the blender jug a 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.989
 dive and our cabbage after that 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.449
 the boiling of cooked water five 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.289
 minutes so really very little 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.289
 the oil 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.250
 we put the almonds you can too 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.990
 don't use pine nuts too 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.830
 like 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.270
 the salt and here it opens to your taste not 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.220
 the garlic clove 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.280
 I would say that it truly is not up to me 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.050
 I like it and for our people I will soon if 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.460
 appreciate the Rome 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.460
 add we sense it 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.310
 as you have seen it really is 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.740
 very simple today they are also needed 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.930
 made to say 10 so maybe even for 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.869
 while you feel a pasta, whoever you have 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.570
 the water to boil you can prepare it as 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.880
 as a seasoning as an accompaniment 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.500
 or you can serve it if so 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.720
 we used these to the lighthouse of 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.670
 promises that they are delicious and in short 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.190
 you see him put a foul to everything 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.929
 I hope the recipe is delicious 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.929
