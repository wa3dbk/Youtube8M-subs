is not this is nothing except for a
piston<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.500> I'll<00:01:40.590> show<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.770> guys

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
piston so here I'll show you guys

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.679 
piston so here I'll show you guys
actually<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.909> looks<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.509> kind

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
actually what it looks like this is kind

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.670 
actually what it looks like this is kind
of<00:01:42.720> cool<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.960> can<00:01:43.170> make<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.470> your<00:01:43.530> own

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
of cool you can make this in your own

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.249 
of cool you can make this in your own
worlds<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.729> said<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.970> only<00:01:45.060> need<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.329> 3x3

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
worlds like I said you only need a 3x3

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.130 
worlds like I said you only need a 3x3
area<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.880> actually<00:01:48.060> do<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.049> do

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
area to actually do this and you can do

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.230 
area to actually do this and you can do
a<00:01:49.170> dropper<00:01:49.680> or<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.920> hopper<00:01:50.340> depending<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.119> what

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
a dropper or a hopper depending on what

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.460 
a dropper or a hopper depending on what
you<00:01:51.360> want<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.990> guys<00:01:52.079> don't<00:01:52.229> know

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
you want so if you guys don't know

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.679 
you want so if you guys don't know
droppers<00:01:53.310> obviously<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.149> drop<00:01:54.450> whatever

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
droppers obviously just drop whatever

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.630 
droppers obviously just drop whatever
the<00:01:54.869> item<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.890> hopper<00:01:56.219> actually<00:01:56.549> like

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the item is and the hopper actually like

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.490 
the item is and the hopper actually like
dispenses<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.840> let's<00:01:57.990> say<00:01:58.110> there's<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.439> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
dispenses it so let's say there's like a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.830 
dispenses it so let's say there's like a
potion<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.189> there<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.030> want<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.450> splash

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
potion in there and you want to splash

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.350 
potion in there and you want to splash
the<00:02:01.110> person<00:02:01.500> there<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.460> want<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.880> hopper

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the person there then you want a hopper

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.580 
the person there then you want a hopper
and<00:02:03.509> if<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.659> want<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.869> potion<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.350> pop

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and if you want the potion just to pop

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.560 
and if you want the potion just to pop
out<00:02:04.799> or<00:02:05.040> something<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.820> want<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.329> mob

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
out or something if you want like a mob

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.449 
out or something if you want like a mob
egg<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.049> drop<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.160> where<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.340> can

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
egg just to drop out and where they can

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.010 
egg just to drop out and where they can
pick<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> up<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:08.970> use<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.179> then<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.869> would

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
pick it up and use it then you would

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.350 
pick it up and use it then you would
need<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.229> do<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> dropper<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.879> hopper

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
need to do a dropper so this is a hopper

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.580 
need to do a dropper so this is a hopper
and<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.959> can<00:02:13.080> see<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> put<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.379> bunch<00:02:13.530> of

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
and so you can see I put a bunch of

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.850 
and so you can see I put a bunch of
stuff

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
stuff

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.950 
stuff
in<00:02:13.950> there<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.310> then<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.820> what<00:02:14.940> happens<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.660> I

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
in there and then so what happens is I

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.930 
in there and then so what happens is I
put<00:02:16.440> another<00:02:16.560> redstone<00:02:17.070> block<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.520> pushes<00:02:17.850> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
put another redstone block it pushes the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.990 
put another redstone block it pushes the
piston<00:02:18.090> down<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.750> then<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.470> break<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.220> it

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
piston down and then I break it and it

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.220 
piston down and then I break it and it
comes<00:02:21.120> back<00:02:21.330> up<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.690> there<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.900> go<00:02:21.960> pop

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
comes back up and there you go pop

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.900 
comes back up and there you go pop
something<00:02:22.500> out<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.370> was<00:02:23.460> kind<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.670> cool

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910

said<00:02:56.820> before<00:02:56.880> like<00:02:57.239> mine<00:02:57.420> was<00:02:57.570> on<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> surface

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
said before like mine was on the surface

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.050 
said before like mine was on the surface
so<00:02:58.830> like<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.070> was<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.489> ground<00:02:59.760> level

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
so like it was just in a ground level

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.190 
so like it was just in a ground level
but<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:00.360> want<00:03:00.540> anymore<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:00.900> particularly

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
but if you want anymore in particularly

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.570 
but if you want anymore in particularly
I'll<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.739> have<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:01.980> make<00:03:02.100> sure<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.489> go

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
I'll just have to make sure that you go

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.490 
I'll just have to make sure that you go
down<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:03.060> wherever<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.050> actually<00:03:04.320> want<00:03:04.440> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
down to wherever you actually want the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.290 
down to wherever you actually want the
block<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.860> be<00:03:04.890> okay<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:05.850> it's<00:03:06.000> very<00:03:06.090> very

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
block to be okay so it's very very

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
block to be okay so it's very very
simple<00:03:06.480> size<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.810> can<00:03:06.900> see<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.140> need<00:03:07.230> a

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
simple size you can see you need a

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.710 
simple size you can see you need a
redstone<00:03:07.500> torch<00:03:07.830> in<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.760> one<00:03:09.000> direction<00:03:09.390> as<00:03:09.510> far

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
redstone torch in a one direction as far

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.390 
redstone torch in a one direction as far
as<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.870> know<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.020> works<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.500> any<00:03:10.709> direction<00:03:11.070> like

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
as I know it works in any direction like

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.229 
as I know it works in any direction like
this<00:03:11.430> alone<00:03:11.700> when<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:11.850> tried<00:03:12.300> one<00:03:13.170> direction

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
this alone when I tried one direction

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.490 
this alone when I tried one direction
but<00:03:15.239> I'm<00:03:15.420> like<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.810> all<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.050> way<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.170> tried

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
but I'm like this all the way I tried

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.170 
but I'm like this all the way I tried
but<00:03:16.709> as<00:03:17.010> far<00:03:17.190> as<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.340> should<00:03:17.760> work<00:03:17.940> at<00:03:18.060> any

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
but as far as it should work at any

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.370 
but as far as it should work at any
direction<00:03:18.420> as<00:03:18.600> far<00:03:18.720> as<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.930> redstone<00:03:19.260> does

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
direction as far as on a redstone does

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.259 
direction as far as on a redstone does
not<00:03:19.530> glitch<00:03:19.799> up<00:03:19.950> weird<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.850> want<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.120> you

this uh this up sticky piston man I'm
gonna<00:03:32.220> call<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.430> slime<00:03:32.730> piston<00:03:33.090> I'm<00:03:33.180> bad<00:03:33.330> today

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
gonna call a slime piston I'm bad today

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.210

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
to stack up stack these up to make the

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.570 
to stack up stack these up to make the
piston<00:03:37.320> actually<00:03:37.530> go<00:03:37.590> upside<00:03:37.920> down

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
piston actually go upside down

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.550 
piston actually go upside down
make<00:03:39.060> your<00:03:39.209> out<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.360> these<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.780> then<00:03:40.230> um<00:03:40.380> you

make your out of these and then um you
want<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.920> piston<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.190> go<00:03:41.250> upside<00:03:41.489> down<00:03:41.519> and

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
want the piston to go upside down and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.180 
want the piston to go upside down and
actually<00:03:41.940> push<00:03:42.299> this<00:03:42.540> block<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.709> if<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:43.860> get<00:03:44.040> it

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
actually push this block so if I get it

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.789 
actually push this block so if I get it
oh<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.610> gotta<00:03:45.360> go<00:03:45.420> down<00:03:45.540> one<00:03:45.720> more<00:03:45.750> down<00:03:46.620> you

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
oh I gotta go down one more down you

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.640 
oh I gotta go down one more down you
minecraft<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.320> there<00:03:49.320> we<00:03:49.380> go

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
minecraft and there we go

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.259 
minecraft and there we go
okay<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.459> now<00:03:50.580> that<00:03:50.640> it's<00:03:50.820> down<00:03:50.940> like<00:03:51.090> that

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
okay so now that it's down like that

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.610 
okay so now that it's down like that
then<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.600> then<00:03:51.810> when<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.140> actually<00:03:52.500> activate

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
then you then when you actually activate

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.110 
then you then when you actually activate
it<00:03:52.980> it'll<00:03:53.130> actually<00:03:53.220> go<00:03:53.489> down<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.880> pick<00:03:53.970> up

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
it it'll actually go down and pick up

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.699 
it it'll actually go down and pick up
that<00:03:54.299> dirt<00:03:54.660> block<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.260> that's<00:03:55.380> what<00:03:55.560> we'll

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
that dirt block and that's what we'll

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.770 
that dirt block and that's what we'll
start<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.670> commotion<00:03:57.299> with<00:03:57.420> everything

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
start the commotion with everything

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.780 
start the commotion with everything
because<00:03:58.650> see<00:03:58.980> if<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.100> missed<00:03:59.280> anything<00:03:59.459> and

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
because see if we missed anything and

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.699 
because see if we missed anything and
then<00:04:00.209> we<00:04:00.420> just<00:04:00.660> need<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.959> hopper<00:04:01.410> or<00:04:01.590> the

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
then we just need the hopper or the

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.590 
then we just need the hopper or the
dropper<00:04:02.100> this<00:04:02.250> time<00:04:02.430> I'll<00:04:02.580> actually<00:04:02.730> use<00:04:02.940> this

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
dropper this time I'll actually use this

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.420 
dropper this time I'll actually use this
dropper<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.170> was<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.380> dropper<00:04:04.709> okay<00:04:04.860> but<00:04:05.340> he's

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
dropper that was a dropper okay but he's

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.860 
dropper that was a dropper okay but he's
a<00:04:05.459> dropper<00:04:05.940> this<00:04:06.090> time<00:04:06.299> so<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:06.540> can<00:04:06.690> see<00:04:06.780> it's

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
a dropper this time so you can see it's

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.210 
a dropper this time so you can see it's
a<00:04:06.900> little<00:04:07.080> bit<00:04:07.170> different<00:04:07.320> Square<00:04:07.769> opening

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
a little bit different Square opening

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.740 
a little bit different Square opening
compared<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.090> one<00:04:09.299> it's<00:04:09.450> like<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.570> little

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
compared to this one it's like a little

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.930 
compared to this one it's like a little
uh<00:04:09.840> it's<00:04:10.440> kind<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.799> a<00:04:10.890> diamond<00:04:11.250> II<00:04:11.430> shape<00:04:11.700> and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
uh it's kind of a diamond II shape and

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.509 
uh it's kind of a diamond II shape and
then<00:04:12.540> let's<00:04:12.720> put<00:04:12.930> in<00:04:13.049> um<00:04:13.230> let's<00:04:13.860> put<00:04:13.980> in<00:04:14.070> some<00:04:14.100> I

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
then let's put in um let's put in some I

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.300 
then let's put in um let's put in some I
guess<00:04:14.940> all<00:04:15.060> ives<00:04:15.209> golden<00:04:15.480> apples<00:04:16.070> put<00:04:17.070> in<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
guess all ives golden apples put in the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.550 
guess all ives golden apples put in the
go<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.669> nab<00:04:17.820> bruise<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.269> then<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.079> cover<00:04:19.440> it

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
go to the nab bruise and then I cover it

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.940

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
it has to be redstone block because the

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.910 
it has to be redstone block because the
redstone<00:04:51.510> block<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:52.200> can<00:04:52.350> see<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.620> actually

activates<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:54.090> that's<00:04:54.480> what<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.690> whole

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
activates that and that's what the whole

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.590 
activates that and that's what the whole
trick<00:04:55.140> is<00:04:55.460> is<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.640> get<00:04:56.730> it<00:04:56.850> to<00:04:56.880> reverse<00:04:57.270> and

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
then when it comes back up then it

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.920 
then when it comes back up then it
reactivates<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.550> dropper<00:05:00.420> dispenser<00:05:00.840> or
