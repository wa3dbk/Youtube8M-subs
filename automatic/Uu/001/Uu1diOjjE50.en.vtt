00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and that's very basic information know

and that's very basic information know
what<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.390> want<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.839> to<00:01:00.960> notice<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.559> is

how<00:01:05.339> they<00:01:05.580> actually<00:01:05.729> execute<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.720> bat<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
how they actually execute the bat of a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.289 
how they actually execute the bat of a
big<00:01:07.890> hand<00:01:08.159> versus<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> strong<00:01:08.850> hand<00:01:09.090> for

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
big hand versus a strong hand for

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.700 
big hand versus a strong hand for
example<00:01:09.690> there's<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.899> lot<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.170> players<00:01:10.500> who

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
example there's a lot of players who

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.080 
example there's a lot of players who
really<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.310> check<00:01:11.520> raise<00:01:11.759> drawers

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
really like to check raise drawers

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.480 
really like to check raise drawers
there's<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> lot<00:01:13.289> of<00:01:13.320> players<00:01:13.649> who<00:01:14.039> if<00:01:14.310> they

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
there's a lot of players who if they

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
there's a lot of players who if they
raised<00:01:14.759> on<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> flop<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.930> means<00:01:16.200> they're

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
raised on the flop it means they're

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.840 
raised on the flop it means they're
probably<00:01:16.500> weaker<00:01:17.190> than<00:01:17.399> if<00:01:17.520> they're<00:01:17.670> raising

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
probably weaker than if they're raising

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.219 
probably weaker than if they're raising
on<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.240> turn<00:01:18.450> they're<00:01:18.690> going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.899> wait<00:01:19.080> until

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
on the turn they're going to wait until

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.889 
on the turn they're going to wait until
the<00:01:19.500> turn<00:01:19.710> there's<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.550> lot<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.819> players<00:01:21.119> for

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
the turn there's a lot of players for

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.450 
the turn there's a lot of players for
example<00:01:22.319> when<00:01:22.560> they're<00:01:22.679> playing<00:01:22.830> no<00:01:23.100> limit

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
example when they're playing no limit

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.180 
example when they're playing no limit
who<00:01:23.880> bet<00:01:24.360> half<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.690> pot<00:01:25.110> every<00:01:25.830> time<00:01:26.039> that

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
who bet half the pot every time that

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.469 
who bet half the pot every time that
they're<00:01:26.369> bluffing<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> whole<00:01:27.210> pot

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
they're bluffing and the whole pot

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.630 
they're bluffing and the whole pot
pretty<00:01:27.780> much<00:01:27.960> every<00:01:28.259> time<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:29.039> they're<00:01:29.280> not

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
pretty much every time that they're not

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.600 
pretty much every time that they're not
bluffing<00:01:30.319> I've<00:01:31.319> suggested<00:01:31.649> that<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.280> bet<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
bluffing I've suggested that you bet the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.969 
bluffing I've suggested that you bet the
whole<00:01:32.759> pot<00:01:33.030> some<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> time<00:01:34.080> but<00:01:34.590> certainly

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
whole pot some of the time but certainly

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.499 
whole pot some of the time but certainly
not<00:01:35.130> all<00:01:35.190> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> time<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.030> when<00:01:36.179> you<00:01:36.270> when<00:01:36.479> you

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
not all of the time so when you when you

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.730 
not all of the time so when you when you
see<00:01:36.720> somebody<00:01:36.929> who<00:01:37.140> has<00:01:37.259> an<00:01:37.380> incredibly

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
see somebody who has an incredibly

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740 
see somebody who has an incredibly
strong<00:01:37.979> pattern<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.179> makes<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.659> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
strong pattern like that it makes it a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.330 
strong pattern like that it makes it a
little<00:01:39.899> bit<00:01:40.140> easier<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> go<00:01:40.770> around<00:01:41.039> and<00:01:41.190> call

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
little bit easier to go around and call

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.010 
little bit easier to go around and call
those<00:01:41.549> half<00:01:41.759> size<00:01:41.970> bats<00:01:42.270> because<00:01:42.600> you've<00:01:42.750> seen

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
those half size bats because you've seen

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.169 
those half size bats because you've seen
what<00:01:43.259> those<00:01:43.409> that's<00:01:43.679> mean<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> want<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
what those that's mean so I want you to

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.359 
what those that's mean so I want you to
always<00:01:45.420> think<00:01:45.630> when<00:01:46.590> you're<00:01:46.679> playing<00:01:46.950> against

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
always think when you're playing against

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
always think when you're playing against
your<00:01:47.490> opponent<00:01:47.880> given<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.539> context<00:01:49.080> of<00:01:49.170> what

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
your opponent given the context of what

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.950 
your opponent given the context of what
he's<00:01:49.560> done<00:01:49.740> at<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> table<00:01:50.310> before<00:01:50.960> I've

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
he's done at the table before I've

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.319 
he's done at the table before I've
actually<00:01:52.259> made<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.950> hand<00:01:53.329> what

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
actually made it to this hand what

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.450 
actually made it to this hand what
exactly<00:01:54.509> does<00:01:55.020> his<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.439> mean<00:01:55.680> example<00:01:56.280> if

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
exactly does his that mean example if

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.039 
exactly does his that mean example if
you<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.090> number<00:01:57.360> who<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:59.659> waiting<00:02:00.659> for

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
you have to number who is waiting for

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.420 
you have to number who is waiting for
you<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.229> act<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.860> they've<00:02:01.979> got<00:02:02.159> all<00:02:02.310> their

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
you to act and they've got all their

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.889 
you to act and they've got all their
money<00:02:02.609> in<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.880> pot<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> there's<00:02:03.479> kind<00:02:03.810> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
money in the pot and there's kind of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.679 
money in the pot and there's kind of
leaning<00:02:04.229> back<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:05.329> you<00:02:06.329> know<00:02:06.450> maybe

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
leaning back like this you know maybe

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.150 
leaning back like this you know maybe
their<00:02:06.930> arms<00:02:07.229> are<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.500> or<00:02:07.649> something<00:02:08.009> like

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
their arms are out or something like

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.029 
their arms are out or something like
this<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:09.299> is<00:02:09.660> somebody<00:02:10.350> trying<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.829> look

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
this that is somebody trying to look

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.289 
this that is somebody trying to look
overly<00:02:11.400> comfortable<00:02:11.730> with<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.150> situation

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
overly comfortable with the situation

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.020 
overly comfortable with the situation
and<00:02:12.930> generally<00:02:13.859> there's<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.340> much<00:02:14.549> greater

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
and generally there's a much greater

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.580 
and generally there's a much greater
likelihood<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:16.019> person<00:02:16.410> is

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
likelihood that that's person is

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.110 
likelihood that that's person is
bluffing<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.190> if<00:02:17.310> you're<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:17.609> fence<00:02:17.790> about

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
bluffing so if you're on the fence about

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.000 
bluffing so if you're on the fence about
the<00:02:18.390> hand<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:19.079> should<00:02:19.260> probably<00:02:19.680> go<00:02:19.829> with

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
the hand you should probably go with

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.800 
the hand you should probably go with
calling<00:02:20.459> there<00:02:20.640> if<00:02:20.820> they're<00:02:21.180> sort<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.480> leaning

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
calling there if they're sort of leaning

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.569 
calling there if they're sort of leaning
back<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:22.470> know<00:02:22.560> probably<00:02:22.920> not<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.430> they're

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
back you know probably not if they're

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.800 
back you know probably not if they're
folding<00:02:23.880> their<00:02:24.000> arms<00:02:24.150> particularly<00:02:24.540> if<00:02:24.720> they

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
folding their arms particularly if they

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.420 
folding their arms particularly if they
have<00:02:24.840> their<00:02:25.140> hands<00:02:25.350> open<00:02:25.590> if<00:02:26.010> they've<00:02:26.160> got<00:02:26.310> an

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
have their hands open if they've got an

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.670 
have their hands open if they've got an
open<00:02:26.790> body<00:02:26.970> posture<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:28.109> generally<00:02:28.530> means

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
open body posture that generally means

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.099 
open body posture that generally means
that<00:02:28.890> they're<00:02:29.010> trying<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.310> convey<00:02:30.109> that

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
that they're trying to convey that
