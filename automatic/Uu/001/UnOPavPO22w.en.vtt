00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:03.740 
drawn back down towards the tip okay
using<00:01:55.670> your<00:01:55.789> tip<00:01:56.000> cutters

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:40.300 

okay<00:02:11.150> clip<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.270> sit<00:02:12.420> down

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.850 

well<00:02:41.310> then<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:41.610> prime<00:02:42.380> with<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.530> attract

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
well then it's prime with the attract

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.740 
well then it's prime with the attract
primer

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.000 

so<00:02:52.320> with<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.560> tip<00:02:52.740> sized<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.930> filed<00:02:55.860> down

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
so with the tip sized and and filed down

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.150 
so with the tip sized and and filed down
to<00:02:56.190> shape<00:02:57.050> we<00:02:58.050> need<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.290> apply<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.590> acrylic<00:02:58.860> to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
to shape we need to apply the acrylic to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.870 
to shape we need to apply the acrylic to
reinforce<00:02:59.670> the<00:03:00.210> whole<00:03:00.390> structure<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.880> and

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
reinforce the whole structure and and

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.240 
reinforce the whole structure and and
once<00:03:03.090> he's<00:03:03.270> clear<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.840> do<00:03:03.960> this<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.740> reinforce

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
once he's clear to do this to reinforce

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.300 
once he's clear to do this to reinforce
the<00:03:06.060> actual<00:03:06.360> tip<00:03:06.540> area<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.170> then<00:03:07.710> use<00:03:07.890> radiant

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the actual tip area and then use radiant

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.240 
the actual tip area and then use radiant
pink<00:03:08.550> behind<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.210> to<00:03:09.450> really<00:03:09.630> heighten<00:03:09.900> the

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
pink behind it to really heighten the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.620 
pink behind it to really heighten the
pinkness<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:11.550> nail<00:03:11.700> plane<00:03:11.940> just<00:03:12.450> give<00:03:12.600> a

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
pinkness of the nail plane just give a

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.220 
pinkness of the nail plane just give a
real<00:03:12.810> two-tone<00:03:13.260> look<00:03:14.630> so<00:03:15.630> place<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.020> brush

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
real two-tone look so place you brush

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.090 
real two-tone look so place you brush
