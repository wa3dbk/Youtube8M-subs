few<00:00:16.500> days<00:00:16.650> ago<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.820> did<00:00:18.390> post<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.869> video<00:00:19.050> on

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
few days ago I I did post a video on

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.160 
few days ago I I did post a video on
them<00:00:19.670> but<00:00:22.550> they<00:00:23.550> were<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.910> process<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.930> can

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
them but they were in process you can

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.620 
them but they were in process you can
say<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:26.070> tried<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.699> kind<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.359> rush

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
say and I tried to just kind of rush

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.009 
say and I tried to just kind of rush
through<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.849> just<00:00:29.849> will<00:00:30.060> let<00:00:30.510> me<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:30.869> this

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
through it I just will let me do this

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.120 
through it I just will let me do this
video<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.800> see<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.940> end<00:00:33.180> result<00:00:33.719> so

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
video so you can see the end result so

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.139 
video so you can see the end result so
you<00:00:35.130> don't<00:00:35.309> necessarily<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.910> watch<00:00:36.120> that

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
you don't necessarily have to watch that

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.020 
you don't necessarily have to watch that
video<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.860> not<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.430> giving<00:00:38.640> you

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
video because it's not really giving you

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.229 
video because it's not really giving you
that<00:00:39.360> much<00:00:39.540> you're<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.930> showing<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:41.239> where

really really really loved them and it

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.549 
really really really loved them and it
was<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.270> ends<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.960> color<00:01:01.170> would<00:01:01.469> have

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
was like the ends of color would have

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.149 
was like the ends of color would have
never<00:01:01.739> chosen<00:01:03.320> by<00:01:04.320> had<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> lying<00:01:04.739> around<00:01:04.890> in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
face yeah so here's where i added this

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.959 
face yeah so here's where i added this
is<00:01:54.360> how<00:01:54.479> i<00:01:54.509> started<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> add-on<00:01:55.290> i<00:01:55.850> liked<00:01:56.850> it

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
is how i started the add-on i liked it

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.990 
is how i started the add-on i liked it
like<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.950> because<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.250> looks<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.820> it's

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
like that because it looks like it's

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.870 
like that because it looks like it's
just<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.270> continuation<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.729> that's<00:02:02.729> exactly

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
just a continuation and that's exactly

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.270 
just a continuation and that's exactly
how<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.540> wanted<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.219> a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
how I wanted it like it's just a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.859 
how I wanted it like it's just a
continuation<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> braid<00:02:06.420> rather<00:02:06.689> than

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
continuation of the braid rather than

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.050 
continuation of the braid rather than
doing<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.290> bad<00:02:07.500> thing<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.520> can<00:02:08.640> see<00:02:08.819> later

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
doing that bad thing you can see later

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.630 
doing that bad thing you can see later
on<00:02:09.149> down<00:02:09.479> here<00:02:09.780> well<00:02:10.200> got<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> bit<00:02:10.530> lazy<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
on down here well got a bit lazy and it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.820 
on down here well got a bit lazy and it
band<00:02:12.030> thing<00:02:12.330> across<00:02:12.810> if<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.350> understand<00:02:13.740> what

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
band thing across if you understand what

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.610 
band thing across if you understand what
I<00:02:13.860> mean<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.880> if<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.390> flip<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.750> just<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.560> know

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
I mean and if I flip it just so you know

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.490 
I mean and if I flip it just so you know
where<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.310> beginning<00:02:17.459> oops<00:02:18.319> just<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:19.380> you

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
where is the beginning oops just so you

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.809 
where is the beginning oops just so you
know<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.830> beginning<00:02:20.069> that's<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.730> other

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
know in the beginning that's the other
