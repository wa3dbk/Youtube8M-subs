00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.420 
because it was a really intense game it
had<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.210> was<00:01:54.299> really<00:01:54.600> hardcore<00:01:54.979> like<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> lot<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
had it was really hardcore like a lot of

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.460 
had it was really hardcore like a lot of
console<00:01:57.119> games<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.780> they<00:01:58.140> can

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
console games and they can

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.070 
console games and they can
trolls<00:01:58.650> were<00:01:58.890> really<00:01:59.220> unique<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.790> cool<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
trolls were really unique and cool the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.100 
trolls were really unique and cool the
storyline<00:02:01.800> was<00:02:02.340> pretty<00:02:02.850> weird<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.540> know<00:02:03.570> it's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
storyline was pretty weird you know it's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.610 
storyline was pretty weird you know it's
about<00:02:04.350> demons<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.160> whatnot<00:02:05.520> zombies<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:07.290> I

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
about demons and whatnot zombies but I

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.800 
about demons and whatnot zombies but I
kind<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.490> considered<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.270> top-down

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
kind of considered it a top-down

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.230 
kind of considered it a top-down
resident<00:02:10.320> evil<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.710> steroids<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.820> if<00:02:12.090> you're
