featuring science ultimate a cool thing

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.910 
featuring science ultimate a cool thing
about<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.380> can<00:00:19.529> actually<00:00:19.710> use

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
your ultimate from base on the blue side

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.960 
your ultimate from base on the blue side
and<00:00:22.529> get<00:00:22.710> through<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.039> jungle<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.609> right

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and get through the jungle and right

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.849 
and get through the jungle and right
into<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.449> Baron<00:00:24.810> pit<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.500> gonna<00:00:25.650> take

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
into the Baron pit this is gonna take

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.380 
into the Baron pit this is gonna take
some<00:00:25.920> careful<00:00:26.400> maneuvering<00:00:26.550> thru<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
some careful maneuvering thru out the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.390 
some careful maneuvering thru out the
jungle<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:27.990> probably<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.590> few<00:00:28.680> tries<00:00:29.160> to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
jungle and probably a few tries to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.189 
jungle and probably a few tries to
understand<00:00:29.880> how<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.179> really<00:00:30.359> works<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.109> if

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
understand how it really works but if

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.359 
understand how it really works but if
you<00:00:31.289> do<00:00:31.410> get<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> hang<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.219> can

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
you do get the hang of this you can

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.190 
you do get the hang of this you can
definitely<00:00:32.550> surprise<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.329> enemy<00:00:33.360> team<00:00:33.870> so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
definitely surprise the enemy team so

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.450 
definitely surprise the enemy team so
you<00:00:34.290> want<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> start<00:00:34.649> off<00:00:34.770> by<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:35.100> straight

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
you want to start off by going straight

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.830 
you want to start off by going straight
and<00:00:35.610> then<00:00:35.700> move<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.329> left<00:00:36.360> very

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
and then move it to the left very

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.660 
and then move it to the left very
slightly<00:00:37.260> once<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.980> get<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.399> point

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
slightly once you get to this point

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.130 
slightly once you get to this point
right<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.270> want<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> start<00:00:39.780> moving<00:00:39.960> your

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
right here you want to start moving your

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.840 
right here you want to start moving your
mouse<00:00:40.379> all<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> way<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.219> right<00:00:41.250> because

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
mouse all the way to the right because

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.400 
mouse all the way to the right because
it<00:00:41.969> does<00:00:42.090> take<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> while<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.750> turn<00:00:42.930> by<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.260> so

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
it does take a while to turn by this so

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.779 
it does take a while to turn by this so
you<00:00:43.469> don't<00:00:43.530> get<00:00:43.770> hit<00:00:43.950> by<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.100> two<00:00:44.370> walls<00:00:44.579> on

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
you don't get hit by the two walls on

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.340 
you don't get hit by the two walls on
the<00:00:44.879> left<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.719> couple<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.020> seconds

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the left in just a couple of seconds

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.139 
the left in just a couple of seconds
later<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.739> see<00:00:46.920> my<00:00:47.039> mouse<00:00:47.250> Jos<00:00:47.640> across<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
later you see my mouse Jos across the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.880 
later you see my mouse Jos across the
screen<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.539> left<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.440> turn<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
screen to the left and that's to turn to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.619 
screen to the left and that's to turn to
avoid<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.489> wall<00:00:50.730> leading<00:00:50.940> into<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> river

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
avoid this wall leading into the river

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.600 
avoid this wall leading into the river
and<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.199> second<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.590> pass<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.010> wall<00:00:53.250> jolt

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and the second you pass that wall jolt

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.369 
and the second you pass that wall jolt
the<00:00:53.699> mouse<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> way<00:00:54.420> back<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.110> right

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the mouse all the way back to the right

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.260 
the mouse all the way back to the right
so<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.010> actually<00:00:56.219> enter<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.789> Baron

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
so that you can actually enter the Baron

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.790 
so that you can actually enter the Baron
pit<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.719> I'm<00:00:58.079> sure<00:00:58.199> most<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.620> are

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
pit and I'm sure most of you are

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.319 
pit and I'm sure most of you are
wondering<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.430> works<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.850> other<00:01:00.030> side

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
wondering if it works on the other side

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.209 
wondering if it works on the other side
of<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> map<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> other<00:01:01.260> team<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.039> most

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
of the map or the other team but it most

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.860 
of the map or the other team but it most
definitely<00:01:02.399> does<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.300> only<00:01:03.480> go<00:01:03.719> into

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
definitely does but you can only go into

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.960 
definitely does but you can only go into
the<00:01:04.049> dragon<00:01:04.470> pit<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> Baron<00:01:05.430> pit<00:01:05.640> but

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the dragon pit not the Baron pit but

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.730 
the dragon pit not the Baron pit but
either<00:01:06.090> way<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.479> trick<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:07.049> similar<00:01:07.530> but

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
either way the trick is very similar but

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.980 
either way the trick is very similar but
it<00:01:07.890> does<00:01:08.040> require<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.490> bit<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.790> practice<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it does require a bit of practice and a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.330 
it does require a bit of practice and a
tip<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.350> somewhat<00:01:10.710> related<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
tip that is somewhat related to the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.490 
tip that is somewhat related to the
previous<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:12.000> Saiyans<00:01:12.420> ultimate<00:01:12.960> tends<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
previous two Saiyans ultimate tends to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
previous two Saiyans ultimate tends to
somewhat<00:01:13.830> drift<00:01:14.310> along<00:01:14.700> walls<00:01:15.090> even<00:01:15.390> though

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570
