nice summary of everything you want to
know<00:02:30.830> regarding<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.480> routers<00:02:33.480> connection

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
know regarding the routers connection

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.500 
know regarding the routers connection
the<00:02:35.910> signal<00:02:36.270> strength<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:37.760> data<00:02:38.760> has<00:02:39.450> been

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
the signal strength the data has been

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.190 
the signal strength the data has been
consumed<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.260> if<00:02:40.320> we<00:02:40.440> look<00:02:40.470> here<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:42.690> says<00:02:42.930> that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
consumed so if we look here it says that

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.810

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
internet connection you can just type

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.390 
internet connection you can just type
and<00:03:26.670> restart<00:03:27.230> because<00:03:28.230> SMS<00:03:28.769> will<00:03:28.980> always<00:03:29.190> talk

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
being up or down and there we go just

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.580 
being up or down and there we go just
restarting<00:03:34.230> itself<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:36.410> expect<00:03:37.410> this

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
restarting itself so expect this

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.229 
restarting itself so expect this
functionality<00:03:38.690> in<00:03:39.690> 6.1<00:03:40.760> with<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.910> following

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
functionality in 6.1 with the following

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.170 
functionality in 6.1 with the following
modems<00:03:42.720> as<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:42.989> see<00:03:43.170> here<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.730> don't<00:03:44.730> expect

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
modems as you see here and don't expect

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.570 
modems as you see here and don't expect
however<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.810> all<00:03:45.989> 4G<00:03:46.950> networks<00:03:47.310> have

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
however that all 4G networks have

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.600 
however that all 4G networks have
support<00:03:48.000> for<00:03:48.150> SMS<00:03:48.860> that's<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.010> tricky<00:03:50.280> part

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
support for SMS that's the tricky part

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.880 
support for SMS that's the tricky part
so<00:03:51.150> here<00:03:51.450> in<00:03:51.540> Sweden<00:03:51.900> we<00:03:51.989> have<00:03:52.140> for<00:03:52.500> mobile

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
so here in Sweden we have for mobile

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.729 
so here in Sweden we have for mobile
operators<00:03:53.430> running<00:03:54.030> 4G<00:03:54.480> but<00:03:55.019> only<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.500> support

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
operators running 4G but only to support

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.210 
operators running 4G but only to support
it<00:03:56.130> so<00:03:56.959> hopefully<00:03:57.959> more<00:03:58.680> will<00:03:59.329> activate<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:00.510> in

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
it so hopefully more will activate it in

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
it so hopefully more will activate it in
because<00:04:02.220> it's<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.430> neat<00:04:02.610> feature<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:03.090> have
