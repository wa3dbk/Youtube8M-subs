00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello belles election is coming up 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.810
 Easter 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.670
 Why I do not like because you like eggs 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.710
 search and find and then is no 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.420
 chocolate in there like chips in it would be 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.600
 probably something else therefore 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:23.279
 I have a whole day for you today 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.650
 is a special that is filled 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.830
 something I got you something 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.269
 really pretty cool myself 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.070
 do not just have this egg for you 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.370
 but also nine others so ten 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.440
 Eggs from a total of ten greetings you 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.969
 you have to find eggs in videos 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.649
 I hid the one today 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.780
 other new gurus also have eggs 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.520
 Hidden you can all the videos with the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.469
 Hidden eggs on magnolia net 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.629
 find and then you look for the eggs 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:56.399
 Together, it matters very much together 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:58.590
 the big ones do not tell with that 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.300
 what you do not get the big 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.460
 count and then you look at the am 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.439
 Easter Sunday over tells you how 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.020
 it goes on where you your number 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.500
 have to send and then there is one 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.750
 winner 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.790
 and he gets ten at ten 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.939
 probably very cool things 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.950
 So very smart, watch and look 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.869
 so through this video and through the video 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.689
 others and be very attentive to the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.119
 look for the eggs and show otherwise 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.259
 So my everyday brush thought to me 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.150
 I'll do something again what a 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.439
 a little more basic is easy because of me 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.240
 at easter probably again 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.310
 wear normal everyday makeup 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.590
 I'll start with it 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.840
 my foundation is what i see there 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.390
 I really like water 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.640
 use any kind I have one of 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.229
 ge cosmetics the foundation asked him 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.540
 I very much like it then I still have 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.549
 bought one of sephora abroad 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.689
 that such a rounded one is stressing you 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.610
 not because it is so I call in 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.740
 Germany is there so rounded 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.570
 weapon also from other brands and what 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.329
 I also like to use it 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.579
 export facebook from realtech nothing i like 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.200
 This is the best way to do it because you like it 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.899
 I find very good foundation in the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.700
 car can work in from all brushes 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.340
 I think this is so streak-free 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.510
 result and what somehow at pr 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.270
 industry's hugest comic 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.940
 word 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.130
 looks and i love brush i am 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.260
 for my face only water and the 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.730
 very much like then maybe shadow 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.770
 I'm usually on the next 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.510
 of my daily routines and on 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.030
 dearest in dom shadow industry also from 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.220
 realtech nies that is a brush that is 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.630
 relatively fluffy but not too fluid 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.970
 and he is not quite as tight as the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.980
 for example, of the 239 of those I'm off 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.450
 used for years did not find with 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.550
 this one comes in a two 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.830
 practically very good over the entire song 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.420
 and somehow I 'm comfortable too 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.910
 use because it keeps so soft and 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.560
 if you want you can also do it in the 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.630
 I work so well for me 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.890
 so multifunction brush if it is 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.450
 somehow have to go fast then take 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.560
 I am taking the concealer for both 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.930
 I do not have your eyes on you yet 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.400
 tried and for the eyelid fold itself 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.020
 if I'm a little bit more 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.640
 I have time every day then I use 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.260
 the mac 219 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.600
 this is a brush i already have 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.340
 for years I love it all 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.990
 think he fits very well in the lid fold 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.700
 rows so that you can as well 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.140
 blind and also here you can 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.610
 By the way, supposedly very good for 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.200
 I also still use concealer 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.480
 not tried are very very nice 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.950
 brush and I think that's where it comes from 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.709
 bound really that out again 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.360
 so is the filling of the brush 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.250
 I like it and I use it a lot 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.110
 very much and I do not have any 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.459
 Real you found so no 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.980
 really replace the brush of things 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.540
 could and I'm afraid you have to 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.100
 then somehow to spend it 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.350
 unless you have a write me 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.300
 then what I do next is one 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.970
 concealer I have the sigma here 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.760
 precision around that is again 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.380
 practically a small brush and what 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.390
 I like the one we like so much 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.190
 So firm is I have the feeling one 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.930
 can do so very well with concealer 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.310
 apply the point and also 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.930
 at the same time a bit outward 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.970
 blind and I'm someone 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.980
 I use concealer less flat 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.600
 paint under the eyes so now and then 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.310
 what I do not necessarily every 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.709
 still not somehow under 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.810
 the children's village the nose around on Unterm 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.640
 chin that would be down here but me 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.590
 wear it more selectively and for it 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.800
 I find the really great there 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.630
 on the internet looks and then for ruse 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.330
 I like to use the mac very much 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.980
 dog 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.750
 bush is such a thing there are people who 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.450
 like very flat brushes and like 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.200
 then do so here the so rather as a 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.180
 assignment 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.310
 I also like to go back in 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.780
 circular movements applied to the 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.610
 The brush here you can practically like that 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.140
 just use a weird because there 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.980
 just so rounded is about to 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.810
 compete 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.070
 it works quite well since then 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.950
 Do not you have to brush it again 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.560
 unpack or just the way the Rector the 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.060
 blush in and then back in 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.440
 circular movements I am on 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.300
 a friend of the circle a movement i 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.370
 I also do not know that feels 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.440
 Relatively natural and it is relatively 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.440
 fast and I really like that 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.610
 brother probably a lot 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.470
 People do not like what I like 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.720
 do because I think that it is the 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.550
 Mostly good make-up katie look 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.710
 I like to use the multi 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.750
 task force from realtech nothing to the 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.910
 example, so well better hide 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.560
 so that it fits better or if 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.610
 I half-brother then used rather like that 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.040
 a German movement because I learned 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.720
 have that if you circle it that way 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.670
 that makes him the foundation 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.590
 and the concealer pushes back and forth 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.090
 I think that's really great as well 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.160
 Generally one can say I am one 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.170
 huge fan of realtech nis brushing 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.720
 i think they are good i like 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.060
 I like the bristles of it 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.620
 are well linked within the meaning of the 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.210
 example of the expert facebook is very 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.770
 very firm here a bit 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.750
 Florida and this one is here too 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.740
 not so there is so la briegel 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.000
 I think they are white 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.520
 get the well clean I think the 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.290
 Great, that's really mine 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.360
 brush revolution actually been in 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.460
 the last few months you mentioned 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:05.940
 these are my everyday jigsaw puzzle that i have 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:07.380
 I love to use it, I hope it has you 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.240
 something we can do 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.280
 make video answers with your everyday life 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.660
 seen or if you have the recommendation 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.310
 I have to choose from for example 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.010
 never tried brush that would be 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.000
 maybe an idea and then wish 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:23.550
 I wish you a beautiful Easter 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.410
