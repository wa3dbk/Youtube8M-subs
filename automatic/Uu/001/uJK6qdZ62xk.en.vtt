00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.349
 and 0.12 point zero so it makes me very 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.730
 fast but at the same time very cool that 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.500
 good the truth that the developers 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.289
 They are really looking forward and they are 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.930
 working super super fast and already 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.850
 arranging books as well as guys today in 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.279
 this video in the premiere the list of 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 changes for the wild 2 and later 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.630
 You can download the apk as soon as you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.460
 you get know that it takes a little bit in 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.550
 leave so good let's start with 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.739
 the change list good first things 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.590
 new ones that were added are only three and 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.670
 I'm going to read them one they added a button 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.440
 to domesticate the ocelots of the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.030
 guards to which are the button 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.440
 the typical ones that now appear in 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.270
 screen for example when you want 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.030
 ride in a mine cart or 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.640
 explode or woman and but or things like that 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.010
 good by adding that button then 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.370
 they made the controls at the time of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.559
 fly were a little smaller 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.990
 they did that now when I break the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.880
 plantations always always always you 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.490
 is going to run over seeds which I 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.259
 it seems fine I do not know if it's like that in fish 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.310
 all the time in fact I'm not sure 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.940
 but good now when we break this 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.680
 plantations we will always have 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.840
 seeds which is fine for then 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.869
 to be able to quickly reproduce our 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.600
 plantations and now yes guys is going the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.330
 list of arranged books know that the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.460
 I really had many books this is 0.12 but 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.740
 well now I say that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.390
 they put to work and if I'm going to read them 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.119
 first or that here we start with the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.670
 list first that now it's going to be 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.160
 possible or good hopefully put on the list 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.039
 that it is possible to start opening the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.840
 application on android 4.2 down 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.399
 because if a lot of people see me 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.080
 the problem is but apparently it is already 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.690
 rule with windows 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:00.060
 then he fixed a skull when he opened 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.190
 the control command screen if the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.899
 you wanted to set up keys and will then 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.300
 it's a great class or what would happen if 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.440
 you stay a long time in the biomes of 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.570
 snow 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.920
 many skulls were fixed in 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.320
 multiplayer and it was revealed that the sprint 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.380
 did not stop if you did for the 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.760
 right to the left with the button 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.920
 diagonal to the left audio or 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.460
 diagonal to the right it was arranged that 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:32.100
 Now you can pull squid with the cane 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:34.170
 of fishing and now I know if they also come out or 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.630
 of the climate that according to did not end well 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.880
 that there were good certain books and when 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.310
 we finished the application like I do not know 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.920
 it ended well and they are making us very 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.680
 well what it says but the weather does not 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.910
 it ended well to close when 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.040
 ended when he closed all the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.080
 Minecraft application and I was consumed 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.770
 memories ram more than good good then 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.870
 the effects of portal is now so good 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.660
 Now they show up when you get in 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.370
 inside the portal 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.080
 the school of snowballs does not 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.780
 they change their color never again in moments 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.390
 random magma cubes now jump 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.580
 correctly the multiplayer 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.010
 it was arranged that now he is able to 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.150
 move the character that already sorry of 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.709
 that you are no longer able to move the 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.690
 character when you are on a screen 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:23.390
 start or on a screen then 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.070
 interface or of or of menus or things like that 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.930
 because they remember that in the video of 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.140
 testing the controls because if you moved 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.700
 with control in the pause or in the 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.959
 inventory as it was still moving the 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.090
 nice but good, they fixed it 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.690
 he also arranged that you could not 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.030
 get out of control and you could not 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.340
 give back with touch also comes out 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.650
 then the enchantment of touch of 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.140
 Silk is good for grabbing blocks 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.060
 of grass also arranged that already 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.160
 it serves well the field forgiveness that good me 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.959
 I'm testing the Avila on lap 1 and 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.910
 like I could not use it well in fact 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.890
 but he gave him repaired tool 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.410
 I just could not even put things to the 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.870
 mili good had been fixed then it 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.239
 he revealed that the game showed him a face 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.040
 medium then remember good I did 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.650

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.540

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.940
 goals but if my video showed the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.420
 golem that did not appear to the head 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.820
 pumpkin 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.620
 some people but good now yes already 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.730
 you will always look like your head 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.139
 pumpkin and finally it was arranged that 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.030
 if you for example put it 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.520
 They voltearÃ¡n controls jump and 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.319

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.789
 on the way out, it was manifested 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.550
 focus on saved that configuration 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.840
