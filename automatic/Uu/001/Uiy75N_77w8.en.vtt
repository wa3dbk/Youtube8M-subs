00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
I mean maybe just everybody can just

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.150 
I mean maybe just everybody can just
chill<00:00:48.180> out<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.450> we'll<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.750> develop<00:00:49.110> right<00:00:49.350> I

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
mean this is this is much better because

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.650 
mean this is this is much better because
it<00:00:54.809> forces<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.440> move<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.890> now<00:00:59.420> I'm<00:01:00.420> not

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
more I think I got to be a little

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.930 
more I think I got to be a little
careful<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.740> knight<00:04:29.920> of<00:04:29.950> c-4<00:04:30.460> is<00:04:30.550> actually

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
careful the knight of c-4 is actually

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.100 
careful the knight of c-4 is actually
kind<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.240> loose<00:04:34.800> whatever<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:36.040> think<00:04:36.310> it's<00:04:36.430> cool

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
kind of loose whatever I think it's cool

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.810 
kind of loose whatever I think it's cool
I'm<00:04:38.110> just<00:04:38.260> gonna<00:04:38.380> go<00:04:38.530> that<00:04:38.680> far<00:04:39.220> but<00:04:39.610> what<00:04:39.790> I

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
I'm just gonna go that far but what I

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.950 
I'm just gonna go that far but what I
was<00:04:40.000> thinking<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.300> if<00:04:40.360> he<00:04:40.480> played<00:04:40.630> Knight<00:04:40.810> be

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
was thinking is if he played Knight be

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.800 
was thinking is if he played Knight be
three<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:41.470> then<00:04:41.920> Bishop<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:42.310> f2<00:04:42.670> know<00:04:43.600> but

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
three and then Bishop to f2 know but

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.910 
three and then Bishop to f2 know but
then<00:04:43.930> he<00:04:43.960> can't<00:04:44.230> even<00:04:44.410> kick<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.650> night<00:04:44.830> he

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
then he can't even kick the night he

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.860 
then he can't even kick the night he
didn't<00:04:45.190> even<00:04:45.310> matter<00:04:45.520> it<00:04:46.060> was<00:04:46.210> all<00:04:46.360> irrelevant

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
didn't even matter it was all irrelevant

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.900 
didn't even matter it was all irrelevant
so<00:04:47.380> okay<00:04:47.590> so<00:04:47.620> I<00:04:47.800> got<00:04:47.950> pressure<00:04:48.130> on<00:04:48.250> c2<00:04:48.520> but<00:04:48.880> I

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
so okay so I got pressure on c2 but I

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.300 
so okay so I got pressure on c2 but I
gotta<00:04:49.120> go<00:04:49.270> really<00:04:49.480> fast

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.540 

probably<00:04:54.310> better<00:04:54.430> was<00:04:54.669> d5<00:04:55.030> there<00:04:56.550> but

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
probably better was d5 there but
