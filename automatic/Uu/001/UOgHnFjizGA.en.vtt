00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
don't know man

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.270 
don't know man
I<00:02:10.970> think<00:02:11.750> they've<00:02:11.900> done<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.620> pretty<00:02:12.980> good<00:02:13.130> job

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
I think they've done a pretty good job

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.670 
I think they've done a pretty good job
as<00:02:13.700> far<00:02:13.730> as<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.810> listening<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.530> community

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
as far as you listening to the community

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.120 
as far as you listening to the community
I<00:02:16.190> think<00:02:16.820> they<00:02:16.940> patched<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.600> ball<00:02:17.900> or<00:02:18.200> they<00:02:18.650> at

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
I think they patched the ball or they at

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.180 
I think they patched the ball or they at
least<00:02:19.310> load<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.850> damage<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.870> they<00:02:21.470> nerfed<00:02:22.040> it

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
least load the damage and they nerfed it

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.770 
least load the damage and they nerfed it
a<00:02:22.250> little<00:02:22.430> bit<00:02:22.640> which<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:22.970> good<00:02:23.210> one<00:02:23.540> thing

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
a little bit which is good one thing

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.350 
a little bit which is good one thing
that<00:02:23.960> they<00:02:24.080> did<00:02:24.140> do<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.770> they<00:02:25.580> increase<00:02:26.180> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
that they did do is they increase the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.870 
that they did do is they increase the
power<00:02:26.510> on<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.230> em1<00:02:27.620> which<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.370> laser<00:02:28.700> gun

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
power on the em1 which is a laser gun

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.050 
power on the em1 which is a laser gun
and<00:02:29.300> they<00:02:29.570> made<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:30.080> extremely<00:02:31.060> extremely

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
and they made that extremely extremely

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.790 
and they made that extremely extremely
powerful<00:02:32.390> I'm<00:02:33.110> not<00:02:33.290> gonna<00:02:33.440> say<00:02:33.650> it's

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
powerful I'm not gonna say it's

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.030 
powerful I'm not gonna say it's
overpowered<00:02:34.340> because<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:35.810> not<00:02:36.620> even<00:02:36.860> close
