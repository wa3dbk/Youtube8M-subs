00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
there's no recoil on the assault rifles

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.929 
there's no recoil on the assault rifles
and<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:35.009> doesn't<00:01:35.310> look<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.729> kill

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
and it doesn't look like they kill

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.149 
and it doesn't look like they kill
extremely<00:01:36.450> quick<00:01:36.659> usually<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.439> campaign<00:01:37.920> they

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
extremely quick usually on campaign they

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.380 
extremely quick usually on campaign they
die<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> little<00:01:38.549> bit<00:01:38.759> quicker<00:01:38.880> than<00:01:39.150> normal

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
die a little bit quicker than normal

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.870 
die a little bit quicker than normal
players<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.380> from<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.250> I'm<00:01:41.369> guessing<00:01:41.579> is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
players but from what I'm guessing is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.730 
players but from what I'm guessing is
this<00:01:42.060> there's<00:01:42.570> gonna<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> lot<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.110> guns<00:01:43.409> with

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
this there's gonna be a lot of guns with

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
this there's gonna be a lot of guns with
no<00:01:43.950> recoil<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.540> carry<00:01:45.750> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
no recoil and it's not going to carry a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.810 
no recoil and it's not going to carry a
lot<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.259> damage<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.950> feel<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.640> going<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
lot of damage I feel like it's going to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.550 
lot of damage I feel like it's going to
be<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> mix<00:01:48.210> between<00:01:48.329> modeling<00:01:48.869> fair<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.170> damage

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
be a mix between modeling fair to damage

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.679 
be a mix between modeling fair to damage
and<00:01:49.770> model<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.159> 3<00:01:50.460> damage<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.360> fact<00:01:51.570> that

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and model for 3 damage in the fact that

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.060 
and model for 3 damage in the fact that
being<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.200> my<00:01:52.380> own<00:01:52.409> affairs<00:01:52.649> 3<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.920> died

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
being in my own affairs 3 you died

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.190 
being in my own affairs 3 you died
almost<00:01:53.280> instantly<00:01:53.490> modern<00:01:54.240> 43<00:01:54.570> took<00:01:54.840> quite<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
almost instantly modern 43 took quite a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.539 
almost instantly modern 43 took quite a
bit<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.409> shots<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> feel<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.219> it's<00:01:56.399> going

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
bit of shots and I feel like it's going

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.149 
bit of shots and I feel like it's going
to<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.969> between<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.409> you're

and final stand in last and we're in a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.380

couple<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.190> modern<00:02:17.459> warfare<00:02:17.550> series<00:02:17.790> and

couple of the modern warfare series and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.720 
couple of the modern warfare series and
now<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.230> would<00:02:19.380> lead<00:02:19.620> me<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.100> believe<00:02:20.250> is

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
now that would lead me to believe is

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.720 
now that would lead me to believe is
that<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.300> think<00:02:22.110> they<00:02:22.230> took<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.920> day<00:02:23.250> amped<00:02:23.610> up

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
that I think they took the day amped up

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.390 
that I think they took the day amped up
the<00:02:24.090> monomer<00:02:24.959> fair<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.290> or<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.160> modern

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
the monomer fair to or the modern

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.880 
the monomer fair to or the modern
warfare<00:02:26.520> 3<00:02:26.640> engine<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.450> made<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.680> lot

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
warfare 3 engine and made it a lot

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.940 
warfare 3 engine and made it a lot
better<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.760> coming<00:02:30.510> up<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.900> next<00:02:30.930> 20<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.590> 30

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
better so coming up in the next 20 to 30

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.290 
better so coming up in the next 20 to 30
seconds<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.400> guys<00:02:32.580> are<00:02:32.730> going<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.910> see<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
seconds you guys are going to see the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.059 
seconds you guys are going to see the
shotgun<00:02:33.690> which<00:02:33.840> looks<00:02:34.080> badass<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.830> laser

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
shotgun which looks badass the laser

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.710 
shotgun which looks badass the laser
that<00:02:35.310> looks<00:02:35.489> badass<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.150> guy<00:02:36.300> going<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.600> a

that looks badass and the guy going in a
final<00:02:37.050> stand<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.830> that's<00:02:38.010> what<00:02:38.190> leads<00:02:38.430> me<00:02:38.610> to

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
believe is that this game is going to

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.710 
believe is that this game is going to
feel<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> modern<00:02:41.340> warfare<00:02:41.580> 3<00:02:41.760> modern

right<00:03:07.350> here<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> guy<00:03:07.680> drops<00:03:07.890> into<00:03:08.100> final

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
right here the guy drops into final

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.830 
right here the guy drops into final
stand<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.819> that's<00:03:08.970> just<00:03:09.090> what<00:03:09.330> leads<00:03:09.569> me<00:03:09.750> to

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
stand and that's just what leads me to

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.240 
stand and that's just what leads me to
believe<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.290> game<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.739> gonna<00:03:10.860> be<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.190> a

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
believe this game is gonna be like a

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.540 
believe this game is gonna be like a
model<00:03:11.580> for<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.730> 3<00:03:11.940> type<00:03:12.120> game<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.620> I'm<00:03:14.130> almost

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
model for a 3 type game and I'm almost

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.790 
model for a 3 type game and I'm almost
positive<00:03:14.819> i<00:03:15.330> feel<00:03:15.930> like<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.290> guns<00:03:16.470> are<00:03:16.620> gonna

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
positive i feel like the guns are gonna

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.470 
positive i feel like the guns are gonna
have<00:03:16.950> much<00:03:17.100> recoil<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.760> think<00:03:18.269> they're<00:03:18.360> gonna

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
have much recoil I think they're gonna

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.560 
have much recoil I think they're gonna
hit<00:03:18.660> fairly<00:03:18.900> hard<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.579> I'm<00:03:20.579> super<00:03:21.060> stoked<00:03:21.390> for

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
hit fairly hard and I'm super stoked for

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.970 
hit fairly hard and I'm super stoked for
it<00:03:21.720> looks<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:22.079> it's<00:03:22.260> gonna<00:03:22.350> be<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.560> lot<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.739> gun

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
it looks like it's gonna be a lot of gun

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.949 
it looks like it's gonna be a lot of gun
on<00:03:23.100> gun<00:03:23.340> hopefully<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.730> have<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.060> feeling<00:03:24.480> that

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
on gun hopefully I have a feeling that

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.539 
on gun hopefully I have a feeling that
the<00:03:25.170> killstreaks<00:03:25.620> might<00:03:25.829> be<00:03:25.980> like<00:03:26.100> black<00:03:26.340> ops

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
trailer kind of like a modern for a

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.080

three<00:04:31.290> type<00:04:31.470> game<00:04:31.710> that<00:04:32.460> gun<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:32.850> he<00:04:32.970> was
