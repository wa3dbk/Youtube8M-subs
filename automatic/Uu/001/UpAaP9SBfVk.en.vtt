have two important features they have

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.660 
have two important features they have
upset<00:00:58.780> tool<00:00:59.109> joints<00:00:59.679> which<00:00:59.859> is<00:01:00.039> to<00:01:00.219> say<00:01:00.429> the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
upset tool joints which is to say the

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.719 
upset tool joints which is to say the
threaded<00:01:01.059> connectors<00:01:01.600> on<00:01:01.899> each<00:01:02.139> end<00:01:02.499> are

threaded connectors on each end are

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.120 
threaded connectors on each end are
larger<00:01:03.729> in<00:01:03.940> diameter<00:01:04.180> in<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.290> long<00:01:05.500> section

slip assembly it cannot fall through

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.820 
slip assembly it cannot fall through
because<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.790> upset<00:01:22.270> tool<00:01:22.510> joint<00:01:22.870> is<00:01:23.080> larger

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
because the upset tool joint is larger

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.280 
because the upset tool joint is larger
than<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.220> opening<00:01:24.640> in<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:24.880> bowl<00:01:25.290> furthermore
