00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
here what these pipes actually look like

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.749 
here what these pipes actually look like
when<00:00:30.539> they're<00:00:30.810> stock<00:00:31.340> because<00:00:32.340> obviously

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
when they're stock because obviously

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760

to them normally they don't have all
this<00:00:36.809> stuff<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.250> put<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.090> uh<00:00:39.300> put<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
this stuff so I put the uh put the

this stuff so I put the uh put the
header<00:00:39.750> tape<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.320> there<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.629> add<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
header tape on there and then add the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.860 
header tape on there and then add the
middle<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.590> collector<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.670> add<00:00:45.030> powder-coated

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
middle the collector I add powder-coated

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.830 
middle the collector I add powder-coated
black<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.670> actually<00:00:48.180> powder<00:00:48.390> coated

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
black and this is actually powder coated

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.350 
black and this is actually powder coated
as<00:00:48.989> well<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.010> aluminum<00:00:51.000> finish

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
as well but it's a aluminum finish

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.260 
as well but it's a aluminum finish
powder<00:00:51.960> coating<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.890> he'll<00:00:53.579> say<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.000> shiny

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
powder coating so he'll say that shiny

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.639 
powder coating so he'll say that shiny
hold<00:00:54.539> I'm<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.870> dirty<00:00:55.050> now<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.500> I've<00:00:55.590> been

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
hold I'm so dirty now because I've been

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.700 
hold I'm so dirty now because I've been
riding<00:00:55.860> around<00:00:56.210> opener<00:00:57.210> system<00:00:57.899> doesn't<00:00:58.320> come

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
riding around opener system doesn't come

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.590 
riding around opener system doesn't come
with<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> baffle<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.670> this<00:01:00.480> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
with a baffle and this I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.280 
with a baffle and this I
can<00:01:01.109> only<00:01:01.350> assume<00:01:01.530> would<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.100> insanely<00:01:02.670> loud

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
can only assume would be insanely loud

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.780 
can only assume would be insanely loud
without<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.500> baffle<00:01:04.979> cuz<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.369> pretty<00:01:05.580> loud

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
without a baffle cuz it's so pretty loud

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.420 
without a baffle cuz it's so pretty loud
with<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> baffle<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.049> install<00:01:07.920> don't<00:01:08.250> know<00:01:08.340> if

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
with a baffle so I install don't know if

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.330 
with a baffle so I install don't know if
you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.670> see<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.270> there<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.470> installed<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
you can see it in there but installed a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.830 
you can see it in there but installed a
Samson<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:13.229> six<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:13.850> baffle<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.090> had<00:01:15.750> to

Samson a one six one baffle that had to
be<00:01:15.930> custom<00:01:16.860> fit<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.250> there<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.759> probably

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
be custom fit in there you can probably

be custom fit in there you can probably
see<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.600> bolted<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.610> had<00:01:20.610> it'll<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:20.850> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
see I just bolted it in had it'll do a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.640 
see I just bolted it in had it'll do a
little<00:01:21.119> bit<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> Jenny<00:01:21.689> today<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.259> baffle

little bit of Jenny today the baffle

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.399 
little bit of Jenny today the baffle
wasn't<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.340> hard<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.790> install<00:01:24.409> it

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
wasn't really that hard to install it

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.490 
wasn't really that hard to install it
kind<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.740> fit<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.009> there<00:01:26.250> pretty<00:01:26.909> well<00:01:27.500> if

you<00:01:53.520> know<00:01:53.640> anywhere<00:01:54.090> from<00:01:54.170> 170<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.200> 175

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
you know anywhere from 170 to 175

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.480 
you know anywhere from 170 to 175
rear-wheel<00:01:57.030> horsepower<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.170> thing<00:01:58.490> so

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
rear-wheel horsepower on this thing so

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.670 
rear-wheel horsepower on this thing so
I'm<00:01:59.700> pretty<00:02:00.090> pretty<00:02:00.509> stoked<00:02:00.840> about<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.140> and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
I'm pretty pretty stoked about that and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.950 
I'm pretty pretty stoked about that and
it<00:02:01.829> has<00:02:01.920> made<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> huge<00:02:02.189> huge<00:02:03.149> difference<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
it has made a huge huge difference and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.990 
it has made a huge huge difference and
it<00:02:04.530> sounds<00:02:05.009> pretty<00:02:05.040> good<00:02:05.280> too<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:05.790> about<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
it sounds pretty good too I'm about to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.160 
it sounds pretty good too I'm about to
fire<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.450> here<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.899> know<00:02:06.990> what<00:02:07.110> I'm

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
fire it up here so you know what I'm

00:02:07.170 --> 00:03:19.830 
fire it up here so you know what I'm
talking<00:02:07.500> about

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.420 

all<00:03:20.840> right<00:03:21.019> so<00:03:21.349> um<00:03:22.930> one<00:03:23.930> downside<00:03:24.650> of<00:03:24.950> this<00:03:25.159> is

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
all right so um one downside of this is

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.449 
all right so um one downside of this is
just<00:03:26.439> and<00:03:27.439> I<00:03:27.530> don't<00:03:27.650> know<00:03:27.739> exactly<00:03:28.099> what<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.280> do

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
just and I don't know exactly what I do

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:28.990 
just and I don't know exactly what I do
about<00:03:28.549> it

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
about it

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.860 
about it
is<00:03:29.239> this<00:03:30.140> pipe<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.920> gets<00:03:31.189> so<00:03:31.670> blazing<00:03:32.659> hot

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
is this pipe it gets so blazing hot

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.960 
is this pipe it gets so blazing hot
because<00:03:33.290> this<00:03:33.409> is<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.560> true<00:03:33.890> two<00:03:34.159> inch<00:03:34.370> system

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
because this is a true two inch system

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.330 
because this is a true two inch system
that<00:03:35.599> means<00:03:35.840> there's<00:03:36.110> no<00:03:36.349> this<00:03:37.040> is<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.280> only

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
that means there's no this is the only

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.890 
that means there's no this is the only
heat<00:03:37.670> protection<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.150> have<00:03:38.360> on<00:03:38.599> it

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
heat protection I have on it

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.690 
heat protection I have on it
so<00:03:39.409> uh<00:03:40.209> this<00:03:41.209> will<00:03:41.450> melt<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.530> mean<00:03:43.280> just

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
so uh this will melt you I mean just

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.699 
so uh this will melt you I mean just
instantly<00:03:44.299> insanely<00:03:45.079> hot

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
instantly insanely hot

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.460 
instantly insanely hot
so<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.970> does<00:03:47.209> there<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:47.540> a<00:03:47.659> you<00:03:47.989> do<00:03:48.140> have<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.379> be

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
so it does there is a you do have to be

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.050 
so it does there is a you do have to be
pretty<00:03:48.650> careful<00:03:48.920> when<00:03:49.489> you<00:03:49.609> start<00:03:49.849> in<00:03:49.939> this

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
pretty careful when you start in this

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.520 
pretty careful when you start in this
thing<00:03:50.269> when<00:03:50.480> you're<00:03:50.629> sitting<00:03:51.140> at<00:03:51.230> stoplights

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
thing when you're sitting at stoplights

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.180 
thing when you're sitting at stoplights
because<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.670> will<00:03:53.209> you<00:03:53.450> up<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:54.590> so<00:03:55.040> as

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
because it will you up and so as

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.500 
because it will you up and so as
far<00:03:55.250> as<00:03:55.400> power<00:03:55.700> gains<00:03:55.940> I'm<00:03:56.150> probably<00:03:56.329> gonna

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
far as power gains I'm probably gonna

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.180 
far as power gains I'm probably gonna
I'm<00:03:56.780> probably<00:03:56.900> going<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.260> do<00:03:57.349> another<00:03:57.379> zero<00:03:58.040> to

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
I'm probably going to do another zero to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.740 
I'm probably going to do another zero to
sixty<00:03:58.670> zero<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.389> a<00:03:59.510> hundred<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.379> a<00:04:01.750> street

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
sixty zero to a hundred and a street

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.449 
sixty zero to a hundred and a street
start<00:04:03.139> which<00:04:03.379> is<00:04:03.409> five<00:04:03.769> miles<00:04:04.040> an<00:04:04.190> hour<00:04:04.310> to

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
start which is five miles an hour to

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.250 
start which is five miles an hour to
sixty<00:04:04.790> miles<00:04:04.940> an<00:04:05.090> hour<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.510> see<00:04:06.049> where<00:04:06.230> my

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
sixty miles an hour and see where my

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.819 
sixty miles an hour and see where my
times<00:04:06.650> are<00:04:07.150> as<00:04:08.150> compared<00:04:08.659> to<00:04:08.810> stock<00:04:09.109> even

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
times are as compared to stock even

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.050 
times are as compared to stock even
though<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.040> wasn't<00:04:10.280> actually<00:04:10.430> stock<00:04:10.819> before

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
though it wasn't actually stock before

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.869 
though it wasn't actually stock before
so<00:04:11.659> I<00:04:11.720> some<00:04:11.959> stuff<00:04:12.170> done<00:04:12.349> to<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:12.680> one<00:04:13.579> really

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
so I some stuff done to it one really

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.369 
so I some stuff done to it one really
cool<00:04:14.120> thing<00:04:14.180> about<00:04:14.569> it<00:04:14.780> now<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:15.139> it<00:04:15.170> would

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
cool thing about it now is it would

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.840 
cool thing about it now is it would
always<00:04:15.739> I'm<00:04:16.010> sure<00:04:16.130> everybody<00:04:16.459> seen<00:04:16.729> the

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
always I'm sure everybody seen the

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.060 
always I'm sure everybody seen the
triumph<00:04:17.269> rocket<00:04:17.660> three<00:04:17.870> wheelie<00:04:18.229> videos<00:04:18.560> and

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
triumph rocket three wheelie videos and

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.659 
triumph rocket three wheelie videos and
I<00:04:19.400> could<00:04:19.579> do<00:04:19.729> a<00:04:19.760> wheelie<00:04:20.000> on<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.479> but<00:04:21.229> now<00:04:21.669> it's

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
I could do a wheelie on it but now it's

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.020 
I could do a wheelie on it but now it's
insane<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.479> mean<00:04:23.660> it<00:04:24.199> is<00:04:24.500> just<00:04:25.039> roll<00:04:25.610> on

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
insane I mean it is just roll on

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.510 
insane I mean it is just roll on
wheelies<00:04:26.840> with<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.289> no<00:04:27.560> clutch<00:04:27.830> no<00:04:28.220> clutch

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520
