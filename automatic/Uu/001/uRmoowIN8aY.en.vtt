decided to get him a cart which worked

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.880 
decided to get him a cart which worked
quite<00:00:41.640> well<00:00:41.670> but<00:00:42.149> they<00:00:42.719> limit<00:00:43.260> his<00:00:43.379> mobility

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
quite well but they limit his mobility

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.260 
quite well but they limit his mobility
in<00:00:44.070> terms<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.520> being<00:00:44.670> able<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.910> play<00:00:45.120> with

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
in terms of being able to play with

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.660 
in terms of being able to play with
other<00:00:45.420> dogs<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.860> not<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.460> full

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
other dogs and it's not really the full

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.049 
other dogs and it's not really the full
motion<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.180> running<00:00:49.460> Fidelis<00:00:50.460> project<00:00:50.850> we're

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
motion of running Fidelis project we're

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.090 
motion of running Fidelis project we're
using<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.390> variety<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.930> 3d<00:00:52.289> technologies<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
using a variety of 3d technologies and

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.920 
using a variety of 3d technologies and
that<00:00:53.579> allows<00:00:53.789> us<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.059> getting<00:00:54.420> there<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
that allows us to getting there and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.520 
that allows us to getting there and
really<00:00:55.410> modify<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:56.789> organic<00:00:57.300> digital<00:00:58.199> models

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
really modify the organic digital models

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.250 
really modify the organic digital models
quickly<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> easily<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.910> start<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
quickly and easily and start to do the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.990 
quickly and easily and start to do the
sort<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.530> designs<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.309> Derek<00:01:02.609> wants<00:01:02.850> us<00:01:02.969> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
sort of designs that Derek wants us to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.410 
sort of designs that Derek wants us to
do<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.949> great<00:01:05.129> thing<00:01:05.339> about<00:01:05.460> using<00:01:06.000> 3d

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
do the great thing about using 3d

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.260 
do the great thing about using 3d
technology<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.110> Derby's<00:01:07.439> case<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:08.270> having

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
technology and Derby's case is having

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
technology and Derby's case is having
these<00:01:09.390> images<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.930> file<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> computer<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
these images on file on a computer and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.910 
these images on file on a computer and
being<00:01:11.490> able<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.700> print<00:01:11.939> them<00:01:12.260> is<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.560> lot

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
being able to print them is a lot

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.149 
being able to print them is a lot
quicker<00:01:14.640> than<00:01:15.090> having<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.140> hand<00:01:16.350> sculpt<00:01:16.770> every

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
quicker than having to hand sculpt every

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.460 
quicker than having to hand sculpt every
single<00:01:17.520> mould<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.210> rebuild<00:01:18.689> these<00:01:18.930> braces

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
single mould and rebuild these braces

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.870 
single mould and rebuild these braces
5-10<00:01:20.430> times

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.660 

with<00:01:23.720> prosthetics<00:01:24.530> in<00:01:24.619> general<00:01:24.950> but<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.400> lot<00:01:25.640> of

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
with prosthetics in general but a lot of

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.130 
with prosthetics in general but a lot of
the<00:01:25.909> designs<00:01:26.210> are<00:01:26.360> going<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.659> this<00:01:26.780> running

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
the designs are going to this running

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.980 
the designs are going to this running
man<00:01:27.170> sort<00:01:27.619> of<00:01:27.770> look<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:29.450> I<00:01:29.509> was<00:01:29.659> concerned

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
man sort of look and I was concerned

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.280 
man sort of look and I was concerned
with<00:01:30.560> doing<00:01:31.159> a<00:01:31.400> running<00:01:31.700> man<00:01:31.909> that<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:33.140> he

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
with doing a running man that that he

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.690 
with doing a running man that that he
would<00:01:33.409> end<00:01:33.560> up<00:01:33.619> digging<00:01:33.890> them<00:01:34.130> into<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.490> dirt

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
would end up digging them into the dirt

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.820 
would end up digging them into the dirt
and<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.240> that's<00:01:35.810> really<00:01:35.899> where<00:01:36.259> I<00:01:36.500> came<00:01:36.710> up

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
and so that's really where I came up

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.469 
and so that's really where I came up
with<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.979> loop<00:01:37.250> idea<00:01:38.350> hey<00:01:39.350> jerk<00:01:40.000> your<00:01:41.000> new<00:01:41.149> legs

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
with a loop idea hey jerk your new legs

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.190 
with a loop idea hey jerk your new legs
we<00:01:42.440> started<00:01:42.680> him<00:01:42.799> off<00:01:42.830> very<00:01:43.039> low<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:44.630> that

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
we started him off very low and so that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.740 
we started him off very low and so that
it<00:01:45.259> wouldn't<00:01:45.440> be<00:01:45.500> too<00:01:45.680> drastic<00:01:46.509> we<00:01:47.509> have<00:01:47.720> a

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
it wouldn't be too drastic we have a

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.990 
it wouldn't be too drastic we have a
line<00:01:48.110> called<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.500> project<00:01:48.890> 5500<00:01:49.700> which

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
line called the project 5500 which

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.200 
line called the project 5500 which
enables<00:01:50.630> us<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.840> run<00:01:51.259> dual<00:01:52.100> materials<00:01:52.670> that

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
enables us to run dual materials that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.410 
enables us to run dual materials that
has<00:01:53.479> really<00:01:53.750> been<00:01:53.930> key<00:01:54.289> with<00:01:55.090> designing<00:01:56.090> his

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
has really been key with designing his

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.609 
has really been key with designing his
prosthetics<00:01:57.110> I<00:01:57.350> guess<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:59.140> don't<00:02:00.140> become

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
prosthetics I guess I don't become

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.309 
prosthetics I guess I don't become
impressed<00:02:01.039> very<00:02:01.190> quickly<00:02:01.610> but<00:02:02.539> when<00:02:02.929> I<00:02:02.960> saw

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
impressed very quickly but when I saw

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.529 
impressed very quickly but when I saw
him<00:02:03.530> sprinting<00:02:04.069> like<00:02:04.250> that<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.880> was<00:02:05.060> amazing

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
him sprinting like that it was amazing

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.559 
him sprinting like that it was amazing
it<00:02:05.690> just<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:06.679> couldn't<00:02:07.100> believe<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:08.539> first

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
it just I couldn't believe it the first

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.449 
it just I couldn't believe it the first
time<00:02:08.989> he<00:02:09.140> was<00:02:09.289> put<00:02:09.500> on<00:02:09.649> them<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.039> he<00:02:10.130> took<00:02:10.310> off

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
time he was put on them and he took off
