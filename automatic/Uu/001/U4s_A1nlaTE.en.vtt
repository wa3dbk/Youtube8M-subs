00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.960
 with you channel helpful tips and 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.019
 devices for cottages and houses 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.200
 classic car theme 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.889
 so you need to know what I have 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.369
 gearbox 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.710
 type I do not know yes well, that's how I would 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.050
 I do not know this and 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.890
 so as not to climb under the car delov 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.519
 the fact that I am now in the country and pit 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.070
 well, I'm just crammed with sand 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.340
 I couldn't get a hole, but I want to know what 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.260
 are my gearbox for this I 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.180
 took a jack on a car like this 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.100
 put your hijacker though 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.610
 he is now basically not needed but i 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:53.640
 always doing it now took a little and on 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:00.329
 cardan corner now i will put the light on 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:03.980
 there and so put the camera means on 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.980
 propeller shaft is the mark 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.170
 chalk see it now i will 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.200
 turn the wheel 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.350
 And still put the label on the top wheel 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.009
 world in dead. let's say yes but it 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.390
 never mind it just do it for yourself 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.390
 means what to do 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.579
 turn the wheel 10 times and 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.060
 count cardan turns 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.140
 but here you can just for one turn 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.840
 see how much gimbal will do 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.900
 turns and this can be multiplied by 10 but 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.509
 one more now under just one wheel in 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.990
 air, that is, the differential works 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.340
 it means you need to multiply this momentum by 2 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:55.259
 that's all the technology there on the gimbal and 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:00.090
 now about the gearbox you see on 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:04.100
 the gearbox is even drips on the shank 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.140
 oil is insignificant but there is 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.380
 throws butter it is no longer good and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.130
 the most important thing is that he 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.440
 it will be very buzzing I changed the gland 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.260
 after a while he became where there is not 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.020
 set it up but it all turned out 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.140
 nonsense 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:30.450
 means in the market found a cheap gear 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.080
 inexpensive used status 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.170
 It seems to be a good beginning has agreed with 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.910
 man that after the holidays I'll take it 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.420
 there are holidays right now she is near 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.160
 nobody will buy it you will come you will take 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:50.780
 googled like 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:53.430
 engine 1 and 3 box 4-speed 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.300
 it should be like speed 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.900
 there is not strong traction will be me me 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.970
 I am satisfied with this gear went to 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.580
 mostly so far distant 110 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:10.370
 it is stable and so if you slightly increase 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.790
 up to 120 and loads decent drove up to 500 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.280
 600 kilos on this four 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.550
 now I want to change the gear but how 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.160
 I would show it to myself 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.130
 I check that I read Google as much as possible 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.460
 determine the gearbox that I have 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.790
 this moment means starting to rotate 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:37.650
 I take the wheel, I put the mark in chalk and 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.840
 I rotate it turns out half a turn 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.120
 made the wheel see the mark already 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.730
 shifted upward doing a full turn 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.340
 has the label shifted i made one 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:59.900
 10 turn to do now I will do 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:59.900
 10 means so 23 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:25.230
 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 and tags we do not see you 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.750
 Now I am turning further here 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.020
 a label appears 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.670
 4 areas of the forest cranked like this 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.450
 there is actually it 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.880
 if taking into account the differential then it is one 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:42.300
 turnover is obtained but half of the turnover 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.440
 when we need 2 and get a whole 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.840
 turnover from every turn we did 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.720
 cardan two turns multiplied by 24 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:56.040
 that is, if ten times mean in 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.940
 forty one turn of cardan a-41 turn 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.300
 cardan this corresponds to the tragic 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:10.050
 gearbox and I 'll take a penny there goes 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:14.190
 43 in my opinion, well, I found out this 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:17.400
 I should if I went to this on 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:22.470
 Kopeisk still train because 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.880
 I do not want to buy a new one as it looked 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:29.880
 I did not look closely, they are all new, they are all 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.720
 unreliable, and that is as lucky as well 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.340
 the old 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:38.000
 a pair of good with this gear can 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.160
 also there is something to shoot 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.550
 I also have mine scum in the garage 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.310
 lies too buzzing strongly that is something 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.919
 then it will be possible to do 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.729
 the main thing is just to buy there for two weeks 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:56.220
 I will try to arrange a guarantee 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:59.900
 it means that they are not satisfied with weight 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:04.470
 debts did not take this whole deal 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:08.210
 so here's the topic of a movie like 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:13.500
 You can find out what is the gear on 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:17.910
 car is not mean to him 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.050
 But on this and we will be rounded out with 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.300
 you had a channel 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.870
 useful tips and tricks for 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.960
 cottages and houses 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.730
 write comments 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.570
 let's discuss this topic because 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:36.210
 gearbox is very, very so 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.970
 scrupulous thing well, like all 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.830
 the rest but the editor is generally here it 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:44.040
 how to check look 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:47.340
 make sure you only need to set to go 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.110
 listen and then decide not to buy 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.880
 buy 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.500
 even there is no case told what they say 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.010
 here 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.720
 took one so 3 changed in a row and this one 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.600
 the mechanic says I don't care though 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.210
 10 you pay me for removing and installing 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.910
 I say my occasionally go like this 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.370
 I choose him to to to to determine I do not 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.830
 I can determine that's all so he 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.860
 we will buy a cat in a bag and put 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:17.510
 then we 'll shoot a video thanks everyone for 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.510
 attention and see you soon
