in<00:00:23.039> knowing<00:00:23.310> how<00:00:23.779> big<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.230> model<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
in knowing how big it the model is and

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.109 
in knowing how big it the model is and
how<00:00:26.490> big<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.119> interior<00:00:28.310> dimensions<00:00:29.310> are<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.090> i

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
how big the interior dimensions are so i

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.970 
how big the interior dimensions are so i
did<00:00:30.390> some<00:00:30.420> calculations<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.650> quick<00:00:31.830> and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
did some calculations really quick and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.760 
did some calculations really quick and
i'll<00:00:32.070> share<00:00:32.309> theirs<00:00:32.550> with<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.770> first

i'll share theirs with with you first

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.229 
i'll share theirs with with you first
off<00:00:34.980> depending<00:00:35.309> upon<00:00:35.489> how<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.790> want<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.120> go

off depending upon how you want to go
about<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.809> either<00:00:36.930> start<00:00:37.290> from<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
about it you can either start from the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.560 
about it you can either start from the
size<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.280> paper<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.149> figure

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
size of the paper you have and figure

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.139 
size of the paper you have and figure
out<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.780> final<00:00:40.050> dimensions<00:00:40.469> or<00:00:40.910> you<00:00:41.910> know

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
out the final dimensions or you know

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.729 
out the final dimensions or you know
what<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.420> want<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.660> put<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> box<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.410> so

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
what you want to put in the box and so

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.049 
what you want to put in the box and so
you<00:00:43.800> want<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> know<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.430> size<00:00:44.610> piece<00:00:44.940> of

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you want to know what size piece of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.420 
you want to know what size piece of
paper<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.390> want<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> use<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:47.039> we'll<00:00:47.219> start

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
paper you want to use and we'll start

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.920 
paper you want to use and we'll start
off<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.700> way<00:00:48.020> as<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.469> see<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.930> well

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
off that way as you can see this is well

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.810 
off that way as you can see this is well
it's<00:00:52.530> supposed<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> square<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> each

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
it's supposed to be a square and so each

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.319 
it's supposed to be a square and so each
side<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.660> same<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.320> each<00:00:59.250> side<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.879> going

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
side is the same and each side is going

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.939 
side is the same and each side is going
to<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:01.430> one-quarter<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.879> size<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:04.170> your

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
to be one-quarter the size of your

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.179 
to be one-quarter the size of your
original<00:01:05.909> square<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:10.350> figure<00:01:10.830> out<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
original square so to figure out the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.330 
original square so to figure out the
size<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.150> paper<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.600> will<00:01:12.630> need<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.650> figure

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
size of paper you will need you figure

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.210 
size of paper you will need you figure
out<00:01:14.460> how<00:01:14.700> long<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.240> want<00:01:15.619> each<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.680> these

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
out how long you want each of these

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.090 
out how long you want each of these
sides<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.380> you<00:01:19.380> multiply<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.890> by

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
sides to be and you multiply that by

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.760 
sides to be and you multiply that by
four<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.180> want<00:01:21.439> each<00:01:22.439> side<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.490> say

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
four so if you want each side to be say

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.240 
four so if you want each side to be say
ten<00:01:25.770> centimeters<00:01:26.430> then<00:01:27.530> you'll<00:01:28.530> take<00:01:29.009> ten

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
ten centimeters then you'll take ten

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.450 
ten centimeters then you'll take ten
times<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.409> gives<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.070> need<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
times for so that gives you you need a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.660 
times for so that gives you you need a
piece<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.700> paper<00:01:32.850> forty<00:01:33.840> centimeters<00:01:34.430> big<00:01:35.430> in

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
piece of paper forty centimeters big in

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.130 
piece of paper forty centimeters big in
order<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.030> make<00:01:36.409> decides<00:01:37.409> ten<00:01:37.829> centimeters

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
order to make decides ten centimeters

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.440 
order to make decides ten centimeters
the<00:01:40.140> height<00:01:40.409> here<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.360> exactly<00:01:42.360> one<00:01:43.020> half<00:01:43.320> of

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
the height here is exactly one half of

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.020 
the height here is exactly one half of
one<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.570> these<00:01:45.720> sides<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.250> ten-centimeter

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
one of these sides so a ten-centimeter

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.219 
one of these sides so a ten-centimeter
side<00:01:48.390> will<00:01:49.140> give<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> five<00:01:49.920> centimeter<00:01:50.549> hi

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
side will give you a five centimeter hi

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.389 
side will give you a five centimeter hi
for<00:01:53.229> those<00:01:53.350> who<00:01:53.380> liked<00:01:53.710> doing<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.219> math

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
for those who liked doing the math

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.279 
for those who liked doing the math
that's<00:01:55.390> 18<00:01:56.049> of<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.649> length<00:01:56.860> of<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.189> paper<00:01:57.399> or

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
that's 18 of the length of the paper or

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:04.010 
that's 18 of the length of the paper or
you<00:01:59.289> multiply<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.770> length<00:02:00.009> by<00:02:00.310> point<00:02:00.820> 125<00:02:02.070> so

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you multiply the length by point 125 so

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.190 
you multiply the length by point 125 so
to<00:02:05.020> sum<00:02:05.229> up<00:02:05.259> really<00:02:05.590> quick<00:02:06.119> each<00:02:07.119> of<00:02:07.420> these

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
to sum up really quick each of these

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.680 
to sum up really quick each of these
site<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:09.220> figure<00:02:09.640> out<00:02:09.759> how<00:02:09.940> long<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.509> side

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
site you figure out how long the side

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.900 
site you figure out how long the side
you<00:02:10.899> want<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.230> be<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.190> multiply<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.700> by

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
you want to be and you multiply that by

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.559 
you want to be and you multiply that by
4<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:14.290> will<00:02:14.500> give<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:16.120> size<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
4 and that will give you the size of the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.289 
4 and that will give you the size of the
paper<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.959> need<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.230> start<00:02:17.470> with<00:02:17.760> now<00:02:18.760> if<00:02:19.060> you

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
paper you need to start with now if you

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.400

now<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:46.180> other<00:02:46.329> dimensions<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.970> you'll<00:02:49.150> be

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
now the other dimensions that you'll be

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.460 
now the other dimensions that you'll be
of<00:02:49.720> interest<00:02:50.019> is<00:02:50.579> this<00:02:51.579> length<00:02:52.030> here<00:02:52.360> of<00:02:52.930> the

of interest is this length here of the
box<00:02:53.709> which<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.160> 0<00:02:54.579> point<00:02:55.060> three<00:02:55.630> seven<00:02:56.109> five

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
box which is 0 point three seven five

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.430 
box which is 0 point three seven five
times<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.880> length<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.359> your<00:02:59.220> starting<00:03:00.220> square

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
times the length of your starting square

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.710 
times the length of your starting square
this<00:03:02.440> right<00:03:02.709> here<00:03:03.190> we<00:03:03.970> actually<00:03:04.299> already<00:03:04.450> know

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
this right here we actually already know

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.940 
this right here we actually already know
because<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:06.130> same<00:03:06.430> length<00:03:06.819> as<00:03:07.950> your

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
because this is the same length as your

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.699 
because this is the same length as your
interior<00:03:09.250> box<00:03:09.700> so<00:03:10.630> that's<00:03:10.900> point<00:03:11.200> two<00:03:11.440> five

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
interior box so that's point two five

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.110 
interior box so that's point two five
times<00:03:12.190> your<00:03:13.200> original<00:03:14.200> square<00:03:14.709> length<00:03:15.120> so

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
times your original square length so

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.620 
times your original square length so
with<00:03:16.810> those<00:03:17.130> cute<00:03:18.130> little<00:03:18.280> formulas<00:03:18.880> you

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
with those cute little formulas you

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.440 
with those cute little formulas you
should<00:03:19.930> be<00:03:20.109> able<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.680> come<00:03:21.220> up<00:03:21.250> with<00:03:21.450> either

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
should be able to come up with either

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.509 
should be able to come up with either
the<00:03:22.720> size<00:03:23.200> of<00:03:23.410> paper<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.829> need<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.100> start<00:03:24.370> with

the size of paper you need to start with

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.740 
the size of paper you need to start with
knowing<00:03:24.940> what<00:03:25.090> you're<00:03:25.180> going<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.359> put<00:03:25.510> in<00:03:25.630> it

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
knowing what you're going to put in it

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.140 
knowing what you're going to put in it
or<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:27.100> have<00:03:27.310> your<00:03:27.459> piece<00:03:27.609> of<00:03:27.639> paper<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.030> you

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
or you have your piece of paper and you

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.569 
or you have your piece of paper and you
just<00:03:28.269> want<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.569> know<00:03:28.690> what<00:03:28.900> size<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:30.130> will<00:03:30.370> be

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
just want to know what size it will be

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.430 
just want to know what size it will be
you<00:03:31.209> can<00:03:31.389> use<00:03:31.480> those<00:03:31.600> formulas<00:03:32.019> for<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.319> as

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
you can use those formulas for that as

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.000 
you can use those formulas for that as
well<00:03:32.470> hopefully<00:03:33.069> that<00:03:33.670> helps
