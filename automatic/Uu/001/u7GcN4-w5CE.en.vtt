00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.900 
think it was useful make sure to smash
that<00:00:16.020> like<00:00:16.230> button<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.920> helps<00:00:17.250> out<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.550> lot<00:00:17.580> and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
that like button it helps out a lot and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.820 
that like button it helps out a lot and
it<00:00:18.029> just<00:00:18.270> takes<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.600> second<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.199> as<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.680> can

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
it just takes a second and as you can

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.279 
it just takes a second and as you can
see<00:00:19.859> over<00:00:20.279> here<00:00:20.310> there's<00:00:20.670> some<00:00:20.760> suit<00:00:21.289> jackets

see over here there's some suit jackets
and<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.890> think<00:00:23.189> they<00:00:23.310> look<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.820> upper<00:00:24.180> bad<00:00:24.390> as

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
and I think they look for upper bad as

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.420 
and I think they look for upper bad as
they're<00:00:24.779> pretty<00:00:25.050> expensive<00:00:25.250> but<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.310> can

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
they're pretty expensive but you can

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.910 
they're pretty expensive but you can
dress<00:00:27.029> yourself<00:00:27.449> as<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> pimp<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.170> as<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> mafia

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.250 
dress yourself as a pimp or as a mafia
boss<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> mob<00:00:29.849> boss<00:00:29.880> or<00:00:30.359> whatever<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.109> want
