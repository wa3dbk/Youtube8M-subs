00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.690
 hello everyone today we will talk about the topic of 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:11.150
 unemployment the population is divided in two 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.720
 large groups people in age of 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.750
 to work 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.230
 and the very young or old population to 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.230
 to work 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.130
 the population of working age 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.970
 divided into two groups employed and 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.970
 unemployed 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.910
 unemployment is the proportion of the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.040
 active population that has no work 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.390
 but who looks for work and is available 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.390
 to do it 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.649
 causes of unemployment 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.660
 The main ones are unstable 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.980
 political and economic of the country that causes 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.980
 great damage to the population 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.050
 also the lack of investment in 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.990
 industries that generate jobs to the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.720
 society 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.000
 there is also the crisis whereby 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.700
 we cross that is one of the factors 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.030
 main causes that generate massive layoffs 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.030
 of personnel 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.840
 there is also bad planning 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.000
 financial and strategic 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.530
 the flight of capital to other countries 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.530
 It is also a great reason 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.960
 the closing of generators of 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.960
 job 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.790
 and technological advances 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.960
 negative consequences of unemployment 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.960
 they are social instability 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.119
 crime and consequently the 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.119
 insecurity 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.430
 greater tax burden to pay the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.430
 unemployment benefits 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.000
 deceleration of growth because the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.659
 economy loses the creative force of the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.659
 work 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.310
 also the deceleration of development 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.310
 there are more and more poor people 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.010
 positive consequences 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.010
 the economy experiences growth 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.550
 new companies are generated and the 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.550
 population consumption 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.440
 increases the salary for the worker 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.600
 types of unemployment 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.460
 Unemployment is classified into three types 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.230
 according to its cause 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.750
 the first is protection according to 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.970
 structure of the third cyclical by 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.610
 friction arises from normal rotation 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.190
 of work are people who enter and 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.960
 they abandon their employment and for the continuous 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.960
 creation and elimination of employment 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.270
 the structural one refers to when 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.280
 there are technological changes or the 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.680
 international competition modifies 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.800
 skills needed to perform 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.780
 the jobs or change the location of 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.780
 these disappearing forever 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.210
 the cyclic is the one that fluctuates during the 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.010
 economic cycle is cyclical unemployment 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.360
 increases during a recession and decreases 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.360
 during an expansion 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.490
 unemployment rate 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.000
 the unemployment rate can be calculated 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.130
 dividing the number of people 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.530
 unemployed among the labor force by 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.180
 percent and the workforce stand out with 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.810
 the number of people employed plus the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.810
 unemployed people 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.660
 Force participation rate 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.820
 This is an indicator of the 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.240
 disposition of people of legal age 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.860
 work to accept employment and is equal to 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.160
 the labor force among the population 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.650
 age of working full employment 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.470
 full employment will be in an economy 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.060
 when there is no cyclical employment that is 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.040
 is the situation in which all 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.140
 productive resources of an economy 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.140
 they are completely used 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.789
 the unemployment rate during the plenary 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.639
 employment is known as the natural rate of 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:29.650
 unemployment the amount of real GDP in the 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.650
 employment is known as hypotension 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.960
