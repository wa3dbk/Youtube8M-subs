00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.149 
left over however I have to honestly
admit<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.770> much<00:01:52.979> better

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
admit that this one is so much better

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.469 
admit that this one is so much better
than<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> classic<00:01:53.880> car<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.210> one<00:01:54.360> is

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
than the classic car this one is

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.149 
than the classic car this one is
actually<00:01:54.600> sturdy<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.770> going<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> hold

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
actually sturdy it's going to hold

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.679 
actually sturdy it's going to hold
together<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:56.759> gonna<00:01:56.939> fall<00:01:57.180> apart<00:01:57.540> on

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
together it's not gonna fall apart on

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.350 
together it's not gonna fall apart on
you<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:58.380> first<00:01:58.649> time<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.860> built<00:01:59.159> it<00:02:00.000> was<00:02:00.119> very

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you that first time I built it was very

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.230 
you that first time I built it was very
very<00:02:00.649> weak<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.920> would<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.610> kind<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.880> crumble

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
very weak and would just kind of crumble

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.760 
very weak and would just kind of crumble
in<00:02:03.329> your<00:02:03.450> hands<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.020> were<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.320> trying<00:02:04.560> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
in your hands as you were just trying to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.069 
in your hands as you were just trying to
hold<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.850> one<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.390> much<00:02:06.570> better<00:02:06.750> built

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
hold it this one is so much better built

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.109 
hold it this one is so much better built
that<00:02:07.770> first<00:02:08.009> one<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.190> built<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.640> afraid<00:02:08.940> all

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that first one I built up is afraid all

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.150 
that first one I built up is afraid all
