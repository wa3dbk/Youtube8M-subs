00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
most of the rotation comes from just

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.700 
most of the rotation comes from just
being<00:00:39.340> on<00:00:39.460> your<00:00:39.550> toe<00:00:39.730> edge<00:00:39.760> as<00:00:40.000> you<00:00:40.060> jump<00:00:40.710> when

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
being on your toe edge as you jump when

it comes to doing the 360 the main
difference<00:00:44.290> is<00:00:44.470> you'll<00:00:44.649> add<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:44.890> little<00:00:45.310> bit<00:00:45.460> of

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
difference is you'll add a little bit of

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.280 
difference is you'll add a little bit of
wind<00:00:45.850> up<00:00:46.060> and<00:00:46.240> release<00:00:46.630> with<00:00:46.780> it<00:00:46.930> upper<00:00:47.080> body

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
wind up and release with it upper body

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.650 
wind up and release with it upper body
as<00:00:47.650> you're<00:00:48.040> jumping<00:00:48.340> from<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.520> side<00:00:48.730> this

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
as you're jumping from the side this

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.360 
as you're jumping from the side this
creates<00:00:49.840> tension<00:00:50.650> through<00:00:50.830> your<00:00:50.950> body<00:00:51.130> like<00:00:51.340> a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
creates tension through your body like a

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.460 
creates tension through your body like a
rubber<00:00:51.610> band<00:00:51.880> which<00:00:52.510> helps<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:52.870> to<00:00:52.900> spin<00:00:53.230> all

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
rubber band which helps you to spin all

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.640 
rubber band which helps you to spin all
the<00:00:53.770> way<00:00:53.800> around<00:00:55.020> approach<00:00:56.020> at<00:00:56.200> the<00:00:56.290> exact

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
the way around approach at the exact

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.980 
the way around approach at the exact
same<00:00:56.830> speed<00:00:57.160> use<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.120> same<00:00:58.360> toe<00:00:58.570> edge<00:00:58.690> carve

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
same speed use the same toe edge carve

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.100 
same speed use the same toe edge carve
at<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.980> same<00:01:00.220> pop<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:01.330> only<00:01:01.570> difference<00:01:01.960> is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
at the same pop the only difference is

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.170 
at the same pop the only difference is
to<00:01:02.260> wind<00:01:02.530> up<00:01:02.680> a<00:01:02.800> little<00:01:02.950> just<00:01:03.340> fully<00:01:03.670> jump<00:01:03.970> and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
to wind up a little just fully jump and

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.090 
to wind up a little just fully jump and
release<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:04.989> tension<00:01:05.259> as<00:01:05.560> you<00:01:05.650> pop<00:01:05.860> up<00:01:05.890> a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
release that tension as you pop up a

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.370 
release that tension as you pop up a
look<00:01:06.570> don't<00:01:07.570> wind<00:01:07.810> up<00:01:07.930> too<00:01:08.110> early

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
look don't wind up too early

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.100 
look don't wind up too early
closer<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.460> jump<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:09.850> better<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.960> other

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
closer to the jump is better the other

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.780 
closer to the jump is better the other
difference<00:01:11.500> is<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.829> continue<00:01:12.189> looking<00:01:12.340> all

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
difference is to continue looking all

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.760 
difference is to continue looking all
the<00:01:13.090> way<00:01:13.180> around<00:01:13.479> with<00:01:13.570> your<00:01:13.689> hip<00:01:13.900> rather<00:01:14.590> than

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
the way around with your hip rather than

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.550 
the way around with your hip rather than
spotting<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.159> blind<00:01:15.400> landing<00:01:16.259> don't<00:01:17.259> try<00:01:17.499> to

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
spotting the blind landing don't try to

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.039 
spotting the blind landing don't try to
hide<00:01:17.829> it<00:01:17.909> focus<00:01:18.909> on<00:01:18.999> only<00:01:19.179> spinning<00:01:19.659> a<00:01:19.719> tiny

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
hide it focus on only spinning a tiny

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.349 
hide it focus on only spinning a tiny
bit<00:01:20.229> more<00:01:20.439> of<00:01:20.530> your<00:01:20.649> back<00:01:20.859> so<00:01:21.069> 180<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:22.240> may

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
bit more of your back so 180 you may

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:23.969 
bit more of your back so 180 you may
only<00:01:22.479> do<00:01:22.630> it<00:01:22.749> to<00:01:22.899> 70<00:01:23.259> on<00:01:23.289> your<00:01:23.469> first<00:01:23.649> few<00:01:23.859> tries

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
only do it to 70 on your first few tries

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.770 
only do it to 70 on your first few tries
some<00:01:24.759> little<00:01:24.999> when<00:01:25.090> practicing<00:01:25.630> while

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
some little when practicing while

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.440 
some little when practicing while
carving<00:01:26.109> across<00:01:26.409> a<00:01:26.439> room<00:01:26.819> this<00:01:27.819> is<00:01:27.999> safe<00:01:28.240> as

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
carving across a room this is safe as

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.020 
carving across a room this is safe as
you<00:01:28.539> end<00:01:28.689> up<00:01:28.840> facing<00:01:29.109> downhill<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:30.729> you<00:01:30.850> land

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
you end up facing downhill if you land

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.459 
you end up facing downhill if you land
with<00:01:31.090> your<00:01:31.240> toe<00:01:31.389> edge<00:01:31.420> it'll<00:01:31.869> catch<00:01:32.200> in<00:01:32.380> the

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
with your toe edge it'll catch in the

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.940 
with your toe edge it'll catch in the
snow

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
snow

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.940

so<00:01:33.369> try<00:01:33.549> Lance<00:01:33.789> slightly<00:01:34.240> on<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.359> heels<00:01:34.950> it's

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
so try Lance slightly on the heels it's

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.919 
so try Lance slightly on the heels it's
better<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.490> smooth<00:01:36.999> to<00:01:37.299> seventies<00:01:37.689> at<00:01:37.810> this

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
better to smooth to seventies at this

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.340 
better to smooth to seventies at this
stage<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.590> can<00:01:38.619> sloppy<00:01:39.100> 360s<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.109> try<00:01:41.289> to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
stage you can sloppy 360s if you try to

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.020 
stage you can sloppy 360s if you try to
wind<00:01:41.590> up<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:41.920> release<00:01:42.130> too<00:01:42.399> hard<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:42.880> just

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
wind up and release too hard and just

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.940 
wind up and release too hard and just
spin<00:01:43.299> they'll<00:01:43.929> get<00:01:44.139> you<00:01:44.259> off<00:01:44.409> balance<00:01:44.649> and

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
spin they'll get you off balance and

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.899 
spin they'll get you off balance and
make<00:01:45.069> things<00:01:45.249> harder

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
make things harder

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.539 
make things harder
keep<00:01:46.450> your<00:01:46.630> edging<00:01:46.840> smooth<00:01:47.219> adding<00:01:48.219> pop<00:01:48.399> off
