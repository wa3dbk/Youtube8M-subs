00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.100
 well I have already said here 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.310
 is again to be with the object 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.580
 want to push 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:35.900
 in kleve at 15 already go with the 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.820
 midfield yes well there are individual 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.220
 regulations Saxony even build here 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.220
 the mosquito blocks after 15 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.230
 so now it should be upset even for 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.269
 capable machines buck for capable 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.170
 machine quickly became part of bock 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.780
 places 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.729
 because you put her home or pure 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.630
 after one minute and does include 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.310
 clean and the researchers have the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.820
 then plug in and then go 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.820
 no longer out 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.320
 So maybe you have teams 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.710
 if not still in june 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.710
 finished 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.960
 not at all living on it 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.780
 I also think that you built the bks 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.940
 So let's get the annuals 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.720
 third we have some in august 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.720
 not finished yet 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.729
 is a bank 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.500
 I stay with it, we need the castle 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.500
 for capable machine 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.980
 first 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.890
 Before so little is the principle if the 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.890
 keep in there 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.769
 otherwise always his words samba 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.769
 karstadt is the mirror of the people 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.120
 You still have a lot of manager out here 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.900
 raise 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.990
 for the sake of a warm quarter of the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.990
 portuguese 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.910
 So far , of course, they are quite happy 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:43.980
 wait portable so here for the times 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.850
 black with year old and if you have one 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.800
 gravel surface respectively 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.700
 We want to create a high surface here 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.070
 Ten years ago, already 20 years ago 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.330
 years already from ddr-times students 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.820
 we had 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.880
 topinambur has it all here 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.880
 nicely propagated and there are the sows 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.950
 Every year like to get out and get that 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.350
 is the red topinambur is also the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.870
 yellow the yellow is still a number 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.870
