00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello I sarah naughty am pastrywoman 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.900
 and I will show you how to make a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.500
 castle-shaped cake with 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.500
 christmas colors 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:37.170
 we will make small towers for 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.489
 we use ice cones for 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.540
 that it is well liquid do not hesitate to 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.110
 to spend a few seconds 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.640
 microwave 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.140
 it will be easier to spread for 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.090
 our castle it will take us three 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.170
 little tricks we will let them rest 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.170
 as and in the refrigerator 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.020
 we will take care of the cake so for the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.840
 castle we are going to have the important base 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.240
 cake to have three rounds I 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.020
 me so soft that we will cover the 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.910
 on each other 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.190
 before disposing they cover them 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.230
 spreads I'm going to make sure that 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.610
 the cake is straight if you take 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.410
 a knife that does not have in and that is 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.300
 Smooth to risk and remove a piece 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:36.050
 cake savall the damaged for really 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:38.450
 make this key gesture we covered 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.090
 the main castle and the small 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.009
 spreads of dough waiting one goes 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.360
 able to spread the sugar dough and the 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.190
 red sugar paste buy it directly 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.990
 colored because red or black 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.290
 it's too complicated to color from 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.290
 of white 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.930
 I will lift it to put it 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.930
 on the cake 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.650
 good to level up down will push a 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.820
 little bit about the dough is so 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.050
 now I'm going to do the same with the 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:28.480
 three towers you can cover them 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.240
 like a classic cake spreading 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.710
 big circle and the late posing on it and 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.510
 it's a bit more complicated hot so 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:40.570
 I'm going to spread a long strip 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:43.090
 I will turn around the cake for 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.670
 now you have covered all the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.840
 outline the small towers it takes 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.840
 simply cut off the hat 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.010
 the third step so we covered 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.110
 in red the main cake and the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.080
 three rounds we will now decorate 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:16.390
 and each with like a wall all 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:18.640
 at the top of the castle to cut into 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:26.410
 small screen form I'm going to use a 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.730
 cookie cutter so now that I have 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.680
 cut a first band 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.329
 in fact I'm going to let it dry a 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.900
 very little she can stand up 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.900
 on the cake 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.700
 why we covered being castle I 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.980
 am now going to draw a little 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.980
 gray door at the entrance here 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.400
 she will continue the decoration in 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.400
 putting the little firs on each side 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.669
 so we finished the main decoration 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:05:00.760
 of the cake I got the cones 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:05:01.930
