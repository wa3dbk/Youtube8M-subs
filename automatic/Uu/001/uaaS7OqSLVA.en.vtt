in<00:00:59.129> size<00:00:59.370> right<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:00.600> between<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> bezel

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
in size right here but between the bezel

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
in size right here but between the bezel
and<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> actual<00:01:02.489> screen<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.359> screen<00:01:03.510> size<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and the actual screen the screen size is

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.440 
and the actual screen the screen size is
almost<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> same<00:01:05.129> itself<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.030> actual

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
almost the same itself but the actual

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.350 
almost the same itself but the actual
phone<00:01:06.750> itself<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.350> 5<00:01:07.560> inches<00:01:07.939> ok<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.000> here's<00:01:09.299> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
phone itself is 5 inches ok so here's a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.600 
phone itself is 5 inches ok so here's a
little<00:01:09.600> side<00:01:09.810> comparison<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.710> thickness<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
little side comparison and thickness of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.330 
little side comparison and thickness of
the<00:01:11.850> two<00:01:12.060> phones<00:01:12.299> by<00:01:12.630> side<00:01:13.140> by<00:01:13.170> side<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the two phones by side by side as you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.620 
the two phones by side by side as you
can<00:01:14.460> see<00:01:14.670> they<00:01:14.850> are<00:01:14.880> very<00:01:15.330> similar

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
can see they are very similar

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.399 
can see they are very similar
thicknesses<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.310> HTC<00:01:18.000> One<00:01:18.240> m8<00:01:18.630> actually

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
thicknesses but the HTC One m8 actually

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
thicknesses but the HTC One m8 actually
tapers<00:01:19.890> down<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> side<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.119> actually

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
tapers down to the side and is actually

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.749 
tapers down to the side and is actually
curved<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> middle<00:01:23.130> part<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.520> almost

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
curved so in the middle part it's almost

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.350 
curved so in the middle part it's almost
the<00:01:23.909> same<00:01:24.090> size<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.140> iphone<00:01:25.170> itself<00:01:26.299> ok<00:01:27.299> so

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the same size as the iphone itself ok so

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.700 
the same size as the iphone itself ok so
that<00:01:27.570> pretty<00:01:27.720> much<00:01:27.840> wraps<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.530> video
