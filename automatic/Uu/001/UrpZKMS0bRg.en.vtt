 nando ok with another profile that creates two 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.519
 days so that he could accept me 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.199

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.269

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.310
 message one against one in octagon ok 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.279

 invited to play the one big one and good 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.660

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.290
 finish it instantly because they see 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.680
 that coward ended the game when 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.070
 saw that he did not have the host already finished and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.070
 Well, he sent me only game with children 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.100

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.510
 I put him watch starts the game and when 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.210

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.730

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.760
 what he did invited me and well, well, 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.170
 reaction of this cloud started him and good 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.090
 before I started to move or 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.120
 be that to sell the grenade and that 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.960
 he barely shows up and he was already grabbing me 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.610
 at risk with him is not something cheating me 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.430
 he killed four times and just at that moment 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.020
 I returned to steal host and good ended 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.090
 the game even when he's going 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.819

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.420

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.079
 I took out and the ones he pulled out okay 150 because 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.419
 because he put the limit of 150 not him 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.510
 put time limit the position of 50 the 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:03.060
 true of not knowing how to play nothing 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.620
 only one who has up his ego that does not 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.689
 it's worth nothing because it's terrible 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.090
 Hernando says he already won me two 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.530
 Sometimes, but he won me years ago 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.150
 when I did not know how to play when I 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.040
 I was just beginning in this of the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.079
 one against one this guy is terrible 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.790
 so well then and if they challenge it and not 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.310

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.049
