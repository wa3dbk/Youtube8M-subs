welcome<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.910> workshop<00:00:09.740> hi<00:00:10.940> I've<00:00:11.940> just<00:00:12.179> cut

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
welcome to the workshop hi I've just cut

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.629 
welcome to the workshop hi I've just cut
this<00:00:12.630> piece<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.049> wood<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.320> half<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> can<00:00:14.400> show

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
this piece of wood in half so I can show

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.689 
this piece of wood in half so I can show
you<00:00:14.700> how<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.480> make<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.109> half<00:00:16.529> lap<00:00:16.830> joint<00:00:17.130> really

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
you how to make a half lap joint really

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.269 
you how to make a half lap joint really
quickly<00:00:18.270> without<00:00:18.779> any<00:00:18.960> measuring<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:21.980> half<00:00:22.980> lap

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
quickly without any measuring a half lap

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.400 
quickly without any measuring a half lap
joint<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:24.060> where<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.480> remove<00:00:24.779> half<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
joint is where we remove half the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.349 
joint is where we remove half the
material<00:00:25.560> from<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> thickness<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.119> piece

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
material from the thickness of one piece

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.800 
material from the thickness of one piece
hard<00:00:28.080> from<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> other<00:00:29.390> put<00:00:30.390> those<00:00:30.510> cut

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
hard from the other put those cut

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.350 
hard from the other put those cut
surfaces<00:00:31.289> together<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.640> end<00:00:32.820> up<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
surfaces together and we end up with a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.770 
surfaces together and we end up with a
flush<00:00:33.690> joint<00:00:35.149> what's<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.329> difficult<00:00:36.540> about

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
flush joint what's so difficult about

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.560 
flush joint what's so difficult about
that<00:00:37.160> well<00:00:38.160> you've<00:00:38.489> got<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> measure<00:00:38.940> halfway

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
that well you've got to measure halfway

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.889 
that well you've got to measure halfway
well<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.710> don't<00:00:40.920> have<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> ruler<00:00:41.660> all<00:00:42.660> you

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
well if you don't have a ruler all you

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.600 
well if you don't have a ruler all you
need<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.260> cut<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> half<00:00:43.620> lap<00:00:43.890> joint<00:00:44.160> using<00:00:44.370> this

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
need to cut a half lap joint using this

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.180 
need to cut a half lap joint using this
technique<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.480> table<00:00:45.989> saw<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.469> either<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
technique is a table saw and either a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.000 
technique is a table saw and either a
miter<00:00:47.520> fence<00:00:47.670> or<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:49.079> I've<00:00:49.260> got<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
miter fence or as I've got here a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.540 
miter fence or as I've got here a
crosscut<00:00:50.850> sled<00:00:51.829> first<00:00:52.829> thing<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.399> do

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
crosscut sled first thing we have to do

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.360 
crosscut sled first thing we have to do
is<00:00:54.090> find<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.629> middle<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.899> our<00:00:55.020> component<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
is find the middle of our component and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.160 
is find the middle of our component and
remember<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.059> don't<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> ruler<00:00:57.870> or<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> tape

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
remember we don't have a ruler or a tape

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.430 
remember we don't have a ruler or a tape
so<00:00:58.949> how<00:00:59.100> are<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.199> I'm<00:01:01.199> going

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
so how are we going to do that I'm going

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.130 
so how are we going to do that I'm going
to<00:01:01.500> take<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> pencil<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.660> roughly<00:01:03.660> mark

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
to take a pencil and just roughly mark

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.100 
to take a pencil and just roughly mark
where<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> think<00:01:04.769> Center<00:01:05.430> might<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.990> using<00:01:06.990> my

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
where I think Center might be using my

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.429 
where I think Center might be using my
finger<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.189> fence<00:01:08.810> do<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> same<00:01:10.140> from<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
finger as a fence do the same from the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.570 
finger as a fence do the same from the
other<00:01:10.470> side<00:01:11.299> well<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.630> wasn't<00:01:13.619> exactly<00:01:13.740> spot<00:01:14.340> on

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
other side well I wasn't exactly spot on

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.710 
other side well I wasn't exactly spot on
let's<00:01:15.420> go<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.900> between<00:01:16.049> those<00:01:16.409> lines<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
let's go be in between those lines and

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.420 
let's go be in between those lines and
that's<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.840> good<00:01:19.049> approximation<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:20.130> where<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that's a good approximation of where the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.120 
that's a good approximation of where the
center<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:21.470> that's<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.740> quite<00:01:22.950> accurate

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
center is that's not quite accurate

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.270 
center is that's not quite accurate
enough<00:01:23.610> for<00:01:24.330> our<00:01:24.450> joint<00:01:24.780> though<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.920> we're

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
enough for our joint though so we're

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.429 
enough for our joint though so we're
going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.610> set<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.939> height<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.420> our<00:01:27.540> saw<00:01:27.869> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
going to set this height of our saw to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.460 
going to set this height of our saw to
just<00:01:28.799> below<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.100> pencil<00:01:29.759> line<00:01:30.439> with<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
just below that pencil line with a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.830 
just below that pencil line with a
component<00:01:31.950> face<00:01:32.340> down<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:32.970> table<00:01:33.270> or<00:01:33.630> on

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
component face down on the table or on

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.440 
component face down on the table or on
the<00:01:34.020> crosscut<00:01:34.560> sled<00:01:34.740> move<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:35.909> close<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the crosscut sled move it up close to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.210 
the crosscut sled move it up close to
the<00:01:36.540> teeth<00:01:38.900> now<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.960> need<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.439> rotate<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the teeth now you need to rotate the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.800 
the teeth now you need to rotate the
blade<00:01:41.490> until<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.479> find<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> highest<00:01:43.110> point

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
blade until you find the highest point

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.630 
blade until you find the highest point
in<00:01:45.810> its<00:01:46.110> travel<00:01:47.630> now<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.689> raise<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.350> blade

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
in its travel now we raise the blade

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.969 
in its travel now we raise the blade
until<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:50.970> below<00:01:51.329> where<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:52.320> gazed<00:01:52.590> as

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
until we just below where we gazed as

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.910 
until we just below where we gazed as
being<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.340> middle<00:01:54.590> now<00:01:55.590> we're<00:01:55.740> going<00:01:55.860> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
being in the middle now we're going to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.929 
being in the middle now we're going to
take<00:01:56.130> two<00:01:56.729> cuts<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:59.100> face<00:01:59.399> down<00:01:59.759> on

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
take two cuts one with this face down on

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.330 
take two cuts one with this face down on
the<00:01:59.969> table<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.540> one<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.710> opposite<00:02:02.159> face

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the table and one with the opposite face

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:36.580 
the table and one with the opposite face
down<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.000> table

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.440 

now<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.920> see<00:02:38.190> we've<00:02:38.460> left<00:02:38.790> behind<00:02:39.210> a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
now you can see we've left behind a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.290 
now you can see we've left behind a
little<00:02:40.110> piece<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.500> wood<00:02:43.670> right<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.000> middle

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
little piece of wood right in the middle

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.540 
little piece of wood right in the middle
of<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.630> component<00:02:45.960> we<00:02:46.830> know<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.100> right<00:02:47.250> in<00:02:47.460> the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
of a component we know it's right in the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.130 
of a component we know it's right in the
middle<00:02:47.580> because<00:02:47.940> we've<00:02:48.240> cut<00:02:48.480> from<00:02:48.660> both<00:02:48.840> sides

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
middle because we've cut from both sides

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.110 
middle because we've cut from both sides
find<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.320> highest<00:02:52.590> point<00:02:52.860> your<00:02:53.640> teeth<00:02:53.880> will

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
find the highest point your teeth will

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.690 
find the highest point your teeth will
go<00:02:54.270> on<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> blade<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:57.200> raise<00:02:58.200> your<00:02:58.500> saw<00:03:01.700> set

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
go on the blade and raise your saw set

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.920 
go on the blade and raise your saw set
it<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.060> middle<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.570> waste<00:03:03.780> material

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
it to the middle of the waste material

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.150 
it to the middle of the waste material
that<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.590> left<00:03:04.740> behind<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:06.860> that's<00:03:07.860> good

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
that you left behind and that's good

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.180 
that you left behind and that's good
enough<00:03:08.190> for<00:03:08.460> rough<00:03:08.850> work<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.800> now<00:03:10.950> go

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
enough for rough work you can now go

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.540 
enough for rough work you can now go
ahead<00:03:11.540> with<00:03:12.540> stage<00:03:12.840> two<00:03:13.200> which<00:03:13.740> is<00:03:13.920> removal<00:03:14.430> of

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
ahead with stage two which is removal of

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.930 
ahead with stage two which is removal of
all<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.790> waste<00:03:15.000> for<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.510> half<00:03:15.690> lap<00:03:16.760> but<00:03:17.760> why

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
all the waste for the half lap but why

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.850 
all the waste for the half lap but why
not<00:03:18.120> continue<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.750> do<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:18.990> accurately<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
not continue and do it accurately the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.850 
not continue and do it accurately the
way<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.010> do<00:03:21.080> gradually<00:03:22.080> increase<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.500> height

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
way I do gradually increase the height

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.060 
way I do gradually increase the height
of<00:03:23.070> your<00:03:23.250> blade<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:24.200> take<00:03:25.200> passes<00:03:25.740> on<00:03:25.860> both

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
of your blade and take passes on both

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.420 
of your blade and take passes on both
sides<00:03:26.430> until<00:03:27.420> your<00:03:27.570> waste<00:03:27.810> material<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.800> as

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
sides until your waste material is as

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.710 
sides until your waste material is as
thin<00:03:29.880> as<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.210> sheet<00:03:30.570> of<00:03:30.750> tissue<00:03:31.080> paper<00:03:32.720> that'll

thin as a sheet of tissue paper that'll

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.140 
thin as a sheet of tissue paper that'll
be<00:03:33.960> roughly<00:03:34.470> between<00:03:35.190> one<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.790> two

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
be roughly between one and two

be roughly between one and two
thousandth<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.810> an<00:03:36.930> inch<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.380> if<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.310> prepare

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
thousandth of an inch and if you prepare

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.050 
thousandth of an inch and if you prepare
your<00:03:38.820> joint<00:03:39.150> like<00:03:39.360> that<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:40.340> single<00:03:41.340> swipe<00:03:41.700> with

your joint like that a single swipe with
a<00:03:42.090> smoothing<00:03:42.660> plane<00:03:42.780> will<00:03:43.620> have<00:03:43.650> all<00:03:43.950> your

a smoothing plane will have all your

edges flushed up even if you only intend

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.290 
edges flushed up even if you only intend
to<00:03:48.510> sand<00:03:48.810> your<00:03:48.930> joint<00:03:49.520> that<00:03:50.520> thousandth<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.180> an

to sand your joint that thousandth of an
inch<00:03:51.420> will<00:03:52.260> easily<00:03:53.130> disappear<00:03:53.459> with<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.000> few

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
inch will easily disappear with a few

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.770 
inch will easily disappear with a few
strokes<00:03:54.600> of<00:03:54.810> paper<00:03:55.850> so<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:56.880> raised<00:03:57.300> my<00:03:57.480> blade<00:03:57.750> a

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
strokes of paper so I raised my blade a

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:17.900 
strokes of paper so I raised my blade a
little<00:03:57.900> bit<00:03:59.780> and<00:04:00.780> cut<00:04:01.050> again

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.950 

and<00:04:19.650> very<00:04:20.650> quickly<00:04:20.919> I've<00:04:21.669> got<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.180> exactly<00:04:22.720> the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
and very quickly I've got to exactly the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.469 
and very quickly I've got to exactly the
right<00:04:23.199> width<00:04:23.500> I'm<00:04:23.740> looking<00:04:24.070> for<00:04:24.479> that's

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
right width I'm looking for that's

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.320 
right width I'm looking for that's
incredibly<00:04:26.289> thin<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:27.009> if<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.090> look

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
incredibly thin and if you look

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.370 
incredibly thin and if you look
carefully<00:04:29.070> you<00:04:30.070> may<00:04:30.280> be<00:04:30.340> able<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.820> see<00:04:31.139> that<00:04:32.139> in

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
carefully you may be able to see that in

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.560 
carefully you may be able to see that in
a<00:04:32.470> couple<00:04:32.800> of<00:04:32.860> places<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.940> tip<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.449> blade

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
a couple of places the tip of the blade

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.590 
a couple of places the tip of the blade
has<00:04:34.960> just<00:04:35.500> broken<00:04:35.770> through<00:04:36.330> right<00:04:37.330> in<00:04:37.509> the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
has just broken through right in the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.779 
has just broken through right in the
corner<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:39.820> that's<00:04:40.139> as<00:04:41.139> close<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.979> the<00:04:42.550> middle

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
corner so that's as close to the middle

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.379 
corner so that's as close to the middle
these<00:04:43.150> you're<00:04:43.509> going<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.840> get<00:04:44.940> now<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.060> finish

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
these you're going to get now to finish

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.330 
these you're going to get now to finish
preparing<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:47.080> joint<00:04:47.350> we<00:04:48.160> need<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.460> mark<00:04:48.669> up

the blade on the table saw remember
don't<00:05:32.169> change<00:05:32.530> the<00:05:32.740> height

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.610 

and<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.819> result<00:06:07.270> is<00:06:07.479> a<00:06:08.400> lovely<00:06:09.400> joint

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
and the result is a lovely joint

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.129

nice tight joint lines and nice and

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.420 
nice tight joint lines and nice and
flush<00:06:14.610> so<00:06:15.610> I'll<00:06:15.789> glue<00:06:16.060> that<00:06:16.240> up<00:06:17.159> after<00:06:18.159> a<00:06:18.190> few

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
flush so I'll glue that up after a few

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.820
