it's<00:01:03.000> hands-free<00:01:03.989> text<00:01:04.739> messaging<00:01:05.369> that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it's hands-free text messaging that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.240 
it's hands-free text messaging that
again<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.450> another<00:01:06.570> safety<00:01:07.050> feature<00:01:07.289> and<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
again it's another safety feature and it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.029 
again it's another safety feature and it
adds<00:01:08.460> convenience<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.289> it's<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.890> of

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
adds convenience to it so it's all of

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:12.859 
adds convenience to it so it's all of
those<00:01:11.160> things<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.789> I<00:01:11.940> think<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.539> know<00:01:12.570> one<00:01:12.840> of

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
those things and I think you know one of

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.540 
those things and I think you know one of
the<00:01:12.990> key<00:01:13.170> things<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.680> also<00:01:13.950> makes<00:01:14.220> us<00:01:14.399> better

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
the key things that also makes us better

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.029 
the key things that also makes us better
is<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.210> four-cylinder<00:01:15.899> engine<00:01:16.289> has<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
is the four-cylinder engine has the

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.450 
is the four-cylinder engine has the
best-in-class<00:01:17.550> fuel<00:01:18.210> economy<00:01:19.080> 27<00:01:20.009> miles<00:01:20.190> per

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
best-in-class fuel economy 27 miles per

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.790 
best-in-class fuel economy 27 miles per

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.300 
on the highway 31 miles per gallon
combined<00:01:26.729> estimated<00:01:27.720> again<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.800> know<00:01:28.920> who

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
combined estimated again you know who

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.650 
combined estimated again you know who
doesn't<00:01:29.729> want<00:01:29.910> to<00:01:29.940> get<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> vehicle<00:01:30.330> that<00:01:30.600> gets

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
doesn't want to get a vehicle that gets

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.290 
doesn't want to get a vehicle that gets
the<00:01:30.990> best<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.679> fuel<00:01:32.310> economy<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
the best you know fuel economy in the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.510 
the best you know fuel economy in the
segment<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.740> me<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.070> really<00:01:35.340> those

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
segment so to me it's really those

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.969 
segment so to me it's really those
things<00:01:35.910> that<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.570> set<00:01:36.929> it<00:01:37.080> apart<00:01:37.170> from<00:01:37.500> the

again<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> styling<00:01:46.830> I<00:01:46.920> think<00:01:47.189> they<00:01:47.340> did<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
again the styling I think they did a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.870 
again the styling I think they did a
very<00:01:48.090> avant-garde<00:01:48.960> very<00:01:49.560> modern<00:01:50.220> styling

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
very avant-garde very modern styling

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.420 
very avant-garde very modern styling
without<00:01:51.650> changing<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.829> style<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.220> had

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
without changing the style that had

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.460 
without changing the style that had
already<00:01:53.579> had<00:01:54.060> which<00:01:54.390> was<00:01:54.960> very<00:01:55.200> successful

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
already had which was very successful

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.789 
already had which was very successful
meaning<00:01:56.369> our<00:01:56.549> customers<00:01:57.270> liked<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.560> it

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
meaning our customers liked it so if it

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.969 
meaning our customers liked it so if it
isn't<00:01:59.070> broke<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.280> fix<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.470> but<00:02:01.470> they<00:02:01.740> made

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
isn't broke don't fix it but they made

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.620 
isn't broke don't fix it but they made
it<00:02:02.159> modern<00:02:02.369> they<00:02:02.790> made<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.060> more<00:02:03.360> aerodynamic

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
it modern they made it more aerodynamic

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.530 
it modern they made it more aerodynamic
it<00:02:04.500> wasn't<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.070> make<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.640> look<00:02:06.060> good<00:02:06.119> and
