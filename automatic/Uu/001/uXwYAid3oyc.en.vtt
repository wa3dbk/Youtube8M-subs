this<00:01:50.790> right<00:01:51.000> here<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.659> guess<00:01:51.990> they<00:01:52.170> tank<00:01:52.560> not

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
this right here is I guess they tank not

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.830 
this right here is I guess they tank not
to<00:01:53.130> use<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:53.399> never<00:01:53.610> really<00:01:54.299> gave<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.509> name<00:01:54.630> for

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
to use they never really gave a name for

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.399 
to use they never really gave a name for
it<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.820> rotates<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:57.119> yeah<00:01:57.450> 360<00:01:58.079> degrees

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
it this rotates like yeah 360 degrees

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.330 
it this rotates like yeah 360 degrees
then<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.820> torpedoes<00:02:00.420> right<00:02:01.140> there

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
then you have like torpedoes right there

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.050 
then you have like torpedoes right there
yeah

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.600 

like<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.510> yeah<00:02:07.290> they<00:02:07.470> shoot<00:02:07.920> out<00:02:08.040> very<00:02:08.460> neat

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
like that yeah they shoot out very neat

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.380 
like that yeah they shoot out very neat
and<00:02:09.800> that<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.880> for<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.840> rebel<00:02:14.300> for<00:02:15.300> the

and that is it for the rebel for the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.300 
and that is it for the rebel for the
rebel<00:02:16.280> super<00:02:17.280> army<00:02:17.550> pack<00:02:17.730> very<00:02:18.120> close<00:02:18.390> up

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
rebel super army pack very close up

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.480 
rebel super army pack very close up
alright<00:02:20.310> now<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:21.710> snow<00:02:22.710> trooper<00:02:22.950> battle

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
alright now to the snow trooper battle

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.940 
alright now to the snow trooper battle
pack<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.970> was<00:02:24.360> my<00:02:24.540> favorite<00:02:24.900> because<00:02:25.050> they

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
pack this was my favorite because they

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.930 
pack this was my favorite because they
brought<00:02:26.130> back<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:28.220> storm<00:02:29.220> trooper<00:02:29.490> pilot<00:02:29.820> and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
brought back the storm trooper pilot and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.120 
brought back the storm trooper pilot and
I<00:02:29.970> think<00:02:30.120> that's<00:02:30.270> what<00:02:30.420> they<00:02:30.510> call<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.800> this<00:02:31.800> is

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
I think that's what they call it this is

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.410 
I think that's what they call it this is
very<00:02:32.220> neat<00:02:32.700> because<00:02:32.790> they<00:02:32.880> brought<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.150> back

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
very neat because they brought that back

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.260 
very neat because they brought that back
I<00:02:33.600> think<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.840> wasn't<00:02:33.960> a<00:02:34.140> lot<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.460> 99<00:02:35.460> sets<00:02:35.820> like

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
I think it wasn't a lot of 99 sets like

he comes with monoculars which is very
cool<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.770> then<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.340> course<00:03:26.370> we<00:03:27.060> have<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:28.620> snow

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
cool and then of course we have the snow

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.970 
cool and then of course we have the snow
troopers<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.850> uh<00:03:33.290> nothing<00:03:34.290> really<00:03:34.440> different
