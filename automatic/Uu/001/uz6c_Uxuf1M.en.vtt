simple<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.330> for<00:02:31.019> me<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.200> would<00:02:31.530> prefer<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.950> do

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
simple and for me I would prefer to do

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.899 
simple and for me I would prefer to do
something<00:02:32.760> that's<00:02:33.709> easy<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.890> make<00:02:35.250> but<00:02:35.549> has<00:02:35.879> a

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
something that's easy to make but has a

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.580 
something that's easy to make but has a
high<00:02:36.150> impact<00:02:36.569> when<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.049> put<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.290> all<00:02:37.349> together

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
high impact when you put it all together

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.740 
high impact when you put it all together
it<00:02:37.920> really<00:02:37.980> looks<00:02:38.310> good<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.879> know<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.299> it<00:02:39.569> was

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
it really looks good you know but it was

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.080 
it really looks good you know but it was
simple<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.319> begin<00:02:40.829> with<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.790> me<00:02:41.940> at

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
simple to begin with and for me at

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.339 
simple to begin with and for me at
that's<00:02:42.329> something<00:02:42.659> that<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.840> really<00:02:43.049> like<00:02:43.319> to

believing lies you know about ourselves

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.420 
believing lies you know about ourselves
because<00:02:55.079> you<00:02:55.530> know<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.739> world's<00:02:56.010> told<00:02:56.310> us
