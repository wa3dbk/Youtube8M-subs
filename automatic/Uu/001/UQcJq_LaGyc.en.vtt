are at there are three different types
of<00:00:07.620> fishing<00:00:07.980> weight<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.580> are<00:00:08.730> used<00:00:08.910> in

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
of fishing weight that are used in

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.030 
of fishing weight that are used in
British<00:00:09.360> Columbia<00:00:09.780> there<00:00:10.290> are<00:00:10.410> fixed<00:00:10.740> weight

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
British Columbia there are fixed weight

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.970 
British Columbia there are fixed weight
sliding<00:00:11.759> weight<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.360> split<00:00:12.929> shots<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.830> in

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
sliding weight and split shots so in

sliding weight and split shots so in
this<00:00:14.099> house<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.429> fish<00:00:14.610> video<00:00:14.940> we'll<00:00:15.509> take<00:00:15.719> a

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
this house of fish video we'll take a

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.750 
this house of fish video we'll take a
look<00:00:15.960> at<00:00:16.080> how<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.619> when<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.920> use<00:00:17.250> each<00:00:17.460> of

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
look at how and when to use each of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.750 
look at how and when to use each of
these<00:00:17.910> weights<00:00:18.590> fixed<00:00:19.590> weight<00:00:19.740> usually<00:00:20.609> has<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
these weights fixed weight usually has a

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.300 
these weights fixed weight usually has a
line<00:00:21.090> detachment<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.140> such<00:00:22.619> as<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> swivel

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
line detachment on it such as a swivel

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.400 
line detachment on it such as a swivel
so<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:24.000> tie<00:00:24.210> your<00:00:24.359> line<00:00:24.570> directly<00:00:25.109> onto

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
so you can tie your line directly onto

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.859 
so you can tie your line directly onto
it<00:00:25.710> cast<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.430> out<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:27.000> listed<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.689> bottom

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
it cast it out the listed on the bottom

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.500 
it cast it out the listed on the bottom
and<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.650> purpose<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:30.119> anchor

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
and the purpose is just that to anchor

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.479 
and the purpose is just that to anchor
your<00:00:30.599> bait<00:00:30.900> right<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> bottom<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
your bait right on the bottom in the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.479 
your bait right on the bottom in the
current<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.930> amount<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.469> weight<00:00:34.590> use<00:00:34.890> really

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
current the amount of weight use really

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.030 
current the amount of weight use really
depends<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.000> how<00:00:36.329> strong<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> current<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.469> so

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
depends on how strong the current is so

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.639 
depends on how strong the current is so
these<00:00:38.640> kind<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.030> weight<00:00:39.239> ranges<00:00:39.780> from<00:00:39.960> 1<00:00:40.440> ounce

on<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> bottom<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:25.409> usually<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.890> carried

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
on the bottom you usually get carried

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.300 
on the bottom you usually get carried
away<00:01:26.430> by<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> current<00:01:26.909> quite<00:01:27.390> easily<00:01:28.310> split

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
which has a little melt on one side so

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.569 
which has a little melt on one side so
you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.259> actually<00:01:34.560> put<00:01:34.740> your<00:01:34.860> line<00:01:35.070> into<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
you can actually put your line into it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.030 
you can actually put your line into it
and<00:01:35.790> close<00:01:36.570> right<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.650> stay<00:01:37.890> on

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and close right up and that will stay on

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.120 
and close right up and that will stay on
the<00:01:38.220> line<00:01:38.250> pipe<00:01:38.759> firmly<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.829> these<00:01:40.829> weights

are quite small and that usually use for
balancing<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.689> float<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:47.040> reason<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.640> we

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
balancing a float the reason that we

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.340 
balancing a float the reason that we
might<00:01:47.970> want<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.180> use<00:01:48.240> split<00:01:48.630> jaws<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.020> balance
