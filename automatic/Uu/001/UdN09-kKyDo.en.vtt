watching someone do to you what you've

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.200 
watching someone do to you what you've
done<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.120> many<00:02:35.330> other<00:02:35.450> players<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.700> you're

done to so many other players and you're
trying<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.480> think<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.900> ways<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.050> stop<00:02:39.380> it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.210 

twenty-nine

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.090 

I<00:02:50.140> think<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.230> fact<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.530> he<00:02:51.680> passed<00:02:51.920> this

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
I think the fact that he passed this

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.300 
I think the fact that he passed this
isn't<00:02:52.400> for<00:02:52.580> me<00:02:52.610> as<00:02:52.790> well<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:54.100> don't<00:02:55.100> think<00:02:55.130> he'd

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
isn't for me as well I don't think he'd

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.650 
isn't for me as well I don't think he'd
have<00:02:55.400> any<00:02:55.550> fear<00:02:55.850> anyway<00:02:56.180> if<00:02:56.300> he<00:02:56.360> didn't

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
have any fear anyway if he didn't

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.060 
have any fear anyway if he didn't
practice<00:02:56.960> with<00:02:57.080> Romney<00:02:57.380> but<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.650> certainly

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
practice with Romney but it certainly

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.520 
practice with Romney but it certainly
helps<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.580> situation<00:02:58.790> like<00:02:59.720> your<00:02:59.900> situation

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
helps the situation like your situation

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.560 
helps the situation like your situation
when<00:03:00.680> he<00:03:01.370> used<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.580> play<00:03:01.790> with<00:03:02.090> John<00:03:02.330> Higgins

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
when he used to play with John Higgins

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.050 
when he used to play with John Higgins
Steve<00:03:02.990> McGuire<00:03:03.380> all<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.740> time<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.280> think<00:03:04.760> you

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
Steve McGuire all the time I think you

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.270 
Steve McGuire all the time I think you
help<00:03:05.240> them<00:03:05.390> on<00:03:05.600> tremendously<00:03:06.260> when<00:03:07.160> you

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
help them on tremendously when you

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.360 
help them on tremendously when you
played<00:03:07.460> them<00:03:07.610> in<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.760> big<00:03:07.940> occasion<00:03:09.370> you
