00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.270
 more preamble to see the image of 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.430
 satellite that is quite important 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 tell you we have several factors that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.760
 were generating this instability by 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.680
 one side low pressure channel along 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.510
 from our country here we can appreciate it 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.090
 and we have a new disturbance 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.190
 tropical this almost a thousand kilometers to 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.109
 southwest of acapulco warrior east 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.760
 find 30 percent developments 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.329
 iconic this can develop the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.219
 next 20 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.449
 to thirty eight hours that 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.979

 take it into account for up to a 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.159
 30 percent this possibility but 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.600
 let's also see that I do not know anything 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.100

 well you have to have a little bit of 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.979
 patience on this side for the heat 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.130
