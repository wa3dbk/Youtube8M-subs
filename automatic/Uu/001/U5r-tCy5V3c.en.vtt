so much is set up as if they're going to
give<00:01:44.560> you<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.830> real<00:01:45.010> story<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.550> truth<00:01:45.820> but

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
really you never get the truth truth is

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.380

hard<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:50.020> get<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:50.410> getting<00:01:51.370> harder<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.850> get<00:01:52.180> to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
hard to get to getting harder to get to

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.590 
hard to get to getting harder to get to
so<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.620> easiest<00:01:53.770> way<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.280> get<00:01:54.520> there<00:01:54.820> is<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.270> go

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
so the easiest way to get there is to go

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.340 
so the easiest way to get there is to go
by<00:01:55.810> lies<00:01:56.370> don't<00:01:57.370> even<00:01:57.730> try<00:01:58.000> for<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.360> truth<00:01:58.630> try

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
by lies don't even try for the truth try

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.559 
by lies don't even try for the truth try

the<00:05:02.509> idea<00:05:02.840> is<00:05:02.930> I'm<00:05:03.680> going<00:05:03.889> to<00:05:03.949> tell<00:05:04.160> a<00:05:04.190> story

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
the idea is I'm going to tell a story

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.610 
the idea is I'm going to tell a story
but<00:05:05.360> that<00:05:05.599> story<00:05:05.960> is<00:05:06.050> going<00:05:06.139> to<00:05:06.259> resonate

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
but that story is going to resonate

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.189 
but that story is going to resonate
differently<00:05:07.280> in<00:05:07.580> each<00:05:07.910> person<00:05:08.479> and<00:05:08.659> it<00:05:08.990> has

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
differently in each person and it has

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.110 
differently in each person and it has
the<00:05:09.380> effect<00:05:09.740> of<00:05:09.979> getting<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.610> core<00:05:10.849> of

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
the effect of getting to the core of

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.149 
the effect of getting to the core of
each<00:05:11.240> person's<00:05:11.750> life<00:05:11.990> which<00:05:12.590> as<00:05:12.770> I<00:05:12.800> said<00:05:12.919> is

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
each person's life which as I said is

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.089 
each person's life which as I said is
mythic<00:05:13.669> and<00:05:13.789> so<00:05:14.300> just<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.259> hearing<00:05:15.650> of<00:05:15.770> a<00:05:15.889> myth

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
mythic and so just the hearing of a myth

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.120 
mythic and so just the hearing of a myth
is<00:05:16.340> though<00:05:16.909> is<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.479> at<00:05:18.229> some<00:05:18.590> level<00:05:18.949> and

is though is it at some level and

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.629 
is though is it at some level and
alteration<00:05:20.030> or<00:05:20.180> change<00:05:20.960> a<00:05:21.169> person's<00:05:21.560> life<00:05:24.639> in

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
alteration or change a person's life in

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.510 
alteration or change a person's life in
paying<00:05:26.479> enough<00:05:26.720> attention<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:27.289> myth<00:05:27.650> we<00:05:28.310> can
