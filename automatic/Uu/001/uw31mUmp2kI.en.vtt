the camera get all nice and dark you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.049 
the camera get all nice and dark you
can't<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:52.770> me<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.550> probably<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.879> pretty

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
can't see me it's probably a pretty

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.770 
can't see me it's probably a pretty
scary<00:00:54.390> thought<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.920> then<00:00:55.920> turn<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.780> and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
scary thought and then turn this on and

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.029 
scary thought and then turn this on and
as<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.039> see<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:00.239> difference<00:01:00.690> is

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
as you can see the difference is

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.429 
as you can see the difference is
essentially<00:01:02.039> night<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.000> day<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:03.780> let<00:01:04.229> me<00:01:04.290> just

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
essentially night and day so let me just

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.920 
essentially night and day so let me just
flick<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.070> upside<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.810> again

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
flick it upside down like this so again

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.539 
flick it upside down like this so again
I<00:01:07.080> think<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.470> kind<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:07.770> me<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
I think you can kind of get me and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.429 
I think you can kind of get me and

at<00:01:51.299> let's<00:01:51.899> get<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> closer<00:01:52.350> look<00:01:52.439> at<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.710> light

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
at let's get a closer look at the light

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.300 
at let's get a closer look at the light
now<00:01:54.899> again<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.229> clearly<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.890> exit

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
now again you can clearly see the exit

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.100 
now again you can clearly see the exit
sign<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.969> you'll<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.509> live<00:01:57.930> with<00:01:58.079> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
sign so you'll have to live with that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.039 
sign so you'll have to live with that
for<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> second<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:58.890> I'm<00:01:58.979> gonna<00:01:59.100> turn<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.640> the

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
for a second but I'm gonna turn on the

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.069 
for a second but I'm gonna turn on the
standard<00:02:01.049> poly<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.850> see<00:02:03.060> there<00:02:03.299> bad

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
standard poly and you can see there bad

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.499 
standard poly and you can see there bad
guy<00:02:04.320> coming<00:02:04.710> through<00:02:04.740> door<00:02:05.119> turn<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.299> off

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
guy coming through door turn this off

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.490 
guy coming through door turn this off
and<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:07.590> turn<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:09.050> daylight<00:02:10.050> version

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
and then turn on the daylight version

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.380 
and then turn on the daylight version
and<00:02:10.679> if<00:02:11.520> someone's<00:02:11.879> coming<00:02:11.970> through<00:02:12.239> that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and if someone's coming through that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.020 
and if someone's coming through that
door

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
door

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.520 
door
they<00:02:13.180> think<00:02:13.420> is<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.569> freight<00:02:13.840> train<00:02:14.080> coming<00:02:14.410> at

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
they think is a freight train coming at

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.010 
they think is a freight train coming at
them<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:15.040> again<00:02:15.370> you're<00:02:15.790> looking<00:02:16.180> at<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.630> pure

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
them so again you're looking at the pure

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:29.940 
them so again you're looking at the pure
intensity<00:02:17.890> of<00:02:18.780> 640<00:02:19.780> lumens

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.820 

now<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.010> light<00:02:31.250> itself<00:02:31.670> in<00:02:32.120> high-output<00:02:32.930> will

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
now the light itself in high-output will

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.070 
now the light itself in high-output will
put<00:02:34.040> out<00:02:34.450> 640<00:02:35.450> lumens

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
put out 640 lumens

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.460 
put out 640 lumens
that's<00:02:36.379> essentially<00:02:37.209> 22,000<00:02:38.209> peak<00:02:38.569> candle

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
that's essentially 22,000 peak candle

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.800 
that's essentially 22,000 peak candle
beam<00:02:39.709> so<00:02:40.340> it's<00:02:40.459> pretty<00:02:40.670> darn<00:02:41.000> intense<00:02:41.510> and

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
beam so it's pretty darn intense and

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.500 
beam so it's pretty darn intense and
that<00:02:42.379> has<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.920> range<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.670> about<00:02:43.879> two<00:02:44.480> hundred

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
that has a range of about two hundred

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.470 
that has a range of about two hundred
and<00:02:44.959> ninety<00:02:45.019> seven<00:02:45.500> meters<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:47.360> will

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
and ninety seven meters and that will

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.570 
and ninety seven meters and that will
run<00:02:47.660> for<00:02:47.900> roughly<00:02:48.170> about<00:02:48.260> one<00:02:49.010> hour<00:02:49.250> twenty

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
run for roughly about one hour twenty

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.420 
run for roughly about one hour twenty
five<00:02:49.790> minutes<00:02:50.060> give<00:02:50.510> or<00:02:50.540> take<00:02:50.840> in<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.830> medium

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
five minutes give or take in the medium

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.100 
five minutes give or take in the medium
of<00:02:52.610> course<00:02:52.910> it'll<00:02:53.030> run<00:02:53.239> longer<00:02:53.510> there<00:02:53.810> but<00:02:54.019> the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
of course it'll run longer there but the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.720 
of course it'll run longer there but the
output<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.650> different<00:02:55.010> it's<00:02:55.370> three<00:02:55.700> hundred

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
output is different it's three hundred

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.360 
output is different it's three hundred
and<00:02:56.120> forty<00:02:56.480> lumens<00:02:56.870> in<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.590> medium<00:02:57.920> range<00:02:58.099> and

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
and forty lumens in the medium range and

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.930 
and forty lumens in the medium range and
in<00:02:59.360> low<00:02:59.840> power<00:03:00.049> it's<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.590> hundred<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.129> seventy

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
in low power it's a hundred and seventy

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.880 
in low power it's a hundred and seventy
lumens<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.690> again<00:03:02.870> all<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.140> full<00:03:03.319> tech<00:03:03.590> specs

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
lumens and again all the full tech specs

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.009 
lumens and again all the full tech specs
are<00:03:04.040> on<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.280> website<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.390> also<00:03:05.480> has<00:03:05.810> that

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
are on the website it also has that

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.500 
are on the website it also has that
strobe<00:03:06.680> effect<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.670> can<00:03:07.910> run<00:03:08.060> up<00:03:08.329> to

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
strobe effect and that can run up to

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.410 
strobe effect and that can run up to
three<00:03:08.900> hours<00:03:09.079> on<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:10.160> strobe<00:03:10.579> effect<00:03:10.910> the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
three hours on the strobe effect the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.940 
three hours on the strobe effect the
light<00:03:11.599> itself<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:12.170> made<00:03:12.410> from<00:03:12.440> aircraft

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
light itself is made from aircraft

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.630 
light itself is made from aircraft
aluminum<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.269> it's<00:03:14.420> nice<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.049> robust<00:03:15.769> it<00:03:16.430> is

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
aluminum so it's nice and robust it is

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.600 
aluminum so it's nice and robust it is
also<00:03:17.090> shot<00:03:17.390> tested<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.829> impact
