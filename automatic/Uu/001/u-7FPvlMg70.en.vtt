not<00:01:46.770> having<00:01:47.070> mirrors<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.579> do<00:01:47.700> not<00:01:47.880> have

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
not having mirrors and we do not have

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.789

mirrors<00:01:48.390> anywhere<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.840> first<00:01:49.350> time<00:01:49.590> she's

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
mirrors anywhere this first time she's

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.490 
mirrors anywhere this first time she's
seen<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> big<00:01:51.420> shot<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:51.869> it's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
seen it so it is a big shot but it's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.260 
seen it so it is a big shot but it's
about<00:01:52.799> having<00:01:53.040> balance<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.030> think<00:01:54.210> you

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
about having balance and I think you

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.389 
about having balance and I think you
know<00:01:54.360> long<00:01:54.659> hair<00:01:54.960> when<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.439> are<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:56.009> 12

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
know long hair when you are you know 12

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.700 
know long hair when you are you know 12
13<00:01:56.549> 14<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.570> absolutely<00:01:57.990> fine<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.409> sort<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.590> as

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
13 14 is absolutely fine but sort of as

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.950 
13 14 is absolutely fine but sort of as
you<00:01:58.829> get<00:01:58.979> older<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.969> does<00:02:00.299> start<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.750> weigh<00:02:00.899> you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
you get older it does start to weigh you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.929 
you get older it does start to weigh you
down<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.399> much<00:02:02.640> fresher

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
down and I think it's a much fresher

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.880 
down and I think it's a much fresher
look<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.509> I've<00:02:03.600> taken<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.170> -<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:04.860> a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
look so I've taken it up - we can have a

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.740

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
using the razor around the front gives a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.370 
using the razor around the front gives a
really<00:02:11.160> lovely<00:02:11.400> soft<00:02:11.849> feel<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.540> I

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
really lovely soft feel and I

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.630 
really lovely soft feel and I
we<00:02:13.500> thought<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.770> was<00:02:13.830> very<00:02:13.920> important<00:02:14.550> for

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
we thought it was very important for

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.100 
we thought it was very important for
Jill<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.880> have<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> fringe<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.780> was<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.020> of

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
Jill to have a fringe that was one of

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.960 
Jill to have a fringe that was one of
the<00:02:16.170> key<00:02:16.350> things<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:17.220> also<00:02:17.340> decided<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.880> get

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
the key things we also decided to get

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.520 
the key things we also decided to get
rid<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.480> few<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.750> those<00:02:18.810> little<00:02:18.930> gray<00:02:19.230> hairs

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
rid of a few of those little gray hairs

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.390 
rid of a few of those little gray hairs
that<00:02:19.650> were<00:02:19.740> peeking<00:02:20.100> through

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
that were peeking through

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.150 
that were peeking through
but<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.690> fringe<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.230> think<00:02:22.440> does<00:02:22.680> make<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
but the fringe I think does make the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.320 
but the fringe I think does make the
biggest<00:02:23.340> impact<00:02:23.520> that's<00:02:23.910> going<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.150> be<00:02:24.240> the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
biggest impact that's going to be the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.490 
biggest impact that's going to be the
biggest<00:02:24.480> thing<00:02:24.720> for<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:24.990> get<00:02:25.140> used<00:02:25.290> to

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
biggest thing for you to get used to

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.780 
biggest thing for you to get used to
because<00:02:25.620> you're<00:02:25.800> just<00:02:25.920> not<00:02:26.010> used<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.490> seeing

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
because you're just not used to seeing

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.190 
because you're just not used to seeing
it<00:02:27.060> changes<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.570> shape<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.780> your<00:02:27.900> face

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
because if we lift the fringe away

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.450 
because if we lift the fringe away
suddenly<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:30.960> have<00:02:31.050> quite<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> long<00:02:31.620> face<00:02:31.920> yes
