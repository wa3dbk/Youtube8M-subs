00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
facial reactions of people who get on

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.319 
facial reactions of people who get on
the<00:01:34.119> bus<00:01:34.509> that<00:01:34.869> I<00:01:34.899> Drive<00:01:35.999> because<00:01:36.999> they're<00:01:37.149> not

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
the bus that I Drive because they're not

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.330 
the bus that I Drive because they're not
prepared<00:01:37.749> for<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:38.409> then<00:01:38.590> all<00:01:38.950> sudden<00:01:39.249> they

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
prepared for it and then all sudden they

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.620 
prepared for it and then all sudden they
walk<00:01:39.460> on<00:01:39.579> with<00:01:39.670> bus<00:01:39.789> and<00:01:39.999> there's<00:01:40.149> this<00:01:40.329> bulb

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
walk on with bus and there's this bulb

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.770 
walk on with bus and there's this bulb
girl<00:01:41.259> driving<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:42.069> bus<00:01:42.249> so<00:01:42.639> I<00:01:42.999> think<00:01:43.420> that's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
girl driving the bus so I think that's

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.480 
girl driving the bus so I think that's
maybe<00:01:44.319> the<00:01:44.560> only<00:01:44.799> thing<00:01:45.009> and<00:01:45.219> it's<00:01:45.340> usually

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
maybe the only thing and it's usually

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.399 
maybe the only thing and it's usually
again<00:01:45.819> like<00:01:46.060> not<00:01:46.270> negative<00:01:46.780> it's<00:01:47.049> just<00:01:47.259> like

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
again like not negative it's just like

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.679 
again like not negative it's just like
slightly<00:01:48.039> surprised<00:01:48.579> and<00:01:48.850> then<00:01:48.939> they<00:01:49.119> you

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689

because for my birthday it's a mall at

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.639 
because for my birthday it's a mall at
the<00:01:59.259> mall<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.700> we<00:02:00.880> went<00:02:01.090> shopping<00:02:01.149> and<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:02.560> I

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
the mall and we went shopping and so I

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.879 
the mall and we went shopping and so I
was<00:02:02.799> freshly<00:02:03.249> bald<00:02:03.639> and<00:02:04.350> everybody<00:02:05.350> stared

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:05.889 
was freshly bald and everybody stared

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:07.139 
was freshly bald and everybody stared
and<00:02:06.189> that<00:02:06.369> was<00:02:06.520> kind<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.789> an<00:02:06.909> interesting

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
and that was kind of an interesting

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.969 
and that was kind of an interesting
thing<00:02:07.539> to<00:02:07.840> experience<00:02:08.470> because<00:02:08.709> that's<00:02:08.830> never

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
thing to experience because that's never

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.650 
thing to experience because that's never
really<00:02:09.130> happened<00:02:09.550> before<00:02:09.580> it<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.479> kind<00:02:10.630> of

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
really happened before it so it kind of

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.970 
really happened before it so it kind of
made<00:02:10.780> me<00:02:10.810> think<00:02:10.899> about<00:02:11.080> like<00:02:11.350> what<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:11.890> would

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
made me think about like what it would

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.710 
made me think about like what it would
be<00:02:12.160> like<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.490> like<00:02:12.640> be<00:02:13.000> bold<00:02:13.209> for<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> different

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
be like to like be bold for a different

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.530 
be like to like be bold for a different
reason<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:14.590> looked<00:02:15.550> upon<00:02:15.849> differently<00:02:16.270> for

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
reason it's looked upon differently for

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.890 
reason it's looked upon differently for
girls<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.440> not<00:02:17.620> have<00:02:17.860> any<00:02:18.130> hair

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.149 

I'll<00:02:21.409> definitely<00:02:23.230> I'll<00:02:24.230> get<00:02:24.440> different

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
I'll definitely I'll get different

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.979 
I'll definitely I'll get different
reactions<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:25.849> feel<00:02:26.060> like<00:02:27.099> I'll<00:02:28.099> just<00:02:28.450> get<00:02:29.450> more
