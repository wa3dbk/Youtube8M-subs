00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.250
 how can they achieve this makeup and 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.780
 This hairstyle that I made to my friend 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.609
 paula in case you have the 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.680
 characteristics of paula this color of 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.050
 hair the color of skin you know what 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.939
 makeup would look perfect so 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.680
 if you want to know how this is done 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.680
 makeup let's watch the video 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.160
 before you start remember always 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.350
 disinfect their hands when they are going to touch 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.970
 the skin of another person and more than anything 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.980
 so that the person feels safe 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.620
 that the hands are clean as a second 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.840
 step I put this adn lotion is water 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.760
 thermal that I use it as a lotion 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.190
 toning to clean impurities 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.110
 of your face and to leave your skin ready 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.480
 to start to make up then 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.480
 I'm going to apply first on his eyes 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.670
 for this makeup use the water a 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.030
 Konstanz pallet sets and the first thing that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.170
 I will do it will seal the test that we put 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.690
 above and remember that to me 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.960
 like to use a color similar to the tone 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.960
 of your skin 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.860
 the second color that I will use will be 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.900
 a golden one I'm going to apply it on your 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.260
 mobile eyelid we reach the area of 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.260
 Basin 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.260
 intensify and blur so that the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.510
 color integrates perfectly to our 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.750
 skin the second color that I will use 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.150
 It is a wine color I apply putting a 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.190
 point on the outside of the eye and 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.640
 there blur to the middle of our 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.190
 eyelid 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.190
 the point faded to the source 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.500
 remember that the most important part 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.080
 so that a makeup is perfect is 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.800
 at the time of blurring more the part 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.800
 external eye 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.270
 that same color will not apply flush to 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.080
 the lower lashes but also 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.840
 up to half now with a brown color 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.240
 matte we will draw an inverted 7 in the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.550
 external part of our eye and for the 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.920
 top part we'll put it in the middle 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.580
 right where they meet in golden color and 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.580
 the color came 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.260
 they blur only in that small area 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.030
 for the part of the arch of our eyebrow 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.830
 we will light it with the same color 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.830
 vanilla that we put at the beginning 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.320
 and in the lacrimal area we will apply a 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.530
 Vanilla color but with a bit of 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.530
 brightness 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.490
 I'm going to do a type delineation that 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.150
 is using the eyeliner in down 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.150
 field 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.700
 Now with a pencil eyeliner I'm going to 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.010
 mark the bottom water line and 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.930
 superior as a last step to finish 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.180
 with your eyes I will use a mask 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.380
 eyelashes my first one we started with the 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.380
 lower lashes 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.410
 and then with the tabs 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.770
 superiors doing the movements in 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.140
 zigzag and applying growth means 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.790
 until you reach the tips now for 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.800
 continue with his face first I'm going to 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.590
 clean all the surplus to everything 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.480
 has fallen out of the shadows that's why 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.920
 I like to start making makeup first 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.920
 the eyes and then the face 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.299
 and apply a primer to the skin before 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.299
 to apply the base 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.950
 apply the base and I'm using the 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.820
 studio scoop of mac in a tone in that 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.820
 in 25 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.840
 from my palette of blogs you know the sense 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.820
 I will use this rumor in a tone 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.380
 orange applied on the cheeks with 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.380
 circular and ascending movements 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.880
 and to finish applying the color in their 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.880
 lips and I will use two shades of orange 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.830
 and that's how we ended up with the 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.570
 makeup now we go with the hair what 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.400
 first thing I'm going to do is divide your 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.170
 hair in three sections for the part 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.560
 opposite in two sections by the 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:47.250
 back to make some curls 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.250
 using the ferro 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:56.169
 and that 's the way it is 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.879
 makeup and this hairstyle I hope that you 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.979
