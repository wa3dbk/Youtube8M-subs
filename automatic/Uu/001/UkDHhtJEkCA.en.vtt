00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
says these are eastern time zones not

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.999 
says these are eastern time zones not
sure<00:01:24.689> why<00:01:25.200> there's<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.530> difference<00:01:25.920> there

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
sure why there's a difference there

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.350 
sure why there's a difference there
because<00:01:26.490> normally<00:01:26.820> they<00:01:26.909> release<00:01:27.150> them<00:01:27.299> at

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
because normally they release them at

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
because normally they release them at
the<00:01:27.450> same<00:01:27.570> time<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.049> maybe<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.560> ps4<00:01:29.189> on

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the same time but maybe because ps4 on

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.520 
the same time but maybe because ps4 on
playstation<00:01:30.030> 3<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.360> sony<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.350> know<00:01:31.439> they

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
playstation 3 and sony you know they

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.230 
playstation 3 and sony you know they
have<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.130> deal<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.549> rock<00:01:32.759> stars<00:01:32.939> so

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
have that the deal with rock stars so

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.429 
have that the deal with rock stars so
maybe<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.570> why<00:01:33.720> they<00:01:33.750> really<00:01:33.990> some<00:01:34.229> five

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
maybe that's why they really some five

holiday DLC and december 23rd is it

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.310 
holiday DLC and december 23rd is it
tuesday<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.329> guys<00:01:54.479> saw<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.259> of

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
tuesday as you guys saw so it kind of

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.840 
tuesday as you guys saw so it kind of
makes<00:01:55.470> sense<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:55.950> tuesday<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.759> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
makes sense you know tuesday is one of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.850 
makes sense you know tuesday is one of
the<00:01:56.909> days<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.090> they<00:01:57.360> release<00:01:57.600> DLCs<00:01:58.020> plus<00:01:58.560> two

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the days that they release DLCs plus two

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.039 
the days that they release DLCs plus two
days<00:01:59.040> before<00:01:59.250> Christmas<00:01:59.430> I<00:02:00.119> guess<00:02:00.780> if<00:02:00.960> they

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
days before Christmas I guess if they

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.179 
days before Christmas I guess if they
were<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.320> release<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> snow<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.159> all

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
were going to release the snow and all

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.440 
were going to release the snow and all
the<00:02:02.280> Christmas<00:02:02.610> stuff<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:03.030> would<00:02:03.149> kind<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the Christmas stuff that would kind of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.359 
the Christmas stuff that would kind of
make<00:02:03.600> sense<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:04.049> well<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.649> does<00:02:04.860> kind<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.189> suck

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
make sense as well it does kind of suck

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.770 
make sense as well it does kind of suck
though<00:02:05.549> because<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.240> two<00:02:06.479> days<00:02:06.630> before

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
though because that is two days before

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.359 
though because that is two days before
Christmas<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.530> there's<00:02:07.920> reason<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> be

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
Christmas and like there's reason to be

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.949 
Christmas and like there's reason to be
so<00:02:08.640> much<00:02:08.819> stuff<00:02:09.090> going<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.720> lot<00:02:09.899> of

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
so much stuff going on for a lot of

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.780 
so much stuff going on for a lot of
people<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.979> I'm<00:02:11.129> hoping<00:02:11.520> they'd<00:02:11.670> at<00:02:11.760> least

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
people that I'm hoping they'd at least

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.790 
people that I'm hoping they'd at least
extend<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.660> know<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> couple<00:02:13.080> weeks<00:02:13.379> like

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
extend it you know a couple weeks like

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.120 
extend it you know a couple weeks like
this

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
this

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.830 
this
no<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.370> all<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.610> Christmas<00:02:15.060> stuff<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.630> for
