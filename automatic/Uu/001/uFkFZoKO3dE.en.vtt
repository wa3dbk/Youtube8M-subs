00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.930 

really<00:01:03.570> simple<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.830> recognizes<00:01:05.250> most<00:01:05.670> words

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
really simple it recognizes most words

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.180 
really simple it recognizes most words
but<00:01:06.360> even<00:01:06.720> if<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.900> doesn't<00:01:07.560> recognize<00:01:07.920> one

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
but even if you doesn't recognize one

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.050 
but even if you doesn't recognize one
you<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.030> type<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.300> in<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> first<00:01:09.690> time<00:01:12.830> and

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
you just type it in the first time and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.780 
you just type it in the first time and
then<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.180> should<00:01:15.360> pick<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.720> again<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.790> you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
then it should pick it up again as you

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.810 
then it should pick it up again as you
can<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.330> simple<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.820> two

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
can see it's that simple the two

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.910 
can see it's that simple the two
continuous<00:01:21.390> trace<00:01:21.630> input<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.470> continuous

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
continuous trace input the continuous

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.370 
continuous trace input the continuous
input<00:01:23.070> works<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.450> doesn't<00:01:25.170> work

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
input works in and doesn't work

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.880 
input works in and doesn't work
everywhere<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.160> OS<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.580> works<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.970> most

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
everywhere on the OS it works in most

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.460 
everywhere on the OS it works in most
applications<00:01:28.890> such<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.160> in<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:30.000> mail<00:01:30.470> text

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
applications such as in the mail text

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.999 
applications such as in the mail text
messaging<00:01:32.540> email<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:34.080> it<00:01:34.200> doesn't<00:01:34.619> work<00:01:34.830> in

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
messaging email but it doesn't work in

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.790 
messaging email but it doesn't work in
the<00:01:35.130> internet<00:01:35.520> browser<00:01:36.440> that's<00:01:37.440> one<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
the internet browser that's one of the

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.010 
the internet browser that's one of the
methods<00:01:38.160> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.340> use<00:01:38.550> you<00:01:39.300> can<00:01:39.450> also<00:01:39.600> turn

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
methods you can use you can also turn

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.460 
methods you can use you can also turn
off<00:01:40.490> predictive<00:01:41.490> text<00:01:41.700> completely<00:01:45.320> switch<00:01:46.320> it

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
off predictive text completely switch it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.620 
off predictive text completely switch it
to<00:01:46.500> off<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.520> does<00:01:47.700> mean<00:01:47.940> that<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.240> can't<00:01:48.450> use

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
to off it does mean that you can't use

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.790 
to off it does mean that you can't use
the<00:01:48.750> trace<00:01:48.960> input<00:01:49.289> anymore

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
the trace input anymore

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.590 
the trace input anymore
but<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.610> means<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.119> type<00:01:51.450> in

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
but it that means you can just type in

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:00.320 
but it that means you can just type in
normally<00:01:58.310> which<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.490> really<00:01:59.729> easy<00:01:59.880> as<00:02:00.060> well<00:02:00.119> as

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
normally which is really easy as well as

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.889 
normally which is really easy as well as
you<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.750> see<00:02:02.179> it<00:02:03.179> takes<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.420> little<00:02:03.600> bit<00:02:03.720> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you can see it takes a little bit of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.300 
you can see it takes a little bit of
getting<00:02:04.020> used<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.350> I'd<00:02:04.530> much<00:02:04.800> prefer<00:02:04.830> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
getting used to I'd much prefer the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:15.920 
getting used to I'd much prefer the
continuous<00:02:06.300> trace<00:02:06.479> input<00:02:06.810> myself

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.780 

one<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.709> last<00:02:16.920> methods<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.579> show<00:02:17.730> you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
one of the last methods to show you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.449 
one of the last methods to show you
which<00:02:18.689> will<00:02:18.870> work<00:02:18.989> better<00:02:19.290> with<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.799> samsung

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
which will work better with the samsung

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:29.720 
which will work better with the samsung
C<00:02:20.670> pen<00:02:20.939> is<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:24.319> handwriting<00:02:28.159> which<00:02:29.159> if<00:02:29.340> we<00:02:29.489> go

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
C pen is the handwriting which if we go

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:38.390 
C pen is the handwriting which if we go
back<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.030> here<00:02:30.480> go<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:34.790> thing<00:02:35.790> here<00:02:37.400> so

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
back to here go to the thing here so

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.910 
back to here go to the thing here so
that<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.939> now<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.420> type<00:02:39.569> in<00:02:42.920> that's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
that and now you just type in that's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:56.210 
that and now you just type in that's
obviously<00:02:44.280> wrong

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.730 

again<00:02:57.000> doesn't<00:02:57.780> work<00:02:57.930> too<00:02:58.170> well<00:02:58.200> if<00:02:58.590> you're

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
again doesn't work too well if you're

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.510 
again doesn't work too well if you're
using<00:02:58.920> your<00:02:59.190> hand<00:02:59.630> but<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.750> should<00:03:00.930> be<00:03:01.080> fine

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
using your hand but it should be fine
