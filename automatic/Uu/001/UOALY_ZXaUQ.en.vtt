radar but we're playing Piazza today I

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.019 
radar but we're playing Piazza today I
think<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.400> think<00:00:23.609> that's<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.000> called

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
think I think that's what it's called

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.750 
think I think that's what it's called
Piazza<00:00:24.779> which<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.769> Plaza<00:00:26.070> i<00:00:26.250> think<00:00:26.550> is

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
Piazza which is like Plaza i think is

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.759 
Piazza which is like Plaza i think is
what<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.060> stands<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.390> an<00:00:27.570> italian<00:00:27.930> or

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
what that stands for an italian or

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.389 
what that stands for an italian or
something<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:29.970> design<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.199> i<00:00:32.099> don't

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
something to that design and i don't

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.459 
something to that design and i don't
really<00:00:32.700> know<00:00:32.820> how<00:00:33.090> i<00:00:33.329> feel<00:00:33.510> about<00:00:33.809> these<00:00:34.140> maps

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
really know how i feel about these maps

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.840 
really know how i feel about these maps
i<00:00:34.680> don't<00:00:34.829> know<00:00:34.950> if<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.370> because<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
i don't know if it's just because the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.370 
i don't know if it's just because the
game<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> better<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> maps<00:00:36.899> are<00:00:37.050> actually

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
game is better if the maps are actually

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.600 
game is better if the maps are actually
bad<00:00:38.120> it<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.629> something<00:00:40.469> about<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:41.010> map<00:00:41.250> makes

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
bad it is something about this map makes

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.520 
bad it is something about this map makes
it<00:00:41.850> makes<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.629> feel<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.079> game<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
it makes it feel like the game is a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.290 
it makes it feel like the game is a
little<00:00:43.739> bit<00:00:43.860> different<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:45.030> know<00:00:45.059> how

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
little bit different and you know how

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.850 
little bit different and you know how
I've<00:00:45.480> always<00:00:45.750> preached<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.469> need<00:00:46.710> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
I've always preached that they need to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.709 
I've always preached that they need to
have<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> solid<00:00:47.489> map<00:00:47.820> pack<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.210> order<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.629> this

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
have a solid map pack in order for this

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.500 
have a solid map pack in order for this
game<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> improve<00:00:49.910> but<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.000> seems<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.239> this

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
game to improve but it seems like this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.580 
game to improve but it seems like this
map<00:00:51.780> isn't<00:00:52.020> horrible<00:00:53.870> but<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.020> still<00:00:55.230> modern

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
map isn't horrible but it's still modern

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.729 
map isn't horrible but it's still modern
warfare<00:00:55.770> 3<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.280> that's<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> biggest<00:00:56.789> problem

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
warfare 3 and that's the biggest problem

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.410 
warfare 3 and that's the biggest problem
one<00:00:58.739> problem<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.520> with<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.850> map<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
one problem I have with this map is the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.029 
one problem I have with this map is the
kind<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> reminds<00:01:00.960> me<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.170> resistance<00:01:01.859> in

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
kind of reminds me of resistance in

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.270 
kind of reminds me of resistance in
terms<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.270> bullcrap<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.979> actual

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
terms of all the bullcrap in the actual

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.550 
terms of all the bullcrap in the actual
map<00:01:05.580> like<00:01:05.850> there's<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.869> these<00:01:07.049> cars<00:01:07.320> sit

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
map like there's just all these cars sit

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.170 
map like there's just all these cars sit
around<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.860> right<00:01:08.280> there<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.700> car<00:01:08.909> blows

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
around like right there that car blows

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.480 
around like right there that car blows
up<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.450> almost<00:01:09.659> kills<00:01:09.930> me<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:11.310> just

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
up it almost kills me and it's it's just

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.460 
up it almost kills me and it's it's just
stuff<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.990> kind<00:01:13.439> of

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
stuff like that that really just kind of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.160 
stuff like that that really just kind of
grinds<00:01:13.860> my<00:01:13.979> gears<00:01:14.010> i<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:15.090> don't<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.330> not

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
kind of stuff kind of detracts from the

kind of stuff kind of detracts from the
gameplay<00:01:19.740> aspect<00:01:20.280> i<00:01:20.490> mean<00:01:21.000> i<00:01:21.240> don't<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:21.720> too

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
gameplay aspect i mean i don't know too

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.240 
gameplay aspect i mean i don't know too
many<00:01:21.960> people<00:01:22.110> who<00:01:22.439> are<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.680> man<00:01:22.890> i<00:01:22.920> can't

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
many people who are like man i can't

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.219 
many people who are like man i can't
wait<00:01:23.340> till<00:01:23.640> they<00:01:23.729> put<00:01:23.909> more<00:01:24.270> exploding<00:01:25.020> cars

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
wait till they put more exploding cars

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.190 
wait till they put more exploding cars
in<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> map<00:01:25.770> i<00:01:25.920> mean<00:01:26.270> they've<00:01:27.270> done<00:01:27.479> us<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
in the map i mean they've done us that a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.830 
in the map i mean they've done us that a
substantial<00:01:28.610> amount<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:30.119> changes<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
substantial amount of changes in the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.940 
substantial amount of changes in the

call of duty franchise with this
installment<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.509> don't<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:33.930> exploding

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
installment and I don't think exploding

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.770 
installment and I don't think exploding
cars<00:01:34.860> were<00:01:35.100> we're<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.820> our<00:01:35.850> list<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.420> things<00:01:36.570> to

have respect for you but you know a map

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.960 
have respect for you but you know a map
pack<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> map<00:01:49.950> pack<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.369> almost<00:01:50.520> always

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
pack is a map pack they almost always

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.819 
pack is a map pack they almost always
feel<00:01:51.390> exactly<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.869> same<00:01:51.960> they<00:01:52.320> feel<00:01:52.500> really

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.679 
feel exactly the same they feel really
crappy<00:01:53.009> at<00:01:53.340> first<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.240> finally

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
crappy at first and then you finally

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.260 
crappy at first and then you finally
grow<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.500> guess<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.979> could<00:01:56.009> say<00:01:56.369> but

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
grow on you I guess you could say but

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.149 
grow on you I guess you could say but
here's<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.140> want<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.500> point<00:01:58.649> out<00:01:58.860> my

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
here's what I want to point out my

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.870 
here's what I want to point out my
biggest<00:01:59.670> problem<00:02:00.570> with<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:01.229> map<00:02:01.619> pack<00:02:02.460> is

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
biggest problem with this map pack is

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.319 
biggest problem with this map pack is
that<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.869> cannot<00:02:04.350> get<00:02:04.710> into<00:02:05.070> games<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:06.180> are

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
that I cannot get into games that are

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.809 
that I cannot get into games that are
the<00:02:06.659> maps<00:02:06.899> I've<00:02:07.350> played<00:02:07.740> Piazza<00:02:08.250> three<00:02:08.580> times

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the maps I've played Piazza three times

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.890 
the maps I've played Piazza three times
and<00:02:09.239> that's<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.580> finally<00:02:11.580> did<00:02:11.910> after<00:02:12.300> after

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and that's it I finally did after after

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.090 
and that's it I finally did after after
I'd<00:02:13.349> already<00:02:13.379> recorded

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
I'd already recorded

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.180 
I'd already recorded
as<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.250> finally<00:02:14.670> got<00:02:14.880> into<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.980> what<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.070> it

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
as I finally got into a what is it

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.580 
as I finally got into a what is it
liberation<00:02:17.850> lobby<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.930> map's<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.380> too

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
liberation lobby and that map's not too

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.280 
liberation lobby and that map's not too
bad<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.130> huge<00:02:20.670> though<00:02:21.060> which<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.780> guess<00:02:22.260> is

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
bad it's huge though which I guess is

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.450 
bad it's huge though which I guess is
all<00:02:22.590> right<00:02:22.740> it's<00:02:22.860> going<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.070> be<00:02:23.130> pretty<00:02:23.250> good

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
all right it's going to be pretty good

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.560 
all right it's going to be pretty good
for<00:02:23.640> ground<00:02:23.910> war<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.120> think<00:02:24.270> it'll<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> good

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
for ground war I think it'll be a good

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.450 
for ground war I think it'll be a good
domination<00:02:25.260> map<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:25.590> not<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:25.890> great<00:02:26.130> on<00:02:26.280> Team

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
domination map it's not so great on Team

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.040 
domination map it's not so great on Team
Deathmatch<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.060> kill<00:02:27.270> confirm<00:02:27.600> though<00:02:27.840> I

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
Deathmatch and kill confirm though I

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.960 
Deathmatch and kill confirm though I
feel<00:02:28.740> like<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.070> map<00:02:29.280> right<00:02:29.490> here's<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.700> pretty

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
feel like this map right here's a pretty

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.000 
feel like this map right here's a pretty
good<00:02:30.120> team<00:02:30.300> deathmatch<00:02:30.810> map<00:02:31.110> though<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.380> feels

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
good team deathmatch map though I feels

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.550 
good team deathmatch map though I feels
really<00:02:32.250> balanced<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.910> terms<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.560> levels

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
really balanced in terms of the levels

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.080 
really balanced in terms of the levels
and<00:02:34.740> stuff<00:02:34.800> like<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.520> we'll<00:02:35.730> see<00:02:35.910> how<00:02:35.940> it

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
and stuff like that so we'll see how it

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.520 
and stuff like that so we'll see how it
plays<00:02:36.210> out<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.660> know<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:36.930> really<00:02:37.110> easy<00:02:37.410> to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
plays out you know it's really easy to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.590 
plays out you know it's really easy to
set<00:02:38.160> your<00:02:38.250> first<00:02:38.490> impressions<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.150> how<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> map

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
set your first impressions but how a map

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.060 
set your first impressions but how a map
really<00:02:39.930> plays<00:02:40.170> doesn't<00:02:40.560> really<00:02:40.710> come<00:02:41.040> down

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
really plays doesn't really come down

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.700 
really plays doesn't really come down
till<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.360> don't<00:02:42.930> really<00:02:43.020> see<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.470> until

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
till you don't really see that until

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.160 
till you don't really see that until
later<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.070> in<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.610> game<00:02:44.640> in<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.210> maps<00:02:45.750> life

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
later on in the game in the maps life

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.600 
later on in the game in the maps life
cycle<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.650> guess<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.890> could<00:02:47.010> say<00:02:47.190> when<00:02:47.340> people

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
cycle I guess you could say when people

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.850 
cycle I guess you could say when people
start<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.970> figure<00:02:48.150> out<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:49.260> cheap<00:02:49.530> routes

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
start to figure out the the cheap routes

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.740 
start to figure out the the cheap routes
to<00:02:50.130> use<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.610> know<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:50.910> guess<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> route<00:02:51.390> Grothe

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
to use you know I guess a route Grothe

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.960 
to use you know I guess a route Grothe
can't<00:02:51.960> be<00:02:52.080> cheap<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.650> cheap<00:02:52.970> movements

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
can't be cheap but the cheap movements

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.850 
can't be cheap but the cheap movements
to<00:02:54.090> make<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.450> know<00:02:54.570> like<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> new<00:02:54.960> tube<00:02:55.440> from

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
to make you know like a new tube from

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.010 
to make you know like a new tube from
these<00:02:56.400> staircases<00:02:56.730> across<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> map<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.780> don't

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
these staircases across the map I don't

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.230 
these staircases across the map I don't
know<00:02:58.110> but<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:59.340> may<00:02:59.460> notice<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.850> isn't<00:03:00.180> a

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
know but you may notice this isn't a

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.750 
know but you may notice this isn't a
full<00:03:00.570> game<00:03:00.780> because<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.530> entered<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.460> game

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
full game because I entered this game

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.330 
full game because I entered this game
late<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:04.140> didn't<00:03:04.500> last<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.830> whole<00:03:04.950> time<00:03:05.130> so

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
late so it didn't last the whole time so

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.710 
late so it didn't last the whole time so
I'm<00:03:05.370> giving<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.760> guys<00:03:05.940> two<00:03:06.180> games<00:03:06.420> for<00:03:06.540> the

lot of questions for people so I found
that<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.870> map<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.350> really<00:03:37.680> bad<00:03:37.860> for<00:03:38.070> air

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
that this map is really bad for air

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.070 
that this map is really bad for air
support<00:03:38.280> as<00:03:38.850> you'll<00:03:39.030> see<00:03:39.180> any<00:03:39.360> end<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.630> do<00:03:39.690> speed

like why am I even running assault I
might<00:04:06.630> as<00:04:06.690> well<00:04:06.780> just<00:04:07.020> run<00:04:07.200> specialist<00:04:07.830> so

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
might as well just run specialist so

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.080 
might as well just run specialist so
note<00:04:09.210> to<00:04:09.420> self<00:04:09.450> run<00:04:09.930> specials<00:04:10.230> in<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.740> future

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.520 
note to self run specials in the future
but<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.240> feel<00:04:12.420> like<00:04:12.450> this<00:04:12.690> map<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:12.960> pretty<00:04:13.380> well

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
but I feel like this map is pretty well

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.350 
but I feel like this map is pretty well
balanced<00:04:13.950> I'm<00:04:14.040> pretty<00:04:14.250> satisfied<00:04:14.640> with<00:04:15.210> this

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
balanced I'm pretty satisfied with this

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.170 
balanced I'm pretty satisfied with this
map<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.870> don't<00:04:16.440> think<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.770> map<00:04:16.980> pack<00:04:17.250> execution

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
map I don't think the map pack execution

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.510 
map I don't think the map pack execution
look<00:04:18.390> at<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.690> that<00:04:19.140> dudes<00:04:19.380> really<00:04:19.920> using<00:04:20.370> a

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
look at that that dudes really using a

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.520 
look at that that dudes really using a
what's<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:20.970> thing<00:04:21.180> called<00:04:21.210> a<00:04:21.630> trophy<00:04:22.169> system

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
what's that thing called a trophy system

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.110 
what's that thing called a trophy system
and<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:22.770> was<00:04:22.860> like<00:04:22.950> well<00:04:23.070> like<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.490> guess<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.000> got

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
and I was like well like I guess I got

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.290 
and I was like well like I guess I got
on<00:04:24.270> there<00:04:24.600> I<00:04:25.560> don't<00:04:26.490> know<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.610> think<00:04:26.970> that<00:04:27.120> in

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
on there I don't know I think that in

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.780 
on there I don't know I think that in
terms<00:04:27.330> of

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
terms of

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.850 
terms of
terms<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.390> price<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:28.900> think<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:29.260> it's<00:04:29.380> not

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
terms of price I think that it's not

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.010 
terms of price I think that it's not
fair<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.250> they're<00:04:30.640> making<00:04:31.300> new<00:04:31.420> ps3<00:04:31.660> players

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
fair that they're making new ps3 players

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.540 
fair that they're making new ps3 players
wait<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.590> long<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:32.890> also<00:04:33.010> don't<00:04:33.190> think<00:04:33.430> it's

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
wait so long I also don't think it's

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.700 
wait so long I also don't think it's
fair<00:04:33.790> that<00:04:33.850> if<00:04:34.630> you're<00:04:35.110> not<00:04:35.230> an<00:04:35.380> elite<00:04:35.680> member

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
fair that if you're not an elite member

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.680 
fair that if you're not an elite member
you<00:04:36.070> have<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.310> wait<00:04:36.460> even<00:04:36.490> longer<00:04:36.760> also<00:04:37.510> don't

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
you have to wait even longer also don't

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.520 
you have to wait even longer also don't
think<00:04:37.750> it's<00:04:37.930> fair<00:04:38.080> that<00:04:38.140> they're<00:04:38.320> going<00:04:38.470> to

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
think it's fair that they're going to

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.440 
think it's fair that they're going to
make<00:04:38.680> it<00:04:38.800> twenty<00:04:39.220> dollars<00:04:39.700> or<00:04:40.210> at<00:04:40.300> least

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
make it twenty dollars or at least

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.120 
make it twenty dollars or at least
that's<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.660> word<00:04:40.900> on<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.050> street<00:04:41.140> so<00:04:41.650> if<00:04:41.980> this
