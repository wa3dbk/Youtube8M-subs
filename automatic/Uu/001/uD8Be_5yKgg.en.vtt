00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.350
 orton and once again I come back after a long 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.139
 absence time is that I am like the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.849
 most superstars of ww in the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.000
 present that works part time 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.060
 and for the most important events xd xd 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.039
 xd xdddd well, I bring you the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.710
 predictions of the elimination chamber 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.600
 2014 an event that I see that can be 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.539
 good and I hope they start with the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.099
 rivalries hours lehman and 30 at the end 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.750
 of this video I will give a small 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.850
 prediction of what I think we can 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.540
 provide this sleeve wells 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.600
 well let's start the kickoff 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.399
 retransmitted by youtube and wwf com will be 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.489
 a fighter match between the brothers 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.600
 rose against ryback curtis axel the fight 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.280
 it does not tell me anything 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.530
 I know it will be entertaining but I do not 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.320
 it interests at all the victory is the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.149
 I give the road brothers the first fight 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.399
 of the night will be for the title of 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.310
 couples between the friends of triples and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.040
 rose 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.130
 they look against the brothers uses but god 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.260
 my life is ww is that it does not shit 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.510
 with veteran fighters and friends of 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.760
 triple h the truth that I have nothing in 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.500
 against this veteran couple but the 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.960
 It's true that I'm really screwed 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.940
 championships I hope they do a fight 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.920
 with several couples for men germany 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.750
 because I would be disappointed not being able to see 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.880
 couples like the brothers roads or 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.430
 even raimat and curtis axel on monday 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.470
 Germany because of it the fight I think 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.750
 It's going to be very good to have and I'm going with 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.250
 that retain the new outlaws for 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.950
 arrive augurs lehman already with the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.320
 title the next fight will be between my 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.660
 comrades that is to say between tie put thousand 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.850
 against darren young the truth the fight 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.400
 I like it I like that they like it and 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.740
 you think they have a lot of future is a 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.570
 good fighter and with charisma rivalry 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.910
 has since in smackdown is and your 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.619
 changed to rude attacking his partner and 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.240
 from there in the following shows have 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.009
 had several browns in which he has 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.770
 came out winner most of the time 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.619
 thus giving today as the winner is and 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.690
 you arening so that it continues with supposed the 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.670
 third fight of the night will be by the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.100
 Intercontinental Title between 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.020
 champion and against jack swagger the fight 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.780
 I like the truth that I like the one 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.670
 I think it will be the future plan of the wwf 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.130
 for president man already with this title 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.260
 although that I will tell you later the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.209
 rivalry is scarce comes from a 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.430
 blowout that was decided on a leg of 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.530
 four corners the title challenger are 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.170
 two years victorious jack swagger after 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.450
 that's just a couple of facets and that's the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.550
 rivalry I'm like jack winning 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.380
 swagger I think they will give more weight to 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.420
 title since he lived has been of the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.239
 worse reigns in my opinion in many 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.150
 years since it has not contributed anything winner 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.220
 jack swagger the fourth fight of the night 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.709
 it will be between two of the best extremes 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.660
 this year is to say the wyatt family 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.120
 against the shield in a holistic sense 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.640
 This fight will be the best in the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.040
 year however the result is clear 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.260
 I think they are shitting it trying to 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.420
 separate the shield and more by giving it both 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.519
 look for roman rails that for me is the one 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.920
 less talent has but good the 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.170
 result I see it clearly the guaya family 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.600
 covering wins the fight in September rollings 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.000
 after this di mambro is attacking asset 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.569
 rolling if roman will do the salve doing 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.180
 your turn 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.730
 and we will have combat in germany between 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.280
 these therefore winners the family 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.230
 water and the fifth fight of the night will be 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.689
 between batista against alberto del río 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.409
 I really think it 's the easiest fight 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.540
 to predict 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.040
 Alberto del Río wins easy passes to 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.389
 lead an extreme area 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.250
 xd xd xd xd xdddd are not created hopefully 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.170
 was that serious that I screwed up the 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.870
 batista victory in the real battle 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.329
 but it was something too predictable other 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.579
 triple h friend I shit on that bastard 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.200
 of the fight that I can tell you 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.419
 the rivalry comes from before the 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.909
 real battle where Alberto criticized the 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:51.489
 animal but in all batista care 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.680
 has emerged winner and obviously batista 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.930
 you will not lose batista back in time 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.969
 partial is a veteran and takes away the 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.459
 main event from west germany to all 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:03.040
 tasks present even to the worker 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.859
 of john dinner I shit on batista hahaha 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.689
 Well, good winner and sadly batista 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.969
 the next fight will be the filling 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.250
 probably from divas so not the 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:14.919
 I will comment if it is for the title I give as 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.720
 winner to aj and the main event the fight of 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.500
 camera removal by title 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.739
 global 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.530
 ww that blowjob what the unification will be 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.050
 between sheamus cristian the champion randy 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.000
 orton encina antonio cesar and daniel 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.650
 Bryan the truth that I do not know why the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.470
 people have so many doubts with the 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.530
 result the truth is sung winner 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.500
 and new unified Christian champion ha ha 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.990
 ha ha ha ha haha ​​xd xd xd xd tt not 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.340
 I hope that's how I think it's the one 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.280
 he deserves more than all 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.650
 participants but good and I seriously 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.650
 to comment that it may be happening I think 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.270
 Cristian has little left in WW then 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.850
 I'm sure it will be the first 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.040
 eliminated and it will be by séamus I think that 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.730
 can be seen in ures lehman I'm not 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.680
 safe 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.200
 after this I think that Caesar will surprise you 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.510
 to many and eliminate sheamus after this 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.700
 and with four fighters in the ring I think 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.560
 that the next to fall will be pity for 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.390
 intervention or the wyatt family or 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.000
 I even think that I could eliminate it 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.400
 between Caesar or Ibra and the next one in 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.350
 fall after very good fight will be Cesar or 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.660
 hands of bryant and finally when 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.700
 randy orton and brian will appear 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.830
 cane will want to eliminate bryant but 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.410
 Bryant can finish him and he appears 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.750
 triple h pedigree to bryant and as in 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.390
 summerslam randy makes the count and 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.700
 retains its unified championship maybe 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.550
 at the end appear batista and have a 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.220
 I meet with randy anyway winner 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.710
 randy orton and good up here my 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.450
 predictions the truth I want to make some 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.550
 small bets on which can 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.100
 be the combats and possible rivalries 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.070
 in ures lehman already and I hope to hit some 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.840
 combat xd I think with confidence in 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.550
 the titles of couples the new 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.100
 Outlaws will face several 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.160
 couples like for example king spindles 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.530
 mysterio and the big show margin river ryback 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.720
 and curtis axel or the brothers rose between 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.390
 I think he can be among those 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.370
 couples below the titles neither 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.800
 cat I think that the United States 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.840
 will be dinandro is against román reims and 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.610
 we will see to see what participation will 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.910
 rollings and the intercontinental title 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.920
 between Swagger and Antonio festa yes 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.840
 I think the real Americans are 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.090
 they will separate the night after the camera 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.940
 of elimination after seeing that they ceased not 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.280
 has won in the fpv jacques and as soon as 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.760
 to the rest of the matches I think we'll see a 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.890
 where 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.900
 against brock lesnar's obsession 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.240
 heymann with the undertaker will have to see 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.460
 in history I think and I think it's one of those 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.890
 least I'm sure we 'll see a dinner 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.200
 maybe accompanied by seamus and maybe or 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.960
 hulk hogan against the wyatt family but 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.390
 I'm not sure about this after this 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.610
 I think there are several alternatives as 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.530
 maybe there's a triple h against ryan or 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.260
 a triple threat between triple h 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.960
 centimeters funk and ryan or very very little 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.690
 probable a triple h against pm for a 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.190
 daniel bryan against shawn michaels 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.230
 we might also see sheamus 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.570
 instead of in the fight against the wyatt 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.970
 against alberto del río or cristian 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.040
 and finally the main events seems 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.500
 sure we will see batista against randy 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.810
 orton and who knows if maybe makes m 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.570
 funk or daniel bryan appear hopefully 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.910
 yes and well this has been all for me 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:24.010
 part this was just an opinion of how 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.140
 see and route men lehman I already wait 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.810
 hit something xp send them a greeting 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:31.590
 cordial and I hope to see you enress lehman already 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.590
 a greeting
