00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
because it's a carbon-neutral building

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.469 
because it's a carbon-neutral building
so<00:01:49.920> they<00:01:50.040> basically<00:01:50.240> generate<00:01:51.240> all<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
so they basically generate all the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.569

panels on the top of the building and

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.170 
panels on the top of the building and
that's<00:01:55.530> really<00:01:56.070> cool<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.000> other

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
