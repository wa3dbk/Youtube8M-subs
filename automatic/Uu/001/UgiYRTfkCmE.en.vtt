basically the same spiked sort of um
only<00:00:45.210> thing<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:45.600> different<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
only thing that's different is the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.459 
only thing that's different is the
plates<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:47.820> upper<00:00:48.239> well<00:00:48.719> basically<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
plates the upper well basically it's a

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.340 
plates the upper well basically it's a
it's<00:00:49.739> completely<00:00:50.430> different<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.320> they<00:00:52.320> have

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
it's completely different but they have

it's completely different but they have
the<00:00:52.710> same<00:00:52.890> feel<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.309> them<00:00:54.829> each<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.129> weighs

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the same feel to them each one weighs

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.150 
the same feel to them each one weighs
around<00:00:56.969> six<00:00:57.510> ounces<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:59.989> each<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.350> is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
around six ounces and each one is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.980 
around six ounces and each one is
basically<00:01:02.579> built<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:05.040> events<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.990> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
basically built for the events of the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.789 
basically built for the events of the
100<00:01:07.439> through<00:01:07.790> 400<00:01:09.140> another<00:01:10.140> max<00:01:10.380> how<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.650> can

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
100 through 400 another max how you can

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.370 
100 through 400 another max how you can
do<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.250> 800<00:01:11.700> also<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.479> I'm<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.110> gonna<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
do the 800 also but I'm just gonna do a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.370 
do the 800 also but I'm just gonna do a
quick<00:01:13.799> little<00:01:14.060> comparison<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.170> long

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
quick little comparison I think so long

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320 
quick little comparison I think so long
I<00:01:16.590> don't<00:01:16.799> want<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.100> make<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.820> video<00:01:18.090> too<00:01:18.180> long

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
I don't want to make this video too long

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.490 
I don't want to make this video too long
so<00:01:18.720> I'm<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.020> gonna<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.350> quick<00:01:19.700> upper

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
so I'm just gonna do this quick upper

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.520 
so I'm just gonna do this quick upper
upper<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> max<00:01:24.330> cat<00:01:24.570> it's

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
upper as you see on the max cat it's

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.429 
upper as you see on the max cat it's
it's<00:01:26.340> open<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.060> you're<00:01:27.330> gonna<00:01:27.420> gonna<00:01:28.290> get<00:01:28.409> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
it's open so you're gonna gonna get a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.039 
it's open so you're gonna gonna get a
lot<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.680> airflow<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.729> good

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
lot of airflow in it which is good

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.960 
lot of airflow in it which is good
especially<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.850> which

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
especially if you if you like that which

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.609 
especially if you if you like that which
I<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.540> because<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:34.170> foot<00:01:34.439> doesn't

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
I do like because your foot doesn't

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.050 
I do like because your foot doesn't
overheat<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.570> these<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.500> seller<00:01:37.740> fives

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060

down so it's not it's not a big problem
the<00:01:52.170> only<00:01:52.200> air<00:01:52.740> flow<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.250> guys<00:01:53.430> from

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the only air flow that you guys from

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.539 
the only air flow that you guys from
here<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.360> tongue<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.680> vapor<00:01:55.860> tongue<00:01:56.189> you

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
here the tongue the the vapor tongue you

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.490 
here the tongue the the vapor tongue you
get<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> lot<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.060> air<00:01:57.149> flow<00:01:57.180> well<00:01:58.110> than<00:01:58.320> that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
get a lot of air flow well than that

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.830 
get a lot of air flow well than that
it's<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.640> all<00:01:59.790> closed<00:02:00.060> off<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.630> sides

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it's it's all closed off on the sides

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.620 
it's it's all closed off on the sides
and<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.710> course<00:02:01.979> right<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.540> get<00:02:03.869> nothing

and of course right here you get nothing

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.960 
and of course right here you get nothing
what<00:02:06.630> else<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.960> say<00:02:07.160> for<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.879> materials

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
what else can I say for the materials

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.710 
what else can I say for the materials
this<00:02:11.970> is

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
this is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.840 
this is
is<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> mesh<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:14.330> that's<00:02:15.330> gonna<00:02:15.510> add<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.780> airflow

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
is a mesh so that's gonna add to airflow

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.340 
is a mesh so that's gonna add to airflow
differences<00:02:17.850> color<00:02:18.150> ways<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.570> course<00:02:18.840> this

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
differences color ways of course this

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.730 
differences color ways of course this
this<00:02:19.680> bike<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.100> almost<00:02:21.080> well<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.350> three

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
this bike is almost well it is three

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.760 
this bike is almost well it is three
years<00:02:22.890> old<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.250> believe<00:02:23.840> but<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.380> it's

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
years old I believe but it's it's it's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.830 
years old I believe but it's it's it's
held<00:02:25.980> up<00:02:26.130> well<00:02:26.340> as<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.730> see<00:02:26.880> on<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.060> plate<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
held up well as you see on the plate the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.370 
held up well as you see on the plate the
plate<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.350> um<00:02:29.480> for<00:02:30.480> both<00:02:30.710> five<00:02:31.710> spikes<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.380> they

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
plate is um for both five spikes so they

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.180 
plate is um for both five spikes so they
are<00:02:35.010> very<00:02:35.520> similar<00:02:35.960> because<00:02:36.960> basically<00:02:37.920> has

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
are very similar because basically has

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.420 
are very similar because basically has
the<00:02:38.280> same<00:02:38.660> spike<00:02:39.660> plate<00:02:40.080> for<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.100> spikes

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
the same spike plate for the spikes

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.720 
the same spike plate for the spikes
except<00:02:42.090> for<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.660> design<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.800> course<00:02:43.950> because

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
except for the design of course because

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.090 
except for the design of course because
this<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:45.030> 3/4<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.850> top

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
this is a 3/4 and this is just the top

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.740 
this is a 3/4 and this is just the top
difference<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.850> course<00:02:51.150> carbon<00:02:51.570> fiber

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
difference is of course carbon fiber

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.900 
difference is of course carbon fiber
shank<00:02:52.670> right<00:02:53.670> there<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.890> shank<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.459> helps<00:02:56.760> a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
shank right there the shank it helps a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.300 
shank right there the shank it helps a
lot<00:02:57.270> believe<00:02:58.020> it<00:02:58.110> or<00:02:58.200> not<00:02:58.350> especially<00:02:58.830> when

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
lot believe it or not especially when

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.470 
lot believe it or not especially when
coming<00:02:59.790> off<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:01.160> with<00:03:02.160> each<00:03:02.310> step<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:03.090> take

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
coming off the with each step you take

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.380 
coming off the with each step you take
you<00:03:04.230> feel<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.470> little<00:03:04.740> spring<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.340> we're<00:03:06.180> on

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
you feel a little spring to it we're on

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.290 
you feel a little spring to it we're on
this<00:03:06.630> spike<00:03:06.990> right<00:03:07.800> here<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.370> basically<00:03:08.670> where

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
this spike right here is basically where

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.530 
this spike right here is basically where
you<00:03:09.750> get<00:03:09.959> all<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.980> spring<00:03:11.340> from<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.390> of

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
you get all the the spring from so of

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.800 
you get all the the spring from so of
course<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:14.430> helps<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.820> lot<00:03:15.030> right<00:03:15.330> here<00:03:15.540> and

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
course that helps a lot right here and

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.560 
course that helps a lot right here and
the<00:03:16.350> plate<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.620> more<00:03:16.890> stiff<00:03:17.220> which<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.820> prefer

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
the plate is more stiff which I prefer

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.330 
the plate is more stiff which I prefer
because<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:21.390> use<00:03:21.630> left<00:03:21.989> less<00:03:22.590> F<00:03:22.890> like

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
because you you use left less F like

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.850 
because you you use left less F like
effort<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:24.120> um<00:03:24.330> actually<00:03:25.019> bring<00:03:25.260> your<00:03:25.350> foot<00:03:25.620> up

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
effort to um actually bring your foot up

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.699 
effort to um actually bring your foot up
we're<00:03:26.730> on<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.450> max<00:03:27.690> cat<00:03:28.050> you're<00:03:28.410> just

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
we're on the max cat you're just

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.750 
we're on the max cat you're just
literally<00:03:29.130> using<00:03:30.090> energy<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:32.489> bring<00:03:32.640> your

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
literally using energy to to bring your

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.270 
literally using energy to to bring your
foot<00:03:32.940> up<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.330> bring<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.230> back<00:03:34.260> down<00:03:34.410> but<00:03:35.070> it

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
foot up and bring it back down but it

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.430 
foot up and bring it back down but it
really<00:03:35.670> doesn't<00:03:36.000> matter<00:03:36.090> um<00:03:36.510> actually<00:03:37.200> like

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
really doesn't matter um actually like

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.539 
really doesn't matter um actually like
these<00:03:37.680> more<00:03:38.070> for<00:03:38.660> for<00:03:39.660> curves<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.830> noticed

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
these more for for curves I noticed

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.850 
these more for for curves I noticed
yesterday<00:03:41.700> on<00:03:42.150> my<00:03:42.180> workout<00:03:42.660> um<00:03:42.959> for<00:03:43.739> each

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
yesterday on my workout um for each

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.110 
yesterday on my workout um for each
curve<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.549> had<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.090> work<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.450> bit<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.900> bit<00:03:46.860> more

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
curve I had to work a bit a bit more

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.990 
curve I had to work a bit a bit more
with<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.150> souther<00:03:48.900> fives<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.700> don't<00:03:50.700> know<00:03:50.790> why

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
with the souther fives I don't know why

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.460 
with the souther fives I don't know why
I<00:03:51.360> thought<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.810> thought<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.230> would

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
I thought I thought that I would

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.160 
I thought I thought that I would
actually<00:03:52.500> get<00:03:53.030> enough<00:03:54.030> grip<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.959> can

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
actually get enough grip so that can

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.430 
actually get enough grip so that can
just<00:03:55.200> take<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.830> curve<00:03:56.010> but<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.700> was<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.900> was

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
just take the curve but I was I was

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.100 
just take the curve but I was I was
working<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.890> bit<00:03:59.100> more<00:03:59.340> but<00:03:59.790> it<00:04:00.720> really<00:04:00.930> didn't

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
working a bit more but it really didn't

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.810 
working a bit more but it really didn't
matter<00:04:01.170> at<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.470> end<00:04:01.500> because<00:04:02.010> it<00:04:02.340> was<00:04:02.760> a

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
matter at the end because it was a

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.600 
matter at the end because it was a
really<00:04:02.970> hard<00:04:03.720> workout<00:04:04.640> it<00:04:05.640> was<00:04:05.790> just<00:04:05.970> 200<00:04:07.610> what

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
really hard workout it was just 200 what

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.300 
really hard workout it was just 200 what
else<00:04:08.760> can<00:04:08.880> I<00:04:08.910> say

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
else can I say

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.729 
else can I say
there<00:04:11.310> there<00:04:12.269> there<00:04:12.780> really<00:04:12.900> isn't<00:04:13.170> much<00:04:13.380> the

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
there there there really isn't much the

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.740 
there there there really isn't much the
sakes<00:04:14.010> up<00:04:14.280> like<00:04:14.459> this<00:04:14.760> right<00:04:15.090> here<00:04:15.269> this<00:04:15.510> is

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
sakes up like this right here this is

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.110 
sakes up like this right here this is
easier<00:04:16.560> as<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.979> see<00:04:17.190> right<00:04:17.220> here<00:04:17.640> it's

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
easier as you see right here it's

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.110 
easier as you see right here it's
flexible<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.130> can<00:04:20.489> literally<00:04:20.849> mess

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
flexible so you can literally mess

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.490 
flexible so you can literally mess
around<00:04:21.239> with<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.539> spike<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.930> can<00:04:22.049> throw<00:04:22.289> this

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
around with the spike you can throw this

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.950 
around with the spike you can throw this
in<00:04:22.580> crazy<00:04:23.580> events<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.270> you'll<00:04:24.390> get<00:04:24.630> great

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
in crazy events and you'll get great

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.300 
in crazy events and you'll get great
results

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
results

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.580 
results
you<00:04:26.400> can<00:04:26.610> I've<00:04:27.120> done<00:04:27.360> I've<00:04:27.540> done<00:04:27.570> hurdles<00:04:28.440> with

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
you can I've done I've done hurdles with

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.090 
you can I've done I've done hurdles with
these<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.040> everything<00:04:30.500> but<00:04:31.500> with<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.800> seller

these and everything but with the seller

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.430 
these and everything but with the seller
I<00:04:32.520> feel<00:04:33.090> like<00:04:33.240> it's<00:04:33.419> gonna<00:04:33.540> be<00:04:33.720> more<00:04:33.930> more

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
I feel like it's gonna be more more

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.560 
I feel like it's gonna be more more
rigid<00:04:34.830> so<00:04:35.370> for<00:04:35.760> hurdles<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.180> haven't<00:04:36.450> tried

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
rigid so for hurdles I haven't tried

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.909 
rigid so for hurdles I haven't tried
hurdles<00:04:36.900> yet<00:04:37.280> but<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.930> do<00:04:39.930> know<00:04:40.169> that<00:04:40.380> you're

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
hurdles yet but I do know that you're

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.560 
hurdles yet but I do know that you're
gonna<00:04:41.040> get<00:04:41.190> more<00:04:41.490> of<00:04:41.580> a<00:04:41.639> spring<00:04:41.970> probably

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
gonna get more of a spring probably

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.379 
gonna get more of a spring probably
because<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.830> plate<00:04:44.130> of<00:04:44.310> course<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:44.850> the

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
because the plate of course and the

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.740 
because the plate of course and the
plate<00:04:45.630> helps<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:45.990> lot<00:04:46.200> if<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:47.419> you<00:04:48.419> actually

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
plate helps a lot if you you actually

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.580 
plate helps a lot if you you actually
know<00:04:49.940> what<00:04:50.940> you're<00:04:51.000> doing<00:04:51.480> the<00:04:52.200> plate<00:04:52.440> can

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
know what you're doing the plate can

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.760 
know what you're doing the plate can
help<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:52.919> lot<00:04:53.100> so<00:04:53.520> that's<00:04:54.240> basically<00:04:54.600> it<00:04:54.870> as

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
help you a lot so that's basically it as

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.320 
help you a lot so that's basically it as
I<00:04:56.070> said<00:04:56.370> I<00:04:56.400> don't<00:04:56.580> want<00:04:56.700> this<00:04:56.790> video<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.120> be<00:04:57.300> too

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
I said I don't want this video to be too

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.670 
I said I don't want this video to be too
long<00:04:57.630> because<00:04:58.280> it<00:04:59.280> really<00:04:59.610> it's<00:05:00.410> did<00:05:01.410> two

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
long because it really it's did two

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.219 
long because it really it's did two
different<00:05:01.979> spikes<00:05:02.580> as<00:05:02.940> you<00:05:03.090> see<00:05:03.389> but<00:05:03.840> they're

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
different spikes as you see but they're

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.409 
different spikes as you see but they're
so<00:05:04.470> similar<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:05.310> really<00:05:05.729> can't<00:05:06.919> do<00:05:07.919> a

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
so similar you really can't do a

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.700 
so similar you really can't do a
legitimate<00:05:09.419> comparison<00:05:09.750> because<00:05:10.290> the<00:05:10.470> plates

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
legitimate comparison because the plates

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.620 
legitimate comparison because the plates
are<00:05:10.860> so<00:05:11.010> different<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.639> the<00:05:11.940> two<00:05:12.180> different

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
are so different and the two different

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.740 
are so different and the two different
designs<00:05:13.110> completely<00:05:15.470> it's<00:05:16.470> it's<00:05:16.860> basically<00:05:17.310> a

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
designs completely it's it's basically a

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.890 
designs completely it's it's basically a
personal<00:05:18.750> preference<00:05:18.990> in<00:05:19.500> my<00:05:19.710> opinion<00:05:20.900> like

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
personal preference in my opinion like

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.180 
personal preference in my opinion like
the<00:05:22.080> max<00:05:22.320> cut<00:05:22.590> four<00:05:24.410> bit<00:05:25.410> longer<00:05:25.620> distances

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
the max cut four bit longer distances

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.170 
the max cut four bit longer distances
and<00:05:26.540> for<00:05:27.540> more<00:05:27.720> flexibility<00:05:28.229> in<00:05:28.350> the<00:05:28.440> foot<00:05:28.620> and

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
and for more flexibility in the foot and

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.510 
and for more flexibility in the foot and
somewhat<00:05:30.180> for<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.390> curves<00:05:30.630> and<00:05:30.960> I<00:05:31.890> just<00:05:32.340> like

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
somewhat for the curves and I just like

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.490 
somewhat for the curves and I just like
this<00:05:32.669> spike<00:05:33.000> just<00:05:33.330> because<00:05:33.630> I<00:05:33.660> use<00:05:34.289> less

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
this spike just because I use less

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.310 
this spike just because I use less
effort<00:05:34.979> to<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:36.270> get<00:05:36.450> back<00:05:36.630> to<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:36.900> next<00:05:37.080> step

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
effort to to get back to the next step

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.690 
effort to to get back to the next step
and<00:05:38.300> it<00:05:39.300> locks<00:05:39.539> you<00:05:39.660> down<00:05:39.810> really<00:05:40.140> well

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
and it locks you down really well

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.250 
and it locks you down really well
especially<00:05:41.700> with<00:05:41.940> the<00:05:42.030> fly<00:05:42.180> wire<00:05:42.390> you

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
especially with the fly wire you

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.900 
especially with the fly wire you
actually<00:05:43.530> feel<00:05:43.710> it<00:05:43.740> so<00:05:44.430> yeah<00:05:44.640> that's

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
actually feel it so yeah that's

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.640 
actually feel it so yeah that's
basically<00:05:45.030> it<00:05:45.390> colorways<00:05:46.140> are<00:05:46.289> different<00:05:46.590> of

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
basically it colorways are different of

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.540 
basically it colorways are different of
course<00:05:46.860> but<00:05:47.690> yeah<00:05:48.690> that's<00:05:49.200> basically<00:05:49.380> it<00:05:49.770> the

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
course but yeah that's basically it the

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.700 
course but yeah that's basically it the
plates<00:05:50.850> different<00:05:51.600> uppers<00:05:52.229> are<00:05:52.350> completely

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
plates different uppers are completely

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.380 
plates different uppers are completely
different<00:05:53.070> you<00:05:53.610> can't<00:05:53.820> really<00:05:53.970> compare<00:05:54.120> the

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
different you can't really compare the

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.790 
different you can't really compare the
spikes<00:05:54.660> cuz<00:05:54.960> they're<00:05:55.169> two<00:05:55.289> different<00:05:55.410> spikes

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
spikes cuz they're two different spikes

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.719 
spikes cuz they're two different spikes
but<00:05:57.889> you<00:05:58.889> guys<00:05:59.010> are<00:05:59.130> just<00:05:59.160> kind<00:05:59.370> of<00:05:59.400> to<00:05:59.520> try<00:05:59.669> it
