00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 we use today that stacks 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.700
 use faster attraction 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.570
 fish 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.480
 weeping bait for this we use 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.060
 imperiali ski pepper tag in stick 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 small diameter which is suitable for 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.189
 any water temperature that is like when 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.010
 cold and warm 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:31.650
 that is, here we are, we still see it 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.210
 second option how do we use alice 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.719
 coarse alice 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.420
 Yes, and we ourselves are the same here 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.420
 now at the same water temperature 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.480
 group shotgun water and look at in 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.940
 this film he is highly active 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.600
 better to use with warm water still 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.260
 more the same 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.420
 with warm water and the third option as 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.460
 we have the third option is usually stick 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.210
 mix az on cooking which we 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.230
 use that is all year round too 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.370
 very good thing 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.370
 our secret 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:15.240
 now we threw them 3 2 bags into a glass 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.970
 And what result does it look like? 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.980
 all when she falls off with what she looks like 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.310
 all this can be seen already 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.550
 dissolves 3 is not slow that is anyone 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.890
 the grid is us 11 that is when will this 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.729
 all on a leash she will all lie on 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.940
 bottom not to raise so she is beautiful 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.610
 attracts fish expects from behind so we 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.009
 now see from really see the moment 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.590
 dissolution was already correct 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.990
 this picture we see in the cup yes that is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.920
 we see a picture of what lies but here in 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.600
 this situation there is no bait show 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.300
 bait and around bait that is 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.840
 it attracts a lot more fish this 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.180
 a bunch of need for example we have 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.700
 the option is just closer and interestingly here 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.979
 take that is he just lies with us 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.220
 the mesh has dissolved and that we have a ticket 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.120
 how does the west itself ticket it stands still 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.440
 what his translation 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.390
 we will then say dissolving in 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.280
 depending on water temperature 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.230
 if we talk about cold water from 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.330
 cold body already stood if water 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.090
 really cool as it is now super 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:31.180
 and tours can stand but the small fraction 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.159
 the thunder of the clock 6 8 10 calm for the second 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.329
 option with see here we take the second 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:40.269
 option take this pocket we will say 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:43.000
 we have the second option is cool us 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.190
 correspondingly larger pi LeZion like 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.500
 there will be even more likely 6 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.940
 we can now say for example if we 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.180
 talking about imperiali 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.920
 he is without but he is not oil-based in 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.940
 this case we have oil base there 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.040
 case is very fat it is better here 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.420
 Of course we will fly backwater when cold 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.700
 much longer to stand 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.709
 if we fail to cold water 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.290
 better better use of the simple 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.239
 warm water and cold and not dissolved 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.540
 it will be very simple 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:17.769
 beautiful lies win cause reverse 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.109
 effect with her to call a fish from drew in 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.760
 In this case, well, let's go back to 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.069
 Currently we have a floor grid 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.680
 dissolved that my 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.189
 and he sees how he stood we do not see 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.989
 no addictive effect needed 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.280
 let's watch him for a long time 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.139
 let's go further for the third option 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.290
 talk about this moment this moment 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.030
 flew this ordinary stick mix of ours 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.159
 homemade live 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.290
 particles pops up this very quickly 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.489
 attracts fish and also he is good 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.489
 work on cupid 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.989
 visually you can see it all 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:05.430
 that is , there is a suspended particle 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:07.739
 right there at the bottom we have a bunch of that 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.109
 we like that is such a stick can 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.250
 quietly throw far 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:16.650
 used mesh 14 millimeters 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.930
 normally you can fly 100 meters to 110 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.120
 calmly 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:27.150
 we are talking now that is these sticks 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.289
 but we will throw up to 180 yomen size 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.460
 the stick itself 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:34.530
 that is, the larger the size, the closer it is 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.039
 as the saying goes, the smaller the less 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.039
 mounting and 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.780
 so it went three hours three hours watching 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.870
 initial three options first 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.940
 option ordinary sawing material proteins 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.400
 sawing 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.470
 look for three hours he 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.170
 retained its shape 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.210
 not dissolved but left just such 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.250
 interesting 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.400
 that is, a glance is screamed that is preserved 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.770
 cloudy clouds that attracts fish but 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.870
 the most important thing about it is all if we 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:13.110
 we consider that we use 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:15.740
 the house has a very persistent smell here 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.550
 the water itself 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.490
 the second option where we used 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.210
 the usual type of bath drank it gives well 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.680
 suspended particles look carefully 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.560
 ticket even for cold water 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.340
 has a very good suspended particle 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.830
 they can be seen fault despite the fact that he is 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.449
 oil based it gives very good 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.689
 result 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.889
 fine but 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:44.050
 almost no smell 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:49.300
 and the last option which we 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:52.419
 used stick mix usual he gives 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.810
 good communication which for three 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.020
 o'clock 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:00.189
 continues to ply and top down i 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:03.129
 vice versa and gives light and accordingly 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:05.050
 this smell is reserved 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.180
 is there anything we can say about it 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.159
 about 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.099
 what can we say about it what is real 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:17.139
 on cold water at the most practical 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:19.590
 option and give the stick mix 1 and sawing's 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.590
 teriala
