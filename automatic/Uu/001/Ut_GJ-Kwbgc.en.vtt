00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.120
 hello hello here prefix 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.740
 marmalade fox and today I want 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.960
 offer you a very simple and tasty 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.789
 pumpkin dish and so we need 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 I have enough pumpkin 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.070
 big piece and first of all me 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.320
 you need to clean it well and to clean 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.109
 from the peel and I will first cut into such 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.019
 the slices are small just to be 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.040
 more convenient and now every slice with 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.980
 vegetable peelers are very easy to clean and 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.850
 now we need to cut our pumpkin 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:46.440
 I take 3-4 millimeters 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.690
 thick well and the size sense along the length already 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.520
 how will you get it all there 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.770
 depends on what you like 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.920
 will get like this 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.559
 records there plus minus 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.790
 heat the pan well 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.470
 her little oil and lay out our 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.850
 secretly so she is good 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.450
 roasted until ruddy here so we 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.490
 fry ours on both sides so that she 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.470
 blushed and then every time we shoot 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.259
 lay out 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:33.180
 every layer on some formula 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:35.689
 baking and just salt and pepper black 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.689
 pepper 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.740
 if you want if you like you can add 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.619
 more cumin and garlic if crushed 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.470
 love if you don't want to be too 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.050
 acute garlic can be through one layer but i 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.040
 I do not add garlic at all 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.320
 surely you can all these bars so 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.490
 roll in seasoning and just shove 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.710
 everything in the oven 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.259
 but in the oven so blush fails 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.380
 the pumpkin becomes more so simple 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.690
 wet and soft when all pumpkin 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.290
 fried folded forms will just 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.670
 sprinkle with grated cheese on top 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.660
 absolutely anyone can be what you 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.680
 like and of course the thickness of the layer can 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.890
 be to your taste and put in the oven 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.200
 literally five minutes to cheese 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.300
 melted 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.170
