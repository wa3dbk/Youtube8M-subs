00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.299 
I want to show you the best duplicator
out<00:00:08.600> there<00:00:08.870> and<00:00:09.049> I<00:00:09.590> just<00:00:09.620> came<00:00:09.950> across<00:00:10.129> this

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
out there and I just came across this

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.370 
out there and I just came across this
totally<00:00:11.030> by<00:00:11.210> accident<00:00:11.240> last<00:00:11.809> night<00:00:12.080> while<00:00:12.349> I

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
totally by accident last night while I

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.200 
totally by accident last night while I
was<00:00:12.530> actually<00:00:12.860> playing<00:00:13.009> in<00:00:13.190> my<00:00:13.370> survival<00:00:13.790> ward

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 
was actually playing in my survival ward

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.209 
was actually playing in my survival ward
so<00:00:14.719> so<00:00:15.019> freaking<00:00:15.349> amazing<00:00:15.559> and<00:00:15.980> you<00:00:16.070> could

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
so so freaking amazing and you could

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.370 
so so freaking amazing and you could
pretty<00:00:16.460> much<00:00:16.550> duplicate<00:00:17.240> any<00:00:17.570> block<00:00:18.080> type

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
pretty much duplicate any block type

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.319 
pretty much duplicate any block type
that<00:00:18.619> you<00:00:18.739> have<00:00:19.009> I<00:00:19.250> mean<00:00:19.489> is<00:00:19.790> so<00:00:20.000> freaking

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:20.329 
that you have I mean is so freaking

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:21.550 
that you have I mean is so freaking
amazing<00:00:20.540> and<00:00:20.810> this<00:00:20.899> is<00:00:21.079> probably<00:00:21.290> like<00:00:21.529> the

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
amazing and this is probably like the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.159 
amazing and this is probably like the
best<00:00:21.829> duplicator<00:00:22.399> out<00:00:22.669> there<00:00:22.910> so<00:00:23.630> it<00:00:23.960> doesn't

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
best duplicator out there so it doesn't

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.749 
best duplicator out there so it doesn't
really<00:00:24.380> matter<00:00:24.590> which<00:00:24.860> a<00:00:25.099> block<00:00:25.309> type<00:00:25.520> so<00:00:25.730> you

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
really matter which a block type so you

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.010 
really matter which a block type so you
actually<00:00:25.970> have<00:00:26.270> where<00:00:26.540> within<00:00:26.750> your

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
actually have where within your

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.049 
actually have where within your
inventory<00:00:27.470> like<00:00:27.710> this<00:00:27.890> you<00:00:28.399> can<00:00:28.520> just<00:00:28.550> throw

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:29.059 
inventory like this you can just throw

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:32.740 
inventory like this you can just throw
them<00:00:29.210> down<00:00:29.419> like<00:00:29.630> this<00:00:29.869> and<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:31.750> these

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
them down like this and and these

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.600 
them down like this and and these
probably<00:00:33.110> like<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.410> most<00:00:33.590> expensive<00:00:33.920> block

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
probably like the most expensive block

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.640 
probably like the most expensive block
types<00:00:34.880> that<00:00:35.120> aren't<00:00:35.480> available<00:00:35.630> in<00:00:36.170> Minecraft

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
types that aren't available in Minecraft

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.380 
types that aren't available in Minecraft
so<00:00:36.830> if<00:00:37.070> I<00:00:37.160> just<00:00:37.400> put<00:00:37.550> them<00:00:37.670> down<00:00:37.700> like<00:00:38.000> this<00:00:38.150> and

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
so if I just put them down like this and

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.010 
so if I just put them down like this and
then<00:00:39.080> hit<00:00:39.950> you<00:00:40.250> know<00:00:40.370> save<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:40.880> quit<00:00:41.060> and<00:00:41.450> then

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
then hit you know save and quit and then

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.580 
then hit you know save and quit and then
go<00:00:42.170> back<00:00:42.410> into<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:42.950> game<00:00:44.050> collect<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.140> items

go back into the game collect the items
go<00:00:46.340> back<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:46.970> then<00:00:47.630> hit<00:00:48.170> escape<00:00:48.410> close

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340

go back into my car racing it see now I

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.750 
go back into my car racing it see now I
could<00:01:09.229> still<00:01:09.500> have<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.710> items<00:01:10.190> and<00:01:10.370> if<00:01:10.430> I<00:01:10.550> pick

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
could still have the items and if I pick

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.910 
could still have the items and if I pick
them<00:01:10.880> up<00:01:10.970> again<00:01:11.120> I<00:01:11.630> would<00:01:12.050> have<00:01:12.080> a<00:01:12.440> double<00:01:12.830> that

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
them up again I would have a double that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.430 
them up again I would have a double that
amount<00:01:12.979> of<00:01:13.370> items<00:01:13.729> that<00:01:13.909> I<00:01:14.060> had<00:01:14.450> originally<00:01:14.990> so

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
amount of items that I had originally so

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.170 
amount of items that I had originally so
if<00:01:15.620> I<00:01:15.770> keep<00:01:16.070> repeating<00:01:16.370> that<00:01:16.520> but<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.030> thing

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
if I keep repeating that but the thing

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.730 
if I keep repeating that but the thing
is<00:01:17.330> now<00:01:17.600> although<00:01:18.020> I<00:01:18.080> have<00:01:18.229> to<00:01:18.320> do<00:01:18.440> just<00:01:18.620> hit

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
is now although I have to do just hit

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.580 
is now although I have to do just hit
escape<00:01:18.950> close<00:01:19.580> this<00:01:19.880> because<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:21.110> saving

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
escape close this because the saving

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.740 
escape close this because the saving
process<00:01:21.799> is<00:01:22.130> still<00:01:22.370> there<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:22.790> it's<00:01:23.450> just<00:01:23.600> to

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
process is still there and it's just to

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.940 
process is still there and it's just to
working<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:24.260> I<00:01:24.320> wouldn't<00:01:24.530> have<00:01:24.620> to<00:01:24.680> kind<00:01:24.890> of

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
working so I wouldn't have to kind of

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.740 
working so I wouldn't have to kind of
save<00:01:25.190> again<00:01:25.549> and<00:01:25.580> then<00:01:25.909> go<00:01:26.060> back<00:01:26.479> into<00:01:26.630> the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
save again and then go back into the

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.660 
save again and then go back into the
game<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:26.900> then<00:01:27.140> exist<00:01:27.560> all<00:01:27.979> have<00:01:28.159> to<00:01:28.280> do<00:01:28.400> now

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
game and then exist all have to do now

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.820 
game and then exist all have to do now
just<00:01:28.700> keep<00:01:29.390> pressing<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.870> escape<00:01:30.170> exiting

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
just keep pressing the escape exiting

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.219 
just keep pressing the escape exiting
the<00:01:30.950> game<00:01:31.100> from<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.850> X<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.330> then<00:01:32.750> going<00:01:33.049> back

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
the game from the X and then going back

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.320 
the game from the X and then going back
into<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.650> game<00:01:33.890> it's<00:01:34.220> kind<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:34.610> taking<00:01:34.970> longer

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
into the game it's kind of taking longer

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.460 
into the game it's kind of taking longer
to<00:01:35.450> load<00:01:35.720> now<00:01:35.960> because<00:01:36.229> I'm<00:01:36.320> actually

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
to load now because I'm actually

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.310 
to load now because I'm actually
recording<00:01:37.010> with<00:01:37.460> them<00:01:37.729> I<00:01:37.909> was<00:01:38.540> software

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
recording with them I was software

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.640 
recording with them I was software
called<00:01:39.670> Camtasia<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:42.140> it's<00:01:42.320> actually

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
called Camtasia so it's actually

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.219 
called Camtasia so it's actually
