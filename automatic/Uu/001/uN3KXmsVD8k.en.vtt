00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
through its paces today run it on some

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.679 
through its paces today run it on some
drill<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:05.909> if<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.090> actually<00:01:06.390> has<00:01:06.540> any

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
drill see if it actually has any

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.320 
drill see if it actually has any
practical<00:01:07.130> application<00:01:08.130> I'll<00:01:08.850> start<00:01:09.210> off

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
practical application I'll start off

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.570 
practical application I'll start off
just<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.720> our<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.590> order<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.340> actually

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
just with our so my order this actually

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.060 
just with our so my order this actually
is<00:01:11.880> fully<00:01:12.150> automatic<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.930> know<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.860> might

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
is fully automatic I know that might

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.469 
is fully automatic I know that might
seem<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> little<00:01:14.400> funny<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:14.970> we'll<00:01:15.119> see<00:01:15.270> what

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
seem a little funny but we'll see what

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:35.330 
seem a little funny but we'll see what
that<00:01:15.720> looks<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.200> little<00:01:16.470> later

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.140 

yeah<00:01:36.340> not<00:01:36.550> too<00:01:36.730> bad

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
yeah not too bad

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:55.780 
yeah not too bad
quite<00:01:37.960> controllable

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.760 

as<00:01:56.510> you<00:01:56.690> can<00:01:56.810> see<00:01:56.990> from<00:01:57.200> some<00:01:57.410> of<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.560> drills

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
as you can see from some of the drills

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.580 
as you can see from some of the drills
that<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:58.070> ran<00:01:58.280> back<00:01:58.520> there<00:01:58.550> it's<00:01:59.270> not<00:01:59.450> as

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
that I ran back there it's not as

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.900 
that I ran back there it's not as
uncontrollable<00:02:00.590> as<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.830> think<00:02:01.160> so<00:02:01.700> what<00:02:01.790> I'm

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
uncontrollable as you think so what I'm

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.160 
uncontrollable as you think so what I'm
going<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.090> do<00:02:02.240> I'm<00:02:02.360> just<00:02:02.420> going<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.690> try<00:02:02.930> a

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
going to do I'm just going to try a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.770 
going to do I'm just going to try a
short<00:02:03.980> fully<00:02:04.490> automatic<00:02:05.030> burst<00:02:05.240> for<00:02:05.540> no<00:02:05.630> other

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
short fully automatic burst for no other

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.230 
short fully automatic burst for no other
reason<00:02:05.930> because<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:06.560> can<00:02:06.950> I<00:02:07.220> really<00:02:07.940> like<00:02:08.090> to

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
reason because I can I really like to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.669 
reason because I can I really like to
see<00:02:08.420> what<00:02:08.600> it<00:02:08.690> can<00:02:08.869> do<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:09.259> I've<00:02:09.350> moved<00:02:09.530> a

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
see what it can do so I've moved a

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.770 
see what it can do so I've moved a
little<00:02:09.890> closer<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.490> berm<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.940> I'll<00:02:11.540> try

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
little closer to the berm and I'll try

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:20.740 
little closer to the berm and I'll try
it<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:11.990> see<00:02:12.170> if<00:02:12.320> it<00:02:12.530> can<00:02:13.250> in<00:02:13.400> fact<00:02:13.430> be<00:02:13.730> held<00:02:19.750> I'm

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
it and see if it can in fact be held I'm

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.630 
it and see if it can in fact be held I'm
not<00:02:20.990> too<00:02:21.170> bad<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.620> that's<00:02:21.800> actually<00:02:22.190> fun<00:02:22.400> I

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
not too bad and that's actually fun I

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:59.210 
not too bad and that's actually fun I
think<00:02:23.180> we'll<00:02:23.300> try<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.510> again

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.280
