00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
 Diablo OST announcing the beginning of an eternal dispute 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.480
 Diablo again, if you're in the mood, 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.740
 It seems that the killer is still blocking the test server. 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.520
 Treasure Goblin added as a special event to Daily Quest 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.380
 When Treasure Goblin comes up, it tells by the voice of the grandfather of Kane 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.820
 It seems to be a treasure goblin down taste because it dies too early. 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.780
 Treasure Goblins will pay 100 yen for the treatment. 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.340
 In the statistics, the warrior shows the damage received in the past healing portion. 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.180
 The most anticipated new map of the Eternity Dispute Update 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.280
 It is a map that supports the fight between angel and devil in two attacks. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.460
 Do you kill your opponent first? 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.400
 Or do we keep our objects? 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460
 It seems to be a battlefield that requires careful choice. 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.900
 When the life is halved, the angel and demon position changes as the event occurs .... ;;;;;; 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.540
 When you kill a demon (or an angel), an angel is summoned to attack. 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.160
 The remaining stamina of the friendly angel appears to be a new shield. 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:45.789
 It is important to know how much object is left and how to summon it. 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.960
 I have edited it briefly and have a pleasant hero ~
