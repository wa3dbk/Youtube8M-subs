00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.050
 They wanted to lord this Christmas. 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.050
 they have arranged a tree within our heart 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:17.189
 and in it hanged instead of present the names of all our hearers 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.560
 the listeners from near by 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.019
 The old and the most recent 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.940
 those we see each day and those we rarely encounter 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.020
 the always remembered 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.020
 and those who are sometimes forgotten 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.690
 the constants that the intermittent ones 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.430
 finally 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.280
 the names of all listeners 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
 here they have passed through our history 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.340
 we want to mount with a tree with very deep roots 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.680
 so that their names 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.980
 never be collected from our hearts again 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.470
 we dedicate very extensive so that new names 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.530
 from all over 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.530
 joins existing ones 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.010
 of very nice shadows 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.560
 so that our friendship is the bad moment of rest in the zone 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.780
 you warned 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.420
 already raul 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.200
 besides that one is alive within us 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.590
 on each day of the year that begins 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.370
 so that we can always live the love of the laity the fraternity 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.650
 with the list 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.870
 Unfortunate 2009 is the messages of the direction and employees of the radio 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.990
 imperial IMF to all our advertisers and collaborators
