00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.280 
around the same time but it doesn't need
to<00:01:49.470> be<00:01:49.560> exact<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.790> quickly<00:01:51.390> pause<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
to be exact so quickly pause the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.770 
to be exact so quickly pause the
recording<00:01:52.470> while<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.640> I'll<00:01:54.360> be

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
recording while I do this and I'll be

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.750 
recording while I do this and I'll be
back<00:01:54.960> once<00:01:55.229> done

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
back once done

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
okay so I've got them both recorded and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.620 
okay so I've got them both recorded and

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
see I've recorded both of them and it's

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.840 
see I've recorded both of them and it's
really<00:02:04.910> important<00:02:05.600> that<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:06.200> use<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:07.670> audio

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
really important that you use the audio

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.440 
really important that you use the audio
with<00:02:08.270> both<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.510> them<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:10.880> record<00:02:11.270> them<00:02:11.330> at

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
with both of them and you record them at

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.570 
with both of them and you record them at
the<00:02:11.600> exact<00:02:11.900> same<00:02:12.110> frame<00:02:12.440> rate<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:13.370> what<00:02:13.520> you

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
the exact same frame rate so what you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.750 
the exact same frame rate so what you
need<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.790> do<00:02:13.910> now<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.390> do<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.230> same<00:02:15.760> just

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
need to do now is do the same just

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.880 
need to do now is do the same just
virtualdub<00:02:17.480> them<00:02:17.720> like<00:02:17.960> you<00:02:18.140> usually<00:02:18.350> do<00:02:18.680> with

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
virtualdub them like you usually do with

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.550 
virtualdub them like you usually do with
counter-strike<00:02:19.430> videos<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:21.170> virtual<00:02:22.070> dog

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
counter-strike videos so virtual dog

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.280 
counter-strike videos so virtual dog
drag<00:02:24.560> one<00:02:24.800> in<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:26.780> want<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.050> get<00:02:27.170> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
drag one in and you want to get the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.650 
drag one in and you want to get the
frame<00:02:27.560> rate<00:02:27.770> too<00:02:28.070> I<00:02:28.520> think<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:28.880> recorded<00:02:29.300> just<00:02:29.480> a

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
frame rate too I think I recorded just a

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.059 
frame rate too I think I recorded just a
30<00:02:29.960> so<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.320> was<00:02:30.410> really<00:02:30.530> fast

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.670

his ABI we'll just save it to my desktop

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.410 
his ABI we'll just save it to my desktop
as<00:02:48.639> 1,000<00:02:49.329> and<00:02:50.879> shouldn't<00:02:51.879> take<00:02:51.999> too<00:02:52.030> long<00:02:52.209> but

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
as 1,000 and shouldn't take too long but

once we've got our Clips recorded we can

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.430 
once we've got our Clips recorded we can
drag<00:03:47.280> them<00:03:47.430> both<00:03:47.610> into<00:03:47.790> vegas<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:49.290> is

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
drag them both into vegas and this is

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.320 
drag them both into vegas and this is
where<00:03:49.680> you'll<00:03:49.980> see<00:03:50.370> why<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:50.640> was<00:03:50.819> important<00:03:51.239> we

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
where you'll see why it was important we

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.300 
where you'll see why it was important we
were<00:03:51.450> called<00:03:51.690> at<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.930> same<00:03:52.080> frame<00:03:52.410> rate<00:03:52.590> if

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
were called at the same frame rate if

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.160 
were called at the same frame rate if
you<00:03:53.519> create<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.819> new<00:03:53.940> video<00:03:54.239> track<00:03:54.480> by<00:03:54.750> right

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
you create a new video track by right

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.930 
you create a new video track by right
clicking<00:03:55.440> on<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.799> top<00:03:55.950> on<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.430> go<00:03:56.610> into<00:03:56.819> that

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
clicking on the top on and go into that

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.729 
clicking on the top on and go into that
video<00:03:57.209> track<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.959> can<00:03:58.019> drag<00:03:58.319> this<00:03:58.500> layer

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
video track you can drag this layer

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.440 
video track you can drag this layer
above<00:03:59.069> it<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.250> then<00:03:59.459> drag<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.940> audio<00:04:00.239> below

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
above it and then drag the audio below

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.930 
above it and then drag the audio below
and<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.530> easiest<00:04:01.890> way<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.069> line<00:04:02.280> these<00:04:02.430> up<00:04:02.489> is

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
and the easiest way to line these up is

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.170 
and the easiest way to line these up is
through<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.720> audio<00:04:04.049> so<00:04:04.890> you<00:04:04.920> can<00:04:05.790> see<00:04:05.940> that's

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
through the audio so you can see that's

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.780 
through the audio so you can see that's
where<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.750> second<00:04:07.349> or<00:04:07.860> third<00:04:07.890> shot<00:04:08.400> is<00:04:08.549> on

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
where the second or third shot is on

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.910 
where the second or third shot is on
this<00:04:08.970> one<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.870> can<00:04:09.989> just<00:04:10.019> line<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.440> up<00:04:10.680> and

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
this one so you can just line it up and

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.400 
this one so you can just line it up and
you<00:04:11.400> can<00:04:11.459> see<00:04:12.000> right<00:04:12.030> there<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.810> they're

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
you can see right there that they're

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.610 
you can see right there that they're
pretty<00:04:13.590> much<00:04:13.709> lined<00:04:14.190> up<00:04:14.400> perfectly<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:16.470> can

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
pretty much lined up perfectly you can

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.310 
pretty much lined up perfectly you can
tell<00:04:16.919> all<00:04:17.220> serve<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.729> just<00:04:17.940> if<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:18.870> move<00:04:19.169> your

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
tell all serve I just if you move your

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.050 
tell all serve I just if you move your
mouse<00:04:19.470> up<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.859> top<00:04:20.040> of<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.310> top<00:04:20.579> layer

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
mouse up to the top of the top layer

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.500 
mouse up to the top of the top layer
that<00:04:22.019> makes<00:04:22.260> sense<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:23.640> little<00:04:23.880> opacity<00:04:24.419> is

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
that makes sense the little opacity is

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.020 
that makes sense the little opacity is
one<00:04:24.600> hundred<00:04:24.660> percent<00:04:25.400> tab<00:04:26.400> thing<00:04:26.700> will<00:04:26.820> pop

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
one hundred percent tab thing will pop

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.630 
one hundred percent tab thing will pop
up<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.870> can<00:04:27.990> strag<00:04:28.350> down<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:28.890> that's

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
up and you can strag down and that's

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.070 
up and you can strag down and that's
another<00:04:29.940> way<00:04:30.090> you<00:04:30.150> can<00:04:30.300> see<00:04:30.479> if<00:04:30.570> they<00:04:30.720> lined<00:04:30.900> up

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
another way you can see if they lined up

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.580 
another way you can see if they lined up
which<00:04:31.260> you<00:04:31.380> can<00:04:31.500> see<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.740> is<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:33.810> i'll<00:04:34.200> show<00:04:34.530> you

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
which you can see it is so i'll show you

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.610 
which you can see it is so i'll show you
how<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:35.460> just<00:04:35.760> get<00:04:35.910> your<00:04:36.090> gun<00:04:36.450> if<00:04:36.960> that's<00:04:37.470> what

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
how to just get your gun if that's what

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.760 
how to just get your gun if that's what
you<00:04:37.710> want<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.940> say<00:04:39.210> if<00:04:39.479> you<00:04:39.660> are<00:04:39.780> here

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
you want so say if you are here

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.589 
you want so say if you are here
and<00:04:41.889> you<00:04:42.460> only<00:04:42.610> wanted<00:04:42.910> you<00:04:43.030> gun<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.449> be<00:04:43.569> a

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
and you only wanted you gun to be a

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.600 
and you only wanted you gun to be a
wireframe<00:04:43.810> you<00:04:44.770> go<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:45.039> top<00:04:45.220> layer<00:04:45.430> and

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
wireframe you go to the top layer and

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.240 
wireframe you go to the top layer and
click<00:04:46.599> your<00:04:46.840> event<00:04:47.139> pan/crop<00:04:47.349> button<00:04:48.099> here

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
click your event pan/crop button here

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.399 
click your event pan/crop button here
which<00:04:48.280> is<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.520> square<00:04:48.970> go<00:04:49.930> down<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.199> the<00:04:50.289> bottom

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
which is a square go down to the bottom

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.589 
which is a square go down to the bottom
left<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:50.800> it'll<00:04:51.039> say<00:04:51.220> mask<00:04:51.490> tick<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.150> box<00:04:52.360> and

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
left and it'll say mask tick the box and

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.369 
left and it'll say mask tick the box and
then<00:04:53.530> use<00:04:54.009> the<00:04:54.190> pen<00:04:54.430> tool<00:04:54.460> here<00:04:54.879> to<00:04:55.479> just<00:04:55.750> trace

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:56.379 
then use the pen tool here to just trace

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:03.480 
then use the pen tool here to just trace
around<00:04:57.039> your<00:04:57.810> gun<00:04:58.889> and<00:05:00.150> there<00:05:01.150> we<00:05:01.210> go<00:05:01.590> so<00:05:02.590> you

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
around your gun and there we go so you

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.129 
around your gun and there we go so you
can<00:05:03.729> see<00:05:03.909> it's<00:05:04.240> everything<00:05:04.629> except<00:05:04.930> for<00:05:05.080> the

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
can see it's everything except for the

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.559 
can see it's everything except for the
gun<00:05:05.319> but<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.460> will<00:05:06.759> have<00:05:06.970> to<00:05:07.030> keep<00:05:07.449> adjusting

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
gun but you will have to keep adjusting

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.430 
gun but you will have to keep adjusting
it<00:05:08.020> using<00:05:08.470> keyframes<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:10.810> make<00:05:11.050> sure<00:05:11.229> it<00:05:11.379> all

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
it using keyframes to make sure it all

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.980 
it using keyframes to make sure it all
stays<00:05:11.740> in<00:05:12.039> there<00:05:12.389> when<00:05:13.389> you<00:05:13.449> shoot<00:05:13.690> you'll

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
stays in there when you shoot you'll

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.580 
stays in there when you shoot you'll
have<00:05:14.139> to<00:05:15.030> add<00:05:16.030> a<00:05:16.090> keyframe<00:05:16.419> make<00:05:17.289> it<00:05:17.409> a<00:05:17.470> bit

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
have to add a keyframe make it a bit

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.700 
have to add a keyframe make it a bit
higher<00:05:17.880> of<00:05:18.880> that<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:19.659> then<00:05:20.199> you<00:05:20.289> can<00:05:20.409> add<00:05:20.500> some

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
higher of that and then you can add some

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.260 
higher of that and then you can add some
feather<00:05:20.919> into<00:05:21.220> it<00:05:21.340> to<00:05:21.580> make<00:05:21.610> sure<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.150> edges

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
feather into it to make sure the edges

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.749 
feather into it to make sure the edges
are<00:05:22.419> nice<00:05:22.599> and<00:05:22.840> soft<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.319> then<00:05:24.220> say<00:05:24.580> if<00:05:24.669> you

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
are nice and soft and then say if you

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.390 
are nice and soft and then say if you
want<00:05:24.940> this<00:05:25.150> enemy<00:05:25.750> here<00:05:26.199> as<00:05:26.349> well<00:05:26.560> just<00:05:27.130> trace

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
want this enemy here as well just trace

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.100 
want this enemy here as well just trace
around<00:05:27.550> him<00:05:27.759> as<00:05:27.909> well<00:05:28.060> and<00:05:28.240> do<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.810> exact<00:05:29.080> same

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
around him as well and do the exact same

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.219 
around him as well and do the exact same
thing<00:05:29.940> so<00:05:30.940> that's<00:05:31.479> pretty<00:05:31.659> much<00:05:31.810> it<00:05:31.870> and<00:05:32.139> then

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
thing so that's pretty much it and then

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:33.899 
thing so that's pretty much it and then
you<00:05:32.319> can<00:05:32.409> get<00:05:32.530> creative<00:05:33.039> with<00:05:33.219> it<00:05:33.280> as<00:05:33.490> well<00:05:33.669> you

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
you can get creative with it as well you

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.879 
you can get creative with it as well you
can<00:05:34.060> add<00:05:34.240> some<00:05:34.539> linear<00:05:34.840> wipes<00:05:35.080> and<00:05:35.409> different

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
can add some linear wipes and different

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.370 
can add some linear wipes and different
transitions<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.759> say<00:05:37.509> make<00:05:37.750> it<00:05:37.870> just<00:05:38.110> go<00:05:38.229> from

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
transitions to say make it just go from

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.180 
transitions to say make it just go from
left<00:05:38.830> to<00:05:38.949> right<00:05:39.069> and<00:05:39.490> slide<00:05:39.940> across<00:05:41.190> and

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
left to right and slide across and

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.100 
left to right and slide across and
things<00:05:42.550> like<00:05:42.669> that<00:05:42.729> you<00:05:43.060> know<00:05:43.090> you<00:05:43.780> don't<00:05:43.960> have

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
things like that you know you don't have

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.290 
things like that you know you don't have
to<00:05:44.259> just<00:05:44.440> do<00:05:44.560> it<00:05:44.680> this<00:05:44.770> way<00:05:44.979> but<00:05:45.759> that's<00:05:46.060> just

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
to just do it this way but that's just

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.469 
to just do it this way but that's just
the<00:05:46.479> way<00:05:46.569> I<00:05:46.599> did<00:05:46.930> and<00:05:47.110> then<00:05:48.099> you<00:05:48.550> can<00:05:48.729> also<00:05:49.000> go

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
the way I did and then you can also go

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.930 
the way I did and then you can also go
to<00:05:49.509> video<00:05:49.780> effects<00:05:50.199> and<00:05:50.530> say<00:05:50.770> get<00:05:51.130> light<00:05:51.669> rays

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
to video effects and say get light rays

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.839 
to video effects and say get light rays
and<00:05:55.259> you<00:05:56.259> know<00:05:56.380> you<00:05:56.440> can<00:05:56.710> on<00:05:56.860> add<00:05:57.219> them<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:57.759> the

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
and you know you can on add them to the

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.240 
and you know you can on add them to the
top<00:05:58.029> layer<00:05:58.270> and<00:05:58.800> you<00:05:59.800> can<00:05:59.919> see<00:06:00.039> it<00:06:00.130> only

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
top layer and you can see it only

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.659 
top layer and you can see it only
affects<00:06:00.699> the<00:06:01.590> wireframe<00:06:02.590> here<00:06:02.889> so<00:06:03.520> that's

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
affects the wireframe here so that's

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:04.950 
affects the wireframe here so that's
another<00:06:03.849> cool<00:06:04.090> thing<00:06:04.120> you<00:06:04.300> can<00:06:04.419> do<00:06:04.599> just<00:06:04.779> add
