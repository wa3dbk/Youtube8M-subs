and put the bod pod all over the top of
my<00:02:46.050> case<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.560> what's<00:02:47.040> really<00:02:47.340> great<00:02:47.640> about

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
things that are handled a lot so I

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.570 
things that are handled a lot so I
thought<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.350> would<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.620> perfect<00:02:53.220> for<00:02:53.310> this

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580
