00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 and decorating Easter eggs is possible 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.730
 use such knitted covers 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.160
 which fit very get them 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.870
 can up to take all the same for 1 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:23.640
 blue multi colored 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:26.119
 create the first air loop and 6 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:43.620
 air loops 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:47.190
 close the ring on the column will do 2 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:55.250
 air loops and lifts and pillar 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:01:00.809
 double crochet then 2 air loops and 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:06.990
 two columns from the rally and so I will 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:11.640
 repeat six times around the ring 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.689
 I got 6 pairs of columns with 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.990
 nakida between 2 air 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.990
 eyelets 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:32.860
 start and end of gases sentinel 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.930
 connected by means of a column with 2 nakida 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.890
 aerial loops Laviss place 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.310
 tied up with a crochet column 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.100
 joined key catch and again those 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:50.049
 air loops for lifting column with 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:54.670
 nakida two air loops and 2 columns 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:58.750
 glow and then for a chain of 2 air 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:04.420
 loops of the previous row further I will 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:09.450
 knit here is a chain of the previous row of 2 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:13.950
 double crochet and two air loops 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.950
 2 double crochets 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:35.880
 only six of these are the elements below 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:39.570
 to last to the turmoil and connect with 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:43.950
 Beata beginning using the Dinka on 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:48.450
 the post and then the connective aid 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.710
 row row and there succeeded chain 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.380
 air loops of the previous row again 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:59.910
 two or three columns rather air 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:04.350
 double crochet stitches 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:10.530
 loops and two double crochets 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:16.790
 also a chain of air loops now 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:21.840
 air spots and again the same fragment 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:26.120
 2 2 columns with 2 air nakida 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:30.959
 eyelets and two double crochets and 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.840
 continue to the end of the series between these 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.739
 slingshot place air loops rather 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.250
 double crochet stitches and air loops with 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:45.959
 not only that the box office weights 1 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:49.350
 air loops again connect the beginning 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:55.380
 and the end I yes and managed to take this series 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:04:00.540
 from next year I instead of these 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:04.410
 fragments add more but between 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:12.510
 awesome a loop I will have 2 air 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:18.019
 2 double crochet stitches 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.019
 double crochet stitches 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:34.050
 two air loops and again 2 columns with 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.050
 nakida under the next chain 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:49.230
 air loop 2 double crochet and 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:54.880
 so I will knit to the end of the row the amount 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:59.500
 loops it does not add us already 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:04.800
 thats it goes up and thats it 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.800
 trying on I tied 4 rows 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:15.550
 where here first without air 1 you 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.180
 exact answer in total 4 rows with two 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:25.180
 air loops 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:29.440
 now I see the operator is raising us 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.140
 double crochet 2 aerial 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:40.180
 peaceful now I will knit 4 air 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:44.580
 loops again 2 double crochet under 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.580
 also a chain of air loops and 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:06:02.019
 too polite a month ago so drunk 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:06.610
 and continue to two columns smithty 

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:13.349
 there are four air loops 2 columns with 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:13.349
 nakida again knit to the end of the row 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:28.930
 finished the row to the end and toast a piece and 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:32.500
 Now I will knit 10 columns with 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:45.930
 nakida under each archek of 4 air 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:45.930
 loops of the previous row 1 2 3 4 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.220
 Generally there is a column with sc 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:19.870
 nakida column here air 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:24.669
 the previous eyelet is compressed and 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:27.419
 the next chain is again 10 bars with 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.419
 nakidom 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:49.960
 so here between the end of the series 

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:49.960
 all this last row I put on 

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:57.990
 so of course more interesting than even 

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.240
 painted and all of them can be decorated 

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:04.790
 differently 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:08.810
 You can knit 8 threads of beads sheet 

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.810
 It all depends on your imagination
