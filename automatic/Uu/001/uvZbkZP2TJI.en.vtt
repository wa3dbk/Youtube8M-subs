pieces go together you use very few of
any<00:02:00.359> fasteners<00:02:01.200> yeah<00:02:01.590> well<00:02:02.340> that's<00:02:02.520> kind<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
any fasteners yeah well that's kind of

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.769 
any fasteners yeah well that's kind of
my<00:02:03.529> pride<00:02:04.529> and<00:02:04.709> Joy's<00:02:04.889> I<00:02:05.279> I<00:02:05.549> invented<00:02:06.479> a

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:06.779 
my pride and Joy's I I invented a

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:08.900 
my pride and Joy's I I invented a
process<00:02:07.409> for<00:02:07.439> manufacturing<00:02:07.770> furniture<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
process for manufacturing furniture and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.290 
process for manufacturing furniture and
I<00:02:09.209> got<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> patent<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.760> it's<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.180> result

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
I got a patent on it and it's the result

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.500 
I got a patent on it and it's the result
of<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.780> search<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.350> try<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.910> simplify<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
of this search to try to to simplify the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.720 
of this search to try to to simplify the
way<00:02:15.690> furniture<00:02:15.930> was

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
way furniture was

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.520 
way furniture was
and<00:02:17.060> also<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.360> make<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.629> better<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:18.110> make<00:02:18.349> it

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
and also to make it better to make it

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.550 
and also to make it better to make it
stronger<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.390> today<00:02:20.390> where<00:02:20.599> we<00:02:20.959> do<00:02:21.349> this

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
stronger and today where we do this

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.910 
stronger and today where we do this
entire<00:02:21.950> line<00:02:22.129> of<00:02:22.159> furniture<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:23.920> assembles

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
entire line of furniture that assembles

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.800 
entire line of furniture that assembles
without<00:02:25.220> any<00:02:25.400> metal<00:02:25.879> fasteners<00:02:26.360> there<00:02:26.659> are<00:02:26.720> no

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
without any metal fasteners there are no

without any metal fasteners there are no
plastic<00:02:27.230> fasteners<00:02:27.769> we're<00:02:28.040> just<00:02:28.310> using<00:02:29.120> the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
plastic fasteners we're just using the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.660 
plastic fasteners we're just using the
wood<00:02:30.080> itself<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.530> create<00:02:30.799> structure<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.519> it's

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
wood itself to create structure so it's

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.910 
wood itself to create structure so it's
a<00:02:31.730> very<00:02:31.760> strong<00:02:32.360> way<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.599> make<00:02:32.780> furniture<00:02:33.019> that

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
a very strong way to make furniture that

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.890 
a very strong way to make furniture that
doesn't<00:02:34.310> work<00:02:34.430> loose<00:02:34.610> over<00:02:34.910> time<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.720> also

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
doesn't work loose over time it also

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.500 
doesn't work loose over time it also
creates<00:02:36.410> an<00:02:36.650> aesthetic<00:02:37.310> for<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:38.060> furniture

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
creates an aesthetic for the furniture

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.500 
creates an aesthetic for the furniture
that<00:02:38.840> it's<00:02:39.319> allowed<00:02:39.890> me<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:41.060> look<00:02:41.239> at<00:02:41.360> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
that it's allowed me to to look at the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.490 
that it's allowed me to to look at the
elements<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.349> design<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:43.090> harmonium<00:02:44.090> and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
elements of design the harmonium and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.289 
elements of design the harmonium and
proportion<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.730> simplify<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
proportion and and to simplify the

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.990 
proportion and and to simplify the
furniture<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:48.379> really<00:02:48.739> it's<00:02:49.640> been<00:02:49.790> fun

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000

type of thomas's do you have to

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.199 
type of thomas's do you have to
manufacture<00:03:03.859> do<00:03:04.370> well<00:03:04.730> that's<00:03:04.879> one<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.120> the

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
manufacture do well that's one of the

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.539 
manufacture do well that's one of the
interesting<00:03:05.660> things<00:03:06.109> that<00:03:06.200> were<00:03:06.549> that

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
interesting things that were that

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.160 
interesting things that were that
although<00:03:07.879> the<00:03:07.910> furniture<00:03:08.390> has<00:03:08.569> this<00:03:08.750> feeling

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
although the furniture has this feeling

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.349 
although the furniture has this feeling
of<00:03:09.290> being<00:03:09.500> traditional<00:03:10.060> we're<00:03:11.060> doing<00:03:11.090> some

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
of being traditional we're doing some

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.770 
of being traditional we're doing some
pretty<00:03:11.510> radical<00:03:11.769> engineering<00:03:12.769> of<00:03:12.890> wood<00:03:13.489> and

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
pretty radical engineering of wood and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.099 
pretty radical engineering of wood and
so<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.790> defender<00:03:16.790> of<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:16.940> pieces<00:03:17.150> were<00:03:17.569> we're

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
so the defender of the pieces were we're

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.809 
so the defender of the pieces were we're
measuring<00:03:18.560> in<00:03:18.890> increments<00:03:19.069> of<00:03:19.310> five<00:03:19.579> one

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
measuring in increments of five one

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.759 
measuring in increments of five one
thousandth<00:03:20.299> of<00:03:20.329> an<00:03:20.450> inch<00:03:20.540> which<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:21.230> little

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
thousandth of an inch which is a little

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.309 
thousandth of an inch which is a little
less<00:03:21.889> than<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:22.099> human<00:03:22.400> hair<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.940> so<00:03:23.870> which<00:03:24.079> can

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
less than a human hair and so which can

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.539 
less than a human hair and so which can
make<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.709> difference<00:03:24.739> between<00:03:25.069> an

make the difference between an

make the difference between an
