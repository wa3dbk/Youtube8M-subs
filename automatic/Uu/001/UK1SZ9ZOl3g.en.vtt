00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.403
 "Tapeworms and chronic headaches" 

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:10.958
 Neurocysticercosis is an infection of the central nervous system 

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:14.639
 which is caused by larvae of pork tapeworm. 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.393
 Small larvae attacking the brain 

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:21.804
 are the cause of the increasing number of infections in the United States. 

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:27.329
 This infection is then the leading cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.228
 This is the most common parasitic disease in the human brain, 

00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:34.973
 previously only in developing countries, 

00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:37.337
 of course, with the exception of Muslim countries. 

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.926
 Everything changed thirty years ago 

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:43.302
 and now this disease is increasingly occurring across North America. 

00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:47.808
 In addition to epileptic seizures, parasites can be the cause 

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:52.381
 brain tumors, aneurysms 

00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:56.460
 or psychiatric manifestations such as depression. 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.860
 Who wouldn't be depressed if he had worms in his brain? 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.192
 Tapeworms can also cause dementia, 

00:01:02.192 --> 00:01:06.026
 but the good news is that using appropriate medicines 

00:01:06.026 --> 00:01:07.240
 it is possible to reverse this state. 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.353
 Surgical removal, ie surgical removal of larvae from the brain 

00:01:11.353 --> 00:01:13.525
 it is seldom necessary. 

00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:16.254
 However, once the larvae reach the eyeball, 

00:01:16.254 --> 00:01:19.063
 their removal is absolutely necessary, whether they are alive or not. 

00:01:19.063 --> 00:01:22.354
 I spoke of the tapeworm earlier, 

00:01:22.354 --> 00:01:24.494
 but now we have new information 

00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:27.395
 for example, that the infection may cause chronic headaches; 

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.443
 Either migraine or so-called tension headache 

00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:33.163
 even if the larvae of these parasites are already dead. 

00:01:33.163 --> 00:01:35.096
 Apparently it will happen 

00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:37.996
 that our body is trying to get rid of calcified dead worms 

00:01:37.996 --> 00:01:41.710
 the remains of their bodies then get our brain 

00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:45.350
 and cause inflammation that can contribute to headaches. 

00:01:45.353 --> 00:01:46.550
 This disease is still quite rare 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.060
 and even if you live in an endemic area 

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:53.590
 you can eliminate the disease mainly by 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.630
 to cook pork. 

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:58.360
 But what exactly does that mean? 

00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:02.560
 Tapeworms are found in some parts of pig bodies 

00:02:02.562 --> 00:02:04.130
 more than in others. 

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:06.360
 To eliminate the parasite, let the meat freeze literally "to the bone" 

00:02:06.363 --> 00:02:09.090
 and no matter how much muscle is infected, 

00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:12.830
 You have to leave the finely chopped meat for one month 

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:15.090
 stored in the freezer 

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:18.260
 and then cook for more than 2 hours. 

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:21.180
 Then you get a well-prepared pork chop. 

00:02:21.187 --> 00:02:24.130
 The New England Journal of Medicine recently mentioned 

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:27.920
 the case of a guy who had to have thousands of tapeworm larvae. 

00:02:28.328 --> 00:02:29.850
 They literally crawled through his muscles, 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.700
 after all, you see them in the form of these white stripes. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.440
 Each strip is actually a young larva. 

00:02:35.444 --> 00:02:39.400
 That's why you can become infected with pork: 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.800
 because the tapeworm gets into the muscles. 

00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:43.840
 Maybe even cannibals will want to cook meat for at least two hours. 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.200
 However, not all parasites must necessarily be associated with meat. 

00:02:48.205 --> 00:02:52.270
 Healthy, albeit a little anxious doctor at the age of 32 

00:02:52.273 --> 00:02:54.620
 visited a family medicine clinic 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.880
 where he brought a sample of suspected parasites from his stool, 

00:02:57.884 --> 00:03:01.500
 that day. 

00:03:01.503 --> 00:03:03.710
 And here we are. 

00:03:03.714 --> 00:03:05.640
 Each is about 2.5 cm long. 

00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:07.710
 This man had traveled to India before 

00:03:07.717 --> 00:03:09.770
 at night, you had chinese food, 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.400
 and who knows what was in it. 

00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:13.330
 What if she got infected with larvae? 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:17.860
 The sample was sent to a microbiological laboratory for analysis. 

00:03:17.862 --> 00:03:22.330
 Later that day, a microbiologist in a stool sample 

00:03:22.338 --> 00:03:25.100
 identified Vigna radiata, 

00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:29.730
 previously referred to as Phaseolus aureus, 

00:03:29.738 --> 00:03:33.800
 mung bean sprouts in common language. 

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:35.550
 They were the bean sprouts! 

00:03:35.558 --> 00:03:39.500
 "The patient was called and then carefully, 

00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:41.250
 but uncompromisingly, informed about his diagnosis. " 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.590
 "Due to the nature of the identified specimen 

00:03:43.594 --> 00:03:46.900
 the patient was presented with information in a considerate manner 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.130
 to insult the patient with regard to the sensitivity of the case. " 

00:03:51.137 --> 00:03:55.680
 Therefore, the following can be recommended to other doctors: 

00:03:55.686 --> 00:04:00.000
 "How comical we can sometimes feel, 

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:05.090
 try not to laugh! "
