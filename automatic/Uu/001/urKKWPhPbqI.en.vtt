00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.090 
is drilled by rotating the drill pipe
back<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.280> forth<00:01:18.610> as<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.470> drill<00:01:20.710> pipe<00:01:20.860> is

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
back and forth as the drill pipe is

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.370 
back and forth as the drill pipe is
pushed<00:01:21.370> down<00:01:21.520> into<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.330> ground<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
screen is placed down through the drill

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.700 
screen is placed down through the drill
pipe<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:34.420> drill<00:01:34.720> pipe<00:01:34.900> is<00:01:35.170> then<00:01:35.410> removed

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
pipe the drill pipe is then removed

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.640 
pipe the drill pipe is then removed
leaving<00:01:36.550> only<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.210> well<00:01:37.450> screen<00:01:37.869> in<00:01:38.110> the

leaving only the well screen in the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.270 
leaving only the well screen in the
ground<00:01:41.430> let's<00:01:42.430> look<00:01:42.610> at<00:01:42.790> it<00:01:42.940> again<00:01:44.010> water<00:01:45.010> is

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
ground let's look at it again water is

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.130 
ground let's look at it again water is
run<00:01:45.490> into<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.090> top<00:01:46.450> of<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.720> drill<00:01:46.960> pipe

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
run into the top of the drill pipe

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.540 
run into the top of the drill pipe
through<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.619> fitting<00:01:47.979> on<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.190> top<00:01:48.369> of<00:01:48.490> the

drill pipe then the hole is drilled by

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.420 
drill pipe then the hole is drilled by
twisting<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.150> drill<00:01:52.390> pipe<00:01:52.600> into<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.650> ground

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.950 

work<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.610> drill<00:01:57.880> pipe<00:01:58.060> up<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.479> down<00:01:58.690> and

work the drill pipe up and down and

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.600 
work the drill pipe up and down and
side-to-side<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.740> make<00:01:59.890> sure<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.310> really

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
side-to-side to make sure it is really

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.650 
side-to-side to make sure it is really
loose<00:02:00.880> in<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.840> ground<00:02:03.119> then<00:02:04.119> remove<00:02:04.509> the

water supply and put the well screen
down<00:02:12.730> through<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.690> drill<00:02:13.930> pipe<00:02:18.360> then<00:02:19.360> remove

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
down through the drill pipe then remove

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.010 
down through the drill pipe then remove
