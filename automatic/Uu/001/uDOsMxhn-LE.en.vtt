 187 km counter crowd to get off at 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.880
 120 miles I'm polishing 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.530

 the transport show so I got 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.490
 said that maybe I had a 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.910
 personal ad so you sell your 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.139
 wreck 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.090
 yeah I know it's not very green yes 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.689

 forgiveness green forgiveness that's right and that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:33.750
 their forgiveness is the culprit and yes 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.120
 what's more eco-friendly than cycling is 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.469
 more trend also in France it is selling 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.010
 every year more than 3 million 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.629
 bicycles 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.820
 the problem is that there are 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.890
 a lot of model at all prices then 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.620
 how to choose my counter 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.809
 technique for a technical control of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.020
 bicycles so i'm going to compare this 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.680
 small folding bike at a city bike 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.969
 classic type a bit Dutch and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.050
 this third vtc bike all way 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.910
 first lesson is size 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.850
 guirane is riding a bike 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.350
 on the three models now is this 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.040
 progress in the investigation 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.760
 not sure after use what I can 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.800
 to say is that these are bikes and that 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.810
 I do not know anything about it so I 'm going to do 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.310
 rather call for an expert for this 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.630
 technical control of the bikes I made 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.430
 call to a former professional there 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.369
 is morgan 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.619
 he makes the arrivals superclass of gold he 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.490
 know this all the time even if you 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.460
 happens like that he makes skids 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.330
 morgan sava through you who told me I 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.450
 I'm going to bring you a great bike and that's what 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.340
 what I did is a little 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.140
 tonight it's a bit okay we're going 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.670
 play the lego we have the impression and that 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.490
 so you tell me it's a bike a bike 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.869
 folding so there it is folded it is folded 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.600
 so if we unfold revive a bike 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.070
 exactly prove the month go the bike 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.570
 customers this is the latest trend of the 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.789
 bicycle morgan 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.680
 so he started by unfolding it quite 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.550
 easily by the way in 17 seconds 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.229
 India is here okay there I see 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.130
 we can talk 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.600
 morgane it's not that I do not do you 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.590
 trust but for you to be validated 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.789
 as an expert you have to tell me 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.620
 bat at the race being of a natural 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.670
 powerful enough you'll see it's a bit 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.940
 impressive but no you do not go there 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.319
 arrive 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.319
 I was ready go 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:25.160
 jerry p I missed but he is far already 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.720
 does it do well what is this folding bike 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.450
 small 20-inch wheels 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.100
 so it's a super handy bike 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.020
 it's interesting for people who have 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.430
 a little bit of trouble on a bike on this 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.200
 model there is simply there 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.910
 has only one speed and only one 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.940
 speed for guirane it's not enough in 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.470
 on the other hand, there is only one speed 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.660
 so thankfully the climb not very 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.010
 very long and it's a steel frame so 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.390
 it is true that the steel frame will do 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.340
 that the bike is going to be a little bit 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.850
 more uplifted than the city bike and that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.840
 the vtc 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.700
 it is addressed 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.860
 to people that make small walks 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.910
 in family so for example in a park 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.830
 like here we can do a little 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.340
 walk it can be nice stops at 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.900
 people who go to work by bike and then 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.030
 simply for the holidays too 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.860
 the holidays nice call to put it 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.090
 in the car or even in a campsite 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.920
 because and then move to go do 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.810
 his errands 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.670
 and yes that's the big advantage of cycling 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.660
 folding we suspected but we have when 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:23.000
 even wanted to check 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.000
 we are like that to pigeons good ok 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.930
 but then should we throw our good old 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.120
 bike to put us to customers bah 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.819
 it's not so simple 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.260
 which bike is your favorite bah 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.489
 leaning rather for the vtc 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.129
 simply because it's a 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.019
 valois to these athletes then we have a 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.989
 less heavy bike we can really 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.220
 use the bikes everywhere our expert 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.900
 dome hop for the vtc 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.370
 the problem with the bike is that it 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.550
 find the one that suits us 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.220
 the 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.450
 city ​​bikes and will not be so because 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.750
 that simply already there is more than 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.860
 speed 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.750
 so it's true that in a city where he 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.420
 there is a little bit of side and its seven more 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.950
 nice to have this type of bike there and 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.540
 it's true that folding bike does with 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.210
 its low center of gravity 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.130
 bah simply people who have 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.320
 bad to ride a bike that starts cycling 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.880
 will be able to easily pass on a 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.250
 little bike like that it'll be a lot 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.990
 easier to use who take the 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.840
 bike and unfolds it and it's gone for 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.080
 a little stroll 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.330
 each user will choose his bike 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:25.629
 in function will simply 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.870
 of their course of their place at home 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:30.669
 for example where comfort can be summarized 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.509
 to say that the folding bike and there it passes 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.639
 the technical control 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.740
 1 it is rather not bad it is enough 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.840
 practical but only to make 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.870
 small trips to the city if we like 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.319
 hiking and doing long 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.389
 distances 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.939
 it's better to have a race bike or 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.800
 well a vtc for those who hesitate and 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:49.300
 who wonders if it's really done 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.930
 for them there are always bikes in 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.569
 free service 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.650
 it's a little trick 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.719
 only in cities where there are 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.180
 like lille lyon orleans 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:00.129
 because when there is none it's more 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.330
 galley it may seem obvious but I 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.889
 prefers to give the info because I am 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:10.020
 like that you in the sharing you will finish 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.020
 foot me what I said
