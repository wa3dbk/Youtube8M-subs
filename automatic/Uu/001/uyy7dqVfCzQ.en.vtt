things like that I don't think I've even

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.330 
things like that I don't think I've even
attacked<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.299> math<00:01:54.540> yet<00:01:54.720> myself<00:01:55.340> I've

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
attacked on this math yet myself I've

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.170 
attacked on this math yet myself I've
always<00:01:56.579> been<00:01:56.880> defending<00:01:57.200> am<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.640> tend<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
always been defending am and I tend to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.209 
always been defending am and I tend to
learn<00:02:00.450> how<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.899> defend<00:02:01.140> when<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> learned<00:02:01.979> how

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
learn how to defend when I learned how

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.280 
learn how to defend when I learned how
to<00:02:02.280> attack<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.240> mutual<00:02:03.719> thing<00:02:03.750> once

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
to attack it's just a mutual thing once

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.719 
to attack it's just a mutual thing once
you're<00:02:04.439> aggressive<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> map<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
you're aggressive on a map and you

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.609 
you're aggressive on a map and you
figure<00:02:06.030> eight<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.210> sly<00:02:06.750> roots<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.259> sneaky

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
figure eight like sly roots and sneaky

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.070 
figure eight like sly roots and sneaky
roots<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
roots and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.700 
roots and
that's<00:02:09.800> just<00:02:10.130> where<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:10.340> not<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.360> know

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
that's just where you not you know

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.280 
that's just where you not you know
gravitate<00:02:12.710> towards<00:02:13.280> defending<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.960> tend

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
gravitate towards defending and I tend

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.770 
gravitate towards defending and I tend
to<00:02:15.380> defend<00:02:15.770> from<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.190> standpoint<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.880> if<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.510> was

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
to defend from a standpoint of if I was

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.540 
to defend from a standpoint of if I was
around<00:02:18.140> sneaky<00:02:18.590> bastard<00:02:19.040> what<00:02:19.220> would<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.430> be

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
around sneaky bastard what would I be

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.180 
around sneaky bastard what would I be
trying<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.880> do<00:02:20.000> right<00:02:20.270> now<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:21.320> I<00:02:21.770> find<00:02:22.100> that

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
trying to do right now and I find that

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.330 
trying to do right now and I find that
that<00:02:22.400> tends<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.910> serve<00:02:23.390> me<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.340> reasonably

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
that tends to serve me and reasonably

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.460 
that tends to serve me and reasonably
well<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:27.010> my<00:02:28.010> efforts<00:02:28.420> but<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:30.050> just<00:02:30.080> like

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
well in my efforts but this is just like

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.020 
well in my efforts but this is just like
it's<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.860> flat<00:02:31.100> straight<00:02:31.430> we've<00:02:31.670> got<00:02:31.880> an

it's a flat straight we've got an

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.570 
it's a flat straight we've got an

will<00:02:59.360> change<00:02:59.660> as<00:02:59.959> everybody<00:03:00.380> starts<00:03:00.770> to

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
will change as everybody starts to

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.830 
will change as everybody starts to

like that book I mean you just get a get
a<00:03:05.959> recon<00:03:06.440> ER<00:03:06.470> with<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:06.910> stall<00:03:07.910> flam<00:03:08.209> in<00:03:08.420> there

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
a recon ER with a stall flam in there

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.680 
a recon ER with a stall flam in there
and<00:03:08.870> I'm<00:03:09.230> sure<00:03:09.500> they<00:03:09.800> he<00:03:10.310> could<00:03:10.490> assist<00:03:11.360> he

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
and I'm sure they he could assist he

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.340 
and I'm sure they he could assist he
doing<00:03:11.959> some<00:03:12.290> damage<00:03:12.500> but<00:03:13.810> like<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.959> mop<00:03:15.110> is

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
doing some damage but like the mop is

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.440 
doing some damage but like the mop is
the<00:03:15.590> math<00:03:15.709> look<00:03:16.010> so<00:03:16.280> good<00:03:16.640> I<00:03:16.670> can't<00:03:17.060> I<00:03:17.209> still

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
the math look so good I can't I still

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.300 
the math look so good I can't I still
hanker<00:03:17.750> overhead<00:03:18.110> good<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.500> sky<00:03:18.830> looks<00:03:19.130> it

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
hanker overhead good that sky looks it

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.040 
hanker overhead good that sky looks it
just<00:03:19.519> looks<00:03:19.700> great<00:03:19.970> it's<00:03:20.690> probably<00:03:20.870> the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
just looks great it's probably the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.090 
just looks great it's probably the
second<00:03:21.590> most<00:03:21.620> impressive<00:03:22.400> thing<00:03:22.640> i've<00:03:22.850> seen<00:03:23.239> i

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
second most impressive thing i've seen i

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.130 
second most impressive thing i've seen i
don't<00:03:25.100> know<00:03:25.190> like<00:03:25.430> if<00:03:25.760> it's<00:03:26.000> technically<00:03:26.660> that

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
don't know like if it's technically that

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.930 
don't know like if it's technically that
impressive<00:03:27.560> but<00:03:27.800> it<00:03:28.070> just<00:03:28.220> looks<00:03:28.310> good<00:03:28.700> it's

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
impressive but it just looks good it's

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.630 
impressive but it just looks good it's
nicely<00:03:29.120> done<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.780> kind<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:30.769> second<00:03:31.220> only<00:03:31.370> to
