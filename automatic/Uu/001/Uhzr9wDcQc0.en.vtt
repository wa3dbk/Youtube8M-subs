here

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.470 

I<00:00:16.260> haven't<00:00:16.560> been<00:00:16.710> 100%<00:00:17.270> um<00:00:18.560> still<00:00:19.560> marching<00:00:19.950> on

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
I haven't been 100% um still marching on

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.080 
I haven't been 100% um still marching on
contact<00:00:21.480> wheel<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:21.870> is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.410> first<00:00:22.890> hub<00:00:23.160> that

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
contact wheel here is the first hub that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.250 
contact wheel here is the first hub that
I've<00:00:24.180> cast<00:00:24.590> for<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.620> customer<00:00:27.080> wants<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
I've cast for a customer wants a

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.210 
I've cast for a customer wants a
serrated<00:00:28.530> wheel<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:30.920> had<00:00:31.920> some<00:00:32.070> problems

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
serrated wheel and I had some problems

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.830 
serrated wheel and I had some problems
writing<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.030> slightly<00:00:33.360> softer<00:00:33.690> rubber

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
writing this is slightly softer rubber

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.470 
writing this is slightly softer rubber
than<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.380> serrated<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.340> past<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.210> had<00:00:36.330> some

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
than I serrated in the past and had some

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.470 
than I serrated in the past and had some
problems<00:00:36.840> doing<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.670> I've<00:00:38.670> found<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.330> way

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
problems doing it so I've found a way

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.540 
problems doing it so I've found a way
that<00:00:39.660> works<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.320> really<00:00:40.470> well<00:00:40.980> now<00:00:41.280> but

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that works really really well now but

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.299 
that works really really well now but
I've<00:00:41.730> got<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.000> take<00:00:42.150> this<00:00:42.330> rubber<00:00:42.600> off<00:00:43.309> report

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
I've got to take this rubber off report

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.950 
I've got to take this rubber off report
so<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.120> thought<00:00:45.300> I'd<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.540> a<00:00:45.570> bit<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
so I thought I'd do a bit of a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.710 
so I thought I'd do a bit of a
destruction<00:00:46.710> test<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.580> ribs<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
destruction test on these ribs just to

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.200 
destruction test on these ribs just to
see<00:00:48.930> how<00:00:49.110> strong<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.970> this<00:00:50.970> is<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
see how strong they are this is a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.330 
see how strong they are this is a
different<00:00:52.110> grader<00:00:52.320> rubber<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.070> lot<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.220> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
different grader rubber to a lot of the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.910 
different grader rubber to a lot of the

wheels
most<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.100> wheels<00:00:56.310> I've<00:00:56.430> done<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.820> far<00:00:56.850> wall

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
most of the wheels I've done so far wall

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.240 
most of the wheels I've done so far wall
wheels<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.720> done<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.020> far<00:00:58.280> are<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.340> PTM<00:01:00.329> eg

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
wheels are done so far are a PTM eg

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.710 
wheels are done so far are a PTM eg

it's<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.920> supposed<00:01:11.190> to<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.460> tough<00:01:12.320> its

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
it's not supposed to be as tough its

it's not supposed to be as tough its
elasticity<00:01:13.800> isn't<00:01:14.160> as<00:01:14.369> high<00:01:15.170> et<00:01:16.170> cetera<00:01:16.350> et

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.490 
elasticity isn't as high et cetera et
cetera<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.399> um<00:01:17.640> I'm<00:01:18.210> pretty<00:01:18.509> alarmed<00:01:19.110> with

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
cetera but um I'm pretty alarmed with

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.380 
cetera but um I'm pretty alarmed with
what<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.160> do<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.550> do<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.149> pair

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
what I can do with it do it with a pair

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.090 
what I can do with it do it with a pair
of<00:01:21.420> pliers<00:01:22.789> without<00:01:25.520> breaking<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:28.100> actually

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
of pliers without breaking it actually

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
of pliers without breaking it actually
might<00:01:29.280> try<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.580> go<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.149> pair<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> vise

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
might try and go for on a pair of vise

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.300 
might try and go for on a pair of vise
grips

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
grips

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.070 
grips
yeah<00:01:32.310> see<00:01:33.179> what<00:01:33.300> I<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.840> think<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.050> just

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
yeah see what I can do it I think I just

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.949 
yeah see what I can do it I think I just
got<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.440> bit<00:01:34.619> off<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:35.479> tiny<00:01:36.479> little<00:01:36.630> corner

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:36.959 
got a bit off then tiny little corner

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:42.770 
got a bit off then tiny little corner
there<00:01:37.670> but<00:01:38.670> I've<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:38.850> damaged<00:01:40.250> but<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.780> am

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
there but I've just damaged but I am

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.410 
there but I've just damaged but I am
very<00:01:44.509> pleased<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.720> say<00:01:46.940> heís<00:01:47.940> actually<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.300> bit

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
very pleased to say heís actually a bit

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.059 
very pleased to say heís actually a bit
worried<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.959> cut<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.440> slots<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
worried you know cut the slots in and

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.210 
worried you know cut the slots in and
create<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.459> weak<00:01:50.670> point<00:01:52.100> particularly<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.190> a

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
create a weak point particularly with a

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.740 
create a weak point particularly with a
square<00:01:53.580> cornered<00:01:53.940> cutter<00:01:54.179> like<00:01:54.420> I'm<00:01:54.569> using

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
square cornered cutter like I'm using

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.719 
square cornered cutter like I'm using
here<00:01:54.899> creating<00:01:55.800> a<00:01:55.860> weak<00:01:56.009> point<00:01:56.250> across<00:01:56.399> there

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
here creating a weak point across there

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.969 
here creating a weak point across there
that<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.810> know<00:01:57.929> the<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.289> ribs<00:01:58.530> might<00:01:58.800> be

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that the you know the the ribs might be

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.830 
that the you know the the ribs might be
weak<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.849> some<00:02:00.300> way

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.490

the<00:02:09.400> strength<00:02:09.790> of<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:11.250> she's<00:02:12.250> outstanding

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
the strength of that she's outstanding

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.980 
the strength of that she's outstanding
I'm<00:02:13.120> going<00:02:13.540> off<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.050> see<00:02:14.200> what<00:02:14.350> we<00:02:14.500> can<00:02:14.620> do
