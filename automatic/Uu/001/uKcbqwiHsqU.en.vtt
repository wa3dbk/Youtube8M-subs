that<00:00:51.770> is<00:00:51.980> also<00:00:52.160> carbon<00:00:52.670> injected<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.660> Danny

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
that is also carbon injected the Danny

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.870 
is carbon injected versus a fiberglass
injection<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.170> through<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:00.920> sizes<00:01:01.370> we<00:01:01.400> bury

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
injection so through the sizes we bury

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.869

the<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.690> amount<00:01:03.079> of<00:01:03.489> fiberglass<00:01:04.489> or<00:01:04.820> carbon

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
the the amount of fiberglass or carbon

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.109 
the the amount of fiberglass or carbon
fiber<00:01:05.420> that's<00:01:05.720> that's<00:01:06.049> injected<00:01:06.640> in<00:01:07.640> the

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
fiber that's that's injected in the

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.069 
fiber that's that's injected in the
Danny<00:01:08.479> cask<00:01:08.840> we<00:01:09.170> replace<00:01:10.540> fiberglass<00:01:11.540> with

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
Danny cask we replace fiberglass with

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.780 
Danny cask we replace fiberglass with
carbon<00:01:12.530> fiber<00:01:12.799> to<00:01:12.979> lighten<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.369> up<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:13.670> to

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
carbon fiber to lighten it up and to

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.920 
carbon fiber to lighten it up and to
give<00:01:13.909> it<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.030> little<00:01:14.119> more<00:01:14.270> strength<00:01:14.720> so

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
give it a little more strength so

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.020 
give it a little more strength so
there's<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.170> three<00:01:15.619> percent<00:01:15.920> injection<00:01:16.729> in<00:01:16.880> the

stiffened up with carbon fiber added

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.780 
stiffened up with carbon fiber added
you've<00:01:50.600> got<00:01:50.810> nice<00:01:51.080> EBA<00:01:51.530> padding<00:01:52.070> all<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.670> way

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
you've got nice EBA padding all the way

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.090 
you've got nice EBA padding all the way
through<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.509> heel<00:01:53.750> area<00:01:53.890> for<00:01:54.890> shock

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
through the heel area for shock

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.270 
through the heel area for shock
absorption<00:01:55.420> there's<00:01:56.420> minimal<00:01:56.869> contact<00:01:57.680> with

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
absorption there's minimal contact with

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.950 
absorption there's minimal contact with
the<00:01:58.520> board<00:01:58.759> there's<00:01:59.000> actually<00:01:59.450> nineteen

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
the board there's actually nineteen

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.320 
the board there's actually nineteen
percent<00:02:00.229> of<00:02:00.680> this<00:02:00.860> base<00:02:01.070> plate<00:02:01.399> touches<00:02:02.210> the

percent of this base plate touches the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.240 
percent of this base plate touches the
board<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:03.080> you've<00:02:03.200> got<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.380> true<00:02:03.649> flex<00:02:04.009> all<00:02:04.220> the

board so you've got a true flex all the
way<00:02:04.340> through
