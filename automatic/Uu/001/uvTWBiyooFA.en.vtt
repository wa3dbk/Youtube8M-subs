well<00:00:00.719> we've<00:00:01.170> discovered<00:00:01.589> gears<00:00:02.010> in<00:00:02.460> an<00:00:02.730> insect

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380 
well we've discovered gears in an insect

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.539 
well we've discovered gears in an insect
mechanically<00:00:04.380> interacting<00:00:05.040> gears<00:00:05.339> are

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
mechanically interacting gears are

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.130 
mechanically interacting gears are
always<00:00:05.850> thought<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.330> as<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.509> man-made

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
always thought of as a man-made

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.310 
always thought of as a man-made
invention<00:00:07.940> used<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:09.150> our<00:00:09.300> bikes<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.900> our<00:00:10.019> cars

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
invention used in our bikes and our cars

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.740 
invention used in our bikes and our cars
but<00:00:11.250> what<00:00:11.429> we've<00:00:11.610> shown<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.389> small

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
but what we've shown is that a small

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.099 
but what we've shown is that a small
plant<00:00:13.170> sucking<00:00:13.590> bug<00:00:14.179> evolved<00:00:15.179> gears<00:00:15.450> long

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
plant sucking bug evolved gears long

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.920 
plant sucking bug evolved gears long
long<00:00:16.410> ago<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:17.119> uses<00:00:18.119> these<00:00:18.330> gears<00:00:18.690> to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
long ago and uses these gears to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.010 
long ago and uses these gears to
mechanically<00:00:19.680> synchronize<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.270> very<00:00:21.630> rapid

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
mechanically synchronize the very rapid

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.550 
mechanically synchronize the very rapid
jumping<00:00:22.410> movements<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.010> its<00:00:23.880> legs<00:00:24.410> this<00:00:25.410> is

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
jumping movements of its legs this is

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.720 
jumping movements of its legs this is
the<00:00:25.680> first<00:00:26.630> demonstration<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:28.730> interacting

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the first demonstration of interacting

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.410 
the first demonstration of interacting
gears<00:00:30.000> being<00:00:30.420> used<00:00:30.689> by<00:00:30.900> any<00:00:31.199> animal<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:33.149> jump

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
gears being used by any animal the jump

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.190 
gears being used by any animal the jump
is<00:00:33.600> really<00:00:34.079> very<00:00:34.590> rapid<00:00:35.070> indeed<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:36.480> takes<00:00:36.960> off

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
is really very rapid indeed it takes off

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100 
is really very rapid indeed it takes off
at<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.860> velocity<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.760> five<00:00:39.239> meters<00:00:39.930> per

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
at a velocity of about five meters per

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.869 
at a velocity of about five meters per
second<00:00:40.469> that's<00:00:40.620> equivalent<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.219> about<00:00:41.399> twelve

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
second that's equivalent to about twelve

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.900 
second that's equivalent to about twelve
miles<00:00:42.120> per<00:00:42.420> hour<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.860> accelerates<00:00:44.280> in

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
miles per hour and it accelerates in

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.270 
miles per hour and it accelerates in
less<00:00:45.180> than<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.480> millisecond<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
less than a millisecond so it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.029 
less than a millisecond so it
experiences<00:00:48.000> enormous<00:00:48.780> g-forces<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.680> takes

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
experiences enormous g-forces it takes

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.630 
experiences enormous g-forces it takes
off<00:00:50.390> about<00:00:51.390> five<00:00:51.660> hundred<00:00:51.930> or<00:00:52.230> even<00:00:52.260> 700g<00:00:53.129> I

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
off about five hundred or even 700g I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.389 
off about five hundred or even 700g I
first<00:00:54.329> became<00:00:54.719> aware<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.230> these<00:00:55.469> bugs<00:00:55.770> when<00:00:56.370> I

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
first became aware of these bugs when I

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.069 
first became aware of these bugs when I
was<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> garden<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.390> my<00:00:57.539> friend<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
was in the garden of my friend and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.869 
was in the garden of my friend and

Germany he has a quite wild garden with

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.750 
Germany he has a quite wild garden with
lots<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.120> ivy<00:01:03.480> growing<00:01:03.719> all<00:01:03.989> over<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.379> place

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
lots of ivy growing all over the place

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.250 
lots of ivy growing all over the place
they're<00:01:05.760> very<00:01:05.970> specific<00:01:06.630> sort<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.930> bug<00:01:07.080> they

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
they're very specific sort of bug they

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.310 
they're very specific sort of bug they
only<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.159> eat<00:01:08.369> ivy<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.900> spent<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
only like to eat ivy and so I spent a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
only like to eat ivy and so I spent a
huge<00:01:10.590> amount<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:11.010> time<00:01:11.240> trying<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.390> look<00:01:12.689> on

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
huge amount of time trying to look on

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.740 
huge amount of time trying to look on
all<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> Ivy<00:01:13.890> bushes<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.310> Cambridge<00:01:14.909> for

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
all the Ivy bushes in Cambridge for

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.980 
all the Ivy bushes in Cambridge for
these<00:01:15.960> bugs<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.500> couldn't<00:01:16.950> find<00:01:17.189> them<00:01:17.990> then

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
these bugs and couldn't find them then

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.320 
these bugs and couldn't find them then
my<00:01:19.170> five-year-old<00:01:19.650> grandson<00:01:20.159> max<00:01:20.700> came<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
my five-year-old grandson max came to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.050 
my five-year-old grandson max came to
the<00:01:21.509> rescue<00:01:21.689> he<00:01:22.619> found<00:01:23.040> these<00:01:23.280> bugs<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.880> his

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the rescue he found these bugs in his

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.660 
the rescue he found these bugs in his
garden<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.689> he<00:01:25.530> rushed<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.070> he<00:01:26.340> one<00:01:26.490> day

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
garden and he rushed up to he one day

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.920 
garden and he rushed up to he one day
and<00:01:26.850> said<00:01:27.000> grandad<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> found<00:01:27.780> these

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and said grandad I found these

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.749 
and said grandad I found these
planthoppers<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.680> my<00:01:28.799> garden<00:01:29.070> here<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.579> are

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
planthoppers in my garden here they are

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.260 
planthoppers in my garden here they are
and<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.409> brought<00:01:31.619> them<00:01:31.770> back<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> lab

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
and so we brought them back to the lab

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.700 
and so we brought them back to the lab
here<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.420> Cambridge<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.990> that's<00:01:34.140> when<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> did

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
here in Cambridge and that's when I did

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.770 
here in Cambridge and that's when I did
the<00:01:34.829> experiment<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.549> showing<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the experiment of showing that the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.630 
the experiment of showing that the
cogwheels<00:01:37.229> were<00:01:37.439> actually<00:01:37.950> engaging<00:01:38.369> with

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
cogwheels were actually engaging with

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.260 
cogwheels were actually engaging with
each<00:01:38.820> other<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.990> high-speed<00:01:40.970> images<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.150> we

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
each other the high-speed images that we

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.020 
each other the high-speed images that we
have<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.630> take<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.110> these<00:01:43.320> bugs<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:44.549> reveal

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
have to take of these bugs to reveal

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.190 
have to take of these bugs to reveal
these<00:01:45.360> very<00:01:46.350> brief<00:01:46.920> events<00:01:47.689> takes<00:01:48.689> us<00:01:48.869> into<00:01:49.079> a
