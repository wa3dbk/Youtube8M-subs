have this little spinning wheel of death
problem<00:00:16.720> for<00:00:16.960> some<00:00:17.890> few<00:00:18.369> of<00:00:18.519> you<00:00:18.669> and<00:00:18.960> we're

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
problem for some few of you and we're

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.380 
problem for some few of you and we're
not<00:00:20.109> quite<00:00:20.349> sure<00:00:20.380> what<00:00:20.829> causes<00:00:21.220> it<00:00:21.310> but<00:00:21.490> it's

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
not quite sure what causes it but it's

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.620 
not quite sure what causes it but it's
it's<00:00:23.079> weird<00:00:23.320> and<00:00:23.490> otherwise<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:25.119> game<00:00:25.300> seems

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
it's weird and otherwise the game seems

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.399 
it's weird and otherwise the game seems
to<00:00:25.720> be<00:00:25.839> reasonably<00:00:26.769> debugged<00:00:27.429> now<00:00:27.759> so<00:00:28.409> it's

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:29.409 
to be reasonably debugged now so it's

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:31.890 
to be reasonably debugged now so it's
getting<00:00:29.739> there<00:00:29.769> it's<00:00:30.069> getting<00:00:30.189> there<00:00:30.900> anyway

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
getting there it's getting there anyway

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.709

the order audio working on all those
sounds<00:00:59.769> and<00:00:59.920> we're<00:01:00.370> currently<00:01:01.359> having<00:01:01.870> in<00:01:02.170> the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
sounds and we're currently having in the

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.270 
sounds and we're currently having in the
very<00:01:02.800> first<00:01:03.869> iteration<00:01:04.869> of<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.500> sounds<00:01:06.040> all

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
very first iteration of the sounds all

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.149 
very first iteration of the sounds all
the<00:01:07.000> levels<00:01:07.240> of<00:01:07.689> these<00:01:08.259> sounds<00:01:08.829> all<00:01:09.009> the

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
the levels of these sounds all the

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.920 
the levels of these sounds all the
volume<00:01:09.490> levels<00:01:09.820> of<00:01:10.000> these<00:01:10.150> sounds<00:01:10.479> are<00:01:10.570> not

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
volume levels of these sounds are not

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.560 
volume levels of these sounds are not
balanced<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:11.770> you<00:01:11.829> will<00:01:12.100> hear<00:01:12.610> outrageously

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
balanced so you will hear outrageously

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.289 
balanced so you will hear outrageously
loud<00:01:13.900> sliders<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:15.250> on<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.579> hover<00:01:15.970> over

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
loud sliders and so on and hover over

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.469 
loud sliders and so on and hover over
sounds<00:01:17.310> ignore<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.460> but<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.880> sounds<00:01:19.240> are

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
sounds ignore that but the sounds are

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.710 
sounds ignore that but the sounds are
also<00:01:20.159> now<00:01:21.159> being<00:01:21.549> iterated<00:01:22.119> towards<00:01:22.509> their

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
also now being iterated towards their

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.800 
also now being iterated towards their
final<00:01:23.110> version<00:01:23.439> and<00:01:23.939> once<00:01:24.939> you<00:01:25.240> have<00:01:25.390> played

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
this version for a while nice you hover

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.920 
this version for a while nice you hover
over<00:01:28.930> system<00:01:29.350> once<00:01:30.280> you<00:01:30.460> have<00:01:30.810> played<00:01:31.810> this

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
version a while and you go back to the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.370 
version a while and you go back to the
public<00:01:33.670> version<00:01:33.820> how<00:01:34.119> it<00:01:34.299> feels<00:01:34.600> so<00:01:34.840> dead<00:01:35.170> and

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
public version how it feels so dead and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.740 
public version how it feels so dead and
empty<00:01:35.860> it's<00:01:36.100> amazing<00:01:36.909> even<00:01:37.360> though<00:01:37.509> this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
empty it's amazing even though this

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.510 
empty it's amazing even though this
current<00:01:38.140> version<00:01:38.409> is<00:01:38.500> still<00:01:38.770> free

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
current version is still free

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.179 
current version is still free
because<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:39.939> all<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.540> air<00:01:40.979> imbalances<00:01:41.979> in

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
because of all the air imbalances in

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.480 
because of all the air imbalances in
sound<00:01:42.790> volume<00:01:43.350> anyway<00:01:44.350> I<00:01:44.619> wanted<00:01:45.039> to<00:01:45.310> show<00:01:45.460> you

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
sound volume anyway I wanted to show you

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.779 
sound volume anyway I wanted to show you
what<00:01:45.789> we<00:01:45.969> are<00:01:46.060> currently<00:01:46.240> working<00:01:46.570> on<00:01:47.140> in<00:01:47.469> the

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
what we are currently working on in the

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.399 
what we are currently working on in the
beta<00:01:48.789> version<00:01:48.939> and<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:49.659> closed<00:01:49.899> beta<00:01:50.079> version

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
beta version and the closed beta version

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.319 
beta version and the closed beta version
of<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.619> game<00:01:50.740> so<00:01:51.490> I've<00:01:51.789> built<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.180> little

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
of the game so I've built a little

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.080 
of the game so I've built a little
platform<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.110> want<00:01:53.320> to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
platform and I want to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.440 
platform and I want to
model<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.770> has<00:01:55.979> outrageously<00:01:56.969> flared

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
model and it has outrageously flared

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.490 
model and it has outrageously flared
wheel<00:01:57.840> arches<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.429> good<00:01:59.700> reason

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
wheel arches and that for a good reason

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.219 
wheel arches and that for a good reason
let<00:02:01.500> me<00:02:01.679> see<00:02:02.130> what<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.549> do<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.689> first<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.140> all

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
let me see what I can do so first of all

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.669 
let me see what I can do so first of all
let's<00:02:04.500> put<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.369> an<00:02:05.670> engine<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.530> it's<00:02:07.530> not

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
let's put in an engine and it's not

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.550 
let's put in an engine and it's not
fitting<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.220> there<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.759> choose<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.209> one

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
fitting in there so just choose this one

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.759 
fitting in there so just choose this one

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
corners and so on andreu through angles

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.879 
corners and so on andreu through angles
and<00:02:59.010> all<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.760> good<00:02:59.910> stuff<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.769> we<00:03:01.769> are

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
looking forward to getting that debugged

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.069 
looking forward to getting that debugged
and<00:03:04.260> tested<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.690> let's<00:03:06.690> see<00:03:06.959> what<00:03:07.290> maybe<00:03:09.079> we

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
and tested and let's see what maybe we

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.080 
and tested and let's see what maybe we
just<00:03:10.470> go<00:03:10.680> from<00:03:11.010> here<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:12.769> we<00:03:13.769> just<00:03:14.760> choose

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
just go from here and we just choose

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.750 
just go from here and we just choose
some<00:03:15.510> stuff<00:03:16.019> on<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.889> aerodynamics<00:03:17.549> tab

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
some stuff on the aerodynamics tab

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.670 
some stuff on the aerodynamics tab
doesn't<00:03:18.630> all<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.230> cool<00:03:19.609> this<00:03:20.609> interior

doesn't all that cool this interior

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.500 
doesn't all that cool this interior
hasn't<00:03:22.680> changed<00:03:23.010> much<00:03:23.340> or<00:03:23.790> nothing<00:03:24.239> at<00:03:24.359> all

hasn't changed much or nothing at all

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.720 
hasn't changed much or nothing at all

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
since the version you have been playing

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.520 
since the version you have been playing
in<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.030> open<00:03:27.359> beta<00:03:27.510> right<00:03:27.780> now<00:03:27.930> but<00:03:28.290> now<00:03:28.470> we

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
in the open beta right now but now we

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.250 
in the open beta right now but now we
come<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:28.889> this<00:03:29.160> one<00:03:29.400> here<00:03:29.579> yes<00:03:30.120> now<00:03:30.690> we<00:03:30.750> have

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
come to this one here yes now we have

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.390 
come to this one here yes now we have
should<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.639> which<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.109> behind<00:03:34.109> a<00:03:34.590> locking

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
should that is which is behind a locking

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.229 
should that is which is behind a locking
plate<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.120> current<00:03:36.450> open<00:03:36.930> beta<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.290> now

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
plate in the current open beta is now

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.289 
plate in the current open beta is now
unlocked<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.540> working<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:41.010> apart<00:03:41.910> from<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
unlocked and working so apart from the

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.870 
unlocked and working so apart from the
campsite<00:03:42.889> there<00:03:43.889> was<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.040> minus<00:03:44.370> sign<00:03:44.400> missing

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
campsite there was a minus sign missing

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.580 
campsite there was a minus sign missing
so<00:03:45.030> now<00:03:45.299> all<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.840> camper<00:03:46.139> values<00:03:46.410> are

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
so now all the camper values are

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.770 
so now all the camper values are
positive<00:03:46.739> which<00:03:47.280> doesn't<00:03:47.819> contribute<00:03:48.450> to

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
positive which doesn't contribute to

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.620 
positive which doesn't contribute to
excellent<00:03:49.260> handling<00:03:49.560> if<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.190> may<00:03:50.370> say<00:03:50.549> so<00:03:50.630> so

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
excellent handling if I may say so so

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.349 
excellent handling if I may say so so
you<00:03:52.200> have<00:03:52.440> an<00:03:53.040> easy<00:03:53.400> mode<00:03:53.730> for<00:03:54.000> all<00:03:54.150> the

much softer springs and raised mode of
course<00:04:04.780> yeah<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.470> it's<00:04:05.739> balancing<00:04:06.280> according
