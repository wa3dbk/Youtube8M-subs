00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
pretty much pwned these noobs twice in a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.970 
pretty much pwned these noobs twice in a
row<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:45.989> happens<00:00:46.020> now<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:46.860> just

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
row it's just what happens now I'm just

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.770 
row it's just what happens now I'm just
kidding<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.430> gameplay<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.360> my<00:00:48.539> best

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
kidding this gameplay is not my best

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170 
kidding this gameplay is not my best
gameplay<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.070> wanted<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.550> show<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.850> because

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
gameplay but I wanted to show it because

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.950 
gameplay but I wanted to show it because
it<00:00:52.079> gives<00:00:52.289> an<00:00:52.530> example<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:53.719> something<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.870> think

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it gives an example of something I think

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.930 
it gives an example of something I think
is<00:00:55.170> important<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.890> don't<00:00:56.160> get<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> best<00:00:56.640> score

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
is important I don't get the best score

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.029 
is important I don't get the best score
i<00:00:56.969> think<00:00:57.270> my<00:00:57.390> score<00:00:57.780> ends<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:58.020> being<00:00:58.170> 30<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.649> 11

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
i think my score ends up being 30 and 11

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.040 
i think my score ends up being 30 and 11
I<00:00:59.070> mean<00:00:59.250> yeah<00:00:59.789> that's<00:01:00.059> still<00:01:00.300> pretty<00:01:00.449> much<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.780> 3

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
I mean yeah that's still pretty much a 3

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.869 
I mean yeah that's still pretty much a 3
to<00:01:01.170> 1<00:01:01.199> KD<00:01:01.620> with<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> sniper<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.520> pretty<00:01:02.699> good

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
to 1 KD with a sniper it's pretty good

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.969

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
gameplay is I think there's a pretty

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.539 
gameplay is I think there's a pretty
sick<00:01:07.080> nine<00:01:07.590> kill<00:01:07.860> streak<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> middle<00:01:08.490> of

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
he's like basically it's me like me

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.340

walking<00:03:32.709> into<00:03:33.010> your<00:03:33.280> room<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.790> put<00:03:34.390> in<00:03:34.510> you

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
walking into your room and put in you

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.510 
walking into your room and put in you
know<00:03:35.380> how<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:35.739> have<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:35.980> stack<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.280> magazines

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
know how you have a stack of magazines

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.820 
know how you have a stack of magazines
and<00:03:37.090> that's<00:03:37.270> me<00:03:37.450> putting<00:03:37.780> my<00:03:37.810> magazine<00:03:38.410> on<00:03:38.590> top

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
and that's me putting my magazine on top

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.140 
and that's me putting my magazine on top
of<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.070> stack<00:03:39.310> that's<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.790> one<00:03:39.880> you're<00:03:40.000> going

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
of the stack that's the one you're going

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.760 
of the stack that's the one you're going
to<00:03:40.209> see<00:03:40.420> right<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.870> thought<00:03:41.350> that's<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:41.620> good

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
to see right I thought that's a good

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.490 
to see right I thought that's a good
analogy<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.670> makes<00:03:42.820> sense<00:03:43.000> um<00:03:43.330> I<00:03:43.780> don't

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
analogy and it makes sense um I don't

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.350 
analogy and it makes sense um I don't
really<00:03:44.680> see<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.070> big<00:03:45.310> deal<00:03:45.550> with<00:03:45.790> bumpy<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.270> I

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
really see a big deal with bumpy and I
