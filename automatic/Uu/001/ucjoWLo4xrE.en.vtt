00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.940 

wait<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> minute<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:39.320> space<00:00:40.320> mission<00:00:40.559> if

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
wait a minute this is a space mission if

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.190 
wait a minute this is a space mission if
you<00:00:41.219> could<00:00:42.120> not<00:00:42.329> tell<00:00:42.629> from<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:44.750> little<00:00:45.750> clip

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
you could not tell from that little clip

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.119 
you could not tell from that little clip
of<00:00:46.230> space<00:00:48.079> yeah<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:51.620> we'll<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.829> how<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.010> goes

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
of space yeah so we'll see how it goes

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.880 
of space yeah so we'll see how it goes
I'm<00:00:54.260> assuming<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> be<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.739> pretty

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
I'm assuming it's going to be a pretty

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.689 
I'm assuming it's going to be a pretty
hard<00:00:55.980> level<00:00:57.079> because<00:00:58.079> we're<00:00:58.859> getting<00:00:59.160> towards

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
hard level because we're getting towards

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.599 
hard level because we're getting towards
