00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:17.119
 hello how are we again here for 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.970
 explain a new topic from a point of 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.869
 informative view and problems that 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.260
 affect many people the issue that 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.070
 we will play is the typical lumbalgia 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.270
 Kidney pain that affects a huge 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.060
 amount of population 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.190
 the pain of meetings occurs 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.760
 normally when we 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.120
 we crouch and lift one more weight or 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.149
 less in this position 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.559
 and especially when we do not take care of the fact 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:54.780
 of doing it in a frontal way but that 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.890
 we try to make gestures laterally 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.500
 when the column is twisted 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.750
 then you are at a huge risk of 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.580
 column injury 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.720
 the lumbar spine 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.990
 it's a pillar 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.970
 which supports the weight of practically 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.770
 whole body 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.140
 this pillar in turn that supports load 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.260
 he has to have the ability to move 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.090
 and therefore has to 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.380
 offer us two properties that are 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.369
 contradictory and each other 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.829
 to achieve this the spine the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.430
 Lumbar spine in particular is formed 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.920
 for different bony pieces and between 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.790
 they some joints that are the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.920
 intervertebral joints 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.560
 to maintain is this column we have 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.910
 a series of braces in the same way 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.150
 that a mastiff on a ship has cables and 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.000
 then a series of lateral muscles 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.300
 the obliques the lumbar square 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.900
 abdominals ahead and especially for 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.570
 behind the musculature for vertebral one 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.910
 tremendously strong musculature very 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.100
 resistant to fatigue I call him the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.950
 amphetamine musculature because it's 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.380
 here interactive controlling these 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.450
 movements that are small of one in 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.860
 one but when we add them all 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.060
 they give great mobility to the column 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.610
 let's look now how is a joint 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.090
 intervertebral the model that I present 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.330
 here 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:45.440
 supposes the lower part of a vertebra 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:49.040
 and the top of another vertebra 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.340
 in the central area we find ourselves with 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.410
 the intervertebral disc this disc 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.340
 intervertebral is formed by a 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.100
 fibrous ring that surrounds and that forms 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.820
 the entire contour of the joint and in 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:08.290
 its interior a nucleus that is gelatinous 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.290
 and it gives a certain elasticity 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.330
 How many movements can we make with 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.570
 this joint 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:21.140
 we all know the great movements 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:23.640
 inter joint flexion 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.760
 extension 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.470
 inclination to the national immersion 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.580
 lateral towards the other 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.350
 rotation 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.360
 rotation 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.790
 There are six movements 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.310
 and are the best known are the macro 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.240
 movements of the spine but 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.120
 other lesser-known movements 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.690
 would include for example the fact of 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.750
 subsequent displacement of the set of 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.340
 a vertebra turn the displacement 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.110
 previous on the other hand we can have 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.530
 lateral displacements towards 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.110
 right or to the left and by 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.350
 last movements that would be of 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:12.880
 traction capture or movements of 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:16.040
 compression as you can see we have 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:20.190
 and macro movements 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:25.170
 and six micro movements 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:28.470
 because I insist on this, look at a column 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:32.200
 vertebral will not move properly if 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.290
 the micro movements do not fit well 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.990
 the spine the situation of a 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.950
 vertebra with the other must be in a 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.590
 easy buoyant flexing situation 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.490
 must be in this position when 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.930
 we have the column in this position 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.620
 any movement is executed with 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.500
 tremendous facilitates forgiveness 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.200
 when a vertebra is in a 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.540
 dysfunction situation is blocked 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.100
 somehow the gestures are 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:08.170
 limited if only by the micro 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:12.060
 movements that have an effect 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.490
 amplifier in the macro movements 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.620
 how do we prevent the problems of 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.240
 low back pain as we prevent any 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.630
 problem that may occur in the column 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:26.000
 vertebral thinking one thing the most 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:31.060
 of lumbago low back pain problems 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.100
 they are not identified, we do not know if they are 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.500
 labels cities is ingÃ©s of ligaments 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.030
 it can be a tuberculosis can be a 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.700
 herniated disc or even a cancer 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.490
 but what is certain is that if 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.950
 We balance the tensioners of this boat 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.960
 if we achieve that the mobility of the 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.660
 column be wide in every way 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.080
 and be in this floating situation 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.410
 easy the spine will be much healthier and 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.400
 lumbalgias will be much further 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.400
 thank you and see you next time
