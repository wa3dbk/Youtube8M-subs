00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
to just speed it up cuz it's like you

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.889 
to just speed it up cuz it's like you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
know it's easier on me so that way I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:46.880 
know it's easier on me so that way I
don't<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.590> stuff<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.829> say

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
