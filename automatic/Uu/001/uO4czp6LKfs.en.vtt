00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
mean depending on that layer you could

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.500 
mean depending on that layer you could
actually<00:00:51.620> just<00:00:52.620> fold<00:00:52.890> free<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.610> know<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:53.910> if

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
actually just fold free you know if if

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.549 
actually just fold free you know if if
their<00:00:54.629> range<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.899> pretty<00:00:55.020> tight<00:00:55.289> under<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
their range is pretty tight under the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.990 
their range is pretty tight under the
gun<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.190> could<00:00:56.309> actually<00:00:56.430> dystopian

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
gun then you could actually dystopian

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.670 
gun then you could actually dystopian
queen<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.300> clubs<00:00:57.510> who<00:00:57.960> fought<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.199> such<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> big

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
queen of clubs who fought for such a big

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.060 
queen of clubs who fought for such a big
raise

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
raise

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.799 
raise
then<00:00:59.760> again<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.030> mean<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.270> he's<00:01:00.359> been<00:01:00.510> opening

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
then again I mean if he's been opening

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.630 
then again I mean if he's been opening
fairly<00:01:01.410> wide<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.219> amount<00:01:02.430> all<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
fairly wide it's for that amount all the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.960 
fairly wide it's for that amount all the
time<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.180> obviously<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> standard<00:01:04.110> cool

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
time then is obviously a standard cool

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.399 
time then is obviously a standard cool
so<00:01:05.970> anyway<00:01:06.330> everyone<00:01:06.659> else<00:01:06.750> falls<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.229> his

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
so anyway everyone else falls for his

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.039 
so anyway everyone else falls for his
nine<00:01:07.650> Jack<00:01:08.250> ace<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.700> clubs<00:01:08.880> okay<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.479> he's<00:01:09.810> got

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
nine Jack ace of clubs okay so he's got

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.399 
nine Jack ace of clubs okay so he's got
not<00:01:10.439> flush<00:01:10.680> draw<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.250> gutter

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
not flush draw and a gutter

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.870 
not flush draw and a gutter
he<00:01:13.409> needs<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.740> flip<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> fifty<00:01:14.220> he<00:01:14.340> decides<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
he needs to flip the fifty he decides to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.850 
he needs to flip the fifty he decides to
just<00:01:15.299> cool<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.869> could<00:01:19.080> raise<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.320> here

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
just cool and you could raise that here

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.010 
just cool and you could raise that here
but<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.520> actually<00:01:20.850> think<00:01:21.090> you're<00:01:23.869> against<00:01:24.869> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
but I actually think you're against it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.179 
but I actually think you're against it
under<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.229> gun<00:01:25.350> right<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.619> no<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.770> quite<00:01:26.009> like

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
under the gun right so no I quite like

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.830 
under the gun right so no I quite like
white<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.520> cooling<00:01:26.909> because<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.180> keeps<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
white like cooling because it keeps the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.390 
white like cooling because it keeps the
pot<00:01:28.020> under<00:01:28.170> control<00:01:28.619> you're<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.920> position<00:01:29.280> so

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
pot under control you're in position so

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.980 
pot under control you're in position so
you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.610> always<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.360> know<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.630> value<00:01:30.900> on

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you can always you know get value on

nature Street that's fine

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.810

back<00:01:56.650> at<00:01:56.830> something<00:01:57.040> in<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.159> world<00:01:57.420> river<00:01:58.420> is

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
back at something in the world river is

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.640 
back at something in the world river is
another<00:01:58.630> break5

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
another break5

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.969 
another break5
so<00:02:00.610> what<00:02:00.790> is<00:02:00.940> ninth<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.630> case<00:02:01.840> by<00:02:02.049> five<00:02:02.290> he

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
so what is ninth a case by five he

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.090 
so what is ninth a case by five he
checks<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.700> he<00:02:04.240> decides<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.600> bet<00:02:04.840> 18<00:02:05.350> basically

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
checks so he decides to bet 18 basically

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.609 
checks so he decides to bet 18 basically
as<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.369> bluff<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.869> guys<00:02:08.020> snap<00:02:08.200> calls<00:02:08.440> with

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
as a bluff and the guys snap calls with

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.930 
as a bluff and the guys snap calls with
King<00:02:08.830> Jack<00:02:09.750> too<00:02:10.750> bad<00:02:10.929> alright<00:02:11.459> yeah<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.489> mean<00:02:12.880> I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
King Jack too bad alright yeah I mean I

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.390 
King Jack too bad alright yeah I mean I
think<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.450> prefer<00:02:13.690> betting<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.050> turn<00:02:14.260> here<00:02:14.590> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
think I prefer betting the turn here the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.860 
think I prefer betting the turn here the
other<00:02:15.520> thing<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.760> want<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.940> decide<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.420> you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
other thing you want to decide is you

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.960 
other thing you want to decide is you
know<00:02:16.989> whether<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.350> proof<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.680> action<00:02:18.069> whether

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
know whether the proof of action whether

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.280 
know whether the proof of action whether
you<00:02:19.180> should<00:02:19.239> have<00:02:19.420> actually<00:02:19.690> called<00:02:19.870> preflop

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
you should have actually called preflop

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.660 
you should have actually called preflop
I<00:02:20.470> mean<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.680> don't<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:20.950> about<00:02:21.069> how<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.370> Birds

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
I mean I don't know about how that Birds

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.090 
I mean I don't know about how that Birds
been<00:02:21.819> playing<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.330> guess<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.350> six<00:02:23.560> handed<00:02:23.860> so

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
been playing I guess it is six handed so

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.830 
been playing I guess it is six handed so
you<00:02:24.760> know<00:02:24.850> he's<00:02:25.239> opening<00:02:25.510> way<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.690> should<00:02:25.810> be

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
you know he's opening way it should be

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.600 
you know he's opening way it should be
fairly<00:02:26.080> wide<00:02:26.350> so<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:26.739> mean<00:02:27.010> not<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.250> worst<00:02:27.430> hand

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
fairly wide so I mean not the worst hand

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.850 
fairly wide so I mean not the worst hand
in<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.760> world<00:02:28.170> okay<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.410> know<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.620> wouldn't<00:02:29.800> say

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
in the world okay I know I wouldn't say

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.110 
in the world okay I know I wouldn't say
it<00:02:30.010> was<00:02:30.040> miss<00:02:30.250> played<00:02:30.430> horribly<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.850> would

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
it was miss played horribly I would

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.850 
it was miss played horribly I would
probably<00:02:31.330> prefer<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.840> bet<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.050> turn<00:02:32.230> then

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.680
