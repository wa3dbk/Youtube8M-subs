[MUSIC "LO, THE MIGHTY GOD
 APPEARING!"]

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.100
(SINGING) Lo, the
mighty God appearing!

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.200
From on high Jehovah speaks!

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.200
Eastern lands the
summons hearing, o'er

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.900
the west his thunder breaks.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.500
Earth behold him!

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.600
Earth behold him!

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
Universal nature shakes.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.200
Earth behold him!

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.300
Earth behold him!

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.300
Universal nature shakes.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.300
Zion, all its light unfolding,
God in glory shall display.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.300
Lo! he comes! nor
silence holding;

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.600
fire and clouds prepare his way.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.900
Tempests round him!

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.300
Tempests round him!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.300
Hasten on the dreadful day.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.600
Tempests round him!

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.000
Tempests round him!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Hasten on the dreadful day.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.300
To the heav'ns his
voice ascending,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.300
to the earth beneath he cries.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.100
Souls immortal, now descending,
let their sleeping dust arise!

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.400
Rise to judgment!

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.500
Rise to judgment!

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.700
Let thy throne adorn the skies.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.100
Rise to judgment!

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.200
Rise to judgment!

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
Let thy throne adorn the skies.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.200
Now the heav'ns on high adore
him and his righteousness

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.700
declare.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.800
Sinners perish from before
him, but his Saints his mercies

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.300
share.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.400
Just his judgments!

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.500
Just his judgments!

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
God, himself the
judge, is there.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.400
Just his judgments!

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.500
Just his judgments!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.300
God, himself the
judge, is there.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.000
Just his judgments!

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.400
Just his judgments!

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.900
God, himself the
judge, is there.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.550
God is there.
