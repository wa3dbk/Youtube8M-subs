00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.729 
so this is a faded glory in case you're
in<00:02:28.510> America<00:02:28.719> no<00:02:29.349> more

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
in America no more

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.979 
in America no more
and<00:02:30.430> one<00:02:30.819> thing<00:02:30.969> about<00:02:31.060> these<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:31.629> that<00:02:31.659> it's

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
and one thing about these is that it's

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.429 
and one thing about these is that it's
removable<00:02:32.590> cup<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:34.180> see<00:02:34.390> right<00:02:35.079> there's<00:02:35.349> a

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
removable cup so see right there's a

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.599 
removable cup so see right there's a
little<00:02:35.560> hole<00:02:35.920> enough<00:02:36.370> wrong

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
little hole enough wrong

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.830 
little hole enough wrong
now<00:02:39.609> comes<00:02:39.909> the<00:02:40.060> cup

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
now comes the cup

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.589 
now comes the cup
so<00:02:41.379> that's<00:02:41.859> a<00:02:42.159> little<00:02:42.370> much<00:02:42.700> padding<00:02:43.090> for<00:02:43.420> you

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
so that's a little much padding for you

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.449 
so that's a little much padding for you
hmm

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
hmm

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.429 
hmm
then<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.670> just<00:02:45.849> take<00:02:45.939> out<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.329> cup<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:47.170> look

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:47.439 
then you just take out the cup you look

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.640 
then you just take out the cup you look
like<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.859> you<00:02:48.579> know<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:49.359> onto<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.139> boob<00:02:50.379> I

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
like this you know it onto the boob I

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.729 
like this you know it onto the boob I
guess<00:02:50.859> um<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:52.180> I'm<00:02:52.239> talking<00:02:52.420> quietly<00:02:52.930> I'll

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
guess um so I'm talking quietly I'll

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.780 
guess um so I'm talking quietly I'll
speak<00:02:54.010> up<00:02:55.590> although<00:02:56.590> I'll<00:02:56.980> see<00:02:57.159> how<00:02:57.280> easy<00:02:57.549> it

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:21.350 
speak up although I'll see how easy it
is

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360

so<00:05:02.310> let<00:05:03.310> me<00:05:03.430> check<00:05:03.640> how<00:05:03.820> much<00:05:03.880> shines<00:05:04.450> in<00:05:04.690> here

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
so let me check how much shines in here

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:12.180 
so let me check how much shines in here
so<00:05:05.230> this<00:05:05.470> go<00:05:05.740> can<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:06.490> Eagles<00:05:06.880> reference

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.600 

that's<00:05:12.790> the<00:05:13.030> time

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
that's the time

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.020 
that's the time
so<00:05:15.180> about<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.599> same<00:05:15.629> size<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.639> just<00:05:17.849> hooks

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
so about the same size and it just hooks

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.850 
so about the same size and it just hooks
up<00:05:18.479> and<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:18.810> can<00:05:18.990> definitely<00:05:19.169> tell<00:05:19.740> the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
up and you can definitely tell the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:36.200 
up and you can definitely tell the
difference<00:05:19.889> any<00:05:20.460> days<00:05:20.759> readers

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.560 

see<00:05:36.810> and<00:05:37.530> we<00:05:37.560> have<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:38.039> talk<00:05:38.280> so<00:05:39.090> these<00:05:39.330> aren't

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
see and we have to talk so these aren't

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.330 
see and we have to talk so these aren't
completely<00:05:40.259> like<00:05:40.889> pad<00:05:41.250> it<00:05:41.430> up<00:05:42.350> so<00:05:43.350> yeah<00:05:44.039> okay

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
completely like pad it up so yeah okay

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.189 
completely like pad it up so yeah okay
stop<00:05:44.610> matters<00:05:45.060> to<00:05:45.360> your<00:05:45.449> mom<00:05:45.660> and<00:05:45.900> then<00:05:46.080> it's

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
stop matters to your mom and then it's

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.680 
stop matters to your mom and then it's
reversible<00:05:46.860> so<00:05:47.699> you<00:05:47.759> can<00:05:48.030> basically<00:05:48.180> a<00:05:48.449> whole

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
reversible so you can basically a whole

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.320 
reversible so you can basically a whole
different<00:05:49.050> box<00:05:50.810> read<00:05:51.810> this<00:05:51.990> black<00:05:52.289> one<00:05:53.300> that<00:05:54.300> I

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330
