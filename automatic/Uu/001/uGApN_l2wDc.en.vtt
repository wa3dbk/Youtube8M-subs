really<00:00:36.420> bad<00:00:36.570> shape<00:00:37.050> earlier<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.219> kind<00:00:38.430> of

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
really bad shape earlier but we kind of

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.799 
really bad shape earlier but we kind of
scrambled<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.120> position<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:39.600> we've<00:00:39.690> got

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
scrambled to this position now we've got

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.260 
scrambled to this position now we've got
kind<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> nice<00:00:40.710> 62<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.309> play<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.700> there's

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
kind of a nice 62 to play and there's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.940 
kind of a nice 62 to play and there's
two<00:00:42.450> obvious<00:00:42.980> choices<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> idea<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
two obvious choices with the idea of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.139 
two obvious choices with the idea of
sort<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.010> buttoning<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.000> making

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
sort of buttoning up here and making

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.580 
sort of buttoning up here and making
life<00:00:48.480> difficult<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:49.050> him<00:00:49.260> as<00:00:49.350> he<00:00:49.440> comes

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
life difficult for him as he comes

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799 
life difficult for him as he comes
around<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.550> know<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.850> maybe<00:00:51.120> building

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
around and you know just maybe building

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.910 
around and you know just maybe building
a<00:00:51.899> better<00:00:52.050> board<00:00:52.370> or<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.640> using<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.239> six<00:00:54.920> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
a better board or I'm using this six to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.500 
a better board or I'm using this six to
hit<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> guy<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> know<00:00:57.120> come<00:00:57.390> on

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
hit the guy here and you know come on

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.330 
hit the guy here and you know come on
here<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.100> try<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.300> fill<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> prime<00:01:00.719> here<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
here and try to fill the prime here and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.009 
here and try to fill the prime here and
trap<00:01:02.340> him<00:01:02.489> back<00:01:02.730> here<00:01:03.270> maybe<00:01:03.480> he<00:01:03.629> comes<00:01:03.840> in

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
trap him back here maybe he comes in

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.200 
trap him back here maybe he comes in
with<00:01:04.110> an<00:01:04.229> ace<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> deuce<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.189> he<00:01:05.790> can't<00:01:06.030> get

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
with an ace or a deuce and he can't get

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.990 
with an ace or a deuce and he can't get
the<00:01:06.479> three<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.170> make<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> three<00:01:07.909> make<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the three or we make the three make the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.330 
the three or we make the three make the
five<00:01:09.180> point<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.930> he<00:01:10.560> starts<00:01:10.830> crashing<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
five point and he starts crashing in the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.609 
five point and he starts crashing in the
meantime<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.850> get<00:01:12.000> some<00:01:12.180> sixes<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.780> jump<00:01:13.380> out

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
meantime we get some sixes to jump out

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.260 
meantime we get some sixes to jump out
we've<00:01:13.830> got<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.340> we've<00:01:14.460> got<00:01:14.549> three<00:01:14.790> guys<00:01:14.939> back

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
saying in background the sixes don't

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.380 
saying in background the sixes don't
grow<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.100> trees<00:01:20.220> when<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.759> need<00:01:20.909> them<00:01:21.119> or<00:01:21.270> any

number<00:01:21.600> doesn't<00:01:21.750> grow<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.020> trees<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.470> you

need it especially the bigger numbers to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.100 
need it especially the bigger numbers to
jump<00:01:24.689> over<00:01:25.650> over<00:01:26.340> primes<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.750> that's<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
jump over over primes so that that's the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:37.420

lot<00:01:46.200> behind<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> race<00:01:46.920> lot<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.369> want

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
lot behind in the race lot you just want

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.420 
lot behind in the race lot you just want
to<00:01:47.850> hit<00:01:48.000> which<00:01:48.799> gives<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.159> winning

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
to hit which gives you some winning

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.139 
to hit which gives you some winning
chances<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:53.220> know<00:01:53.250> he<00:01:53.549> has<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.850> go<00:01:53.970> all<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
chances you know he has to go all the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.260 
chances you know he has to go all the
way<00:01:54.270> back<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.750> starts<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.909> maybe<00:01:56.909> you'll<00:01:57.149> be

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
way back to starts and maybe you'll be

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.270 
way back to starts and maybe you'll be
able<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.659> do<00:01:57.810> something<00:01:58.290> however<00:02:00.860> big<00:02:01.860> problem

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
able to do something however big problem

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.190 
able to do something however big problem
with<00:02:02.520> hitting<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
with hitting is that you have the the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.289 
with hitting is that you have the the
three<00:02:05.040> point<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.610> don't<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.090> five

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
three point and you don't have the five

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.320 
three point and you don't have the five
point<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.009> gonna<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.849> little<00:02:09.060> bit

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
point so it's gonna be a little bit

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.880 
point so it's gonna be a little bit
difficult<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.929> fill<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> five<00:02:10.560> point

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
difficult to fill in the five point

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.220 
difficult to fill in the five point
you've<00:02:11.069> got<00:02:11.250> three<00:02:11.790> builders<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.330> can

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
you've got three builders you can

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.290 
you've got three builders you can
but<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.010> also<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.400> three<00:02:15.640> men<00:02:15.819> behind<00:02:16.120> a

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
but you also have three men behind a

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.850 
but you also have three men behind a
prime<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:16.750> they're<00:02:16.870> trying<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.170> escape<00:02:17.470> them

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
prime and they're trying to escape them

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.260 
prime and they're trying to escape them
at<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.160> same<00:02:18.340> time<00:02:18.580> as<00:02:18.790> you're<00:02:18.910> trying<00:02:19.150> to

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
at the same time as you're trying to

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.870 
at the same time as you're trying to
build<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.600> five-point<00:02:22.050> if<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.350> come<00:02:23.620> out

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
build the five-point if you come out

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.610 
build the five-point if you come out
with<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.910> six<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.540> can<00:02:25.569> swap<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.170> five<00:02:26.380> with

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
with the six you can swap the five with

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.430 
with the six you can swap the five with
the<00:02:26.650> two<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.970> then<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.080> much<00:02:29.230> better

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
the two and then you have a much better

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.020 
the two and then you have a much better
chance<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.950> making<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.370> five<00:02:30.580> point<00:02:30.880> and

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
chance of making the five point and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.860 
chance of making the five point and
maybe<00:02:31.270> you<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.630> hit<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.810> shot<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:33.780> when<00:02:34.780> you

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
maybe you can hit a shot and when you

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.320 
maybe you can hit a shot and when you
have<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.050> better<00:02:35.290> board<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:37.090> course

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
have a better board and you of course

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.620 
have a better board and you of course
you<00:02:37.420> have<00:02:37.600> one<00:02:37.780> more<00:02:37.930> guy<00:02:38.170> escaped<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:40.420> course

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
you have one more guy escaped of course

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.000 
you have one more guy escaped of course
the<00:02:40.810> problem<00:02:41.020> with<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.830> might

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
the problem with that is that you might

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.790 
the problem with that is that you might
not<00:02:42.160> get<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.520> shot<00:02:42.550> hey<00:02:43.540> that's<00:02:44.260> right<00:02:44.440> come

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
not get the shot hey that's right come

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.370 
not get the shot hey that's right come
on<00:02:44.860> get<00:02:45.130> up

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
on get up

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.800 
on get up
so<00:02:47.380> those<00:02:47.590> are<00:02:47.800> basically<00:02:48.520> what<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:49.660> to

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
so those are basically what you have to

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.290 
so those are basically what you have to
weigh<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:51.010> got<00:02:51.160> any<00:02:51.310> tips<00:02:51.580> on<00:02:51.730> how<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.060> would

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
weigh you got any tips on how you would

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.440 
weigh you got any tips on how you would
weigh<00:02:52.480> them<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:54.730> just<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:55.120> matter<00:02:55.330> of

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
weigh them it's just a matter of

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.930 
weigh them it's just a matter of
experience<00:02:56.430> judgments<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.610> guessing<00:02:59.940> plays

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
experience judgments and guessing plays

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.840 
experience judgments and guessing plays
a<00:03:00.970> big<00:03:01.269> part<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:02.230> don't<00:03:02.980> know<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.100> would<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.610> would

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
a big part I don't know I would I would

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.479 
a big part I don't know I would I would
turn<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.150> heads<00:03:04.860> yep<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:06.100> should<00:03:06.250> put<00:03:06.400> this

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
turn to heads yep that should put this

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.790 
turn to heads yep that should put this
you<00:03:06.640> preferred<00:03:06.970> play<00:03:07.180> yeah<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:07.959> guess<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:08.350> yeah

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
you preferred play yeah I guess so yeah

you preferred play yeah I guess so yeah
that's<00:03:09.190> that's<00:03:09.610> absolutely<00:03:10.269> right<00:03:10.570> yeah<00:03:11.320> how

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
that's that's absolutely right yeah how

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:24.060 
that's that's absolutely right yeah how
close<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.070> using<00:03:12.160> these<00:03:12.430> are<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:23.650> turn<00:03:23.890> out

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
close to using these are this turn out

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.270 
close to using these are this turn out
to<00:03:24.250> be<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.610> huge<00:03:24.970> blunder<00:03:25.410> it's<00:03:26.410> quite<00:03:26.680> clear<00:03:27.070> to

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
to be a huge blunder it's quite clear to

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.490 
to be a huge blunder it's quite clear to
hit<00:03:27.489> its<00:03:27.790> like<00:03:28.030> point<00:03:28.450> almost<00:03:28.840> point<00:03:29.140> three

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
hit its like point almost point three

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.680 
hit its like point almost point three
point<00:03:30.370> two<00:03:30.489> point<00:03:30.790> three<00:03:30.910> under<00:03:31.390> precise

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
point two point three under precise

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.050 
point two point three under precise
numbers<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.829> was<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.190> was<00:03:33.340> pretty<00:03:33.579> big<00:03:33.850> so

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
numbers it was it was pretty big so

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.460 
numbers it was it was pretty big so
Matt's<00:03:34.269> absolute<00:03:34.690> spot<00:03:34.959> on<00:03:35.110> these<00:03:35.290> these

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
Matt's absolute spot on these these

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.580 
Matt's absolute spot on these these
things<00:03:35.739> can<00:03:36.450> be<00:03:37.450> wildly<00:03:37.959> different<00:03:38.320> in<00:03:38.440> terms

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
things can be wildly different in terms

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.699 
things can be wildly different in terms
of<00:03:38.799> equity<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:40.209> does<00:03:40.570> look<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:41.170> know<00:03:41.260> in<00:03:41.620> a

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
of equity this does look you know in a

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.020 
of equity this does look you know in a
way<00:03:41.829> it<00:03:41.890> looks<00:03:42.040> kind<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.250> nice<00:03:42.400> you're<00:03:42.700> holding

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
way it looks kind of nice you're holding

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.170 
way it looks kind of nice you're holding
him<00:03:43.150> you<00:03:43.329> could<00:03:43.540> do<00:03:43.989> things<00:03:44.760> but<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:46.150> just

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
him you could do things but it just

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.940 
him you could do things but it just
turns<00:03:46.690> out<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.019> be<00:03:47.320> very<00:03:48.040> very<00:03:48.489> wrong<00:03:48.820> and<00:03:49.950> at

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
turns out to be very very wrong and at

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.979 
turns out to be very very wrong and at
the<00:03:51.070> end<00:03:51.190> when<00:03:51.310> we<00:03:51.340> made<00:03:51.549> our<00:03:51.579> play<00:03:51.970> Casper<00:03:52.900> had

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
the end when we made our play Casper had

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.449 
the end when we made our play Casper had
taken<00:03:53.200> my<00:03:53.440> point<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.739> view<00:03:53.799> and<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.070> had<00:03:54.160> kind<00:03:54.340> of

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
taken my point of view and I had kind of

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.789 
taken my point of view and I had kind of
gotten<00:03:54.940> around<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.239> his<00:03:55.450> we're<00:03:56.230> thinking<00:03:56.620> but

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
gotten around to his we're thinking but

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.250 
gotten around to his we're thinking but
he<00:03:56.950> made<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.760> executive<00:03:57.970> decision<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.810> did

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
he made the executive decision and did

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.069 
he made the executive decision and did
did<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.890> other<00:04:00.010> play<00:04:00.310> which<00:04:00.610> then<00:04:01.329> I<00:04:01.660> put<00:04:01.989> it
