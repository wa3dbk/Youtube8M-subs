and<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.840> realized<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:20.039> such<00:00:20.520> an<00:00:20.670> epidemic

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and I I realized that such an epidemic

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.060 
and I I realized that such an epidemic
that<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.480> world<00:00:21.689> has<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:22.109> certain<00:00:22.439> basic

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
that we take for granted that really

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.569 
that we take for granted that really
play<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> huge<00:00:30.480> role<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:31.130> public<00:00:32.130> health<00:00:32.279> and

how how people live their lives and I
really<00:00:35.670> feel<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.210> that's<00:00:36.390> important<00:00:36.870> that's

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
really feel like that's important that's

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.709 
really feel like that's important that's
what<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:37.500> calling<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.129> my<00:00:38.250> research<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.329> so

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
what my calling is in my research is so

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.780 
what my calling is in my research is so
important<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:41.129> critically

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
important because it really critically

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.119 
important because it really critically
engages<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.450> outside<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> classroom<00:00:43.500> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
engages you outside of the classroom you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.729 
engages you outside of the classroom you
take<00:00:44.399> exactly<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.539> you've<00:00:45.780> learned<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.289> you

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
apply it to an individual setting where

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.690 
apply it to an individual setting where
you<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.350> you're<00:00:49.770> forced<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.309> creatively

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
think about a project or look at a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.779 
think about a project or look at a
problem<00:00:52.860> from<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.219> different<00:00:53.250> angle<00:00:53.579> that

problem from a different angle that

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.990 
problem from a different angle that
you've<00:00:53.910> never<00:00:54.090> thought<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.510> before<00:00:54.920> also

research isn't just limited to pipetting
in<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> lab<00:01:07.530> all<00:01:07.740> day<00:01:08.180> thinking<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.960> only

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
in a lab all day thinking that only

scientists<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.220> research<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.790> that's<00:01:11.939> that's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
scientists to research and that's that's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.990 
scientists to research and that's that's
the<00:01:12.659> beauty<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.549> and<00:01:14.549> also<00:01:14.820> one<00:01:14.970> more
