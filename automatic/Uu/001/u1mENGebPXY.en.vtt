 the man had children from discarded bottles 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.889
 transforming 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.889
 d a new phase 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.699
 position of the day 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.699
 hope so 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.310
 customer discoveries 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.160
 O 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.080
 the actual recycled combat that is commonly called minister fan of the roads 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.340
 clothing and decorations 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.030
 norbu in the year 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.000
 - we got back to creating another six rounds in the away 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.930
 Environmental education worked creatively. 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.010
 develop parts during this year 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.880
 we have children month we have the month of june we have one 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.030
 scrub we have the international cleaning day of Guimarães flávio beach 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.500
 of this campaign a campaign 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.289
 that travel not only to Brazil but throughout the world 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.429
 and we can with the result of the campaigns develop toys at the time 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:16.570
 because 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.190
 our idea is to make it a race for poor communities to add value to the 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.590
 month 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.190
 no matter only you compact lobbyiche press you sell 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.650
 how much does it cost a pound of pet or how much does it cost? 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.720
 indicates a sugar cane how much it cost the end of an aluminum can 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.229
 so all this is a 10 hour growth and if you can add value 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.240
 to this you are going to be able to help the environment and a certain 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.999
 way to help 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.590
 if indoors with extra income 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.680
 without a bottle to be a piece of crepe paper nobody imagines needing 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.750
 win or win 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.950
 I became very well-known olympics 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.950
 I think that famous one. 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.819
 the force of the sea 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.089
 rhythmic gymnastics 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.119
 says it's nothing more or less than that 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.289
 a girl of only six 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.049
 to bring reinforcements 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.669
 a paper ball 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.709
 if you can get your child to stay indoors 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:21.689
 developing 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.689
 the joke added 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.780
 the history of toys was pure and simple 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.790
 to make these children work with adults 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.529
 in a job of massive persuasion so they get a job done 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:43.229
 that the future that they are trying to do for children may have an end 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:48.109
 very close if they do not become aware of the creation of this 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.699
 raw material from anyone and directly affects the environment. 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.010
 is that we managed to realize that no sir uses the tactic made in the final 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.690
 then making the world change 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.040
 but also the emergence of steel the emergence of aluminum the emergence of 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.650
 plastic emergence of pvc pt outbreak 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:13.099
 Are all the subjects prevented? 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.849
 here if they are not well cut if they are not well distributed valdelírio 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.029
 environment of making 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:27.069
 every day that passes the world suffers more with it then yes the pants and the 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.100
 consequences 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.649
 we see every day 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:30.659
 we see that it is a 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.489
 a car racing a car of formula 1 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.180
 that those involved also with some empty soda bottles 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.189
 I think you realize that if you use creativity you can do things 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:48.089
 in our economies a superstar of formula 1 and who drove it is our 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:53.969
 miss ayrton senna not forgetting to say that a bcp toy lasts 6 50 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:59.199
 years lp enke brazil and if by chance he broke the spare part 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.529
 Late on a shelf you're in a dump. 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:07.469
 being in a pantry wherever you go, we can not 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:13.379
 also forget that it has caused much of the floods in the cities after 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.489
 of a time of rain are the pet bottles because it does not have as they are 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.449
 float and we are bringing it is in the house as a toy
