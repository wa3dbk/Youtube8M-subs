00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
about the 13 so an either nice big gain

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.640 
about the 13 so an either nice big gain
here<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.950> get<00:01:29.130> back<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.930> time<00:01:31.320> get

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
here it get back to just in time get

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.460 
here it get back to just in time get
enough<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.369> piece<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.869> rusher<00:01:33.869> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
enough of a piece of that rusher to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.749 
enough of a piece of that rusher to
allow<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> quarterback<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.369> get<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> pass

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
allow the quarterback to get the pass

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.640 
allow the quarterback to get the pass
off<00:01:36.000> he<00:01:36.150> still<00:01:36.360> gets<00:01:36.570> drilled<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.409> get<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
off he still gets drilled but we get the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.090 
off he still gets drilled but we get the
touchdown

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
touchdown

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.219 
touchdown
so<00:01:38.610> Lando<00:01:39.000> looks<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.420> he's<00:01:39.570> stopped<00:01:39.960> short

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
so Lando looks like he's stopped short

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.899 
so Lando looks like he's stopped short
on<00:01:40.380> 3rd<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.710> 3<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.070> look<00:01:41.340> at<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> effort

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
on 3rd and 3 but look at the effort

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.580 
on 3rd and 3 but look at the effort
there<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.659> get<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.049> first<00:01:43.290> down

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
there to get the first down

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.010 
there to get the first down
running<00:01:44.490> hard<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.000> keeping<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> chains

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
running hard and keeping the chains

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.800 
running hard and keeping the chains
moving<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.590> Gophers<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:48.509> again<00:01:48.630> is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
moving for the Gophers so here again is
