00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello yourself cook today go on 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.310
 Unfortunately, Ivanov did not play 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.470
 I write a release this week 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.330
 except today it's like I was sick 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.219
 but today I will try to make up 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.230
 time to score as many goals as possible 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.940
 so by the end of the release on my team 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.100
 there was as much silver as possible 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.170
 players 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.699
 looking for an opponent let's play a match 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.410
 if you want to buy cheap coins for 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.150
 FIFA than an item to follow the link 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.380
 which is in the description for the video there 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.090
 be a VKontakte group where you can 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.570
 buy cheap coins for various 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.000
 platform composition at the opponent I think 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.190
 england here is a hybrid spain france and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.489
 England 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.030
 cool team and place chordi alba on 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.000
 flank 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.730
 very dangerous opponent is very difficult 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.960
 I will think so, but let's see Russia still 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.149
 Who does not attack the award it was cool 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.510
 body go pass go pass baby baby 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.969
 baby 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.219
 hit near corner beat but valdez on 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.000
 the place we hung was the hotel here on the sword 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.369
 must be the first blow and defender 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.409
 saves the gate nothing happens at her 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.860
 how could a dead end be in my mind 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.570
 He moved the ball here and even pass the ball at 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.110
 passes the transfer must have been a hotel 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.970
 kick kick kick kick good corner again 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.100
 valdez takes the ball but there he is 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.950
 uncomfortable on death so think left to 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.220
 my opponent's number and now 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.850
 cast passes and oh how so not 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.880
 the ridge is scored with fish but it's a goalkeeper like 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.000
 the tree played he stood inspected and 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.759
 felt him full of crap 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.850
 may react as I do not know translate 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.600
 the ball is on the corner but there is also past all 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.790
 the ball flew but came out still do not know 10 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.000
 no time nobody was hotel alone 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.619
 it is worth a blow Valdez in place of the defender 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.049
 or who was there I do not know the time and place 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.360
 pirate ball in the center can be dangerous 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.790
 hit blows goal in my opinion there was a rebound 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.550
 if not for the player who downloads 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.200
 he is less possible the goalkeeper would have caught well 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.670
 I do not know yes there was a ricochet of the fifth 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.790
 numbers ball flies through the net 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.350
 what is 20 30 minutes and see a little bit 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.400
 then there will be a lot of time 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.500
 there are moments but this is in my opinion my left 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.630
 the tank runs and overtakes the opponent's players 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.020
 can do cross but there is not one 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.000
 player and you can beat now hit her from 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.290
 rebound could fly the ball but damn 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.090
 too strong and you are good 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.480
 cool cast on the shaft 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.480
 must deal a goal kick excellent hours 9 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.300
 minutes and mario balotelli everything is fine 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.740
 Negredo passes not coming that he is good 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.980
 how cool is mogatec given 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.910
 output situation is included in the center 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.440
 beat hit beat hit good hit but 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.540
 near corner and there is a valdez in place over 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.630
 was very turn around there or what such 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.120
 come up with a meadow around the hotel can 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.920
 beat beat hit beat hit battery don't 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.650
 that analysis scores damn I already thought 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.220
 tabal hotel scored on whether the second scores 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.390
 Goal 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.430
 22 ah-ah-ay was a hotel 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:17.550
 oh well how's what passed 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:21.450
 cool good hit hit goal floor body tele 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.900
 good 32 what a match this blow was 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.100
 the hotel is just deadly again remember 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.100
 mind and struck was the hotel 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.720
 cool kick from the barbell you got to 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.880
 punched perfectly just 32 what kind of comeback 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.330
 dangerous dangerous can be dangerous can 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.209
 be dangerous no no no oh well 33 not 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.160
 ridge what the hell are you 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.020
 goalkeeper if i hadn't stepped goalkeeper there 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.630
 the goalkeeper would have caught but for some reason I started 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.489
 go out and equalized the rival 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.720
 cool match was hotel scores two 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.850
 sword if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.560
 Shake up puts the ball on the cool 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.810
 match with two replacements and play 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.580
 one more and so chatted scored two goals 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.900
 by replacing two 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:10.870
 players i think i will change this time 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:14.769
 cent PKK put here Greco 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.290
 and put another one too I have two 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.000
 player 2b to from one club put 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.060
 Ross probably on the right flank 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.620
 so that chemistry was better yes the name became 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.590
 much better now 96 will play one more 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.090
 match and probably finish duck u rival 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.430
 very bad chemistry now let's see 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.070
 what team is a hybrid from different leagues 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.280
 players get 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:42.870
 Italy Spain and England but in attack 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.550
 Gomez is who can always taste bitter 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.350
 let's see and there will be crosses flank probably 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.139
 will be cross flank goalkeeper goalkeeper 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.419
 knocks the ball with his fist and now hit her 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.720
 what a parachute punch com bell center 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.030
 selects pinara 5th and how dangerous 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.760
 maybe it's good for armor 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.539
 the goalkeepers are so good not him again immediately 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.690
 guarding is necessary to hit the bar is dangerous because 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:12.850
 that gomez comes out flank shots goal from 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:14.320
 rod flies the ball into the goal damn well, not 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.080
 I know my goalkeeper should have taken 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.840
 marked in principle far enough with 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:24.130
 long distance hit but not shone 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.190
 the ball oh well so patched passes 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.950
 Barbie is good powerful blow to the new goalkeeper 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.960
 gets on sul on was the hotel passes and 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.360
 need to turn around the hotel runs runs 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.849
 runs runs runs with a great goal kick 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.810
 compares the score of mario balotelli 45 minutes 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.760
 and cool strike in the near corner for 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.810
 goalkeeper and goal 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:50.470
 Serve on ice hit a goal on ice Donald 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:56.260
 scores 21 cool again head scores 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:59.940
 my protector from genesis was ebay hotel 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:05.229
 After all, there was a hotel head 31 cool 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:08.139
 excellent right after the break, scored two 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.000
 goals are great just 31 corps 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.940
 the second player puts thereby hinders 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.830
 to another player and you can beat her if 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.070
 on the far hung it would be a goal 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.990
 there was a hotel alone standing but 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.020
 another defender insures and that you 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.810
 do guys why strike a bar beat out 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.090
 good i had a goal 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.600
 not to finish the medal and now why the hell 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:33.180
 so you do gomez and say screwed up 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.640
 flogged defenders and scoring gomez always 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.610
 can score in any situation and here 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.130
 now he scores 32 32 and column 10 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.620
 minutes everyone can be knocked on was 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.420
 a hotel where we chatted about it 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.450
 be dangerous very little body goes alone 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.100
 on one almost hit her and why 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.140
 so broke center field and now 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.060
 the last opponent's attacks will probably be 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.150
 and it is very dangerous and may be gomez hit 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.800
 scissors what do you do in 32 points 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.990
 scores two goals 0 to 1 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.910
 however, as in the previous match was still 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.770
 one moment at the end of the first second 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:08.100
 More precisely time which could realize 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.690
 but unfortunately I did not implement it, and so 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.950
 chatted scored two goals respectively 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.170
 make two replacements 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:16.710
 first thing I want to replace the left side 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:20.310
 it will be futile from the steam we will replace it 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:23.160
 in iraq which is a little bit much 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:26.040
 faster than this without bach but nisbah 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.260
 we will protect the stats much better and change 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.930
 still think opornika opornika will 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.870
 opornik we will have and tried for the Brazilian 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.690
 another brazilian in the judson team here 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.270
 here chemistry will be much better think yes 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.640
 there will be one hundred percent chemistry now everything 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:45.330
 players with a series of actually it finally 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:48.030
 happened now i won't have a bad 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:50.190
 chemistry on it all i think in this release 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.050
 scored how many four goals played two 

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.680
 match I think you enjoyed it with you 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.680
 how everyone bye
