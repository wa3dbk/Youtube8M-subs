00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.750
 hello today I'm going to prepare some croquettes 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.369
 of fish to prepare 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.090
 we will need the following 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.550
 ingredients we will need a little bit of 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.919
 fish this fish is the one that has 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.759
 I have taken advantage of a 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:34.700
 broth that I have prepared olive oil 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:38.690
 wheat flour milk a bit of 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.829
 butter also black pepper salt and 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:47.179
 nutmeg let's start doing 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.219
 in the pan with the oil 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:52.010
 butter and flour we're going to 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.329
 sautÃ© to prepare the base dough 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.400
 the croquettes we are going to place in a 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.540
 casserole or in a saucepan 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.540
 olive oil 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.970
 also the butter 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.830
 now let's wait 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.410
 to melt a little bit the 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.640
 butter once the butter 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.440
 already melted it has already melted 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.310
 let's add the flour and we're going to 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.860
 toast a little 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.780
 when they call when the flour has been 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.520
 costado a little we see that it is changing 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.039
 color 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.710
 you never have to leave it raw because it does not 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.049
 it tastes good so we 're a 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.850
 little bit when it's already toasted we're going to 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.840
 go adding the milk without stopping 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.840
 stir with the rods 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.740
 let's add to everything 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.159
 this is the quantity the proportions that 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.950
 I usually do for the bechamel and now 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.149
 I 'm going to lower the fire because I want 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.320
 add the salt salt the corresponding 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:09.590
 then with the filling it will also take 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:13.069
 your quantity is also added 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.580
 a little bit of black pepper to taste 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.580
 each one 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.270
 and to add the nutmeg I'm going to 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.270
 put out the fire 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.110
 we mix well and now we see that the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.500
 Bechamel is expressing himself to a 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.230
 point where we need to move this point 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.760
 It is the ideal point for croquettes 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.580
 then it will be like that the mass inside 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.260
 so now I remove it from the fire and the 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.540
 Bechamel for croquettes is already 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.630
 finished when we have the bechamel 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.820
 prepared we shred the fish or 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.190
 I chop it I prefer to put it like that 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.560
 shredded 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.290
 because if you find a piece 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.360
 he is also rich and once he is 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.360
 all crumbled already we add it 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.260
 to the bechamel here I have the bechamel 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.260
 prepared so I'm just going to add 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.269
 now we are going to spend all the bechamel with 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.280
 the fish to a tray to cool it 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.560
 and then later to be able to do 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.269
 croquettes once we have it already in the 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.680
 tray we prepare a little bit the 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.799
 surface 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.849
 and we can leave it covered with a paper 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:43.280
 of film and so that it does not crust us 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.470
 what we are going to do is make him be 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.460
 contact on paper 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.460
 with the bechamel 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.950
 and now we already let it cool down 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.930
 that is already at room temperature and the 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.319
 bechamel is already once mass 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.080
 croquettes and has cooled we can 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.810
 see that the one that has not crusted and that 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.540
 it already has a fairly consistent 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.450
 strong now let's prepare the 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.959
 batter on a plate we will put the 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.419
 eggs and we have to beat them very well 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.550
 you have to beat them a lot so that we do not 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.530
 pieces of clear 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.840
 well beaten with the help of two 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.980
 teaspoons let's take lots of 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.890
 mass well more or less and we're going to go 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.600
 leaving on the breadcrumbs for 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.480
 First make a batter with the bread 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.340
 grated and then we'll do what 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.040
 we will go through the egg and now 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.500
 finish again breadcrumbs you have to 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.690
 try to make them the same size and 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.640
 you can choose between doing the big ones or 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.600
 make them smaller now we're going 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.600
 giving the form 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.360
 and we will leave them each within the 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.360
 bread crumbs and we go well in egg 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.430
 and we are taking them out and such of the excellent 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.240
 and we put them back on top of bread 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.430
 grated 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.199
 this is a little bit long but then fine 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.199
 it's worth it because you can freeze 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.650
 with the batter of bread we can already go 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.979
 giving the form 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.990
 and I leave them on a tray in 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.600
 which I have placed a film paper 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.970
 because that's how I can have them in the 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.350
 freezer occupies me little so I have 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.470
 have to be careful that I do not get 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.990
 crush and when you have all the 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.330
 pod the whole tray complete the 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.160
 you enter the freezer can be 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.470
 fry directly there is no 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.810
 problem then I will do all the 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.580
 tray and then already go to fry for 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.740
 I'll fry them in a fryer 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.690
 if you do it in a pan you have to have 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.020
 abundant oil and very hot 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.720
 hot I have set a temperature of 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.000
 165 degrees 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.260
 you have to fry them a few times 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.690
 because if they do not cool us the oil and 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:12.780
 could be opened in about two minutes 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.420
 we have already golden brown and ready now the 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.980
 let's move to an absorbent role the 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:22.650
 we let the oil drain and the 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.050
 we have ready to serve if it has 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.300
