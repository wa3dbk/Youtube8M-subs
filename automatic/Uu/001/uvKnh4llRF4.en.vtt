00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.140
 what I like not to multiple janacek 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.770
 it's the changes of atmosphere and 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.650
 of character in the same room 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.330
 they are very abrupt and unexpected without 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.330
 no introduction or development 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.180
 every note is important and 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.450
 essential and he always goes right to 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.450
 goal 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.070
 1 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.040
 1 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 e 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.440
 janacek's music a total absence 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.700
 of romance as it was used but 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.039
 his music is really 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.039
 a mixture of voltage intensity 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.180
 by listening to janacek's music 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.470
 we realize that it was not 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.000
 influenced by a great composer 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.810
 before him and let's also look at the story 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.790
 music 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.159
 we realize that he does not have 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.840
 influenced by two composers after him 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:12.590
 as milan kundera says he and the meteor 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.590
 of the history of music 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.320
 yeah 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400
 and 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.450
 but 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.760
 no 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.760
 my 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.180
 without the musical pledge comes from the music 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.459
 folk and his love for the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.100
 Czech language for years of 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.230
 years he has collected studying the 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.540
 Czech folklore and also using 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:04.690
 this language in his works and his 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:07.600
 operas I'm sure that influences and 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.650
 and fashioned use of molting phrasing is 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.650
 says in his compositions
