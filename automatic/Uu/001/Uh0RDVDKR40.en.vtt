rims that'll look really really nice on
the<00:01:43.409> bike<00:01:43.619> because<00:01:43.829> they're<00:01:44.040> black<00:01:44.280> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the bike because they're black and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.010 
the bike because they're black and
they're<00:01:44.729> really<00:01:45.030> heavy<00:01:45.270> duty<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:48.600> bike<00:01:48.780> so

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
they're really heavy duty the bike so

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.020 
they're really heavy duty the bike so
actually<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> hub<00:01:49.920> they<00:01:50.520> say<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
actually like the hub they say the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.940 
actually like the hub they say the
latter<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> better<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.829> my

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
latter it is the better it is but my

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.980 
latter it is the better it is but my
hubs<00:01:53.220> pretty<00:01:53.610> loud<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.149> guess<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.420> must<00:01:54.780> be

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
hubs pretty loud so I guess that must be

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.200 
hubs pretty loud so I guess that must be
a<00:01:55.020> good<00:01:55.320> thing<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.610> listen<00:01:57.060> like

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
a good thing like if you listen like

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:06.609 
a good thing like if you listen like
just<00:01:57.479> listen<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.079> it

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.940 

like<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:07.979> pretty<00:02:08.399> loud<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:09.690> anyway<00:02:10.020> I'm

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
like that's pretty loud but anyway I'm

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.590
