00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.620
 How are we friends today? 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.440
 with psychologists daniel vásquez montaño 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.440
 that is another type of house logo 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.519
 this topic with our friends 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.650
 is with the name you left me like 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.099
 something like that but yes it is very 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.370
 Valuable friends guess what is called the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.800
 issue how to make a man do what 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.320
 you want 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.600
 Few women do not know they have to write down 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.540
 there they go down are five points then 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.590
 I took peace with the pencil take paper and 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.270
 begin to notice number one lists 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.980
 this is very delicate very 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.660
 smart every month with credit 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.660
 number one effect lives alone 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:04.070
 if we do not do is perhaps not 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.940
 because because the woman and mentally she 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.940
 let's get carried away by that for that idealism of 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.940
 Water 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.780
 If we will not know what I do not 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.960
 I need to ask friends are not going to 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.930
 do not get up we are not going to do 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.960
 here we will guess explicit and 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.290
 they have to ask him to do syllable number 2 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.940
 I want 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.940
 that I save the dishes 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:41.600
 think it over 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:45.159
 do not offend and you never help me with this 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.159
 there is never just not 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.990
 if you ask more than once 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.539
 once because to us it's like 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.710
 We ask once for not having asked 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.210
 finally it comes out here we follow 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.520
 doing what we have to do all 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.740
 the days then you have to ask for more 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.810
 once it feels good always good that 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.659
 is the number three that you have to ask for 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.810
 correct way not without complaining without 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:12.010
 if even offend me as my love 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.349
 I would love for you to help me to the bank 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.900
 I would love there is such a nice person 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.900
 I would love that I like it 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.340
 always using and always using the power 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.910
 feminine that is extremely of the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.500
 powerful blunt redundancy of 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.660
 part of you do not melt 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.970
 when they use then when you use your 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.860
 charms 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:43.710
 then I do not know what no no no no 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.210
 offend welcome number 4 number 4 there 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.330
 that train your man with 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.190
 positive reinforcement ie you have to 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.190
 Give prizes for going out more 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.180
 seriously, you have to reward, you have to 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.180
 reward 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.629
 we have the gentlemen who are 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.329
 watching program and they will agree 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.189
 completely with me that we always 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.870
 He likes to reward us make us 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.000
 feel valued that make us feel 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.700
 important are hitting us that there is no 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.890
 better person we are not important 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.620
 for you our countries and there are 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.510
 that always expressing what happens is 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.609
 that when we wash the dishes they tell us 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.439
 oh, look here, you missed here 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.260
 towards the fork and instead of saying my 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.359
 love thank you very much my love I love 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.879
 when he helps me save a plate or 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.040
 maybe tomorrow the treble and I love 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.810
 when the canyon cooks to motivate us 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:04:00.060
 for the pot the bleeding 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.060
 clothes 55 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:08.890
 we have to negotiate we love 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.020
 negotiate and we love 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.430
 It's as simple as saying my love 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:21.400
 you remember what you wanted to do 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:24.400
 Well, yes, exactly, if you do this 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.139
 because you have stagnation what do you think and 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.000
 that for us is very practical very 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.460
 simple and we like it because there is no 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.990
 rate averages are elements that you understand 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.320
 discover it and simple though then 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.520
 open are the points to make 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.000

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.010

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.130
 that is to put it into practice friends 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.340

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.320
