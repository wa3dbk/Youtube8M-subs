talk about piston tapes piston tapes are
redstone<00:00:25.720> devices<00:00:26.200> that<00:00:26.439> are<00:00:26.590> useful<00:00:27.220> when

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
redstone devices that are useful when

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.659 
redstone devices that are useful when
you<00:00:27.550> have<00:00:27.580> a<00:00:28.029> series<00:00:28.930> of<00:00:28.960> different<00:00:29.919> redstone

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
you have a series of different redstone

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.490 
you have a series of different redstone
signals<00:00:31.149> that<00:00:31.360> you<00:00:31.480> want<00:00:31.779> one<00:00:32.020> after<00:00:32.380> the

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
signals that you want one after the

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.040 
signals that you want one after the
other<00:00:33.600> these<00:00:34.600> three<00:00:35.530> devices<00:00:35.800> here<00:00:36.190> are<00:00:37.050> three

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
other these three devices here are three

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.360 
other these three devices here are three
different<00:00:38.380> kinds<00:00:38.500> of<00:00:38.680> piston<00:00:38.980> tapes<00:00:39.160> there

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
different kinds of piston tapes there

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.069 
different kinds of piston tapes there
are<00:00:39.460> many<00:00:39.700> many<00:00:39.969> kinds<00:00:40.180> of<00:00:40.420> piston<00:00:40.719> tapes<00:00:40.870> this

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
are many many kinds of piston tapes this

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.250 
are many many kinds of piston tapes this
is<00:00:41.230> only<00:00:41.559> three<00:00:42.340> different<00:00:42.489> sizes<00:00:43.020> I'll<00:00:44.020> just

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
is only three different sizes I'll just

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.550 
is only three different sizes I'll just
demonstrate<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:46.030> it<00:00:46.150> looks<00:00:46.330> like<00:00:46.540> so<00:00:47.200> I

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
demonstrate what it looks like so I

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.980 
demonstrate what it looks like so I
press<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.280> activate<00:00:48.730> it<00:00:48.880> and<00:00:48.970> now<00:00:49.300> that<00:00:49.570> wires

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
press I activate it and now that wires

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.900 
press I activate it and now that wires
lit<00:00:50.290> up<00:00:50.410> now<00:00:50.950> that<00:00:51.100> split<00:00:51.670> up<00:00:52.200> those<00:00:53.200> two<00:00:53.910> that

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
lit up now that split up those two that

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.350 
lit up now that split up those two that
one<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.390> so<00:00:56.320> on<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.590> so<00:00:56.710> forth<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.910> way<00:00:58.239> it

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
one and so on and so forth the way it

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.600 
one and so on and so forth the way it
works<00:00:58.570> is<00:00:59.050> that<00:00:59.829> you<00:01:00.250> have<00:01:00.520> a<00:01:02.579> series<00:01:03.579> of

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
works is that you have a series of

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.039 
works is that you have a series of
blocks<00:01:04.329> going<00:01:04.689> around<00:01:05.079> a<00:01:06.060> loop<00:01:07.060> with<00:01:07.659> four

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
blocks going around a loop with four

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.950 
blocks going around a loop with four
sets<00:01:08.470> of<00:01:08.649> Pistons<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:09.280> you<00:01:10.210> have<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.630> part<00:01:10.869> in

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
sets of Pistons and you have a part in

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.139 
sets of Pistons and you have a part in
the<00:01:11.020> middle<00:01:11.229> here<00:01:11.530> where<00:01:12.040> you<00:01:12.220> have<00:01:12.250> power

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
the middle here where you have power

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.690 
the middle here where you have power
going<00:01:13.600> into<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:14.079> four<00:01:14.380> or<00:01:14.710> however<00:01:15.100> many<00:01:15.399> not

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
going into the four or however many not

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.669 
going into the four or however many not
doesn't<00:01:16.329> need<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.600> before<00:01:16.899> there<00:01:17.380> is<00:01:17.469> the

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
doesn't need to before there is the

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.859 
doesn't need to before there is the
blocks<00:01:18.219> in<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.609> line<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.909> block<00:01:22.630> is

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
blocks in a line and if the block is

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.840 
blocks in a line and if the block is
made<00:01:23.109> of<00:01:23.259> glass<00:01:23.499> that<00:01:24.069> power<00:01:24.340> doesn't<00:01:24.729> go

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
made of glass that power doesn't go

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.550 
made of glass that power doesn't go
through<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:25.450> if<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.929> is<00:01:26.079> made<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.380> something

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
through and if it is made of something

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.739 
through and if it is made of something
like<00:01:26.740> wool<00:01:27.039> or<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.549> salt<00:01:28.090> any<00:01:28.299> kind<00:01:28.539> of<00:01:28.600> solid

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
like wool or a salt any kind of solid

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:30.480 
like wool or a salt any kind of solid
blocking<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.380> glass<00:01:29.590> can<00:01:29.770> be<00:01:29.799> any<00:01:30.009> kind<00:01:30.249> of

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
blocking the glass can be any kind of

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.209 
blocking the glass can be any kind of
transparent<00:01:31.090> block<00:01:31.289> the<00:01:32.289> signal<00:01:32.950> will<00:01:33.069> go

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
transparent block the signal will go

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.989 
transparent block the signal will go
through<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.119> can<00:01:34.299> use<00:01:34.479> this<00:01:34.719> to<00:01:35.789> get<00:01:36.789> a

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
through and so you can use this to get a

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:43.580 
through and so you can use this to get a
series<00:01:37.569> of<00:01:37.600> different<00:01:39.389> states<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:42.189> one<00:01:42.579> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
series of different states this one is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.769 
series of different states this one is
three<00:01:44.590> four<00:01:44.889> five<00:01:45.100> six<00:01:45.340> seven<00:01:45.609> eight<00:01:45.880> nine<00:01:45.909> so

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:46.779 
three four five six seven eight nine so

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:50.940 
three four five six seven eight nine so
that<00:01:46.929> this<00:01:47.079> is<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.380> nine<00:01:47.889> by<00:01:49.109> eight<00:01:50.109> there's<00:01:50.469> 18

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
that this is a nine by eight there's 18

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.440 
that this is a nine by eight there's 18
different<00:01:51.130> combinations<00:01:51.819> possible<00:01:52.329> and

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
different combinations possible and

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.019 
different combinations possible and
something<00:01:52.569> like<00:01:52.659> this<00:01:52.929> I<00:01:53.249> have<00:01:54.249> a<00:01:54.369> smaller<00:01:54.909> one

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:55.029 
something like this I have a smaller one

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:57.209 
something like this I have a smaller one
here<00:01:55.450> which<00:01:55.689> has<00:01:55.990> ten<00:01:56.859> different

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
here which has ten different

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:07.130 
here which has ten different
possibilities<00:02:01.529> both<00:02:02.529> out<00:02:02.709> again<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.829> so

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
possibilities both out again and so

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.030 
possibilities both out again and so
works<00:02:08.140> just<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.590> same<00:02:09.959> except<00:02:10.959> it's<00:02:11.290> it's

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
works just the same except it's it's

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.280 
works just the same except it's it's
smaller<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.580> has<00:02:12.760> less<00:02:13.060> less<00:02:13.900> available

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
smaller and has less less available

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.610 
smaller and has less less available
spaces<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.490> you<00:02:15.550> see<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.819> one<00:02:16.030> had<00:02:16.319> 18<00:02:17.319> and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
spaces so you see that one had 18 and

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.120 
spaces so you see that one had 18 and
this<00:02:17.680> one<00:02:17.890> has<00:02:18.010> 10<00:02:18.340> but<00:02:19.209> what<00:02:20.140> if<00:02:20.349> you<00:02:20.590> wanted

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
this one has 10 but what if you wanted

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.940 
this one has 10 but what if you wanted
an<00:02:21.459> odd<00:02:21.939> number<00:02:22.450> like<00:02:22.989> say<00:02:23.290> 11<00:02:23.799> different

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
an odd number like say 11 different

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.830 
an odd number like say 11 different
states<00:02:24.220> for<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:25.329> you'll<00:02:25.480> have<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.689> do

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
states for that you'll have to do

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.000 
states for that you'll have to do
something<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.260> bit<00:02:26.290> tricky

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
something a bit tricky

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.580 
something a bit tricky
something<00:02:27.640> like<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:27.970> this<00:02:28.659> one<00:02:28.930> as<00:02:29.200> you

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
something like this this one as you

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.210 
something like this this one as you
would<00:02:30.220> be<00:02:30.790> able<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:31.030> see<00:02:31.180> would<00:02:31.390> be<00:02:31.510> has<00:02:32.220> 22

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
would be able to see would be has 22

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.289 
would be able to see would be has 22
different<00:02:34.200> states<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.409> it<00:02:35.560> but<00:02:36.430> say<00:02:36.909> I<00:02:36.940> wanted

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
different states in it but say I wanted

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.440 
different states in it but say I wanted
11<00:02:37.840> this<00:02:38.650> one<00:02:38.950> is<00:02:39.190> set<00:02:39.459> up<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.819> give<00:02:39.970> me<00:02:40.000> two

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
11 this one is set up to give me two

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
11 this one is set up to give me two
sets<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.870> eleven<00:02:41.230> what<00:02:42.159> it<00:02:42.280> does<00:02:42.489> is<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:43.150> has

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
sets of eleven what it does is it has

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.740 
sets of eleven what it does is it has
one<00:02:44.470> set<00:02:44.799> of<00:02:44.890> eleven<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.459> then<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.599> repeats

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
one set of eleven and then it repeats

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.369 
one set of eleven and then it repeats
the<00:02:47.200> exact<00:02:47.620> same<00:02:47.860> one<00:02:48.160> again<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.780> lets<00:02:50.140> it

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
the exact same one again so that lets it

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.550 
the exact same one again so that lets it
have<00:02:50.680> an<00:02:50.860> odd<00:02:51.010> number<00:02:51.459> of<00:02:51.489> different<00:02:52.000> states

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
have an odd number of different states

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.479 
have an odd number of different states
but<00:02:54.329> it<00:02:55.329> works<00:02:55.540> with<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:55.840> kind<00:02:56.049> of<00:02:56.110> setup

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
but it works with this kind of setup

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.970 
but it works with this kind of setup
it's<00:02:57.489> a<00:02:57.640> cool<00:02:58.510> idea<00:02:59.819> this<00:03:00.819> thing<00:03:01.060> over<00:03:01.180> here<00:03:01.269> is

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
it's a cool idea this thing over here is

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.920 
it's a cool idea this thing over here is
if<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.220> wanted<00:03:03.549> a<00:03:03.670> really<00:03:03.879> really<00:03:04.390> small<00:03:04.660> one

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
if you wanted a really really small one

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.630 
if you wanted a really really small one
it's<00:03:05.440> something<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.890> came<00:03:05.950> up<00:03:06.129> with<00:03:06.250> on<00:03:06.489> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
it's something I came up with on the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.580 
it's something I came up with on the
spot<00:03:06.670> it's<00:03:07.150> not<00:03:07.359> actually<00:03:07.810> set<00:03:08.019> up<00:03:08.140> as<00:03:08.319> you<00:03:08.440> can

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
spot it's not actually set up as you can

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.940 
spot it's not actually set up as you can
see<00:03:08.739> it's<00:03:08.920> just<00:03:09.129> sort<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.720> shell<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.930> one<00:03:11.170> it

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
see it's just sort of a shell of one it

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.910 
see it's just sort of a shell of one it
relies<00:03:12.940> on<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.299> fact<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:14.019> torch

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
relies on the fact that a torch

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.640 
relies on the fact that a torch
underneath<00:03:15.579> a<00:03:15.730> glass<00:03:16.239> block<00:03:16.569> does<00:03:17.019> not<00:03:17.260> deep

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
underneath a glass block does not deep

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.670 
underneath a glass block does not deep
out<00:03:17.890> like<00:03:18.459> unpowered<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.599> torch<00:03:20.140> on<00:03:20.349> top<00:03:20.500> of

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
out like unpowered the torch on top of

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.979 
out like unpowered the torch on top of
it<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:20.920> if<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:22.060> want<00:03:22.359> to<00:03:22.480> put<00:03:22.599> in<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.810> work<00:03:22.959> to

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
it and if you want to put in the work to

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.920 
it and if you want to put in the work to
extract<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.739> data<00:03:23.890> from<00:03:24.069> here<00:03:24.670> then<00:03:25.329> there

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
extract the data from here then there

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.660 
extract the data from here then there
you<00:03:25.959> go<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.560> have<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.709> be<00:03:26.799> a<00:03:26.920> bit<00:03:27.099> careful<00:03:27.340> if

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
you go you have to be a bit careful if

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.309 
you go you have to be a bit careful if
you<00:03:27.790> want<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.569> do<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:28.840> though<00:03:29.019> because<00:03:29.140> you

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
you want to do it though because you

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.020 
you want to do it though because you
can't<00:03:29.560> have<00:03:29.769> a<00:03:29.950> block<00:03:30.280> on<00:03:30.489> top<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:30.849> there

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
can't have a block on top of there

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.479 
can't have a block on top of there
because<00:03:31.569> that<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:32.049> messes<00:03:32.200> with<00:03:32.530> this

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
because that just messes with this

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.789 
because that just messes with this
piston<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.569> can't<00:03:34.810> extract<00:03:35.230> it<00:03:35.380> this<00:03:35.560> way

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
piston and you can't extract it this way

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.250 
piston and you can't extract it this way
cuz<00:03:36.190> messes<00:03:37.060> with<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.299> other<00:03:37.450> piston<00:03:37.930> as<00:03:38.109> you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
cuz messes with the other piston as you

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.780 
cuz messes with the other piston as you
can<00:03:38.410> see<00:03:38.560> just<00:03:38.799> screws<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.310> whole<00:03:39.340> thing<00:03:39.639> up

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
can see just screws the whole thing up

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.900 
can see just screws the whole thing up
what<00:03:40.450> you'll<00:03:40.569> have<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.900> do<00:03:41.049> is<00:03:41.349> something

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
what you'll have to do is something

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.720 
what you'll have to do is something
involving<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:43.290> piston<00:03:44.290> on<00:03:44.410> top<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.859> a<00:03:44.950> torch<00:03:45.250> or

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
involving a piston on top of a torch or

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.080 
involving a piston on top of a torch or
some<00:03:46.209> other<00:03:47.370> method<00:03:48.370> that<00:03:48.400> doesn't<00:03:48.669> mess<00:03:48.940> with

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
some other method that doesn't mess with

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.720 
some other method that doesn't mess with
the<00:03:49.209> other<00:03:49.359> pistons<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:50.169> block<00:03:51.069> on<00:03:51.280> top<00:03:51.519> it

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
the other pistons a block on top it

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.640 
the other pistons a block on top it
pushes<00:03:52.150> it<00:03:52.239> up<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.450> stuff<00:03:53.019> like<00:03:53.169> that<00:03:53.349> it's

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
pushes it up and stuff like that it's

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.270 
pushes it up and stuff like that it's
I'd<00:03:54.130> be<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.639> little<00:03:55.090> difficult<00:03:56.280> perfectly

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
I'd be a little difficult perfectly

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.920 
I'd be a little difficult perfectly
possible<00:03:57.459> I'm<00:03:57.819> sure<00:03:57.849> but<00:03:58.269> I<00:03:58.419> didn't<00:03:58.630> want<00:03:58.810> to

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
possible I'm sure but I didn't want to

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.110 
possible I'm sure but I didn't want to
put<00:03:59.049> it<00:03:59.139> in<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.380> effort<00:03:59.769> to<00:03:59.919> do<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.120> sorry

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
put it in the effort to do it sorry

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.120 
put it in the effort to do it sorry
about<00:04:01.299> that<00:04:01.450> cut<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:01.959> started<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.620> do<00:04:02.739> something

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
about that cut I started to do something

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.569 
about that cut I started to do something
then<00:04:03.340> thought<00:04:03.910> better<00:04:04.090> of<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.329> so<00:04:05.160> that's<00:04:06.160> the

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
then thought better of it so that's the

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.220 
then thought better of it so that's the
end<00:04:06.970> of<00:04:07.180> what<00:04:07.359> I'm<00:04:07.480> going<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.900> show<00:04:08.019> you<00:04:08.049> in

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
end of what I'm going to show you in

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.559 
end of what I'm going to show you in
this<00:04:08.349> video<00:04:08.650> if<00:04:08.889> you<00:04:09.220> want<00:04:09.250> to<00:04:09.700> see<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.209> video<00:04:10.419> of

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
this video if you want to see a video of

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.770 
this video if you want to see a video of
me<00:04:10.900> build<00:04:11.290> one<00:04:11.950> of<00:04:12.040> these<00:04:12.129> quickly<00:04:12.609> just<00:04:13.239> ask

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
me build one of these quickly just ask

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.890 
me build one of these quickly just ask
for<00:04:14.079> it<00:04:14.169> in<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.290> comments<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:15.720> guess<00:04:16.720> that's

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
for it in the comments I guess that's

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.930 
for it in the comments I guess that's
all<00:04:17.019> so<00:04:17.680> this<00:04:18.130> has<00:04:18.250> been<00:04:18.430> redstone

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
all so this has been redstone

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.590 
all so this has been redstone
advancement<00:04:19.479> and<00:04:19.630> have<00:04:20.229> a<00:04:20.260> nice<00:04:20.440> day
