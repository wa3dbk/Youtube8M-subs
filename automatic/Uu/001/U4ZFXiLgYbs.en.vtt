 But let's wait and give a date. 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.110
 fixed 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.600
 now we take the breast out of the pan 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.310
 we put on the paper towel in the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.310

 mixing peppers let's wait for 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:47.700
 meat getting well blonde gets dirty Jorge 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.650
 that our overcoming of 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.770
 now we put the vehicle that we 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.770
 africans 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.850
 Now we put out the fire. 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.560
 we put the curd the curd 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.440
 to give alloy 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.110
 our ground beef now I will not let 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.190
 cool to room temperature 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.830
 environment 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.290
 then put it in the refrigerator while 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.280
 we will prepare the rest of the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.790
 recipe 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.120
 we will cut both ends Telo 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.040
 It can be with a kitchen knife even okay 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.220
 now we make a little pressure like this 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.989
 until we arrive in the warm and we open 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.680
 just as if you had peeled a 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.680
 orange 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.519
 and if you want to buy olive already 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:41.540
 open it is so then we cut 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.540
 this plant here 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:46.519
 we open it up from the side 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:57.180
 we take the stuff we do not go 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:59.060
 use it and it becomes that fine and 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.040
 it gets thicker 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.299
 We're going to make this one finer here. 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.829
 which is more common than having words at home 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.700
 now we'll do it like this with all 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.769
 they 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.949
 we are finishing taking the 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.959
 Cardozo of these readers 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:18.439
 It was quick, people look at fuel. 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.359
 peeling orange 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:25.579
 We will prepare the ingredients for 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:28.439
 but we beat the games like that 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.640
 now we put two tablespoons of 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:33.550
 milk 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.430
 if you want you can put it here 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.220
 opt for applied pepper salt 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.170
 we leave the filling in the refrigerator that 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.200
 is a little pain and was the lady 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.800
 which is easier to make the balls 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.860
 we take a small spoon and we do 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.530
 so with the hands tightening as if 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.780
 to make a little ball 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.730
 so do not leave it in the refrigerator for 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.910
 be able to give consistency when 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.630
 the polka dots it warm no signal 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.050
 now we pick up olives and put the 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.680
 ball in here and we're squeezing 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:15.220
 so we do not close the olive 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.390
 we left open and even this part of 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:22.890
 up that stays open and stays so looks 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.890
 now we put in the wheat flour 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.680
 twice in the flour 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.140
 Look how we stand, let's do it. 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.970
 so now with real plants 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.760
 now we're going to put the oil to 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.190
 warm up and we will respect the 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.930
 we can not put the fry in the 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.460
 very hot oil, not because otherwise 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.740
 burning oil and neither friedman pond a 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:11.140
 tip is our small one with a spoon of 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:14.800
 put in the pot and good mood and 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.800
 roca that is already in the ideal point 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.400
 this painting will be fast because the 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.240
 stuffing already cooked is just to brown 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.240
 reincarnated 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.610
 the rapid people are in the photo 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.670

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.230
 remainder we are finishing up 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.440
