00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 here are the drivers they are adding 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:10.889
 on the starting grid race 1 pit 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.870
 bike ixfin 125 4 stroke front row with the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.240
 second time of the day at number 93 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.670
 luca carminati now come to his 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.400
 alongside the championship leader Gianluca 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 cup number 78 and then always first 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.980
 row but third gabriele camorra traffic light 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.990
 let it be false people starting a little 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.699
 we're all going to see if they will be there 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.759
 sanctions but what is certain is that 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.829
 Gianluca Q Tip has already taken the lead 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.370
 suffered the attack of the Camorra, however, that 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.270
 we reviewed very concentrated immediately 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.230
 also that of reconnaissance but puts a 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.960
 Quick bite propeller must open for strength 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.930
 air-distance curve must then 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.870
 slow down for can be screened of 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.610
 new acceleration on the straight 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.670
 riders who are about to reach on 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.890
 starting retina of a knee in 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.739
 perfect motard style in order 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.080
 cutitta number 78 carmine number 93 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.610
 camorra number 33 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.310
 right now he lost slightly 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.420
 the contact is actually undergoing the attack 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.700
 of alessandro fabbri the number 41 and alle 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.870
 we have luigi lauro behind 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.670
 the number 11 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.670
 on the head quintet 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:32.000
 praise in carina very carmine 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:36.980
 fast is not leaving room for 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.230
 cutitta trying to pull out number 11 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.890
 hike on the meadow now falls all over 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.650
 ok 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.750
 again at odds with la 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.720
 morgia lauro camorra who turns around 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.890
 look to the left to run 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.440
 full 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.570
 then it accelerates up to 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.950
 curve to the right to go through more gas 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.800
 wide open to attack in the test fabri 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.770
 straight start with the quartet 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.080
 still compact smiths tried one 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.649
 card that failed but 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.369
 they are all there to the limit they are pulling at 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.980
 all 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.870
 the pilots are in the course of the sixth lap 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.450
 that I carmine that he is preparing 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.640
 the attack inside but cutitta tightens 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.910
 tightens the trajectory there is no space 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:29.110
 for no attention last curve 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:32.810
 chess flag and then in order 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.530
 the second is already pinging 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.620
 position then of luca carminati towards 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.519
 the use of gabriele camorra fourth 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.730
 alessandro fabbri race 2 category 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.360
 pitbike xp 125 4 stroke therefore 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.360
 resume 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.840
 the reins of the race program we have 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.629
 saw a quartet in race 2 and we hope 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.810
 to see him again on the first race e 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.930
 we hope to see him again in race 2 the first 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:09.360
 row crucifix carminati camorra if me 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:13.260
 they offer ready-made indeed we have seen 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:18.120
 perhaps anticipated shot of cuttitta that 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.730
 however it leaves way to the rest of the 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:26.280
 group and should be camorra al 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:30.950
 command now let's go see pilots who 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.950
 face the return phase chicane 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.260
 most likely it is not really 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.970
 acute carmine conflict in front 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.700
 third camorra then the group remains 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:49.680
 unchanged in the order we will then go to 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.340
 see there will have been some 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:04:02.100
 false start or not in the meantime 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:05.480
 attention for carmine flights resumes 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.040
 the most classic of falls on 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.300
 on the asphalt we hope nothing serious 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.370
 meanwhile on the straight the luca cuttitta 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.330
 gabriele ca morgia with them 33 then 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:23.970
 alessandro fabbri number 41 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:27.900
 in third position then fall for 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.410
 luca carminati thrown out of 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.950
 curve 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.979
 we are and for memories trh perhaps fabrizio i 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:40.350
 Mammamia trajectories lose grip 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:41.820
 both now seem to be side by side 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.490
 but nothing to do 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.520
 we are at the checkered flag wins 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.440
 cutitta and hour worked strength sow e 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.260
 fabri and check with the second 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.270
 position still gabriele camorra number 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.270
 33 third Alessandro Fabbri 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.539
 gianluca cutitta a brace 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.479
 amazing today here in ortona and ai 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.849
 stretched in the league standings yes 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.150
 both race 1 and race 2 I won all and 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:12.009
 two 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.569
 race 1 had a little more difficulty 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:17.080
 because I had problems with a 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.690
 brake my teammate luca 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.520
 carmine, sick of a hard wire 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.340
 instead in race 2 I fixed the 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.770
 brake problem and I won by margin 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.900
 of 3 seconds 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.639
 I dedicate this victory to a colleague of mine 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.610
 which unfortunately no longer exists 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.880
 michael and his family who are him 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.880
 very close
