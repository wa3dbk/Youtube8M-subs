00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.720 

these<00:00:19.050> two<00:00:19.260> faced<00:00:19.500> off<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.949> few<00:00:19.980> hours<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
these two faced off in a few hours and

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.490 
these two faced off in a few hours and
the<00:00:21.270> doll<00:00:21.449> has<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> great<00:00:21.990> head-to-head

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the doll has a great head-to-head

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.590 
the doll has a great head-to-head
matchup<00:00:22.980> against<00:00:23.609> kohlschreiber<00:00:24.119> which<00:00:24.420> is

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
matchup against kohlschreiber which is

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.300 
matchup against kohlschreiber which is
probably<00:00:24.930> spelled<00:00:25.500> correctly<00:00:25.680> not<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> hundred

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
probably spelled correctly not a hundred

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.000 
probably spelled correctly not a hundred
percent<00:00:26.430> sure<00:00:26.699> he's<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> no<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.500> that's

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
percent sure he's for a no and that's

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.710 
percent sure he's for a no and that's
largely<00:00:29.340> due<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.970> fact<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.359> Cole

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
largely due to the fact that Cole

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.900 
largely due to the fact that Cole
Shriver<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.349> not<00:00:32.040> going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.489> pressure

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
Shriver is not going to really pressure

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.639 
Shriver is not going to really pressure
an<00:00:33.120> adult<00:00:33.480> ooh<00:00:33.719> much<00:00:33.960> kohlschreiber<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.559> only

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
an adult ooh much kohlschreiber is only

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.950 
an adult ooh much kohlschreiber is only
about<00:00:34.800> 5-10<00:00:35.160> he's<00:00:35.640> not<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> big<00:00:36.120> hitter<00:00:36.390> he's

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
about 5-10 he's not a big hitter he's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.830 
about 5-10 he's not a big hitter he's
not<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.410> Juan<00:00:38.010> Martin<00:00:38.370> del<00:00:38.399> Potro<00:00:38.840> who

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
not like Juan Martin del Potro who

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.889 
not like Juan Martin del Potro who
really<00:00:40.260> blew<00:00:40.829> Nadal<00:00:41.309> off<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.820> court<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.300> last

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
really blew Nadal off the court at last

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.049 
really blew Nadal off the court at last
year's<00:00:43.260> US<00:00:43.469> open<00:00:44.010> closed<00:00:44.190> driver<00:00:44.460> can't<00:00:44.789> do

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
year's US open closed driver can't do

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.790 
year's US open closed driver can't do
that<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.930> Nadal<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.320> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.559> able<00:00:46.739> to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
that so Nadal is going to be able to

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.080 
that so Nadal is going to be able to
play<00:00:46.920> his<00:00:47.129> game<00:00:47.340> he's<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.850> able<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
play his game he's going to be able to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.819 
play his game he's going to be able to
really<00:00:48.600> work<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.989> ball<00:00:49.140> around<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.530> court

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
really work the ball around the court

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.799 
really work the ball around the court
and<00:00:50.039> not<00:00:50.070> worry<00:00:50.820> about<00:00:50.910> Kohlschreiber

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and not worry about Kohlschreiber

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.770 
and not worry about Kohlschreiber
uncorking<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.129> take<00:00:53.820> control<00:00:54.210> or<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.629> hit

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
uncorking one to take control or to hit

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.290 
uncorking one to take control or to hit
a<00:00:54.809> winner<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.770> expect<00:00:56.309> an<00:00:56.640> adult<00:00:57.000> ooh<00:00:57.149> win

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300

a winner so I expect an adult ooh win
this<00:00:57.480> match<00:00:58.230> relatively<00:00:59.100> easily<00:00:59.280> probably

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
this match relatively easily probably

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.000 
this match relatively easily probably
straight<00:01:00.329> sets<00:01:00.660> now<00:01:01.379> there's<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.710> few<00:01:01.859> things

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
straight sets now there's a few things

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.470 
straight sets now there's a few things
we<00:01:02.160> want<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.460> look<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.030> regard<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
we want to look for with regard to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.080 
we want to look for with regard to
Nadal's<00:01:04.320> forehand<00:01:05.010> because<00:01:05.670> how<00:01:05.880> he's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
Nadal's forehand because how he's

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.490 
Nadal's forehand because how he's
hitting<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.450> shot<00:01:06.750> well<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.409> to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
hitting that shot well it's going to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.770 
hitting that shot well it's going to
serve<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:08.010> an<00:01:08.430> indicator<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:08.970> how<00:01:09.360> well<00:01:09.600> he's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
serve as an indicator for how well he's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630 
serve as an indicator for how well he's
going<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.200> later<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> tournament

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
going to do later in the tournament

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.190 
going to do later in the tournament
there's<00:01:11.970> two<00:01:12.180> things<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.570> want<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.810> look<00:01:12.930> for

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
there's two things we want to look for

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560 
there's two things we want to look for
and<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.830> first<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.280> whether<00:01:15.000> or<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.330> in

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
and the first is whether or not in

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.690 
and the first is whether or not in
adults<00:01:15.810> forehand<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> penetrating<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> court

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
adults forehand is penetrating the court

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.030 
adults forehand is penetrating the court
whether<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.720> sitting<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.409> an<00:01:19.650> opponent

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
whether it's sitting up and an opponent

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.010 
whether it's sitting up and an opponent
can<00:01:20.130> attack<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:20.759> whether<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.720> really

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
can attack it or whether it's really

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.780 
can attack it or whether it's really
moving<00:01:22.229> through<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> court<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.580> would<00:01:23.670> be

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
moving through the court and it would be

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.920 
moving through the court and it would be
one<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.000> those<00:01:24.090> four<00:01:24.360> hands<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.750> kind<00:01:24.900> of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
one of those four hands that kind of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.649 
one of those four hands that kind of
pushes<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.470> back<00:01:25.650> now<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> second<00:01:27.240> thing<00:01:27.270> we

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
pushes you back now the second thing we

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.600 
pushes you back now the second thing we
want<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> look<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.290> directional<00:01:29.220> control

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
want to look for is directional control

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
want to look for is directional control
when<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.299> doll<00:01:30.540> swore<00:01:30.780> hand<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.439> can

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
when the doll swore hand is on you can

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.200 
when the doll swore hand is on you can
put<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> ball<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.340> dime<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:32.970> put<00:01:33.119> it

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
put that ball on a dime you can put it

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.149 
put that ball on a dime you can put it
wherever<00:01:33.299> he<00:01:33.659> wants<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.829> we<00:01:34.920> think<00:01:34.950> back

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
wherever he wants and if we think back

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.980 
wherever he wants and if we think back
to<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> wimbledon<00:01:36.030> final<00:01:36.420> where<00:01:36.570> he<00:01:36.659> took<00:01:36.810> out

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
to the wimbledon final where he took out

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899 
to the wimbledon final where he took out
Federer<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:38.009> was<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.400> those<00:01:38.460> instances

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
Federer that was one of those instances

what<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> was<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.049> talking<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.799> before<00:01:56.399> we

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
what I was just talking about before we

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.090 
what I was just talking about before we
get<00:01:56.850> going<00:01:56.909> these<00:01:57.689> icons<00:01:58.259> circle<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.070> the

get going these icons circle is the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.490

players body stick as the side they are

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.590 
players body stick as the side they are
hitting<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.159> for<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> righty<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:03.329> would<00:02:03.509> be

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
hitting on so for a righty this would be

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.810 
hitting on so for a righty this would be
a<00:02:03.630> righties<00:02:04.049> forehand<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:05.250> since<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> doll

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
a righties forehand but since the doll

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.010 
a righties forehand but since the doll
is<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> lefty<00:02:06.360> we're<00:02:06.509> pretending<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.960> is

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
is a lefty we're pretending this is

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.260 
is a lefty we're pretending this is
Nadal<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.550> be<00:02:08.670> as<00:02:08.789> for<00:02:09.030> hand

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
Nadal this is going to be as for hand

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.140 
Nadal this is going to be as for hand
over<00:02:10.170> here<00:02:10.410> now<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.640> first<00:02:11.790> thing<00:02:11.940> we're

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
over here now the first thing we're

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.680 
over here now the first thing we're
talking<00:02:12.480> about<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.989> forehand<00:02:13.319> pen

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
talking about is the forehand pen

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.390 
talking about is the forehand pen
trading<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.020> court<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:14.980> simply<00:02:15.370> means

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
trading the court and this simply means

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.990 
trading the court and this simply means
does<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.450> forehand<00:02:16.900> land<00:02:17.800> short<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.370> sit<00:02:18.850> up

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
does the forehand land short and sit up

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.600 
does the forehand land short and sit up
or<00:02:19.650> does<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.680> maybe<00:02:20.920> land<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.250> little<00:02:21.370> bit

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
or does it maybe land a little bit

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.450 
or does it maybe land a little bit
deeper<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.650> push<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.860> back<00:02:24.070> was<00:02:24.430> the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
deeper and push you back was the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.450 
deeper and push you back was the
terminology<00:02:25.240> I<00:02:25.420> used<00:02:25.990> earlier<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.710> if<00:02:27.310> this

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
terminology I used earlier and if this

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.210 
terminology I used earlier and if this
is<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.880> doll's<00:02:28.390> opponent<00:02:29.290> if<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.800> ball<00:02:29.950> doesn't

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
is a doll's opponent if the ball doesn't

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.220 
is a doll's opponent if the ball doesn't
penetrate<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.880> court<00:02:31.120> then<00:02:31.690> they<00:02:31.870> can<00:02:32.050> move

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
penetrate the court then they can move

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.290 
penetrate the court then they can move
in<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:33.600> probably<00:02:34.600> attack<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.320> shot<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:36.070> if

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
in and probably attack that shot but if

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.850 
in and probably attack that shot but if
the<00:02:37.300> ball<00:02:37.480> does<00:02:37.840> penetrate<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.530> court<00:02:38.770> in

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
the ball does penetrate the court in

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.800 
the ball does penetrate the court in
adults<00:02:39.040> forehand<00:02:39.610> then<00:02:40.210> they<00:02:40.420> get<00:02:40.540> pushed

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
adults forehand then they get pushed

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.260 
adults forehand then they get pushed
back<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.410> they're<00:02:42.190> in<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.460> more<00:02:42.670> defensive

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
back and they're in a more defensive

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.380 
back and they're in a more defensive
spot<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.760> first<00:02:45.910> thing<00:02:46.090> we<00:02:46.300> want

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
spot so that's the first thing we want

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.500 
spot so that's the first thing we want
to<00:02:46.510> look<00:02:46.570> for<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.800> second<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.370> like<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.420> was

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
to look for and the second is like I was

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.570 
to look for and the second is like I was
saying<00:02:49.750> before<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.680> directional<00:02:51.190> control

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
saying before the directional control

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.620 
saying before the directional control
the<00:02:52.390> doll<00:02:52.600> wants<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.050> keep<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.290> ball<00:02:53.560> out<00:02:53.770> of

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
the doll wants to keep the ball out of

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.420 
the doll wants to keep the ball out of
this<00:02:56.190> basic<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.550> general<00:02:58.030> area<00:02:58.210> and

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
this basic this general area and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.860 
this basic this general area and
sometimes<00:03:00.430> your<00:03:00.880> forehand<00:03:01.270> doesn't<00:03:01.600> have<00:03:01.720> to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
sometimes your forehand doesn't have to

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.990 
sometimes your forehand doesn't have to
penetrate<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.410> court<00:03:02.680> if<00:03:02.860> you've<00:03:03.430> angled<00:03:03.880> it

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
penetrate the court if you've angled it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.530 
penetrate the court if you've angled it
well<00:03:04.180> if<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.660> land<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.200> ball<00:03:05.350> here<00:03:06.360> maybe<00:03:07.360> on

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
well if you land the ball here maybe on

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.900 
well if you land the ball here maybe on
the<00:03:07.720> service<00:03:08.200> line<00:03:08.410> but<00:03:09.250> you're<00:03:09.430> pulling<00:03:09.790> your

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
the service line but you're pulling your

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.520 
the service line but you're pulling your
opponent<00:03:10.270> off<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.390> court<00:03:10.750> that's<00:03:11.020> just<00:03:11.350> fine

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
opponent off the court that's just fine

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.830 
opponent off the court that's just fine
landing<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:12.280> short<00:03:12.550> creates<00:03:12.880> more<00:03:13.420> angle

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
landing in short creates more angle

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.720 
landing in short creates more angle
they'll<00:03:13.990> be<00:03:14.110> in<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.290> alleys<00:03:15.100> maybe<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
they'll be in the alleys maybe the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.400 
they'll be in the alleys maybe the
bleacher<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.240> when<00:03:16.420> they<00:03:16.540> hit<00:03:16.690> that<00:03:16.900> shot<00:03:17.200> and

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
bleacher is when they hit that shot and

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.479 
bleacher is when they hit that shot and
you're<00:03:17.560> going<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.739> be<00:03:17.860> in<00:03:17.890> control<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.370> that

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
you're going to be in control of that

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.790 
you're going to be in control of that
point<00:03:18.820> but<00:03:19.810> if<00:03:19.900> we<00:03:19.989> go<00:03:20.170> back<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.590> what<00:03:20.709> I<00:03:20.739> was
