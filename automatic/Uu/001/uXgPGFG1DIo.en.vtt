 hey people get to my new video 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.490
 Here in the video I would like to show you 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:12.330
 as you the software update 2.0 on the 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:15.269
 cx 9 100 or 1 100 from sony raise 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.070
 so we can do that before we update here too 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.779
 we have to be able to play on the camera 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.410
 first in the camera something 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.019
 to adjust 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.180
 We go to menu and choose the menu 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.619
 installation here we scroll to 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.239
 down to the menu point 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.300
 Find usb port settings 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.980
 Who usually auto-auto 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.719
 we have to change that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.079
 We click that and choose here 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.250
 mass store that is 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.780
 memory drives is a memory on 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.449
 work that your camera like a kind 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.570
 hard disk can use and confirm 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.640
 the whole with ok that they are behind 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.550
 Also inside and inside 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.899
 That's how we prepared the camera 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.149
 So next you call the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.409
 website of sony on the two 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.760
 I have you down in the web pages 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.310
 video description is linked 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.340
 in each case before that for the cx 9 100 or for 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.909
 the x100e there you will find the respective 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.380
 update you just download the update 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.030
 Just look at it now 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.130
 on my monitor 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.650
 Here we have the button right here 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.930
 just go ahead and download the update 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.880
 so now its the update 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.950
 I can only roughly explain to you 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.290
 what the update is about 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.310
 we had the problem with the focus 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.530
 the cx-9 100 ezb or even the x100 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.460
 that the focus is a bit sluggish 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.540
 was and not really 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.850
 could decide 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.200
 what he focuses on and how long he does it 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.750
 She became focused in this 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.720
 updated data I hope that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.000
 We, like, from the focus or focus 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.990
 speed are like the x10 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.729
 that would be very good 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.040
 Let's see what the update 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.990
 In this regard brings the update is 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.930
 Now we downloaded click here 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.210
 then run this monitor 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.969
 with further instructions how to proceed 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.469
 before we have the camera with the 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.270
 we have to supply the update 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.979
 First of all, prepare the camera 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.260
 means we open here press this usb 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.120
 connection 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.780
 have us plug in our usb and 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.400
 connect the camera to the pc now 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.890
 we open the side monitor here 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.110
 so we can see him and 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.569
 see that the camera with the pc 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.849
 now we can have been connected 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.900
 again in our installation software 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.940
 go in and click here now 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.470
 Continue to be important before moving on 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.690
 makes looks that your camera over a 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.730
 fully charged battery and if you have 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.290
 makes sure you want to play it safe 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.950
 this update from a laptop 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.909
 should the power from here almost 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.519
 fail or something else with 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.650
 Of course, your pc is yours 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.950
 Camera messed up so should here 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.810
 highest care be exercised 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.250
 because otherwise something really goes here 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.440
 tremendously wrong and I have the camera 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.940
 completely dirty because of that, I recommend 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.859
 everyone else in the background 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.900
 to finish running programs before 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.340
 this update executes the program 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.599
 has now as we see the camera here 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.370
 found and now would like please 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.810
 check which firmware versions in the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.909
 moment is installed on this camera 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.220
 We confirm this with further we see 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.370
 we have the version 1.0 on this 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.540
 camera and want the perversion 2.0 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.910
 to have 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.440
 We confirm this with further here 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.160
 we should remove the hardware safely 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.370
 you can go to the menu item 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.090
 remove hardware on your pc and 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.250
 just remove this camcorder 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.799
 click eject and cycle path to now 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.230
 to be removed so the camera was 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:45.049
 away now is in the camera why 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.030
 can one be initialized around the we 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.980
 to activate it click okay we have 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.870
 a touchscreen so click on 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.940
 ok so the camera screen is 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.129
 now we can go in here 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.659
 our installation manager 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.440
 work by just continuing on 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.659
 click 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.760
 the program only tries connections 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:05.810
 the camera has to take the camera 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.790
 found and we start the update like that 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.260
 Here you should take your time 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.409
 because sometimes these updates take 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.629
 extremely long I would be here 5 to 15 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.680
 minutes minimum plan so one more 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.389
 important point now 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.060
 Of course the update is going trendy too 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.829
 please not the camera from the pc and let 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.389
 they just confess nicely in dormant 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.180
 does nothing does not play drum 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.770
 around 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.050
 As I said, it can be huge 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.630
 go wrong so the update is now 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.440
 finished and then we just click here 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:39.750
 At the end take our camera disconnect 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.900
 you from the system and just start 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.530
 New in we just go to the camera 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.120
 to open again 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.800
 and here we come the home screen 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.000
 have to set up the camera again 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.360
