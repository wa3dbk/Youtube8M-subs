tofu is made in a very similar way to
cheese<00:01:05.489> actually<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.630> made<00:01:06.810> by<00:01:06.960> curling

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
cheese actually so it's made by curling

the<00:01:07.650> soy<00:01:07.830> milk<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.729> coagulant<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.750> it's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the soy milk with a coagulant so it's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.380 
the soy milk with a coagulant so it's
got<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> cheese<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.650> consistency<00:01:11.240> when<00:01:12.240> it's

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
got a cheese like consistency when it's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.210 
got a cheese like consistency when it's
stored<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.780> water<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.409> has<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.010> water

below the cooling rack so that you don't

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.969 
below the cooling rack so that you don't
keep<00:01:44.909> capturing<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.689> water<00:01:45.960> some<00:01:46.710> people

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
keep capturing that water some people

press their tofu between two plates that
doesn't<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.799> anything

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
doesn't do anything

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.960 
doesn't do anything
or<00:01:50.439> yeah<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:50.890> just<00:01:51.070> keeps<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.520> water<00:01:51.670> at<00:01:51.880> the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
or yeah that just keeps the water at the

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.640 
or yeah that just keeps the water at the
bottom<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.450> tofu<00:01:52.780> take<00:01:53.259> your<00:01:53.409> block<00:01:53.619> of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
tofu go ahead and put it on your cooling

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.230 
tofu go ahead and put it on your cooling
rack<00:01:56.439> and<00:01:56.680> put<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.220> plate<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.820> then<00:01:58.090> whatever

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
rack and put the plate and then whatever

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.270 
rack and put the plate and then whatever
weight<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.659> have<00:01:58.810> right<00:01:59.320> on<00:01:59.440> top<00:01:59.680> of<00:01:59.830> that<00:01:59.950> and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
weight you have right on top of that and

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.609 
weight you have right on top of that and
you'll<00:02:01.119> start<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.509> immediately<00:02:02.110> see<00:02:02.470> the

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
you'll start to immediately see the

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.130 
you'll start to immediately see the
water<00:02:02.860> dripping<00:02:03.610> out<00:02:03.909> of<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.240> bottom<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.930> the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
water dripping out of the bottom of the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.440 
water dripping out of the bottom of the
tofu<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.399> reason<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.759> don't<00:02:07.060> want<00:02:07.299> to

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
tofu so the reason you don't want to

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.809 
tofu so the reason you don't want to
squish<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.080> tofu<00:02:08.470> with<00:02:08.619> your<00:02:08.800> hands<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.550> press

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
squish the tofu with your hands to press

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.970 
squish the tofu with your hands to press
it<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.209> because<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:10.869> can<00:02:11.020> break<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:11.709> unless

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
it is because you can break it so unless

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.380 
it is because you can break it so unless
you're<00:02:12.190> making<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.489> tofu<00:02:12.670> scramble<00:02:13.209> where

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
you're making a tofu scramble where

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.610 
you're making a tofu scramble where
you're<00:02:13.540> just<00:02:13.690> going<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.870> go<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.080> town<00:02:14.350> and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
you're just going to go to town and

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.590 
you're just going to go to town and
break<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.010> all<00:02:15.130> up<00:02:15.160> with<00:02:15.430> your<00:02:15.580> hands<00:02:16.000> then<00:02:16.569> you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
break it all up with your hands then you

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.080 
break it all up with your hands then you
just<00:02:16.959> want<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.200> press<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.470> carefully<00:02:18.430> with<00:02:18.940> the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
just want to press it carefully with the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.350 
just want to press it carefully with the
weight<00:02:19.270> on<00:02:19.900> top<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.010> process<00:02:21.370> really

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
weight on top so this process really

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.229 
weight on top so this process really
takes<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:23.019> good<00:02:23.260> 5-10<00:02:24.220> minutes<00:02:24.640> depending<00:02:25.120> on

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
takes a good 5-10 minutes depending on

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.720 
takes a good 5-10 minutes depending on
your<00:02:25.300> firmness<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:26.230> your<00:02:26.380> tofu<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:27.400> can't

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
your firmness of your tofu you can't

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.850 
your firmness of your tofu you can't
press<00:02:28.090> silken<00:02:28.600> tofu<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.319> just<00:02:29.620> want<00:02:29.830> to

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
press silken tofu so you just want to

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.120 
press silken tofu so you just want to
press<00:02:30.100> your<00:02:30.250> firm<00:02:30.519> tofu<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:32.319> takes<00:02:32.950> some

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
press your firm tofu and this takes some

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.420 
press your firm tofu and this takes some
time<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.670> it's<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.150> little<00:02:34.300> bit<00:02:34.510> unsteady<00:02:35.430> so

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
time and it's a little bit unsteady so

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.800 
time and it's a little bit unsteady so
there<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.790> an<00:02:36.970> alternative<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.569> was

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
there is an alternative that was

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.870 
there is an alternative that was
invented<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.739> other<00:02:38.950> way<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.280> we<00:02:39.519> deal<00:02:39.850> with

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
invented the other way that we deal with

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.030 
invented the other way that we deal with
pressing<00:02:40.360> tofu<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:41.050> with<00:02:41.260> something<00:02:41.769> called<00:02:41.890> a

comes<00:03:20.739> off<00:03:20.980> of<00:03:21.040> this<00:03:21.280> tofu<00:03:21.670> it's<00:03:21.820> pretty

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
comes off of this tofu it's pretty

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.910 
comes off of this tofu it's pretty
incredible<00:03:22.180> if<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:22.959> love<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:23.290> press<00:03:23.620> for

incredible if you love this press for

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.800 
incredible if you love this press for
even<00:03:24.250> an<00:03:24.400> hour<00:03:24.609> it's<00:03:24.820> just<00:03:25.480> going<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.690> get

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
even an hour it's just going to get

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.599 
even an hour it's just going to get
smaller<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.320> smaller<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.920> smaller<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.430> more

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
dense so it really depends on the kind

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
a little more meat like so you can use

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.550 
a little more meat like so you can use

too and then you don't have to freeze
and<00:04:03.970> then<00:04:04.120> defrost<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:04.900> then<00:04:05.050> we<00:04:05.650> all

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
on a regular basis we definitely think

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.430 
on a regular basis we definitely think

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
regularly so we've only been pressing

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.830 
regularly so we've only been pressing
this<00:04:15.100> for<00:04:15.340> about<00:04:15.430> three<00:04:15.880> minutes<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:16.540> look<00:04:16.690> at

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
this for about three minutes and look at

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.720 
this for about three minutes and look at
all<00:04:17.050> that<00:04:17.380> liquid<00:04:17.680> that's<00:04:18.040> risen<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:18.580> the<00:04:18.700> top

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
all that liquid that's risen to the top

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.520 
all that liquid that's risen to the top
of<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.210> tofu<00:04:19.510> Express<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:22.140> if<00:04:23.140> we<00:04:23.350> were<00:04:23.470> to

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
of the tofu Express and if we were to

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.350 
of the tofu Express and if we were to
let<00:04:23.740> this<00:04:23.890> go<00:04:24.130> for<00:04:24.340> another<00:04:24.490> ten<00:04:24.850> minutes<00:04:25.030> it

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
let this go for another ten minutes it

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.970 
let this go for another ten minutes it
would<00:04:25.510> probably<00:04:25.720> be<00:04:26.080> twice<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.650> amount<00:04:26.740> of

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
would probably be twice the amount of

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.160 
would probably be twice the amount of
that<00:04:27.130> liquid<00:04:27.370> our<00:04:27.790> tofu<00:04:28.150> Express<00:04:28.630> is<00:04:28.840> really

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
that liquid our tofu Express is really

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.650 
that liquid our tofu Express is really
handy<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:29.890> it<00:04:30.340> does<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.730> job<00:04:30.970> and<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.450> presses

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
handy and it does the job and it presses

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.930 
handy and it does the job and it presses
our<00:04:31.960> tofu<00:04:32.320> really<00:04:32.590> nicely<00:04:32.800> but<00:04:33.520> if<00:04:33.640> you<00:04:33.730> don't

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
plate and the grading and the weight on

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.220 
plate and the grading and the weight on
there<00:04:39.010> is<00:04:39.250> totally<00:04:39.970> easy<00:04:40.150> really<00:04:40.750> doable

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
there is totally easy really doable
