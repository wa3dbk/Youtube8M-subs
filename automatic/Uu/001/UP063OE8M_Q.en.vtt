00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
right here you have this line right here

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.660 
right here you have this line right here
on<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.780> lens<00:00:48.989> for<00:00:49.110> example<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.800> most<00:00:50.430> lenses

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
on this lens for example and most lenses

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.090 
on this lens for example and most lenses
this<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.329> all<00:00:51.420> setting<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.809> 300<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.829> have

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
this is all setting to 300 they have

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.130 
this is all setting to 300 they have
this<00:00:53.340> line<00:00:53.610> right<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.960> will

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
this line right here so this will

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.930 
this line right here so this will
actually<00:00:55.559> attach<00:00:56.180> to<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.710> part<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.760> when

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
actually attach to to that part so when

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
actually attach to to that part so when
you<00:01:00.030> attach<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:05.119> okay<00:01:06.150> I'll<00:01:06.420> touch<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.900> that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you attach it on okay I'll touch to that

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.760 
you attach it on okay I'll touch to that
part<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> does<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.180> screw<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:10.320> example

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
part so it does not screw in for example

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.649 
part so it does not screw in for example
for<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.040> type<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.340> lens<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.670> 50<00:01:11.939> millimeter

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
for this type of lens of 50 millimeter

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.570 
for this type of lens of 50 millimeter
prime<00:01:12.930> lens<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.710> no<00:01:14.070> choice<00:01:14.280> actually

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
prime lens you have no choice actually

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
prime lens you have no choice actually
because<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.090> doesn't<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.380> you

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
because it doesn't have that so as you

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.530 
because it doesn't have that so as you
can<00:01:16.560> see<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> lens<00:01:17.070> he<00:01:17.250> doesn't<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
can see in the lens he doesn't have that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.920 
can see in the lens he doesn't have that
mark<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.880> now<00:01:20.880> most<00:01:21.360> lenses<00:01:21.630> do
