00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
is going to be a touchpad which is going

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.910 
is going to be a touchpad which is going
to<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.690> very<00:01:12.720> similar<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> touch<00:01:13.560> Pettis

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
to be very similar to the touch Pettis

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.350 
to be very similar to the touch Pettis
on<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> back<00:01:14.190> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> PS<00:01:14.670> Vita<00:01:14.909> where<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.240> now

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
on the back of the PS Vita where you now

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.550 
on the back of the PS Vita where you now
you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.720> able<00:01:15.870> to<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.020> gestures<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you can be able to do gestures and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560 
you can be able to do gestures and
things<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.340> games<00:01:17.790> also<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.510> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
things like that in games also going to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.180 
things like that in games also going to
have<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.870> light<00:01:19.200> port<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.710> will<00:01:19.860> work<00:01:20.010> in

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
have this light port that will work in

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.380 
have this light port that will work in
conjunction<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.850> camera<00:01:21.210> that's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
conjunction with a camera that's

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
conjunction with a camera that's
compatible<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.050> ps4<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.070> they<00:01:23.220> can

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
compatible with the ps4 so they can

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.710 
compatible with the ps4 so they can
actually<00:01:23.610> identify<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.390> particular

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
actually identify that particular

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.209 
actually identify that particular
controller<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.380> also<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.710> yours<00:01:25.920> should<00:01:26.070> be

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
controller and also to yours should be

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.440 
controller and also to yours should be
able<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.399> do<00:01:26.460> some<00:01:26.670> type<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.820> motion<00:01:27.149> gaming

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
able to do some type of motion gaming

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
download the rest of it in the

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.910 
download the rest of it in the
background<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.170> there's<00:04:07.320> more<00:04:07.470> little<00:04:07.769> tweaks

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
background so there's more little tweaks

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.349 
background so there's more little tweaks
and<00:04:08.220> things<00:04:08.370> like<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.549> with<00:04:08.910> both<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.150> these

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
and things like that with both of these

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.699 
and things like that with both of these
systems<00:04:09.570> when<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:09.989> comes<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.380> software

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
systems when it comes to the software

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.440 
systems when it comes to the software
but<00:04:11.190> because<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.489> think<00:04:11.850> this<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.060> as<00:04:12.150> far<00:04:12.329> as

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
but because I think this is as far as

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.690 
but because I think this is as far as
the<00:04:12.600> pure<00:04:12.900> gaming<00:04:13.260> aspect<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:14.130> these<00:04:14.519> systems

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
the pure gaming aspect of these systems

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.130 
the pure gaming aspect of these systems
I<00:04:14.970> think<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.209> place<00:04:15.359> that<00:04:15.480> supports<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.930> little

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
I think the place that supports a little

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.509 
I think the place that supports a little
bit<00:04:16.229> of<00:04:16.320> him<00:04:16.440> right<00:04:16.829> now<00:04:16.859> from<00:04:17.190> what<00:04:17.340> we've

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
bit of him right now from what we've

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.710 
bit of him right now from what we've
seen<00:04:17.549> I'm<00:04:18.000> about<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.299> get<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.539> software

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
seen I'm about to get the software

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.170 
seen I'm about to get the software

from<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.400> xbox<00:04:23.789> one<00:04:24.030> event<00:04:24.330> I<00:04:24.450> was<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.780> little

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
from the xbox one event I was a little

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.300 
from the xbox one event I was a little
let<00:04:25.200> down<00:04:25.229> from<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.620> games<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:25.919> they<00:04:26.100> showed

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.510 
off I mean I mean they some of them
would<00:04:27.870> look<00:04:28.020> pretty<00:04:28.229> decent<00:04:28.710> but<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.340> one

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
would look pretty decent but the one

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.860 
would look pretty decent but the one
main<00:04:29.760> game<00:04:30.060> that<00:04:30.300> they<00:04:30.390> really<00:04:30.600> showed<00:04:30.750> off

really<00:05:11.680> show<00:05:11.890> what<00:05:11.920> this<00:05:12.220> system<00:05:12.520> can<00:05:12.670> do

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
really show what this system can do

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
talked about what the system can do they

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.090 
talked about what the system can do they
showed<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:16.990> hardware<00:05:17.410> but<00:05:17.620> from<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.890> games
