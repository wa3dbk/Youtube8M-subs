00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:06.010
 in this first special how we 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.810
 we manufacture we travel to Extremadura for 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.510
 discover how we give that unique flavor 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.220
 to the Iberian ham we visited Toledo 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.920
 see how the Spanish guitar is made 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.720
 to finish we take you to pineapple well 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.859
 to know the traditional elaboration 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.859
 of cheese 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.810
 to discover the origins of ham 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.970
 Iberian would have to travel in the 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.130
 time until the year 1200 before Christ 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.750
 a boar came to the banks of 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.790
 Mediterranean and its way through the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.350
 peninsula was crossing with different 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.090
 breeds of term 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.460
 As a result of these meetings, we have today 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.079
 extraordinary ham and see a product 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.699
 essential in the refrigerators of our 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.219
 country that has been paid for 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.440
 up to four thousand euros but how many 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.299
 hams we consume now so first 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.790
 had that about 56 million two million 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.580
 of hams 30 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.680
 I think so if each pig has 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.479
 two legs me through which are the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.500
 admonished paddle in front of two 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.299
 millions many plus 47 million in 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.460
 Spain , almost one ham is produced 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.490
 inhabitant one in ten corresponds 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.259
 to the king of the tapas the Iberian ham a 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.539
 delicacy that we will find in pieces or 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.539
 sliced ​​but how we make it 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.240
 everything starts here in the pasture 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.130
 Extremadura in this paradise the pig 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.540
 Iberian only has to do three things 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.060
 walk and eat acorns responsible for 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.890
 delicious 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.840
 their oils infiltrate the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.790
 muscles of the pig and form the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.610
 veined his flesh what makes the 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.799
 ham melt in the mouth the menu of the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.649
 pig is composed of 3000 acorns 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.289
 candy of first and second 1200 of 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.820
 cork tree to refresh some herbs and 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.820
 as a colophon a cabezadita 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.940
 at 20 weeks the pig reaches 260 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.940
 kilos the raw material is ready 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.800
 in perfectly sanitized trucks 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.630
 The fresh hams arrive at the 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.520
 Dryers are welcomed 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.170
 taking them the temperature and 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.000
 placing them on this tape where 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.820
 adds its particular documentation in the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.680
 banda a brief biography of the ham of 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.990
 where they come from and how long they have been 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.030
 in the time 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.160
 essential data so we can 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.550
 go next process the 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.800
 classification of the pieces 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.720
 each ham is assigned a gate with 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.940
 the objective that they be grouped in 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.620
 function of your resort a key step for 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.920
 know how much time must pass 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.170
 hams in the drying rooms in 24 hours 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.390
 homogenizes its temperature to 3 degrees in 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.770
 the tempering chambers 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.470
 fundamental if we do not want to run a 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.730
 great risk but to be at three degrees the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.590
 salt will not be able to fulfill its mission 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.880
 penetrate the flesh and kill any 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.880
 formation of microbes 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.650
 the hams come back again identifies 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.720
 this time they play their game on the 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.880
 stamp that indicates the week and year in which 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.740
 the elaboration process begins 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.170
 with the papers already finally in order 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.090
 the salting process begins 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.860
 first a fight and after its total 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.870
 One step salt coating 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.090
 essential to preserve the ham 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.740
 for more time the effect is the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.220
 dehydration of meat and 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.900
 very important flavor enhancement the 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.090
 stay in salting will be one day 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.370
 by Kim and this we have to follow him to 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.260
 If we overdo it or if we 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.360
 we are short in this process we 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.200
 we will find a defective ham and 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.200
 without solutions 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.660
 then the salt is removed 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.730
 excess by blowing and washing 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.590
 the hams an agreement is put under the 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.870
 hock and the process begins 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.180
 healing 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.769
 we enter these chambers of Lyon not 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.019
 we want to say that we are going to send the 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.970
 hams to the future but with a simple 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.099
 click the hams will be experienced here 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.709
 the four climatic seasons for their 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.450
 cure a process in which the ham 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.790
 it eliminates the humidity inside 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.459
 and develops gradually and texture 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.740
 Iberian aroma in the first season of 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.960
 winter the salt definitely penetrates 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.370
 in the flesh if we did not do it like that 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.410
 it would take them to appear small 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.580
 pathogenic microorganisms that would end 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.580
 quickly with the ham 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.340
 at 110 days we say goodbye to winter 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.130
 and we mold the hams in the form of 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.810
 racket may seem like a punishment but if 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.370
 we did not do it the ham would stay 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.940
 without that rich coat of Iberian bacon 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.160
 that clothes and protects the flesh 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.590
 a new click welcomes the 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.330
 spring and summer temperatures of 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.220
 up to 22 degrees so that hams 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.350
 they release the humidity inside 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.900
 here they can lose up to a 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.850
 kilo the color of the meat and its crust 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.590
 outside will be increasingly intense 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.620
 symptom that the ham is healing 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.600
 correctly after three months it 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.240
 take to the warehouse to rest 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.460
 it's autumn temperatures between 14 and 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.430
 16 degrees for the fat to finish 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.680
 stabilize the color aroma and flavor 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.230
 definitively settle a process that 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.820
 It can take up to 3 years for sure more 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.980
 of one already link would the tooth 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.310
 but the last step is the selection 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.230
 final 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.750
 by the hands of ham masters 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.400
 thousands of hams go by first 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.560
 press to check if the cure 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.750
 It is the right one 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.700
 then check the shape of the skin 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.830
 and finally with the help of this cove 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.520
 it checks that there are no strange aromas 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.980
 in three key points heart mace and 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.130
 babilla if these criteria are not met 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.200
 will not go to the market and ready for 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.390
 final maneuver the cut with the dreaded 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.370
 ham knife three out of four 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.560
 Spanish consumers recognize no 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.690
 have no idea how to use it on 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.640
 result fifty seven thousand 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.740
 accidents per year for not knowing the 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.110
 technique some even end up in 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.090
 emergencies if we do not want to take a 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.130
 hand in front we think that there is 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:15.190
 another option the ham envelopes 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.140
 sliced but how we make 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.670
 first the ham is immobilized and 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.800
 remove very carefully so as not to 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:24.160
 spoil the piece the bone of the hip 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.440
 the tibia the femur and the fibula but eye 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.820
 we do not throw them for something it says that in 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.820
 the pig until the walk 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.420
 this candle will help us to remove all 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.160
 the skin and the excess fat we 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.350
 we are left with the best of ham and 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.350
 We take to this pressing machine 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:48.150
 This is the resulting piece 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.150
 homogeneous list for cutting 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.530
 these blades pulverize all the 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.960
 speed records 60,000 slices a la 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.200
 an hour ago is the impressive record 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.569
 world knife cutting 2 thousand 160 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.669
 Aragonese slices 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:05.589
 once cut we have the slices 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:08.080
 in trays and sealed with film 

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:09.939
 preventing the entry of oxygen watched 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.360
 if we did not do it that way it would rust 

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:12.360
 the ham 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.130
 It is packaged in trays and ready with a 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.130
 gift for the palate 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:26.229
 in sachets of slices or whole pieces 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:31.289
 So we make the famous Iberian ham 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:31.289
 from pasture to the table in three years
