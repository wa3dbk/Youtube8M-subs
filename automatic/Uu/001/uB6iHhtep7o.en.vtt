00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
pretty cynical about Star Wars games I

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.119 
pretty cynical about Star Wars games I
think<00:00:57.719> Star<00:00:57.960> Wars<00:00:58.199> will<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.590> ended<00:00:58.980> with

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129

Return<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> Jedi<00:00:59.609> I<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.480> should

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
Return of the Jedi I think they should

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.029 
Return of the Jedi I think they should
have<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:01.199> closed<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> lid<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:01.890> but

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
have just closed the lid there but

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.680 
have just closed the lid there but
obviously<00:01:02.309> there<00:01:03.059> were<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> other<00:01:03.420> three

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
obviously there were the other three

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.080 
obviously there were the other three
appalling<00:01:04.049> films<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.530> obviously<00:01:04.820> as<00:01:05.820> many

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
appalling films and obviously as many

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.359 
appalling films and obviously as many
video<00:01:06.360> games<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.930> think<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.799> which

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
video games as you can think of of which

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.370 
video games as you can think of of which
probably<00:01:08.700> only<00:01:08.939> two<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.420> three<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> think<00:01:09.810> were

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
probably only two or three I think were

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.590 
probably only two or three I think were
tolerable<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.520> went<00:01:11.850> along<00:01:12.119> with<00:01:12.270> an<00:01:12.360> open

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
tolerable but I went along with an open

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.480 
tolerable but I went along with an open
mind<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.170> clean<00:01:13.380> pair<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.680> underwear<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
mind and a clean pair of underwear to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.190 
mind and a clean pair of underwear to
see<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> Lucas<00:01:15.210> team<00:01:15.420> had<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.930> their

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
okay so it's not as easy as it looks but

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.350 
okay so it's not as easy as it looks but
this<00:01:24.260> really<00:01:24.650> is<00:01:24.890> where<00:01:25.190> gaming<00:01:25.730> meets<00:01:25.940> film
