00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
world into a wasteland so there's no

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.799 
world into a wasteland so there's no
grass<00:00:12.320> no<00:00:12.980> leaves<00:00:13.250> nothing<00:00:13.880> like<00:00:14.120> that<00:00:14.269> no

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
grass no leaves nothing like that no

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.450 
grass no leaves nothing like that no
oceans<00:00:15.290> at<00:00:15.470> all<00:00:15.620> actually<00:00:16.039> so<00:00:16.250> you're<00:00:16.369> not

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
oceans at all actually so you're not

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.040 
oceans at all actually so you're not
gonna<00:00:16.670> have<00:00:16.789> to<00:00:16.910> worry<00:00:17.420> about<00:00:17.539> travelling

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
gonna have to worry about travelling

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.380 
gonna have to worry about travelling
across<00:00:18.200> massive<00:00:18.619> expansive<00:00:19.280> oceans<00:00:19.789> you<00:00:20.210> just

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
across massive expansive oceans you just

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.790 
across massive expansive oceans you just
have<00:00:20.510> to<00:00:20.630> walk<00:00:20.780> across<00:00:20.900> dirt<00:00:21.320> all<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:21.650> time

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
have to walk across dirt all the time

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.260 
have to walk across dirt all the time
which<00:00:21.980> is<00:00:22.010> probably<00:00:22.340> even<00:00:22.430> worse<00:00:22.730> since

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
which is probably even worse since

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.000 
which is probably even worse since
everything<00:00:23.660> looks<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.140> same<00:00:24.350> so<00:00:24.830> you<00:00:24.920> could

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
everything looks the same so you could

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.320 
everything looks the same so you could
probably<00:00:25.130> notice<00:00:25.520> now<00:00:25.670> there's<00:00:25.880> actually<00:00:26.000> no

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
probably notice now there's actually no

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.720 
probably notice now there's actually no
grass<00:00:26.720> or<00:00:26.869> anything<00:00:27.020> no<00:00:27.740> so<00:00:27.980> no<00:00:28.340> grass<00:00:28.580> of

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
grass or anything no so no grass of

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.820 
grass or anything no so no grass of
course<00:00:28.910> means<00:00:29.210> there's<00:00:29.420> no<00:00:29.570> flowers<00:00:30.050> or<00:00:30.230> seed

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
course means there's no flowers or seed

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.380 
course means there's no flowers or seed
say<00:00:31.160> car<00:00:31.369> hoe<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:31.699> ground<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.000> get<00:00:32.090> seeds

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
say car hoe the ground to get seeds

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.969 
say car hoe the ground to get seeds
because<00:00:32.749> there's<00:00:32.899> no<00:00:32.989> grass<00:00:33.229> so<00:00:33.829> you're<00:00:33.920> not

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:33.979 
because there's no grass so you're not

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:35.259 
because there's no grass so you're not
gonna<00:00:34.129> be<00:00:34.190> able<00:00:34.249> to<00:00:34.339> set<00:00:34.579> up<00:00:34.609> a<00:00:34.729> wheat<00:00:34.879> farm<00:00:35.120> or

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
gonna be able to set up a wheat farm or

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.759 
gonna be able to set up a wheat farm or
anything<00:00:35.539> and<00:00:35.809> there's<00:00:35.989> no<00:00:36.109> pumpkins<00:00:36.589> or

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
anything and there's no pumpkins or

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.829 
anything and there's no pumpkins or
anything<00:00:36.920> like<00:00:37.159> that<00:00:37.219> or<00:00:37.640> melons<00:00:38.089> so<00:00:38.420> that's

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
anything like that or melons so that's

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:39.700 
anything like that or melons so that's
another<00:00:39.019> thing<00:00:39.170> you're<00:00:39.319> talking<00:00:39.379> about<00:00:39.620> to

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
another thing you're talking about to

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.979 
another thing you're talking about to
get<00:00:39.829> but<00:00:40.639> the<00:00:40.850> way<00:00:41.030> that<00:00:41.179> this<00:00:41.300> mod<00:00:41.539> do<00:00:41.719> is<00:00:41.839> with

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
get but the way that this mod do is with

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.959 
get but the way that this mod do is with
that<00:00:42.109> is<00:00:42.319> that<00:00:42.649> it<00:00:42.949> actually<00:00:43.129> it<00:00:43.519> generates

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
that is that it actually it generates

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:45.759 
that is that it actually it generates
random<00:00:44.179> structures<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:44.960> in<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:45.469> random

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
random structures and in the random

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.169 
random structures and in the random
structures<00:00:46.159> you're<00:00:46.280> gonna<00:00:46.370> find<00:00:46.609> chests<00:00:47.059> and

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
structures you're gonna find chests and

in the chests of valuable items such as

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.069 
in the chests of valuable items such as
seeds<00:00:49.609> you<00:00:50.059> wouldn't<00:00:50.299> normally<00:00:50.389> associate

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
seeds you wouldn't normally associate

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.739 
seeds you wouldn't normally associate

no leaves on and they're just like
stacks<00:01:06.500> of<00:01:06.710> seven<00:01:07.040> log<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:07.850> that's<00:01:08.240> kind<00:01:08.450> of<00:01:08.510> a

here so this one appears to be like a
cobblestone<00:01:30.620> structure<00:01:31.130> with<00:01:31.930> bookshelves

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.220 
in it and I'm no chests in this one
actually<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:35.360> does<00:01:35.540> look<00:01:35.660> like<00:01:35.690> a<00:01:35.810> creepers

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
blown up at the bottom though because

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.890 
blown up at the bottom though because
it's<00:01:37.430> torches<00:01:37.760> off<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.970> wall<00:01:38.090> be<00:01:38.510> interesting

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
it's torches off the wall be interesting

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.710

to improve these trees and maybe make

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.020 
to improve these trees and maybe make

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
them branch off in different directions

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.880 
them branch off in different directions

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.119 
wasteland theme and we've got some run
another<00:02:37.079> rock<00:02:37.260> over<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:37.769> if<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:37.950> don't

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
another rock over there so if you don't

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.500 
another rock over there so if you don't
want<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.310> go<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.549> nether<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.269> just<00:02:39.420> go

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
want to go to the nether you can just go

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.839 
want to go to the nether you can just go
there<00:02:39.689> I<00:02:39.870> will<00:02:40.170> mention<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.769> this<00:02:41.609> mod<00:02:41.819> does

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
there I will mention that this mod does

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.759 
there I will mention that this mod does
not<00:02:42.180> change<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.629> cave<00:02:42.840> generation<00:02:43.379> so<00:02:43.709> you

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
not change the cave generation so you

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:44.869 
not change the cave generation so you
can<00:02:43.890> still<00:02:44.040> go<00:02:44.129> into<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.370> ground<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.700> find

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
can still go into the ground and find

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.190 
can still go into the ground and find
some<00:02:45.030> decent<00:02:45.209> caves<00:02:45.599> there's<00:02:45.810> nothing<00:02:46.049> new

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
some decent caves there's nothing new

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.750 
some decent caves there's nothing new
about<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.040> actually<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.340> see<00:02:47.519> what's<00:02:47.670> in

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
about that and actually I see what's in

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.890 
about that and actually I see what's in
this<00:02:47.849> chest<00:02:48.090> we've<00:02:48.239> got<00:02:48.329> so<00:02:48.450> you've<00:02:48.599> got<00:02:48.690> some

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
this chest we've got so you've got some

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.539 
this chest we've got so you've got some
direct<00:02:49.409> wheat<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:49.769> this<00:02:49.859> chest<00:02:50.099> which

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
direct wheat in this chest which

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.339 
direct wheat in this chest which
arguably<00:02:50.909> is<00:02:51.060> worse<00:02:51.420> than<00:02:51.629> seeds<00:02:51.959> because

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
arguably is worse than seeds because

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.440 
arguably is worse than seeds because
hmmm<00:02:53.220> you're<00:02:53.579> not<00:02:53.670> going<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.879> be<00:02:53.940> able<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.150> and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
hmmm you're not going to be able to and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.330 
hmmm you're not going to be able to and
use<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.200> wheat<00:02:55.409> again<00:02:55.680> after<00:02:56.010> you've<00:02:56.099> used

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
use this wheat again after you've used

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.520 
use this wheat again after you've used
it<00:02:56.519> once<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:56.940> probably<00:02:57.780> better<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.109> get<00:02:58.200> seeds

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
it once so probably better to get seeds

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.229 
it once so probably better to get seeds
and<00:02:59.189> let's<00:02:59.489> see<00:02:59.670> you've<00:02:59.790> got<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> thing<00:03:00.120> over

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
and let's see you've got a thing over

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.250 
and let's see you've got a thing over
here<00:03:00.359> you<00:03:00.510> can<00:03:00.629> see<00:03:00.750> some<00:03:00.900> naturally

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
here you can see some naturally

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.229 
here you can see some naturally
generated<00:03:01.769> caves<00:03:02.040> with<00:03:02.340> lovely<00:03:02.790> lighting

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
generated caves with lovely lighting

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.509 
generated caves with lovely lighting
glitches<00:03:03.689> oh<00:03:03.840> I'm<00:03:04.319> gonna<00:03:04.560> be<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.280> looking

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
glitches oh I'm gonna be so looking

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.789 
glitches oh I'm gonna be so looking
forward<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.819> 1.7<00:03:06.329> when<00:03:06.599> this<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.840> all<00:03:06.959> fixed<00:03:07.200> no

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
forward to 1.7 when this is all fixed no

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.379 
forward to 1.7 when this is all fixed no
but<00:03:07.980> yeah<00:03:08.069> let's<00:03:08.370> just<00:03:08.489> go<00:03:08.639> through<00:03:08.670> another

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
but yeah let's just go through another

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.179 
but yeah let's just go through another
few<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.049> these<00:03:10.170> our<00:03:10.349> random<00:03:10.680> structures<00:03:11.040> I

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
few of these our random structures I

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:12.589 
few of these our random structures I
think<00:03:11.489> there's<00:03:11.639> only<00:03:11.670> four<00:03:12.000> different<00:03:12.209> kinds

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
think there's only four different kinds

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:13.729 
think there's only four different kinds
because<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.780> haven't<00:03:12.900> seen<00:03:13.019> any<00:03:13.230> more<00:03:13.319> there's

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
because I haven't seen any more there's

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.679 
because I haven't seen any more there's
nothing<00:03:13.950> actually<00:03:14.040> in<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.430> chest<00:03:14.670> hmm<00:03:15.299> well

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
nothing actually in that chest hmm well

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.180 
nothing actually in that chest hmm well
yeah<00:03:15.780> okay<00:03:16.109> another<00:03:16.379> generator<00:03:16.769> structure

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
yeah okay another generator structure

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.250 
yeah okay another generator structure
there<00:03:17.579> only<00:03:17.699> appears<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.209> be<00:03:18.359> about<00:03:18.989> four

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
there only appears to be about four

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.629 
there only appears to be about four
different<00:03:19.349> types<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:20.010> have<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.430> future

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
different types I have in the future

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.000 
different types I have in the future
there<00:03:20.849> be<00:03:20.940> more<00:03:21.150> variety<00:03:21.599> but<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.349> can<00:03:22.560> say<00:03:22.769> that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
there be more variety but I can say that

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.110 
there be more variety but I can say that
some<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.340> these<00:03:23.400> chests<00:03:23.639> have<00:03:23.699> nothing<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.030> it

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
some of these chests have nothing in it

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.970 
some of these chests have nothing in it
it's<00:03:24.209> really<00:03:24.299> boring<00:03:24.569> but<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.650> cave

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
it's really boring but the cave

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.289 
it's really boring but the cave
generation<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.639> same<00:03:26.819> so<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.060> can<00:03:27.150> still

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
generation is the same so you can still

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.670 
generation is the same so you can still
go<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.419> get<00:03:27.599> diamonds<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.139> mineshafts<00:03:28.560> and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
go and get diamonds and mineshafts and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.409 
go and get diamonds and mineshafts and
stuff<00:03:28.799> like<00:03:28.949> that<00:03:29.099> still<00:03:29.519> go<00:03:29.609> to<00:03:29.669> the<00:03:29.819> end<00:03:29.940> but

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
stuff like that still go to the end but

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.399 
stuff like that still go to the end but
of<00:03:30.510> course<00:03:30.690> you're<00:03:30.810> not<00:03:30.900> gonna<00:03:30.989> have<00:03:31.139> any

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
of course you're not gonna have any

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:32.659 
of course you're not gonna have any
passive<00:03:31.889> Marvis<00:03:32.190> which<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:32.459> gonna<00:03:32.549> be

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
passive Marvis which it's gonna be

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.039 
passive Marvis which it's gonna be
horrible<00:03:32.819> you're<00:03:33.389> not<00:03:33.480> gonna<00:03:33.569> have<00:03:33.690> any<00:03:33.780> sheep

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
horrible you're not gonna have any sheep

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.629 
horrible you're not gonna have any sheep
pull<00:03:34.349> of<00:03:34.470> sheep<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.159> you're<00:03:35.250> gonna<00:03:35.400> have<00:03:35.519> any

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
pull of sheep and you're gonna have any

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.399 
pull of sheep and you're gonna have any
pigs<00:03:35.879> or<00:03:36.060> anything<00:03:36.239> like<00:03:36.359> that<00:03:36.480> but<00:03:37.260> most

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
pigs or anything like that but most

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:38.599 
pigs or anything like that but most
importantly<00:03:37.799> not<00:03:37.889> gonna<00:03:38.069> have<00:03:38.159> any<00:03:38.250> squids

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
importantly not gonna have any squids

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.490 
importantly not gonna have any squids
which<00:03:38.819> is<00:03:38.940> which<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.329> good<00:03:39.510> we<00:03:39.690> like<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:39.989> so

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
which is which is good we like that so

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.469 
which is which is good we like that so
no<00:03:40.620> squids<00:03:40.949> home<00:03:41.579> because<00:03:41.849> there's<00:03:42.030> no<00:03:42.120> oceans

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
no squids home because there's no oceans

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:45.229 
no squids home because there's no oceans
or<00:03:42.629> any<00:03:42.750> water<00:03:42.989> so<00:03:43.709> yeah<00:03:43.949> although<00:03:44.459> having<00:03:45.030> no

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
or any water so yeah although having no

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.210 
or any water so yeah although having no
water<00:03:45.419> probably<00:03:45.930> not<00:03:46.049> good<00:03:46.169> for<00:03:46.319> survival<00:03:46.799> um

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
water probably not good for survival um

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.110 
water probably not good for survival um
so<00:03:47.430> yeah<00:03:47.549> that's<00:03:47.699> pretty<00:03:47.849> much<00:03:47.909> everything

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
so yeah that's pretty much everything

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.670 
so yeah that's pretty much everything
for<00:03:48.449> the<00:03:48.540> wasteland<00:03:48.870> mod<00:03:49.049> it<00:03:49.199> just<00:03:49.349> makes<00:03:49.560> your

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
for the wasteland mod it just makes your

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.289 
for the wasteland mod it just makes your
world<00:03:49.979> really<00:03:50.519> inhospitable

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
world really inhospitable

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.119
