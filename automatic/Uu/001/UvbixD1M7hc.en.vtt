00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hello dear friends , how are you? 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.680
 consider ga byte is another video from 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.240
 headings how to counter or what will go on 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.780
 a hero who simply terrorizes 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.770
 ranked games and furious around 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.660
 whose hero many have asked to meet 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.590
 signatures of kopecks for an elevator 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.750
 let's go and to begin with we will disassemble as always 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.490
 weak sides 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.439
 the first is not the largest amount of mana 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.539
 at the beginning of the game when it is sufficiently large 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.099
 bones of the first skill 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.239
 when the sol of the country of charts appears 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.250
 friends will constantly not be enough mann and 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.960
 second with careless playing beard 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.120
 can easily fatten their shelves 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.340
 enemy heroes and worse seated 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.700
 team mate we mean so 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.170
 love the third like any hero who 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.969
 relies on your inviz very 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.770
 sensitive to see well there is a gas there 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.649
 center we go further a lot of the hero 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.780
 bruda very strong public character this 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.129
 the strength is that first of all 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.860
 she's a well-organized team competition 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.150
 interactions that pub where people often 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.030
 I play only for myself 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.740
 rarely seen as a rule in the team 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.560
 she plays usher and swings 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.049
 through solo hard you and not only 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.979
 view hardline the best place for bruda 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.240
 so we will push off from it 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.280
 besides certain outline of the heroes about 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.070
 which I will tell later your peak 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.350
 there must be two support 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.670
 just 2 so as a pile to the enemy team 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.500
 condemns your supports to 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.290
 waste of money buying 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.060
 center and lumen ag1 support such 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.549
 loads can't handle it so much on his shoulders 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.100
 There is also a purchase and about chickens as well 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.930
 warden cards only after what 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.270
 spied 2 support one of them should 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.479
 be sure to buy yourself the beginning of the game is not 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.040
 postponing a pack with Andrei 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.060
 only having enough vision 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.369
 resist chest 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.490
 otherwise, it will simply humiliate 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.200
 the whole line further worth noting one 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.630
 moment that in order to bend 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.130
 Brood require a good level of play and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.140
 also normal microcontrol 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.390
 in the absence of this often 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.300
 enemy ford will only help you in 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.220
 victory 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.340
 for some reason it comes across for me 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.010
 such should still be taken as an axiom 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.720
 The following facts if you start the game 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.050
 sing a little saw right arm pile 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.310
 your throne will come to an end 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.710
 if you did everything right and not 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.960
 further pharma frags and took a couple more 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.960
 since then it will become just a fig burden 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.430
 for my team, in principle, as well as about 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.370
 other pusher about the dish can never 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.080
 forget and disregard very 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.410
 there are often situations when the game is on 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.840
 straight from your team break t2 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.910
 and everything seems to be fine but at this time 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.360
 bruda already breaks your barracks to another 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.950
 the lines 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.050
 precisely because of inattention 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.930
 most game vs broodmother 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.790
 and are playing now move on 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.220
 particular hero which is worth taking in 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.720
 counterbalance brude 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.280
 attention if you don't find a hero here 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.890
 which you think can ride brood 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.050
 then do not write about it in the comments this 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.460
 does not mean that it does not fit it means 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.590
 that I did not consider it necessary to add it 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.570
 due to some reasons including 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.480
 not confirmed sti statistics thanks 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.160
 for understanding and bad choice against 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.950
 get be legion because of her 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.390
 first ability the thing is that the first 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.070
 skill legion commander acts on 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.920
 the ural region depends on it 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.300
 the number of targets that are in it 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.190
 considering the fact that the pond is always 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.770
 run with your bundles damage from this 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.480
 the skill will just be fierce also not 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.520
 forget about the fact that the spiders 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.760
 gold is given and the pile will be just a movie 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.650
 to the legionnaire itself not even though 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.640
 the storm of all invizers slardar is good too 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.459
 go against bruda 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.080
 thanks to its ulta and mass camp 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.660
 with good enough damage will not be 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.320
 superfluous here we assign in x the same with 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.350
 my ulta 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.310
 namely track the enemy of ore number one 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.440
 is ax 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.989
 this is the best hero you can 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.120
 against him and take everything because the pond 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.340
 kills enemies thanks to a whole army 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.530
 spiders and how do we know passive as 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.209
 work so the more he is attacked 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.910
 the more he turns causing damage 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.580
 around him now imagine that in 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.470
 Axa ore attacked with his army of ca. 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.220
 the account is spinning so how do we boil the gene 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.840
 TFA and Brood and immediately answer the tavern 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.520
 also we have not talked about the ogre which 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.140
 able to catch the brood and and the spiders in 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.209
 invise and also kill quickly 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.710
 further comes the hero sau and skills which 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.720
 can quickly destroy and farm 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.510
 spider this mipo 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.000
 at son the skin tight timber column and so 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.110
 Further they are dangerous if 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.900
 Brood lichens and chief weapons can not but 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.340
 mention such a hero as a shaker and he 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.730
 could be attributed to the previous one 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.220
 group 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.890
 if it were not for his ultimate more than 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.020
 The targets hit them all the more. how are we 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.820
 already said bruda is always in 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.310
 surrounded by a huge number of spiders 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.990
 not only that all bunches with a brood will die 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.520
 almost instantly so by this and this 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.820
 broodmother to nearby not 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.980
 Hello hello of the items which is worth 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.690
 gather against uchiha I would single out diffusa 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.340
 in order to take off her ulta 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.560
 it would be nice to buy more nekra 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.620
 which is on the last level of pumping 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.990
 gives effect pv site and for carry heroes 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.990
 it is necessary to put objects that give oh e 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.910
 metal fury and mjolnir but bypass 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.210
 I donâ€™t see any reason to speak 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.930
 I understand it all thanks for the fact that 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.910
 have looked 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.550
 like it if you like it 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.290
 video and write in the comments on what 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.830
 hero is worth making new how to counter 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.250
 in the meantime, good luck to all and do not be ill 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.250
 soon
