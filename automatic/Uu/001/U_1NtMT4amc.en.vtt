all I did was a jump on eBay and I

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.350 
all I did was a jump on eBay and I
ordered<00:02:02.299> some<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.920> know<00:02:04.040> 10-year<00:02:04.850> UV

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
ordered some you know 10-year UV

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.319 
ordered some you know 10-year UV
stabilized<00:02:07.959> film<00:02:09.429> so<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.580> easy<00:02:10.700> film<00:02:11.090> that

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
stabilized film so it easy film that

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.860 
stabilized film so it easy film that
sine<00:02:11.569> riders<00:02:12.049> might<00:02:12.260> use<00:02:12.529> and<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:14.180> stuck<00:02:14.840> that

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
sine riders might use and I stuck that

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.809 
sine riders might use and I stuck that
on

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
on

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.709 
on
to<00:02:16.689> just<00:02:16.900> sort<00:02:17.049> of<00:02:17.670> just<00:02:18.670> sort<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.450> see<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 
to just sort of just sort of you see the

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.410 
to just sort of just sort of you see the
lips<00:02:20.019> disappears<00:02:20.769> in<00:02:20.950> behind<00:02:21.219> there<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:22.299> then

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
lips disappears in behind there and then

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.789 
lips disappears in behind there and then
once<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.689> did<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.930> just<00:02:23.019> took<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.349> blade<00:02:23.560> and

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
once it did that I just took a blade and

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.770 
once it did that I just took a blade and
I<00:02:23.859> just<00:02:24.069> trimmed<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.430> around<00:02:24.609> the<00:02:24.730> top<00:02:24.939> to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
I just trimmed it around the top to

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.629 
I just trimmed it around the top to
create<00:02:26.079> like<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> bit<00:02:26.409> of<00:02:26.499> a<00:02:26.560> Sun<00:02:26.769> shield<00:02:27.010> and

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:27.639 
create like a bit of a Sun shield and

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.009 
create like a bit of a Sun shield and
after<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.150> it's<00:02:28.389> probably<00:02:28.569> been<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.870> best

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
after that it's probably been the best

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.440 
after that it's probably been the best
shield<00:02:29.769> for<00:02:30.249> using<00:02:30.549> during<00:02:30.760> winter<00:02:30.999> time<00:02:31.150> that

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
shield for using during winter time that

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.410 
shield for using during winter time that
that<00:02:32.079> I've<00:02:32.200> ever<00:02:32.319> had<00:02:33.000> if<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.060> want<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.299> leave

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
that I've ever had if you want to leave

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.190 
that I've ever had if you want to leave
home<00:02:34.599> in<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.780> morning

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
tight and the anti fault properties are

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.280 
tight and the anti fault properties are
amazing<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:46.030> then<00:02:46.180> as<00:02:46.359> the<00:02:46.540> day<00:02:46.689> wears<00:02:46.959> on<00:02:47.230> and

it gets a little bit brighter you know
the<00:02:50.560> thing<00:02:50.739> tints<00:02:51.129> down<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.340> bit<00:02:51.639> and<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:53.500> know

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
helmet and I haven't exposed to sunlight

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.839 
helmet and I haven't exposed to sunlight
one<00:03:26.139> of<00:03:26.259> the<00:03:26.319> things<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.859> is<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.459> bit<00:03:27.699> of<00:03:27.790> a

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
one of the things that is a bit of a

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.789 
one of the things that is a bit of a
problem<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.269> if<00:03:28.419> you<00:03:28.509> take<00:03:28.720> this<00:03:28.900> if<00:03:29.199> you<00:03:29.560> take

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
problem is if you take this if you take

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.300 
problem is if you take this if you take
this<00:03:30.009> thing<00:03:30.069> out<00:03:30.579> into<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.780> Sun<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.409> expose

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
this thing out into the Sun and expose

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.589 
this thing out into the Sun and expose
it<00:03:33.489> this<00:03:33.639> way<00:03:33.849> up<00:03:34.919> the<00:03:35.919> sunlight<00:03:36.389> makes<00:03:37.389> it

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
it this way up the sunlight makes it

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.099 
it this way up the sunlight makes it
quite<00:03:37.900> dark<00:03:38.199> indeed<00:03:39.419> but<00:03:40.419> when<00:03:40.629> it's<00:03:40.780> on<00:03:40.959> the

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
quite dark indeed but when it's on the

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.129 
quite dark indeed but when it's on the
helmet<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.680> it's<00:03:42.099> closed

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
helmet and it's closed

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.189 
helmet and it's closed
you<00:03:44.919> know<00:03:44.979> this<00:03:45.189> there's<00:03:45.609> a<00:03:45.669> the<00:03:46.199> windshield

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
you know this there's a the windshield

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.599 
you know this there's a the windshield
the<00:03:47.259> shield<00:03:47.650> itself<00:03:47.829> has<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:49.259> has<00:03:50.259> a<00:03:50.519> you<00:03:51.519> know

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
the shield itself has a has a you know

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.640 
the shield itself has a has a you know
it<00:03:51.729> cancels<00:03:52.299> out<00:03:52.419> some<00:03:52.599> of<00:03:52.689> the<00:03:52.750> UV<00:03:53.019> rays<00:03:53.290> and

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
it cancels out some of the UV rays and

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.369 
it cancels out some of the UV rays and
UV<00:03:53.739> is<00:03:54.400> what<00:03:54.549> activates<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:58.379> the

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
UV is what activates the the the

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.110 
UV is what activates the the the
photochromatic<00:03:59.949> property<00:04:00.549> of<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.699> vial<00:04:00.909> of

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
photochromatic property of the vial of

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.640 
photochromatic property of the vial of
the<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.109> insert<00:04:02.469> so<00:04:04.199> you<00:04:05.199> know<00:04:05.319> if<00:04:05.500> you're

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
the of the insert so you know if you're

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.789 
the of the insert so you know if you're
expecting<00:04:05.949> a<00:04:06.219> really<00:04:06.370> dark<00:04:06.669> tint<00:04:07.709> you'll<00:04:08.709> be

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
expecting a really dark tint you'll be

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.770 
expecting a really dark tint you'll be

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
a shot I'm trying to make sure that

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.360 
a shot I'm trying to make sure that
helmet<00:05:36.139> doesn't<00:05:36.440> move<00:05:36.620> so<00:05:36.860> it<00:05:36.950> becomes<00:05:37.190> really

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
helmet doesn't move so it becomes really

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.710 
helmet doesn't move so it becomes really
obvious<00:05:37.460> the<00:05:38.060> difference<00:05:40.330> and<00:05:41.330> that's<00:05:41.450> the
