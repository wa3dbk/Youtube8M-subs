00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
here we just got simple layers going on

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.999 
here we just got simple layers going on
right<00:00:11.639> now<00:00:11.670> they<00:00:12.420> are<00:00:12.570> not<00:00:12.719> animated<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.559> get

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
right now they are not animated I get

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.950 
right now they are not animated I get
play<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.759> say<00:00:15.000> nothing's<00:00:15.360> happening<00:00:15.750> so

play you say nothing's happening so

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.019 
play you say nothing's happening so
let's<00:00:16.859> change<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.310> let's<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:17.640> some<00:00:17.789> stuff

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
let's change that let's get some stuff

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.090 
let's change that let's get some stuff
going<00:00:18.300> off<00:00:18.590> so<00:00:19.590> you're<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.859> go<00:00:19.949> right

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
going off so you're going to go right

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.519 
going off so you're going to go right
into<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.400> attribute<00:00:20.970> editor<00:00:21.330> go<00:00:22.170> right<00:00:22.380> to

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
into the attribute editor go right to

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.009 
into the attribute editor go right to
the<00:00:22.619> texture<00:00:22.920> that's<00:00:23.310> plugged<00:00:23.850> into<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.150> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the texture that's plugged into that and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.170 
the texture that's plugged into that and
you<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.289> go<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.740> place<00:00:26.099> 2d<00:00:26.400> texture<00:00:26.760> tab

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
you can go to the place 2d texture tab

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.929 
you can go to the place 2d texture tab
on<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.660> top<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.920> you'll<00:00:29.039> see<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.490> called

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
on the top and you'll see this called

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.299 
on the top and you'll see this called
offset<00:00:30.150> here<00:00:30.689> now<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> first<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:32.099> going

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
offset here now the first one is going

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.220 
offset here now the first one is going
to<00:00:32.369> make<00:00:32.520> an<00:00:32.669> anime<00:00:33.090> from<00:00:33.510> left<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.809> right<00:00:34.020> and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
to make an anime from left to right and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.990 
to make an anime from left to right and
the<00:00:35.010> second<00:00:35.250> one's<00:00:35.399> going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.550> go<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.910> down

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the second one's going to go up and down

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.160 
the second one's going to go up and down
but<00:00:36.329> we're<00:00:36.450> not<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.719> use<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.079> down

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
but we're not going to use up and down

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.410 
but we're not going to use up and down
because<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.590> wouldn't<00:00:37.770> make<00:00:37.860> any<00:00:38.010> sense<00:00:38.420> so

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
because that wouldn't make any sense so

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.139 
because that wouldn't make any sense so
we're<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:39.989> right<00:00:40.520> into<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.879> one

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
we're going to go right into that one

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.200 
we're going to go right into that one
here<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.620> I<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> timeline<00:00:44.160> set<00:00:44.730> from<00:00:44.940> 1

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
here and I have the timeline set from 1

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.430 
here and I have the timeline set from 1
to<00:00:46.020> 180<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:47.160> let's<00:00:48.120> make<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.510> let's<00:00:48.930> set<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> key

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
to 180 so let's make it let's set a key

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.340 
to 180 so let's make it let's set a key
here<00:00:49.829> right<00:00:50.430> click<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.850> go<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.480> set<00:00:51.809> key<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
here right click it go to set key and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650 
here right click it go to set key and
you<00:00:52.410> see<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.620> turns<00:00:52.800> red<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.280> there's<00:00:53.520> no<00:00:53.670> red

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you see it turns red but there's no red

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.150 
you see it turns red but there's no red
mark<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> timeline<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.800> got<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.070> be

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
mark on the timeline so you got to be

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.130 
mark on the timeline so you got to be
careful<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:56.610> sometimes<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.899> little

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
careful but sometimes you get a little

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.670 
careful but sometimes you get a little
confused

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
confused

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.549 
confused
so<00:00:59.010> once<00:00:59.309> set<00:00:59.609> there<00:01:00.050> then<00:01:01.050> I'm<00:01:01.199> gonna<00:01:01.260> go<00:01:01.410> all

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
so once set there then I'm gonna go all

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.939 
so once set there then I'm gonna go all
the<00:01:01.620> way<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.739> 180<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:03.019> since<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.229> first<00:01:04.530> plane

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the way to 180 and since the first plane

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.679 
the way to 180 and since the first plane
it's<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.640> first<00:01:05.850> plane<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.240> closest<00:01:06.570> thing

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
it's the first plane the closest thing

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.539 
it's the first plane the closest thing
that's<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.049> moving<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.380> fastest<00:01:07.920> so

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that's going to be moving the fastest so

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.310 
that's going to be moving the fastest so
I'm<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.060> put<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.450> I'm<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.080> by

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
I'm going to put that I'm going to go by

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.399 
I'm going to put that I'm going to go by
3<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.189> put<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.670> 3<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.409> then

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
3 so I'm going to put that at 3 and then

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.399 
3 so I'm going to put that at 3 and then
I'm<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.710> set<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> key<00:01:14.630> if<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.780> hit<00:01:15.930> play<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
I'm going to set a key if I hit play and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.609 
I'm going to set a key if I hit play and
now<00:01:16.950> they're<00:01:17.189> going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> move<00:01:17.520> pretty<00:01:18.360> fast

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
now they're going to move pretty fast

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.719 
now they're going to move pretty fast
now<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.680> important<00:01:20.070> part<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.310> doing<00:01:20.610> this

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
now the important part about doing this

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.210 
now the important part about doing this
is<00:01:20.970> getting<00:01:21.299> parallaxing<00:01:21.990> happening<00:01:22.950> with

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
is getting parallaxing happening with

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.160 
is getting parallaxing happening with
your<00:01:23.369> different<00:01:23.549> layers<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.150> obviously<00:01:24.840> three

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
your different layers so obviously three

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.060 
your different layers so obviously three
different<00:01:25.409> layers<00:01:25.470> are<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.830> move<00:01:25.920> at

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
different layers are going to move at

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.620 
different layers are going to move at
three<00:01:26.220> different<00:01:26.340> speeds<00:01:26.549> which<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.450> why<00:01:27.600> I

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
three different speeds which is why I

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.140 
three different speeds which is why I
went<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.500> first<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.040> number<00:01:29.280> three<00:01:29.490> now

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
went the first one is number three now

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.789 
went the first one is number three now
I'm<00:01:30.210> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> middle<00:01:30.750> one<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
I'm going to go the middle one do the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.940 
I'm going to go the middle one do the
same<00:01:32.040> thing<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.290> instead<00:01:34.290> I'm<00:01:34.650> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> set

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
same thing and instead I'm going to set

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.910 
same thing and instead I'm going to set
a<00:01:34.979> key<00:01:35.159> at<00:01:35.250> 0<00:01:35.810> make<00:01:36.810> sure<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.590> am<00:01:37.740> i

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
a key at 0 make sure on that one I am i

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I'll set a key there and now you can see

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.590 
I'll set a key there and now you can see
that<00:01:50.310> one's<00:01:50.490> moving<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> different

that one's moving but at a different
speed<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.290> there<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.649> some<00:01:52.890> Karel<00:01:53.189> action

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
speed so there is some Karel action

speed so there is some Karel action
going<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.450> mess<00:01:54.570> around<00:01:54.600> with

thing
set<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> key<00:02:02.579> at<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.649> then<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.979> 180<00:02:06.500> and

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
set a key at one and then go to 180 and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.460 
set a key at one and then go to 180 and
put<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.520> as<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:09.000> now<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.869> first<00:02:10.140> layer<00:02:10.349> is

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
put that as one now the first layer is

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.979 
put that as one now the first layer is
three<00:02:10.770> seconds<00:02:11.370> two<00:02:11.550> last<00:02:11.940> ones<00:02:12.180> one

three seconds two last ones one
that's<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:13.769> a<00:02:13.829> base<00:02:14.010> number<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.939> I<00:02:15.180> came<00:02:16.019> up

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
that's just a base number that I came up

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.349 
that's just a base number that I came up
with<00:02:16.230> now<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.799> go<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.159> my<00:02:17.849> different<00:02:18.060> my

play<00:02:29.819> around<00:02:29.909> with<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.239> numbers<00:02:30.269> of<00:02:31.049> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
play around with the numbers of the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.140 
play around with the numbers of the
offset<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.889> get<00:02:32.040> different<00:02:32.219> speeds<00:02:32.609> and<00:02:32.939> your

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
offset to get different speeds and your

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.629 
offset to get different speeds and your
timeline<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.840> mean<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.709> could<00:02:34.859> be<00:02:34.980> as<00:02:35.280> long<00:02:35.519> as

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
timeline I mean you could be as long as

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.369 
timeline I mean you could be as long as
it<00:02:35.760> needs<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.030> or<00:02:36.299> I'm<00:02:36.540> sure<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.959> needs<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.260> it

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
it needs to or I'm sure it needs to it

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.949 
it needs to or I'm sure it needs to it
doesn't<00:02:37.590> really<00:02:37.709> matter<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.689> that's<00:02:39.689> how<00:02:39.900> you

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
doesn't really matter so that's how you

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.709 
doesn't really matter so that's how you
animate<00:02:40.409> you've<00:02:40.560> ease
