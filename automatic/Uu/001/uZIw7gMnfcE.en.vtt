00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.289
 That 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.769
 that's always a bit 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.760
 gradually in that area 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.760
 that card 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
 nbg that you know is 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.540
 godmothers 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.910
 a second squat 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.910
 godmothers 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400
 as a result 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.780
 that card 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.820
 4 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.820
 something like that doesn't matter 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.960
 the trio has been destroyed 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.630
 the top three 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.130
 the credit crisis 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.130
 the champions league 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.590
 inappropriate language 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.590
 6 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.989
 there is a kind of subsidy 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.749
 who is careful 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.749
 as 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.229
 I know this competition is like this season 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.419
 santos 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.510
 the advice remains as before 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.459
 3 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.969
 then I sometimes stop over close and not see a second lazet 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.609
 the if something is wrong 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.299
 Hans is to score this situation 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.769
 you feel 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.769
 the side stood 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:20.789
 i see here 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.339
 for Jan Peeters 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.339
 slide the ball suddenly I saw 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.559
 peter hendriks again 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.319
 foundation sets background will worsen the ball is eliminated 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.959
 possibility for novel hours 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.959
 not with this kind 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.269
 my sport does not tear the first decision city 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.979
 no goal was then a goal but now it appears that the ball and that are 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:06.939
 a very strange situation has gone through the same way at least I can 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.169
 not seeing my commentary here 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.349
 only beautiful now also goes on the field 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.269
 train from 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.129
 Global was very positive 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.079
 in his response melo you send them players now 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.090
 at the center line in other words from 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.819
 it was a goal so guys we don't talk about that anymore 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.819
 I now wonder what will happen 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.999
 hugo hovenkamp not adjusted 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.999
 from here you cannot see if the ball is in the water 

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:36.669
 it goes with them only to see by the reaction of gullit 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.650
 After all, it has become a goal and most of the time 26 minutes 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.900
 play on a incoming 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.599
 and that is certainly one 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.529
 unexpected development 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:50.159
 after more than 36 minutes of play in the first half, the score is now very high 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.159
 surprisingly 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.089
 also a song in the center with a long shot in the neighborhood 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.699
 What are we doing 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.199
 the distance was unclear nine meters that it is now also close 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:11.759
 not 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.759
 play a role again 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.409
 of the beer boat is well positioned in midfield that is only tilted upwards 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:49.409
 catch and then it goes fast-speed tour 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:06.629
 that presented itself 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:08.740
 the right side 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.699
 then ballin that is not out yet 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.949
 that was it even if it plays here also arends that penalty area 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.949
 just another year or american songbook 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:43.819
 then played on 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:10.969
 we give the few times the government 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:14.069
 left our defense while driving with Microsoft 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.129
 is in between 

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:17.960
 the final phase was to come 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.369
 percent against nsc with about four minutes still playing 

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:23.249
 I have the impression that both 

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:26.249
 it is usually fine although it is even more important here 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:42.590
