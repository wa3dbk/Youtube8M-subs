00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 ok google 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.009
 clipset 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.650
 hi clip &amp; it 's good you know where 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:16.750
 you are not and what is the gadget that we have 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:31.090
 yes yes yes today brought lexus 5 of google 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:34.000
 bye lg we started css is already here sexy 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.460
 yes it is already here because it makes me so much 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.520
 illusion to have the nexus 5 because the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.950
 Nexus 4 was already the best smartphone in 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.140
 value for money of the last 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.880
 times we go of all time 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.670
 previous until it has come out in those 5 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.210
 clear is that the Nexus 5 includes the 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.090
 same philosophy of the nexus 4 is to say a 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.879
 high-quality hardware smartphone 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.309
 high- end but at a pretty price 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.200
 quite quite affordable as of 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.250
 affordable, you're going to have to see everything 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.049
 the video because I will not say it until 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.270
 the good end is more to the best I say 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.670
 in the middle to give them a surprise 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.770
 Lexus 5 is still manufactured by the 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.700
 axis as well put it in this game 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.549
 that under vale 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.430
 that is bigger but it is built 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.259
 by the axis in the nexus 4 what they had 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.570
 fact was to put video ahead and 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.950
 glass behind the back 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.079
 final ended up being a little 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.869
 unstable because when I started 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.220
 vibrate and when they called it tended to 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.899
 slip to me particularly I never 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.299
 happened but I know that more than one of you 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.159
 I've had another one of the problems I had 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.560
 is that the glass on the back was 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.119
 the same one that covered the objective of the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.770
 camera with which the camera ends 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.969
 losing a little bit of quality for that 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.520
 what they have done now is 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.340
 build it in plastic to make it more 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.630
 resistant and also improve grip what 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.369
 what happens is that clear loses a little bit 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.780
 the premium aspect I had in those 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.970
 four but that's a matter of 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.770
 tastes otherwise really is a 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.060
 smartphone very well built but 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.189
 we go to the nougat since I'm talking 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.770
 of the physical aspect we go with the appearance 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.079
 physical to start apart from this color 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.729
 black is available the nexus 5 in a 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.920
 white color and or white I have not seen it 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.539
 I do not know how nice it is or not but neither 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.849
 it looks really bad on the back 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.890
 has the 8 megapixel camera and a 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.360
 led flash on this side we have the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.069
 power button off lock and 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.040
 here the slot for the cards 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.810
 microsim 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.459
 superior we have here a small 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.019
 microphone and here the minijack connection 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.579
 for some headphones I remind you that 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.870
 the headphones did not come in the box with 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.700
 which you have to use ones that 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.469
 you have or that you buy in any 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.969
 case for that price is almost better than not 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.590
 come because he gets other birds if not 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.689
 they would put some bad humans and here 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.670
 we have volume control that by 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.670
 true the buttons are ceramic 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.970
 and in the bottom part we have the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.569
 minijack connection and here we have the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.569
 speaker the screen is 495 inches and 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.000
 has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 is 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:58.010
 say a full hd resolution screen 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.900
 with ips technology has 445 pixels per 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.390
 inch so you can get an idea 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.130
 how clear it looks is also hard 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.100
 hard hard as it has protection 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.720
 corning gorilla glass 3 of course is 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.340
 one of the best screens that there is to 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.390
 same in the market and at a good price 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.850
 I'm telling you, it comes from 349 euros per 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.500
 here is a camera to perform 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.299
 1.3 megapixel video conferencing 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.100
 also to make you two portraits 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.049
 course but the camera you're with 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.660
 watching right now is the back camera 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.549
 of 8 megapixels I will teach you 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.370
 some of the functionalities that 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.049
 integrates the camera that certainly does not 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.010
 I said new version of the system 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.330
 operative android 4.4 I would teach you a 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.340
 kat kit as taught in the unboxing 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.420
 but I have already stamped them all on 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.610
 the internal of the camera we can 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.290
 modify some basic parameters of 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.819
 the capture as for example the 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.890
 exposure compensation 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.859
 the color temperature and then also 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.400
 we have scenes for example party 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:58.189
 sunset night action and there's even a 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.109
 option that is hdr plus that is pretty 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.340
 interesting and that works very well another 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.920
 of the interesting functions that we 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.069
 offers the nexus 5 camera is the 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.989
 possibility of making timelapse 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.930
 here the only thing we would have to do 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.390
 is to modify 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.859
 the interval in which we want it to be 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.570
 make each of the captures well 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.489
 we would have a video with the effect of 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.139
 time also have accelerated 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.030
 the panoramic function has a 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.070
 Fun function called photos fill 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.100
 that allows us to take photos 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.860
 wraps in 360 degrees the only thing that 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.230
 we should do 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.840
 is to move the camera and placing 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.760
 the little circle in the points that we go 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.500
 indicating is a very fun and 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.650
 that allows you to take very creative photos 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.030
 but it's not quite as accurate as 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.890
 it should be or at least that we 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.410
 I would like it to be in general the camera 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.450
 It's good but it's not excellent it shows 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.850
 that the brands that charge more for their 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.410
 smartphones also invest more in the 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.330
 quality of the cameras and is that the 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.280
 Nexus 5 camera is improvable in 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.840
 terms of sharpness and fidelity of 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.090
 color the overall results are 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.310
 rather better than those of the nexus 4 and 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.840
 saves with great dignity practically 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.080
 all situations inside 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.110
 qualcomm snapdragon 800 to 2.3 processor 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.910
 gigahertz 2 gigs of ram and capacity 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.220
 storage of 16 gigabytes in the 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:21.830
 price that I mentioned before 349 euros 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.540
 and 32 gb and 399 euros and without the possibility of 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.370
 increase storage capacity 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.770
 since it does not have a slot for 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.890
 microsd cards to its weight is 130 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.320
 grams and here we have a slot that 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.720
 would invite us to open the lid and leave the 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.460
 discovered the battery but it did not 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.390
 may however that the construction does not 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.610
 be unique 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.610
 and has made it have an index of 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.530
 repair of 8 out of 10 according to people 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.140
 difficult is to say that it must be super 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.820
 easy to lift this to fix it and 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.580
 Replace as the battery is not 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:56.300
 removable I can not teach it but it is 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.820
 of 2300 milliamps really the 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.620
 autonomy ends up being a tad fair to the 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.140
 end of the day let's give you to 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.610
 use the smartphone but without going 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.940
 something that more and more users 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.160
 we demand as a main option and in what 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.680
 that a lot of smartphones are already 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.050
 putting the batteries by the way has 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.840
 also integrated wireless charging your 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.120
 Microusb port is compatible with slim 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.860
 port is to say that with the corresponding 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.830
 adapter we can plug it into 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.850
 devices using hdmi that is 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.530
 micro usb hdmi and projectors screens 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.330
 the TV of your house what you want for 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.430
 against is not compatible with usb 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.350
 on-the-go a functionality to which 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.270
 many androids are already more than 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:42.800
 accustomed has double wifi 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:45.520
 nfc band bluetooth 4.0 connectivity 4g 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.150
 lte where available 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.270
 the compass gyroscope accelerometer 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:54.879
 pressure sensor and of course gps 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.259
 but if interesting is your hardware does not 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:59.110
 less interesting is the new version 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:04.240
 of the operating system kitkat that activates 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:06.069
 for example functions like ok google 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.979
 now we could tell him what we 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:11.530
 give the win that yes in English because 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:13.000
 still in Spanish is not active with what 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.069
 which I had to put the 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.569
 text recognition in English for 

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:18.669
 to be able to speak to him yes it is true that 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:21.099
 functions for example the location 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:24.680
 gps works even if I speak to you in English 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:28.990
 for example ok google 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.990
 binner stress transformation 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.690
 and then he tells me what are the 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.000
 restaurants that are closer and 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.880
 I just have to open it in 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.669
 google maps and it would even indicate me the 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.800
 way its price is walking since ya ya 

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:47.990
 I 've said it before so for your 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.330
 extraordinary value for money 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.520
 for its screen for its power and for 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:56.120
 integrate android like your parents what 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:59.870
 brought to the world has earned our 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.820
 stamp clip ete and you know if you want 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.470
 know more about smartphones or about 

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.630
 Any other gadget can visit us 

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:09.250
 in clipset the technology easy and 

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.250
 fun until the next video grama
