you<00:01:40.290> should<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> option<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> where<00:01:41.610> you

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you should have the option of where you

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.490 
you should have the option of where you
want<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.000> throw<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.360> how<00:01:42.750> much<00:01:42.960> power<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> an

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
us a lot of options as manager and I

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.990 
us a lot of options as manager and I
think<00:02:43.110> that'll<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.319> great<00:02:43.620> as<00:02:43.890> well<00:02:43.920> I'd<00:02:44.819> like

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
think that'll be great as well I'd like

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.699 
think that'll be great as well I'd like
to<00:02:45.150> see<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.300> lot<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.480> customization<00:02:45.900> options<00:02:46.560> as

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
to see a lot of customization options as

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.800 
to see a lot of customization options as
well<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.220> think<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:48.030> regular<00:02:48.360> channels<00:02:48.630> to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
well I think that regular channels to

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.960 
well I think that regular channels to
does<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.769> well<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.310> obviously<00:02:50.459> like<00:02:50.850> to

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
does it well but you obviously like to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.090 
does it well but you obviously like to
see<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> bit<00:02:51.390> more<00:02:51.540> expensive<00:02:51.840> especially<00:02:52.620> if

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
see a bit more expensive especially if

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.320 
see a bit more expensive especially if
there's<00:02:53.580> not<00:02:53.760> going<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.940> be<00:02:54.030> Northern

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
there's not going to be Northern

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.660 
there's not going to be Northern

Hemisphere licensing and regulatory not
confer<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.269> think<00:02:57.510> it's<00:02:57.690> pretty<00:02:58.200> much<00:02:58.410> done

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
confer I think it's pretty much done

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.900 
confer I think it's pretty much done
that<00:02:58.950> Nolan<00:02:59.220> emissary<00:02:59.519> it's<00:02:59.640> going<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.819> be<00:02:59.880> a
