00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.940
 born of a comprehensive research into 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.469
 aerodynamic and a narrow 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.440
 collaboration with the champion of 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.169
 tim o triathlon in the aude the 1,118 and 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.169
 the champion bike homologated by the uci 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.669
 the 118 benefits from all the benefits of 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.640
 monbahu lamps either 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:28.150
 aerodynamics rigidity comfort 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:36.250
 and lightness the aerodynamic frame 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:37.870
 218 and technologies this technology of 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.000
 digital support allowed us to 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.729
 sign and analyze the movements 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.650
 air around the cap to maximize 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.470
 the effectiveness of each section of the 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.809
 presentism the results we have 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.640
 amazed at its gains in efficiency and 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.799
 performance confirmed by 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.510
 results in dimensional sulfur 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.760
 will translate when you cross the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.590
 finish line of the next to evil by 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.790
 a reduction of only 7 minutes 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.740
 give them to me in the wind tunnel are 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.190
 that an aspect of real performance that 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.990
 the 918 can deliver the other part 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.630
 of the equation lies in the efficiency 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.320
 aerodynamic also gets cook 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.130
 position the observations for that the 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.560
 ft 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.840
 as a concise golden artist more than one 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.409
 aerodynamic and comfortable position 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.229
 which is called innovative geometry 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.579
 to a trail respects both the 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.390
 morphology and flaps each 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.040
 cyclist yet our positions 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.020
 as soon as the day of 4 elements 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.000
 essential to aerodynamics and 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.630
 comfort of a bike it is only a 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.400
 part of all in argon effect 18 is the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.800
 first bike manufacturer in the world to 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.510
 to offer total integration thanks 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.120
 to web 2.0 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.090
 this exclusive device that were 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.850
 known whose reversible to complete 7500

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.610
 the morphology of each cyclist in 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.290
 effect on each size of frames the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.300
 feels years can be adjusted to a length 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.760
 from 65 or 84th 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.220
 furthermore the guide we have thanks to his 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.530
