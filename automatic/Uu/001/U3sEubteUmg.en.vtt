00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that stereotypical Mesa sound that you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.619 
that stereotypical Mesa sound that you
hear<00:00:38.420> but<00:00:39.420> still<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.320> has<00:00:40.469> its<00:00:40.680> own<00:00:40.800> character

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
hear but still it has its own character

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.610 
hear but still it has its own character
so<00:00:42.629> I'm<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> do<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.079> first<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
so I'm going to do it first with the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.430 
so I'm going to do it first with the
contour<00:00:44.040> switch<00:00:44.640> off<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.329> then<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.260> will

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
contour switch off and then I will

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.510 
contour switch off and then I will
engage<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.280> contour<00:00:47.789> switch<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:50.399> will

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
engage the contour switch and you will

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.620 
engage the contour switch and you will
definitely<00:00:50.700> hear<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.270> difference<00:00:51.660> alright
