00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.580
 as she alone everyone squeezes 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.470
 and who today find themselves for the 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.119
 episode 6 of the comparative maps of 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.970
 14 drums with 15 drums cards 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.310
 today a player what he knows the 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.599
 promises of the series you will see two 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.400
 players who have been transferred a few 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.039
 small post changes that's fine 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.329
 send heavy guard and it's good 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.669
 go this is my first player 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.340
 it's ozil that goes from 87.2 general to 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.810
 86 he knows a small drop that's 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.100
 true that with the gunner if he did not 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.560
 did a great season he was a lot 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.820
 expected in the end the participation of 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.680
 forces that the strong euro that was coming 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.850
 mercato goes a little booster and I think 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.800
 that they can send heavy 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.350
 so as I lÃ© 10 to the general who 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.630
 decrease in speed it drops 2 years 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.950
 also at the shooting level it does not move at 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.310
 level of the passes they increase by 1 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.950
 the guts do not move the defense - 17 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.840
 and on top of 55 goes to 58.2 physics 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.730
 in Poland physics we spent immelt 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.870
 humal what is really a log I 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.480
 think it was the most player 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.640
 physics of fifa 14 in defense this is 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.300
 not a beefy player in front of it was going 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.730
 not despite his 65 speed so level 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.960
 general it increases from 1 scavo prenamed 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.970
 a very very good season 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.210
 his world cup that was not great 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.030
 but his season was pretty cool 165 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.830
 speed goes to 66 the wonder shot 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.159
 also the Easter pass the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.870
 dribble he goes from 68 to 71 at home 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.460
 he takes +3 I do not know why 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.120
 it's going to be the little bookseller on Sunday 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.100
 it goes from 81.6 defense to 88 and they 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.390
 are 85 of head goes to 70 cities of 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.070
 finish I do not understand why 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.659
 which 68 while it's one of 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.549
 most physical players while we have 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.549
 seen from the screen that had destroyed at 90 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.080
 tv what was 85.86 I think I 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.280
 think that two huge ones would have deserved a 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.380
 good 85 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.640
 especially they are really physical whose 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.840
 I think they have a little nervous who 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.549
 is I think they were a little 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.380
 terrier way they had a little bit 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.170
 patch and all that 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.030
 the neymar is the first player 5 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.720
 stars that I have in presented in the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.640
 series so he passes two buses to elderly 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.759
 already it's a very good thing at least 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.340
 we can redo scot builder in 4 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.569
 3 3 with neymar on the left side because 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.250
 we are forced to tense but 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.480
 frankly me neymar but I do not like 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.760
 too much because he's not too physical 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.099
 and dribbling with the blunders it's true 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.239
 it's a bit it's not super great 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.760
 one is where tone for the cage 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.709
 I prefer to live on one side from 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.690
 on a wing on a corner we made our 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.290
 little gray gray to profit our center where 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.299
 we will score directly from the flat of the foot or 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.640
 afterwards it's up to you 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.950
 so the neymar phase from 84 to 86 6 assists 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.360
 of old goal as I say his speed does not 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.860
 do not move if you have not moved 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.860
 because downhill cellar the dribbles do not 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.540
 not move the defense - 13 and he had he 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.900
 has so many heads who has physics 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.459
 this year some we say yeah he 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.380
 also finds a stadium to increase 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.750
 In general, I think it's more 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.360
 secondary stages like everything that is 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.069
 the effects the strikes by far and 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.530
 all who have to make it increase in 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.010
 general but not specifically on the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.569
 card a transferred player is not 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.250
 totally transfer is a return of 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.569
 ready he was at chelsea the capital was 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.370
 the disco global delirium throne to 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.190
 chelsea beat boncourt bulls engaged 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.420
 I really appreciate very strong 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.280
 I really find it very very strong 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.540
 for me it may be one of the 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.310
 best goalkeepers in the world or even 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.139
 the best goalkeeper in the world by day 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.280
 present-day 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.720
 there he has with chelsea I saw some 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.030
 videos of him already he made him 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.910
 some rescues three enough members 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:36.579
 well level stats general it increases from 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:39.220
 two dives it goes from 82 to 84 game to 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.880
 the 88 to 96 hand that loses a 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.780
 his clearance at foot 69 yet I 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.430
 find that he does not have a bad 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.930
 clearance 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.730
 before he had 86 of fx he goes to 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.250
 88 the speed does not move and they 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.290
 earn more positioning is a 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.510
 the biggest transfers that there have been 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.650
 during this transfer window for rough regret 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.200
 which is a little revelation of the 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.879
 World Cup has a bit expensive for my taste 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.450
 but if the real has the means to the 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.189
 pay so much Hebrew he goes from 83 to 86.2 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.349
 general they go from monaco to real 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.269
 madrid and especially he goes from winger 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.420
 right to offensive midfield so I think 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.359
 that it's a good thing for him for 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.829
 we at the level of fifa pardon level 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.400
 stats because these are nineteen of 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.740
 speed at 80 79 holds at 80 90 pass 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.949
 at 84 and they do not move the defense - 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.660
 cast and the 66 of head on fifa 14 which 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.090
 goes to 72.2 physical so pretty 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.830
 physics in euros gains not find 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.169
 I did not find me on this figure 14 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.900
 and I did not think it's true he has 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.430
 known a lot of cards boost hot in 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.539
 man of the match and all so how 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.270
 would I think it was a good 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.400
 relationship that amounts to 14 of this 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.889
 year on the figure to 14 during the 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.699
 debate and express myself on e bay is 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.370
 sometimes two levels in general I 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.440
 finds that 86 and torso neymar then 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.979
 that rodrigues did that one year ago that he is 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.300
 really at the top level we'll say so 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.560
 I think it's a bit too much 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.389
 increase but hey I think she does 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.430
 a huge world cup saw him 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:07.080
 at the madrid real to take over a 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.130
 point that what would have remained in Monaco 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.110
 we'll see what will happen on 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.449
 fifa 14 months I had tested on fugain 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.159
 however I had tested in toc really 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.449
 very nice and we pulled it was goal 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.710
 frankly and guarantee and its beginnings 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.330
 for those who have the means if you 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.190
 can you pay it the attested the before 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.110
 that everyone and you will see that he is going 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.820
 make you want 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.020
 I hope you enjoyed episode 6 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.380
 for me it's still a big 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.820
 pleasure 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.800
 frankly approaches the big players 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.750
 at that we still see 86 I think 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.780
 for next May episode unfortunate posted 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.949
 on the next episode of the 87 past this 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.659
 comment that is always a pleasure 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.250
 the little one like when I see the bar of 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.880
 the adq is very green frankly it's me 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.310
 please 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.310
 it is Ã©ric blow hard by piece
