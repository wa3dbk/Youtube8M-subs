00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
the regular cross so from here I'm going

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.410 
the regular cross so from here I'm going
to<00:01:28.100> stretch<00:01:28.280> out<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.670> last<00:01:28.880> ten<00:01:29.120> percent

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
to stretch out and the last ten percent

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.580 
to stretch out and the last ten percent
I'm<00:01:29.480> going<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.660> turn<00:01:29.780> my<00:01:29.960> hand<00:01:30.110> over<00:01:30.410> you<00:01:30.500> know

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
I'm going to turn my hand over you know

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.750 
I'm going to turn my hand over you know
it's<00:01:30.710> my<00:01:30.830> elbow<00:01:31.040> still<00:01:31.220> didn't<00:01:31.460> touch<00:01:31.610> the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
to my fighting stance and the whole time

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.830 
to my fighting stance and the whole time
my<00:01:37.310> elbow<00:01:37.580> does<00:01:37.730> not<00:01:37.910> touch<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.420> wall<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:38.780> I'm

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
my elbow does not touch the wall so I'm

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.560 
my elbow does not touch the wall so I'm
going<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:38.990> extend<00:01:39.260> in<00:01:39.470> turn<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.360> punch<00:01:41.360> and

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
going to extend in turn and punch and

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.660 
going to extend in turn and punch and
bring<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:42.260> back<00:01:42.290> to<00:01:42.440> my<00:01:42.680> stance<00:01:42.980> now<00:01:43.430> it's<00:01:43.520> very

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
my hand is just as close as my elbow is

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.390 
my hand is just as close as my elbow is
to<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.090> wall<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.570> seem<00:01:53.780> very<00:01:53.810> tight<00:01:54.230> now<00:01:54.950> the

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
touch now you might run into the problem

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.220 
touch now you might run into the problem
of<00:02:13.129> bringing<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.579> hand<00:02:13.760> back

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
of bringing the hand back

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.140 
of bringing the hand back
the<00:02:14.440> wall<00:02:14.590> or<00:02:14.769> even<00:02:15.310> turning<00:02:15.610> me<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.819> little<00:02:16.000> bit

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
the wall or even turning me a little bit

and then bring it back now the key is as
you<00:02:21.549> get<00:02:21.670> better<00:02:21.819> it<00:02:22.000> has<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.209> be<00:02:22.330> fastest<00:02:22.780> but

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
you get better it has to be fastest but

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.610 
you get better it has to be fastest but
to<00:02:23.379> start<00:02:23.680> go<00:02:24.129> slow<00:02:24.459> turn<00:02:25.260> bring<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.379> back<00:02:26.590> and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
to start go slow turn bring it back and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.920 
to start go slow turn bring it back and
never<00:02:27.370> touch<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.790> wall<00:02:27.940> with<00:02:28.090> your<00:02:28.180> own<00:02:28.299> all

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the mechanics are the cross and back and

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.080 
the mechanics are the cross and back and
then<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.660> get<00:02:31.780> better<00:02:32.129> so<00:02:33.129> you<00:02:33.160> don't<00:02:33.400> hear

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
just like you're fighting this like a

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.589 
just like you're fighting this like a
shadow<00:03:57.310> boxing<00:03:57.760> like<00:03:58.299> you're<00:03:58.419> hitting<00:03:58.510> the

now<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:01.030> whole<00:04:01.180> idea<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.540> don't<00:04:01.599> want<00:04:01.840> to

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
now the whole idea is I don't want to

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.839 
now the whole idea is I don't want to
touch<00:04:02.049> my<00:04:02.290> elbow<00:04:02.620> on<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.739> wall<00:04:02.950> if<00:04:03.129> i<00:04:03.489> touch<00:04:03.549> my

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
touch my elbow on the wall if i touch my

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.099 
touch my elbow on the wall if i touch my
up<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.209> wall<00:04:04.359> that<00:04:04.389> means<00:04:04.720> i<00:04:04.810> did<00:04:04.989> the

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
up on the wall that means i did the

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.199 
up on the wall that means i did the
punch<00:04:05.379> incorrectly<00:04:06.190> so<00:04:06.519> i<00:04:06.730> want<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.090> to

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
punch incorrectly so i want you to

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.789 
punch incorrectly so i want you to
extend<00:04:07.389> the<00:04:07.629> punch<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.109> working<00:04:08.590> on<00:04:08.680> that

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
extend the punch and working on that

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:09.960 
extend the punch and working on that
principle<00:04:09.040> getting<00:04:09.549> ninety<00:04:09.849> percent

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
principle getting ninety percent

principle getting ninety percent
extended<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:10.810> then<00:04:11.410> you're<00:04:11.530> going<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.680> turn

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
extended and then you're going to turn

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.860 
extended and then you're going to turn
the<00:04:12.010> palm<00:04:12.220> over<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:13.269> make<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:13.720> connection

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
the palm over and make the connection

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.050

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
here so you hit him in the face or even

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.430 
here so you hit him in the face or even
if<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.209> miss<00:04:16.389> it<00:04:16.539> doesn't<00:04:16.780> matter<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.109> then

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
you need to turn it back right away and

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.390 
you need to turn it back right away and
in<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:19.650> then<00:04:19.980> you're<00:04:20.070> going<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.220> run<00:04:20.340> into

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
turn in the last ten percent okay then

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.450
