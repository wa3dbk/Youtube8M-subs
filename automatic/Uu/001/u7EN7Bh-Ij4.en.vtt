00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.320
 hello to all and with that of tests 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.120
 mobile.fr we are at lg who we 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.620
 present his g3 then you have 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.440
 may have already seen my grip on a 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.630
 little bit long of the g3 there what I you 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.310
 offers more access to design 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.869
 since in the grip there was 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.660
 the cover and it was not very convenient 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.449
 so here we have a version without cover 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.460
 so in a prior edition 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.130
 customized for an operator does 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:36.120
 no attention logo that has behind 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.120
 so here is the g3 with thin borders 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.879
 if he wants it right for you 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.309
 see edge of the border super movie so that 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.809
 it's not bad at the top I'll try to 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.679
 to show you that I'm going to put a little 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:53.249
 blow it's super complicated we're going 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.249
 brighten a little 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.079
 always a little complicated but you 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.350
 guess the just notification letter 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.210
 here the front camera its 2.1 if I get 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.520
 not deceive megapixel audio output 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.170
 just right here is a classic 1 pop in 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.210
 down we have a small area 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.440
 a little shiny a little strange 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.729
 by the way, but why not name 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.909
 it is rather no it is rather original 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.440
 to the idians here like that who will depend 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.539
 so here it is a version 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.479
 gray but if you have the gold version 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:30.380
 gold where there is what dotia I believe there is 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:34.310
 a weird red kind you'll have the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.560
 shade of color also there in the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.720
 slices absolutely nothing in the 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.069
 slices of course since you have the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.390
 button on the back so there I you 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:42.560
 shows quickly but it's true that 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.850
 nothing to do and I pressed 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.679
 keys at the same time oh nothing to report 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.789
 apart from the main mic I try to 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:54.289
 to show you it's always a little 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.850
 complicated here I said to myself micro 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.619
 mainly secondary micro that is 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.920
 here and there there is the knows the port 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.690
 infrared for remote control function 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.179
 this is still a Korean version 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.369
 so there is the little antenna but 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.709
 you will have painted it at home a priori 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:15.110
 I did not break him 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:19.060
 hop and back the jack sorry for 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.849
 that thanks coco 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.319
 here is the jack and the main pickup 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.849
 so at the back it may be the 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.200
 more important important interesting 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:31.800
 you have this kind of coke that's 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.660
 plastic with a brushed aluminum effect 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:43.100
 this is not bad it makes quite good 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.100
 it makes quite good and bone 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.160
 the rear camera the button that was 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.720
 modified so it comes in a little bit more a 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.580
 double flash led with tone this I have 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.080
 talked about in the video and the laser 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.270
 that's about all we have two 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.100
 berries some beautiful curves that's 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.230
 rather not bad when I take it in 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.140
 hand to hand this is a little idea 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.340
 we had 5 points and is 5 inches 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.900
 rather light is what I have the weight 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.010
 under the eyes no I do not have the weight 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.890
 under the eyes sorry but he looks 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.900
 rather and I then of course have one hand 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.430
 good she said that here it is 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.720
 optimized to use a thin and 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.370
 5 points 5 inches it remains difficult 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.140
 to use a hand to look at my thumb 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.060
 and yet I have no hands 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.820
 especially small it's a little bit 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.500
 complicated of course but you can 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.280
 you can everything you can always the 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:36.330
 time t1 and after that the double tap on 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.120
 the screen for ergonomics the touch offers 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:45.320
 here the note claude also so I think 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:47.400
 that's it's place no I do not know anymore 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.170
 I do not know our culture this 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.690
 device c1 1 1 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.950
 okay okay if you know if you 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.510
 did not know the code name 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.530
 it's a system that allows you to 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.690
 unlock the terminal directly if 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.980
 I want to go well I do not know if that 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.780
 it works it's a demo version 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.370
 and see what they are changing all the time 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.330
 the code as my opinion it is not 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.890
 determined 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.750
 Robin Short, that's about all 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.910
 for the design of a rather nice design 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.280
 that do not change very much by 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.830
 report to g2 is also in a 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.030
 next video i would compare the g2o g3 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.040
 from a design point of view is a small 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.040
 little interface soon
