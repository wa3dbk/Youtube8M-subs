00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
13 I think

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.740 
13 I think
PCM<00:02:26.920> 13<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:27.609> it's<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.819> same<00:02:28.000> as<00:02:28.060> doing<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.599> T's

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
PCM 13 so it's the same as doing the T's

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.380 
PCM 13 so it's the same as doing the T's
at<00:02:28.900> 60<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:29.439> if<00:02:29.500> you're<00:02:29.620> upgrading<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.390> then

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
at 60 so if you're upgrading and then

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.280 
at 60 so if you're upgrading and then
that's<00:02:31.780> fine

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
that's fine

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:48.809 
that's fine
you<00:02:32.379> get<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.560> same<00:02:32.739> battery<00:02:43.500> Oh<00:02:47.519> upside<00:02:48.519> down

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
you get the same battery Oh upside down

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.750 
you get the same battery Oh upside down
