00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.859
 It will not be difficult for him to be a dancer. 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:46.650
 even harder 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.860
 epic set to give the maximum 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.980

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.649
 I'm glad to be here. 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:08.689
 really 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.980
 it's a way of working what's this? 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.980
 it's the year 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:19.679

 many many years 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.099
 These guys make a lot of effort. 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.749
 I trained a lot 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.189
 people often do not believe 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.189
 but they believe that the protests should be punished 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.109
 the function of the artist's art 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.689
 that same 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.000
 I think that because of the great artist situation, it's not just what I saw in the 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:43.589
 stage we have our own daughter 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:48.559
 but for the sake of your life story, after all this we go to what 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:50.729
 interests why 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:55.859
 wonderful choreography by afghans in choreography contract choreography of 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.489
 group I think has some elements that still do not understand what they understood 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.759
 in the heart of his proposal but I did not because he has to have a physical 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:08.409
 that much more disciplined because this group has all the talent but as soon as 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.249
 people there that you have to play the handle understood that they are very 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:14.909
 both physically backward 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.309
 understand this as best you can 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:20.669
 how technically 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.110
 it is in this framework of the king's daughter 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.969
 initially all 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.150
 Congratulations, the first one. 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.120

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:34.400
 I will not always have 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.720
 I do not know if it's a group that has 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.409
 we do not have a white board 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.379
 I think you have to 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.419
 but you have to devote more time to 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:48.749
 for a while 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.800
 remember not as an incentive to keep fighting 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.879
