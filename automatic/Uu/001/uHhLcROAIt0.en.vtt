00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hogan people i'm welcome butchers 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.350
 to my picture osram kassel guide to 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.970
 chaos crystal cave all important 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.550
 As always you will find information in 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.679
 the video description the jumping 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.929
 Kassel is located in the southwest 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.949
 the card travel marshes that it is on the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.220
 World map in the far northeast of the next 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.990
 mark here is old poke ruin of 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.010
 here as well as for jumping 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.990
 kassel start off this way 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.340
 we have to start preparing a lot 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.530
 for this jumping not kassel 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.870
 However , here is a speed bach 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.850
 helpful in some places and 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.829
 a second player alone is this 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.430
 jumping kassel relatively hard too 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.920
 You then need a lot to master 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.059
 Offensive power in the long-distance fight as 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.559
 melee side since pretty 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.780
 a fix so I got myself here 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.780
 today support will be brought 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.239
 that make doping fit in pairs follows 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:03.480
 So here's my way off the mark 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:07.129
 from here to the western wall here goes 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.129
 it then up 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:15.100
 past these bats always 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.920
 continue up and then you will see here 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.119
 between the scrub a cave in the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.740
 you can save in but you have to 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.509
 be careful that you are really down in the 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.420
 water land and not on the somehow 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.979
 stone that is relatively hard to see 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.170
 but somehow trying to do so 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.289
 jump as centrally as possible so you too 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.450
 lands in the water and then you are in 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.619
 principle already in the cave and 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.819
 then it starts under water 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.469
 a small dive 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.739
 At the moment it is not here yet 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.079
 Hard that is even alone 

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:50.090
 However, we are then in the same 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.159
 chaos crystal cave where there are some 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.860
 Things to note but that will be 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.689
 I'll show you right then that here 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.929
 the cave is the jumping class itself 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:03.349
 is not that hard in principle 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.299
 since we only have these stone columns here 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:07.369
 have to hop in the once 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.969
 zigzag back and forth to the end and 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.190
 that's it 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.440
 Actually, however, are already left 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.470
 and right next to this should everywhere 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.750
 opponents and these opponents attack us 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.540
 and that's going to be pretty annoying 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.540
 my partner here too for now 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.700
 run this video on the side and me the 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.859
 Keep opponents from neck while I am here 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.950
 long jump also see you here 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:33.470
 again and again this year 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.910
 These thunderstorms appear here 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.950
 Everywhere we are from such a storm 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.950
 you will get hit one 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.359
 random stream and can also be a 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.799
 Diebach be like you see I was 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.819
 now, for example, slows it down 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.730
 I have to start over again 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:53.090
 There are different types of steel 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.280
 either you are slowing down or the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.950
 camera zooms far out or the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.810
 camera zooms in close ran or receive 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.160
 a speedboat or you are getting big 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.079
 or you become very small 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.819
 different things a few things 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.740
 Well some things are really good 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.840
 very negative 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.730
 if you just do not like it 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.940
 which you get so if it is more 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.960
 Thief is then just stop 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.760
 the place and wait until you the 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.120
 So next run gets up to the cloud 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.340
 Again you and you 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.170
 then you can continue now, for example 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.490
 I have the ba front of the camera 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.810
 entire zoom back since you can then 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.060
 really do not do anything then it says 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.100
 really just stop and then 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.720
 wait until you get the new one now 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.740
 For example, I am very small at the moment 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.840
 and then she just keeps going 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.760
 Incidentally, this is an important point 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.470
 if you should fall down here 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.480
 By the way, you do not have to complete the whole thing 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.580
 make jumping kassel of new once you 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.320
 down then loses all her falls well 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.090
 bugs and the mavs and you can 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.160
 this place on this stone is the one 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.650
 the only thing you can do here 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.360
 even with a little skill just like that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.590
 directly jump up again as you can see 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.300
 So you do not have to start from the beginning 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.710
 start again because they are down 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.110
 could fall about half of the 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:10.130
 abbreviate campsite here 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.020
 now I've become very small so 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.520
 continues 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.200
 The jumps are actually consistently 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.670
 not really difficult 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.770
 however, the opponents are the halt 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.810
 really annoying get in between 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.400
 appear 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.229
 and make a 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.490
 that partly real hard now I can 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.470
 I have to wait again until the camera 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.009
 out are so I can, of course, 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.289
 impossible to jump around it just wait 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.460
 until you get the next one and then you can 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.350
 it also continues to go now I have 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.210
 I 'd rather get a speed again 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.130
 fallen down a moment must be 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.389
 Run to the spot again so I am 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:47.210
 back up it can go on 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:49.789
 and on it goes already the jumps 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.729
 be absolutely no problem if you 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.020
 luck has you get those flashes too 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.750
 not at all and then you come here 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.400
 actually relatively easy by now 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.470
 right in the jump I have just that 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.210
 the baw got knocked out so I'll grow up 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.100
 the problem is that these flashes only 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.419
 on certain stones change I have to 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.850
 now jump back with it me 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.440
 which the baw can get rid of now 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.750
 For example, now I am totally 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.120
 I do not really like that either 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.160
 I am now waiting again briefly to that 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.240
 the next is that it's better 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.220
 be very small 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.729
 that's the way to jump 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.190
 to do relatively well 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.050
 it should have done soon 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.870
 if I do not have one yet 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.960
 linked the bachab war or something 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:36.010
 but again, you can get up close and healthy 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.930
 already that is partly really annoying here 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.669
 What happens here and in addition with 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.240
 may then even opponents 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:46.960
 Of course this is really nasty 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.460
 but we will have it soon 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.039
 we are nearing the end 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.599
 some of those opponents who are us 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.250
 even ranged attacks attack you here 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.380
 can support and that is just 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.479
 really angry if you even from the 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.430
 that will be hurled at opponents 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.320
 Of course you are totally annoying but as soon as possible 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.659
 you are here at this box 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.909
 her the achievement that you this 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.440
 jumping basel did the chaos 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.990
 crystal cave can be found here at the 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.300
 get your reward and then over 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.949
 this portal here again from this 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.409
 cave comes out what happens when 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.639
 you betray this portal 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:21.490
 I do not know that yourself 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.050
 do not be afraid there is nothing wrong 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.310
 but then I will see that 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.249
 say goodbye to me with these words and 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.729
 we look into the detail 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:28.729
 people
