00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
wishing as this runner is approaching me

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.810

and<00:01:33.990> he's<00:01:34.470> getting<00:01:34.710> three<00:01:35.040> lines<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and he's getting three lines of the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.140 
and he's getting three lines of the
defense<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.479> someone<00:01:36.930> else<00:01:37.140> will<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:38.150> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
defense that someone else will do it and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.560 
defense that someone else will do it and
I<00:01:39.960> watch<00:01:41.390> each<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> levels<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.290> he

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
I watch each of the levels that he

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.090 
I watch each of the levels that he
certainly<00:01:45.570> travels<00:01:46.259> through<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.770> first

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
certainly travels through the first

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.639 
certainly travels through the first
level<00:01:47.340> which<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.479> defensive<00:01:49.020> line<00:01:49.259> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
level which is the defensive line and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.200
