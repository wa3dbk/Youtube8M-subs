see there we do have the engine warning

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.549 
see there we do have the engine warning
light<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:08.389> now<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.450> try<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:09.870> diagnose<00:00:10.290> what

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
light on now to try and diagnose what

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.709 
light on now to try and diagnose what
the<00:00:10.590> fault<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.099> we're<00:00:11.849> going<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> use<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.509> eye

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
the fault is we're going to use this eye

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.790 
the fault is we're going to use this eye
car<00:00:13.200> soft<00:00:14.120> i-90<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.330> multi-system<00:00:16.109> scan<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.650> it

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
car soft i-90 to multi-system scan to it

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.820 
car soft i-90 to multi-system scan to it
it<00:00:17.279> will<00:00:17.369> scan<00:00:17.730> sort<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.630> most<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> systems

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
it will scan sort of most of the systems

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.720 
it will scan sort of most of the systems
within<00:00:20.160> your<00:00:20.430> Vauxhall<00:00:20.910> or<00:00:21.150> pal<00:00:21.330> vehicle<00:00:22.730> but

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
within your Vauxhall or pal vehicle but

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.689 
within your Vauxhall or pal vehicle but
first<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.150> all<00:00:24.269> what<00:00:24.480> we'll<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.960> we'll

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
first of all what we'll do is we'll

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.500 
first of all what we'll do is we'll
obviously<00:00:26.699> we've<00:00:26.820> hooked<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.180> up<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
obviously we've hooked it up to the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.980 
obviously we've hooked it up to the
diagnostic<00:00:27.960> port<00:00:28.349> as<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.650> can<00:00:28.800> see<00:00:28.949> here<00:00:29.990> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
diagnostic port as you can see here and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.999 
diagnostic port as you can see here and
what<00:00:31.170> we're<00:00:31.289> going<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.710> we're<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:31.949> to

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.639 
what we're going to do is we're going to
go<00:00:32.160> through<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> diagnostic<00:00:32.790> menu<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.930> see

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
go through the diagnostic menu and see

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.260 
go through the diagnostic menu and see
if<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:34.980> find<00:00:35.280> out<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> problem<00:00:36.149> is

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
if we can find out what the problem is

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.600 
if we can find out what the problem is
and<00:00:37.079> why<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> engine<00:00:38.100> light<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:40.610> we're

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
and why the engine light is on so we're

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.470 
and why the engine light is on so we're
in<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> 2000<00:00:42.510> model<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:47.000> that's<00:00:48.000> an<00:00:48.180> Astra<00:00:48.690> G

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
in a 2000 model here that's an Astra G

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.869 
in a 2000 model here that's an Astra G
the<00:00:51.480> 1.6<00:00:52.140> engine<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:52.980> 1/6

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.779 

we<00:00:56.879> got<00:00:57.059> manual<00:00:57.600> select<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:59.399> can't<00:00:59.640> actually

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
we got manual select you can't actually

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.760 
we got manual select you can't actually
go<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.210> diagnose<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> systems<00:01:01.500> just

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
go and diagnose all of the systems just

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.529 
go and diagnose all of the systems just
clip<00:01:01.949> by<00:01:02.100> clicking<00:01:02.340> automatic<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.420> you're

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
not sure where fault may lie it will

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.420 
not sure where fault may lie it will
automatically<00:01:06.479> find<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.930> for<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:08.310> the

automatically find it for you but the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.469 
automatically find it for you but the
engine<00:01:08.760> module<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.420> x16<00:01:10.409> XEL<00:01:11.479> depending

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
engine module is the x16 XEL depending

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.080 
engine module is the x16 XEL depending
on<00:01:12.570> which<00:01:12.720> option<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.080> choose<00:01:13.320> earlier<00:01:14.090> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
on which option you choose earlier and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.719 
on which option you choose earlier and
we're<00:01:15.270> gonna<00:01:15.420> see<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.900> go<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.729> read

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
we're gonna see if we can go in and read

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.630 
we're gonna see if we can go in and read
the<00:01:18.210> dtc<00:01:19.080> which<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.439> diagnostic<00:01:20.100> trouble<00:01:20.400> code

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.670 

alright<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.119> see<00:01:24.270> there<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.570> have

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
alright so as you can see there we have

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.990 
alright so as you can see there we have
cold<00:01:25.680> P<00:01:26.340> zero<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.689> zero<00:01:27.990> five<00:01:28.770> zero<00:01:29.070> zero<00:01:29.700> two

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
cold P zero one zero five zero zero two

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.390 
cold P zero one zero five zero zero two
and<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.840> gives<00:01:31.049> us<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.439> bit<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.650> information<00:01:32.009> to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
and it gives us a bit of information to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.179 
and it gives us a bit of information to
see<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> map<00:01:33.030> sensor<00:01:33.680> has<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> lower

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
see that the map sensor has a lower

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.530 
see that the map sensor has a lower
voltage

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.520 

okay<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.600> what<00:01:39.870> we're<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.380> we're

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
okay so what we're going to do is we're

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.430 
okay so what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:40.830> ahead<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:42.080> take<00:01:43.080> a<00:01:43.110> look<00:01:43.350> at

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
going to go ahead and take a look at

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.280 
going to go ahead and take a look at
that<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.909> bit<00:01:44.909> closer<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:45.900> we'll<00:01:46.049> come

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
that a bit closer and then we'll come

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.660 
that a bit closer and then we'll come
back<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:46.890> if<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.130> get<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> engine

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
back and see if we can get the engine

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.760 
back and see if we can get the engine
light<00:01:47.820> cleared<00:01:50.720> all<00:01:51.720> right<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.200> we've<00:01:52.409> put<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
light cleared all right so we've put a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.510 
light cleared all right so we've put a
new<00:01:53.009> map<00:01:53.250> sensor<00:01:54.560> into<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.740> ostrich<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.340> was

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
new map sensor into this ostrich it was

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.980 
new map sensor into this ostrich it was
quite<00:01:56.700> easy<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.570> engine<00:01:57.840> light<00:01:57.960> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
quite easy to do the engine light is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.389 
quite easy to do the engine light is
still<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.470> so<00:01:58.680> what<00:01:58.830> we<00:01:58.920> need<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> do<00:01:59.220> is<00:01:59.340> we

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
still on so what we need to do is we

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.800 
still on so what we need to do is we
need<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.580> go<00:01:59.700> ahead<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.030> connect<00:02:00.330> it<00:02:00.479> all<00:02:00.630> up

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
need to go ahead and connect it all up

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.600 
need to go ahead and connect it all up
and<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:01.619> what<00:02:01.800> we'll<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.250> we'll<00:02:02.369> come

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
and then what we'll do is we'll come

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.010 
and then what we'll do is we'll come
back<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.000> when<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.180> should<00:02:03.390> see<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.690> engine

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
back and when you should see the engine

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:14.210 
back and when you should see the engine
light<00:02:04.200> disappearing<00:02:12.800> so<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.070> where

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
light disappearing so this is where

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.620 
light disappearing so this is where
we're<00:02:14.400> connecting<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.910> map<00:02:15.090> sensor

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.940 

connect<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.440> up<00:02:20.530> there<00:02:20.710> now<00:02:24.390> what<00:02:25.390> you'll<00:02:25.540> see

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
connect it up there now what you'll see

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.320 
connect it up there now what you'll see
is<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.130> engine<00:02:27.490> like<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.820> just<00:02:28.000> seen<00:02:28.210> it

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
is the engine like you just seen it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:38.070 
is the engine like you just seen it
disappear<00:02:28.780> there<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.980> what<00:02:36.130> we<00:02:36.220> can<00:02:36.400> now<00:02:36.550> do<00:02:37.080> is

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
disappear there so what we can now do is

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.780 
disappear there so what we can now do is
go<00:02:38.410> in<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.680> see<00:02:38.860> if<00:02:38.920> we<00:02:39.040> can<00:02:39.190> erase<00:02:39.580> the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
go in and see if we can erase the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.360 
go in and see if we can erase the
trouble<00:02:40.090> codes<00:02:40.300> should<00:02:43.950> be<00:02:44.950> able<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.190> clear

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
trouble codes should be able to clear

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.340 
trouble codes should be able to clear
this<00:02:45.550> code<00:02:45.790> now<00:02:48.900> there<00:02:49.900> we<00:02:49.990> go

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
this code now there we go

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.000 
this code now there we go
amazing<00:02:50.980> trouble<00:02:51.310> codes<00:02:51.580> suckseed<00:02:52.740> so<00:02:53.740> we<00:02:53.860> can

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
amazing trouble codes suckseed so we can

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.080 
amazing trouble codes suckseed so we can
just<00:02:54.130> go<00:02:54.340> back<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:55.650> read<00:02:56.650> trouble<00:02:57.040> codes<00:02:57.280> and

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
just go back in read trouble codes and

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.340 
just go back in read trouble codes and
there<00:02:58.810> we<00:02:58.900> have<00:02:59.020> it

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
there we have it

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.150 
there we have it
no<00:02:59.530> DTC's<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.720> that's<00:03:01.900> just<00:03:02.050> a<00:03:02.230> quick<00:03:02.440> way<00:03:02.890> of

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
no DTC's so that's just a quick way of

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.660 
no DTC's so that's just a quick way of
using<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.640> iCore<00:03:04.150> soft.i<00:03:05.070> 9:02<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.250> diagnose

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
using the iCore soft.i 9:02 to diagnose
