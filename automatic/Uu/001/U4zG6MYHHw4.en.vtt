this<00:03:46.940> tablet<00:03:47.180> is<00:03:47.450> pretty<00:03:48.260> good<00:03:48.500> one<00:03:49.100> drawback

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
this tablet is pretty good one drawback

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.570 
this tablet is pretty good one drawback
is<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:50.239> only<00:03:50.450> has<00:03:50.750> 2.4<00:03:51.410> gigahertz

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
is that it only has 2.4 gigahertz

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.949 
is that it only has 2.4 gigahertz
internet<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.730> doesn't<00:03:53.000> have<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.120> dual<00:03:53.420> band<00:03:53.690> so

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
internet it doesn't have a dual band so

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.140 
internet it doesn't have a dual band so
if<00:03:54.020> your<00:03:54.230> internet<00:03:54.800> is<00:03:54.830> 5<00:03:55.070> gigahertz<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:55.910> won't

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
if your internet is 5 gigahertz it won't

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.510 
if your internet is 5 gigahertz it won't
detect<00:03:56.420> it<00:03:56.690> will<00:03:56.810> only<00:03:57.020> detect<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.620> 2.4

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
detect it will only detect the 2.4

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.640 
detect it will only detect the 2.4
gigahertz<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:59.300> that<00:03:59.690> might<00:03:59.989> slow<00:04:00.140> down<00:04:00.260> some

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
gigahertz so that might slow down some

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.410 
gigahertz so that might slow down some
things<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.430> watching<00:04:01.700> videos<00:04:02.000> on<00:04:02.120> this<00:04:02.209> tablet

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
things so watching videos on this tablet
