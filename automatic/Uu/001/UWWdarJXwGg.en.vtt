00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:11.400
 well we are here in this game 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.630
 First of all, thank you very much 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.270

 display seriously thank you very much because 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.720
 all why 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.140
 but they like it not very well known I say no 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.869
 It is a well-known game 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.500
 first of all because good this game 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.500
 It is better known 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.789
 we have clothes not so much 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.510
 louis especially because simply by 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.510
 the fact of 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.220
 Well, what do Mario Karl do? 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 64 good good 74 as you can see I'm 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:55.050
 going up with are simultaneous with ones 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.880
 friends so now what to do mario 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.990
 kart individually if I am 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.100
 doing with friends 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.439
 he already lives with racing 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.759
 they're not doing a lot of people the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.380
 truth simply and zenit speedway 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:14.430
 because it's one of racing and just 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.840
 to be innovative and simply pioneer 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.020
 for that case it's not because I say good it's 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.320
 played the lyric racing the streets I went 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.140
 speedway or 6 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.229
 it's just for that why 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.820
 to be a little more creative now if 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.540
 he asks me and if I'm going to do I lived with 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.540
 racing 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:44.940
 it may be in the future 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:48.460
 not not far but not so close 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.550
 but it may be that it may be that 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.760
 I did it 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.690
 I just say that currently this 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.500
 time 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.330
 one of my inspiring players who 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.590
 it's with those I met 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.590
 it is doing now 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.409
 I will not name why 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.720
 because they assure 40 minds a lot of people 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.720
 will know who is 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.500
 Y 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.100
 the truth lives with racing is not that 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.800
 they do a lot but 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.370
 can be felled in the future if it can 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.650
 be but in the future and then you can 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.850
 be that now that I have capturing 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.870
 videos I bought video capture 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.500
 to make more games than in a 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.500
 future that in a foreground and thought 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.110
 do not do them because the emulator looked 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.350
 fatal 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.730
 It might make them now 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.040
 several games for the sake of example 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.360
 As you can see on my channel I have a 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.230
 list of several you like that I have 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.920
 thought of doing 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.920
 and not 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.710
 for example paper mario 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.080
 it was a let's play that of first 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.080
 I had thought to do is to say 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.290
 I had thought to do but 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.340
 Unfortunately 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.420
 I could not do it 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.420
 simply because 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.350
 first because it goes more graphically 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:32.070
 on 64th Street I saw it 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.370
 and that yes not now with the capture of 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.370
 video 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.620
 because I do not have both the download of the 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.420
 virtual console therefore the console 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.420
 virtual like own in 34 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.390
 but good 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:56.450
 removing all these things 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:59.750
 and leaving all this seriously many 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.120
 thank you all if you have seen everything 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.390
 you have seen in a couple of videos that 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.510
 you have seen 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.130
 this this video in concrete seriously 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:15.120
 thank you very much everyone why 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:19.040
 you make happy server 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.040
 seriously every time I see 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:27.020
 every time I see that there are people who 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.190
 says he just started to just 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.290
 have to go to the positive ones 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.270
 I'm very happy though I also 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.950
 I would like that if recommendations 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.420
 because the agreement is one that does not 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.170
 you think I'm pretty no more 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.170
 but anyway 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:48.229
 this presses them now a successor 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:52.210
 you will see it and hopefully that successor will 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.210
 like I will not give you clues 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.930
 and you will see it soon in order for nothing 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.849
