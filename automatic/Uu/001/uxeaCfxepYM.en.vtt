are two versions of that guy then next

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.749 
are two versions of that guy then next
to<00:01:06.189> that<00:01:06.310> guy<00:01:06.520> we<00:01:06.670> have<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.210> Halo<00:01:08.170> universe

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
to that guy we have the Halo universe

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.240 
to that guy we have the Halo universe
series<00:01:09.759> 2<00:01:09.939> I<00:01:09.970> think<00:01:10.119> it<00:01:10.360> was<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:11.259> white<00:01:11.650> mark<00:01:11.979> 6

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
series 2 I think it was the white mark 6

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.470 
series 2 I think it was the white mark 6
with<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.580> blue<00:01:12.760> secondary<00:01:13.360> color<00:01:15.270> actually<00:01:16.270> I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
with the blue secondary color actually I

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.730 
with the blue secondary color actually I
don't<00:01:16.630> think<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:16.930> shoulder<00:01:17.230> pad<00:01:17.410> should<00:01:17.620> be

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
don't think the shoulder pad should be

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.230 
don't think the shoulder pad should be
silver<00:01:18.100> if<00:01:18.220> its<00:01:18.400> secondary<00:01:18.790> either<00:01:19.000> way<00:01:19.090> he's

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
silver if its secondary either way he's

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.340 
silver if its secondary either way he's
not<00:01:19.390> supposed<00:01:19.510> to<00:01:19.630> have<00:01:19.780> silver<00:01:20.050> shoulder

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
he might be as big as the Halo 4's let's

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.969 
he might be as big as the Halo 4's let's
let's<00:01:47.860> compare<00:01:48.310> Halo<00:01:49.000> Reach<00:01:49.030> in<00:01:49.330> Halo<00:01:49.510> 4<00:01:49.570> I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
let's compare Halo Reach in Halo 4 I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.020 
let's compare Halo Reach in Halo 4 I
haven't<00:01:50.979> looked<00:01:51.100> at<00:01:51.190> those<00:01:51.340> guys<00:01:51.580> in<00:01:51.760> a<00:01:51.820> while

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
haven't looked at those guys in a while

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.330 
haven't looked at those guys in a while
so<00:01:52.270> here's<00:01:52.510> a<00:01:52.570> cryotube<00:01:53.200> Master<00:01:53.680> Chief<00:01:53.920> I<00:01:54.100> just

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
so here's a cryotube Master Chief I just

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.399 
so here's a cryotube Master Chief I just
happen<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.760> have<00:01:54.790> out<00:01:55.240> he<00:01:55.720> might<00:01:55.930> be<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.170> same

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
happen to have out he might be the same

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.060 
happen to have out he might be the same
size<00:01:58.110> well<00:01:59.110> he's<00:01:59.290> actually<00:01:59.500> even<00:01:59.860> a<00:01:59.920> little

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
size well he's actually even a little

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.340 
size well he's actually even a little
bit<00:02:00.280> taller<00:02:00.460> than<00:02:00.790> chief<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.390> yeah<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.229> don't

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
bit taller than chief so yeah I don't

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.320 
bit taller than chief so yeah I don't
know<00:02:02.500> what<00:02:02.680> they<00:02:02.799> were<00:02:02.860> doing<00:02:03.190> with<00:02:03.370> that<00:02:03.580> it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
know what they were doing with that it

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.870 
know what they were doing with that it
doesn't<00:02:04.720> even<00:02:04.840> make<00:02:05.049> sense<00:02:05.110> in<00:02:05.890> any<00:02:06.400> way<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.700> can

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
doesn't even make sense in any way I can

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.669 
doesn't even make sense in any way I can
figure<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:07.659> I<00:02:07.690> don't<00:02:07.810> know<00:02:08.019> so<00:02:08.409> I<00:02:08.440> would

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
figure it so I don't know so I would

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.080 
figure it so I don't know so I would
pass<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.159> guy<00:02:09.340> off<00:02:09.399> no<00:02:09.610> matter<00:02:09.789> what<00:02:10.000> and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
pass that guy off no matter what and

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.360 
pass that guy off no matter what and
then<00:02:10.209> we<00:02:10.299> have<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.479> pink<00:02:10.690> one<00:02:10.929> with<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.860> white

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
then we have the pink one with the white

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.119 
then we have the pink one with the white
stripe<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:12.940> he<00:02:13.090> has<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.390> shotgun<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.500> no

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
stripe and he has a shotgun and no

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.190 
stripe and he has a shotgun and no
trigger<00:02:15.430> finger<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:15.940> that's<00:02:16.120> not<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.989> best

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
trigger finger so that's not the best

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.559 
trigger finger so that's not the best
situation<00:02:17.560> there<00:02:18.189> the<00:02:18.700> red<00:02:18.909> one<00:02:19.090> down<00:02:19.269> here<00:02:19.480> on

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
situation there the red one down here on

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.840 
situation there the red one down here on
the<00:02:19.689> Left<00:02:19.959> assault<00:02:20.620> rifle<00:02:21.069> yellow

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
the Left assault rifle yellow

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.940 
the Left assault rifle yellow
stripe<00:02:22.150> his<00:02:22.480> yellow<00:02:22.780> stripe<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.260> narrow<00:02:23.560> that

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
stripe his yellow stripe is narrow that

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.620 
stripe his yellow stripe is narrow that
apparently<00:02:24.580> was<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.790> problem<00:02:25.270> in<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.480> first

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
apparently was a problem in the first

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.600 
apparently was a problem in the first
batch<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:26.080> figures<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.680> don't<00:02:27.280> know<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.550> don't

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
batch of figures I don't know I don't

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.980 
batch of figures I don't know I don't
think<00:02:27.760> they<00:02:27.970> ever<00:02:28.000> did<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.300> running<00:02:28.570> change<00:02:28.810> on

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
think they ever did a running change on

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.410 
think they ever did a running change on
that<00:02:29.020> guy<00:02:29.350> off<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.680> look<00:02:29.800> into<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.280> but<00:02:31.210> he<00:02:31.270> has

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
that guy off to look into it but he has

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.240 
that guy off to look into it but he has
no<00:02:31.540> trigger<00:02:31.810> finger<00:02:32.020> but<00:02:32.110> it's<00:02:32.260> okay<00:02:32.530> then<00:02:33.100> we

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
no trigger finger but it's okay then we

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.790 
no trigger finger but it's okay then we
have<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.730> gray<00:02:34.060> one<00:02:34.330> with<00:02:34.840> an<00:02:35.200> orange<00:02:35.530> stripe

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
have the gray one with an orange stripe

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.710 
have the gray one with an orange stripe
again<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:36.580> don't<00:02:36.760> get<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:37.000> combination<00:02:37.600> but

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
again I don't get that combination but

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.660 
again I don't get that combination but
they<00:02:37.900> keep<00:02:38.050> doing<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.500> whatever<00:02:38.770> he<00:02:39.430> comes

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
they keep doing it so whatever he comes

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.310 
they keep doing it so whatever he comes
with<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.880> needler<00:02:40.240> which<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.660> pretty<00:02:40.870> unique<00:02:41.140> to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
with a needler which is pretty unique to

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.130 
with a needler which is pretty unique to
him<00:02:41.710> but<00:02:42.400> he<00:02:42.460> can't<00:02:42.670> hold<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:43.030> at<00:02:43.420> all<00:02:43.690> really

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
him but he can't hold it at all really

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.600 
him but he can't hold it at all really
so<00:02:44.410> that's<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.800> problem<00:02:45.190> but<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.400> needler

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
so that's a problem but the needler

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.920 
so that's a problem but the needler
itself<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.030> pretty<00:02:46.210> cool<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:46.630> got<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
itself is pretty cool it's got the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.930 
itself is pretty cool it's got the
translucent<00:02:47.530> needles<00:02:47.800> on<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.310> pretty<00:02:48.700> nice

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
translucent needles on it so pretty nice

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.910 
translucent needles on it so pretty nice
then<00:02:49.510> we<00:02:49.660> have<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.870> armored<00:02:50.140> Peck<00:02:50.350> teal<00:02:50.680> with

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
then we have the armored Peck teal with

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.950 
then we have the armored Peck teal with
the<00:02:51.010> white<00:02:51.160> stripe<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.820> smg's<00:02:52.420> right<00:02:52.750> hands

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
the white stripe to smg's right hands

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.890 
the white stripe to smg's right hands
fine<00:02:53.260> left<00:02:53.710> hand<00:02:53.980> no<00:02:54.400> good<00:02:54.640> no<00:02:55.270> bueno

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
fine left hand no good no bueno

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.320 
fine left hand no good no bueno
then<00:02:56.860> we<00:02:57.010> have<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.460> blue<00:02:57.820> with<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.060> yellow

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
then we have the blue with the yellow

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.090 
then we have the blue with the yellow
stripe<00:02:58.660> assault<00:02:59.170> rifle<00:02:59.500> no<00:02:59.590> trigger<00:02:59.830> finger

stripe assault rifle no trigger finger

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.220 
stripe assault rifle no trigger finger
no<00:03:00.250> problem<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.910> then<00:03:01.600> we<00:03:01.750> have<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.050> blue

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.900 
no problem and then we have the blue
with<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.470> secondary<00:03:03.100> white<00:03:03.460> which<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.850> do

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
with the secondary white which I do

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.700 
with the secondary white which I do
believe<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.480> shoulder<00:03:05.020> pads<00:03:05.290> are<00:03:05.470> supposed

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
believe that shoulder pads are supposed

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.750 
believe that shoulder pads are supposed
to<00:03:05.740> be<00:03:05.830> colored<00:03:06.100> so<00:03:06.220> I<00:03:06.250> don't<00:03:06.400> know<00:03:06.490> why<00:03:06.700> this

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
to be colored so I don't know why this

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.850 
to be colored so I don't know why this
why<00:03:07.750> went<00:03:07.960> up<00:03:08.050> here<00:03:08.200> doesn't<00:03:08.530> have<00:03:08.650> blue

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
why went up here doesn't have blue

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.350 
why went up here doesn't have blue
shoulder<00:03:09.190> pads<00:03:09.400> maybe<00:03:09.640> mine<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:09.940> an<00:03:10.090> error

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
shoulder pads maybe mine is an error

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.270 
shoulder pads maybe mine is an error
maybe<00:03:10.840> they<00:03:11.020> just<00:03:11.170> screwed<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.620> up<00:03:11.740> I<00:03:11.950> don't

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
maybe they just screwed it up I don't

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.600 
maybe they just screwed it up I don't
know

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
know
