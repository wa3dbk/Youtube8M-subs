00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.420
 was one 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.220
 I think there is a fan here 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.330
 clouds servals everything much piece of red that 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.400

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.870
 try to prevent it 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.700

 make and all that 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.000
 super convenient of course it is not the 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.870
 intention because yes the were already achieved 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.790
 seems for noobs 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.110
 animals tweet went suit and do not 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.970
 goes back to plant 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.700
 this stands for the ornamental and if they do 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.100
 never never get home kingdom okay 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.870

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.549
 you know well away but well 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.310
 see what we have here and in the evening 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.710
 rob I don't know exactly who yes according to 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.710
 I think the horseshop is personal 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.450
 wages is nothing in jesse are many seibon 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.430
 whatever the weather a nice market you hijack 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.560
 things here have a house in the not too 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.990
 to be a nice pot eden 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.550
 besides that are just the decorations of 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.770
 the streets that make this fun too 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.900
 kind of covers energy after all tips 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.340
 which I actually give you as one 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.990
 role play and here I have sometimes 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.370
 a separate house built yet under the 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.200
 stairs are partly 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.880
 I am major had won like you 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.860
 only seeing is not and immediately I am 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.300
 not because furnish 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.150
 So we have for good in reek 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.919
 persona and yes I just find it separate 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.840
 and yes otherwise on animals so empty place 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.300
 I can put trees down and put one 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.340
 little but not like half a house like that 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.570
 very fat instead of trees 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.789
 We have to send you a little one 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.950
 cavities too clear how a little 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.350
 arranged randomly performs most the for and 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.060
 previous burning for a house for me 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.289
 what so it is no cabbage and just stay 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.240
 burn forever 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.610
 I think that's yes that's an ai 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.410
 that you can give yourself 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.070
 here we have the first the first 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.530
 house that built 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.030
 this house is not commanded me see too 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.229
 right that the weather is slightly different 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.539
 in style 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.490
 so the style doesn't have to be exact there 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:36.389
 here comes you goo who tippee it 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.740

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.639
 have a look yes this is just one 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.650
 bit the the kind of shop 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.600
 so let's see yes there are still here 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.130
 some house leon sitting in leon building 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.750
 through intake except look further or 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.039
 we all say one thing 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.110
 and then they sit in the city 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.479
 corrects fucking fat though beautiful is one 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.680
 bit the bad guy here just that 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.539
 naturally also means all of them 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.460

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.349
 things but everything is of course not it 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.370
 some nice things because at the moment 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.200

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.390

 but you probably know them 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.800
