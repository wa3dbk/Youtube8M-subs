all right so a really big queue that

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.450 
all right so a really big queue that
you're<00:00:03.810> gonna<00:00:03.899> see<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.200> lot<00:00:04.380> in<00:00:04.620> pretty<00:00:05.430> much

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
you're gonna see a lot in pretty much

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.099 
you're gonna see a lot in pretty much
all<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.850> exercises<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.660> called<00:00:06.720> neutral

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
all the exercises is called neutral

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.980 
all the exercises is called neutral
spine<00:00:07.560> so<00:00:08.160> what<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.580> neutral<00:00:08.970> spine<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.750> just

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
spine so what is neutral spine it's just

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.020 
spine so what is neutral spine it's just
the<00:00:10.290> part<00:00:10.800> where<00:00:11.130> your<00:00:11.280> neutral<00:00:11.670> spine<00:00:11.880> or

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
the part where your neutral spine or

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.879 
the part where your neutral spine or
neutral<00:00:12.300> pelvis<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.809> very<00:00:13.139> similar<00:00:13.590> it's

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
neutral pelvis is very similar it's

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.709 
neutral pelvis is very similar it's
basically<00:00:14.250> where<00:00:14.490> your<00:00:14.670> pelvis<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.660> your

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
basically where your pelvis and your

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.830 
basically where your pelvis and your
lower<00:00:16.139> back<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.070> position<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
lower back is in a position that is the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.560 
lower back is in a position that is the
safest<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:19.980> your<00:00:20.010> for<00:00:20.850> your<00:00:20.970> joints<00:00:21.330> but<00:00:21.510> also

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
safest for your for your joints but also

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.560 
safest for your for your joints but also
where<00:00:21.960> you're<00:00:22.080> gonna<00:00:22.170> get<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.529> most<00:00:23.390> use<00:00:24.390> out

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
where you're gonna get the most use out

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.140 
where you're gonna get the most use out
of<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> muscles<00:00:25.199> for<00:00:25.800> example<00:00:25.859> if<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.430> was<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
of the muscles for example if I was in a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.200 
of the muscles for example if I was in a
very<00:00:27.570> tilt<00:00:28.050> anteriorly<00:00:29.010> tilted<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.760> very

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
very tilt anteriorly tilted a very

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.630 
very tilt anteriorly tilted a very
arched<00:00:30.599> back<00:00:30.990> position<00:00:31.470> I'm<00:00:32.130> gonna<00:00:32.340> use<00:00:32.489> my

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
arched back position I'm gonna use my

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.580 
arched back position I'm gonna use my
lower<00:00:32.820> back<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> lot<00:00:33.390> more<00:00:33.570> my<00:00:33.930> hamstrings<00:00:34.410> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
lower back a lot more my hamstrings and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.520 
lower back a lot more my hamstrings and
my<00:00:34.649> quads<00:00:35.000> which<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.120> gonna<00:00:36.300> put<00:00:36.540> again<00:00:36.840> make

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
my quads which is gonna put again make

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.340 
my quads which is gonna put again make
the<00:00:37.680> muscles<00:00:38.570> do<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> job<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:39.960> they're<00:00:40.260> not

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the muscles do a job that they're not

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.869 
the muscles do a job that they're not
really<00:00:40.530> supposed<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.579> I'm<00:00:41.700> always

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
really supposed to so if I'm always

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.970 
really supposed to so if I'm always
doing<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.210> deadlift<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.750> my<00:00:42.870> back<00:00:43.530> arch<00:00:43.800> like

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
doing a deadlift with my back arch like

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.010 
doing a deadlift with my back arch like
this<00:00:44.190> I'm<00:00:44.670> much<00:00:45.000> more<00:00:45.180> likely<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> strain<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this I'm much more likely to strain a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.290 
this I'm much more likely to strain a
muscle<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.500> my<00:00:46.530> back<00:00:46.770> or<00:00:47.010> hurt<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> disk<00:00:47.610> than<00:00:48.210> if

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
muscle in my back or hurt a disk than if

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.910 
muscle in my back or hurt a disk than if
I<00:00:48.390> was<00:00:48.539> doing<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.230> more<00:00:49.440> neutral

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
I was doing it in a more neutral

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.770 
I was doing it in a more neutral
position<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> same<00:00:51.210> if<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.449> was<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
position it's the same if I was in a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020 
position it's the same if I was in a
very<00:00:51.989> rounded<00:00:52.469> position<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.610> area

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
very rounded position this is the area

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.639 
very rounded position this is the area
where<00:00:54.420> people<00:00:54.600> tend<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.020> hurt<00:00:55.170> themselves<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
where people tend to hurt themselves a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.319 
where people tend to hurt themselves a
lot<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.980> I'm<00:00:56.610> sure<00:00:56.760> you've<00:00:56.910> seen<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.120> many

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
lot and I'm sure you've seen it many

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
lot and I'm sure you've seen it many
times<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.840> guy<00:00:57.989> at<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> gym<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:59.219> dead<00:00:59.399> lifting

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
times a guy at the gym just dead lifting

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.520 
times a guy at the gym just dead lifting
with<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> rounded<00:01:00.270> back<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:00.780> they<00:01:01.230> wonder

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
with a rounded back and then they wonder

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.210 
with a rounded back and then they wonder
why<00:01:01.649> their<00:01:01.829> back<00:01:02.010> hurts<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.890> neutral

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
why their back hurts so the neutral

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.250 
why their back hurts so the neutral
spine<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.640> basically<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.570> neutral<00:01:06.960> zone<00:01:07.049> so

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
spine is basically the neutral zone so

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.679 
spine is basically the neutral zone so
the<00:01:07.380> position<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.220> between<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.420> find

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the position in between that and to find

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.690 
the position in between that and to find
it<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.229> got<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.490> put<00:01:11.670> your

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it all you got to do is you put your

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.300 
it all you got to do is you put your
hands<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.119> your<00:01:12.240> hips<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:13.710> tilt<00:01:14.130> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
hands on your hips and you tilt it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.399 
hands on your hips and you tilt it
forward<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.850> then<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.600> kind<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> tilt<00:01:16.290> it

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
forward and then just kind of tilt it

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.770 
forward and then just kind of tilt it
back<00:01:16.590> using<00:01:17.040> your<00:01:17.189> oblique<00:01:17.700> muscles<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
back using your oblique muscles so it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.090 
back using your oblique muscles so it
helps<00:01:18.990> yeah<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.200> put<00:01:19.470> your<00:01:19.560> hands<00:01:19.740> here

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
helps yeah you put your hands here

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.179 
helps yeah you put your hands here
push<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.880> forward<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> big<00:01:22.020> arch<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.500> then

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
push it forward get a big arch and then

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.399 
push it forward get a big arch and then
just<00:01:23.430> tighten<00:01:23.850> up<00:01:23.909> your<00:01:24.030> obliques<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
just tighten up your obliques and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
just tighten up your obliques and
another<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.520> good<00:01:26.700> way<00:01:26.820> is

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
another actually a really good way is

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.719 
another actually a really good way is
just<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.900> against<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.740> wall<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
just going against the wall and if you

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.550 
just going against the wall and if you
put<00:01:29.909> your<00:01:30.000> back<00:01:30.180> against<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.570> wall<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.990> do

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
put your back against the wall and do

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.170 
put your back against the wall and do
the<00:01:31.650> same<00:01:31.860> thing<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.700> tighten<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.030> your

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the same thing and you tighten up your

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.460 
the same thing and you tighten up your
obliques<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.689> should<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:33.930> able<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.140> just

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
obliques you should be able to just

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.499 
obliques you should be able to just
barely<00:01:34.740> slide<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.280> fingers<00:01:35.579> through<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
barely slide your fingers through so

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.450 
barely slide your fingers through so
your<00:01:36.659> back<00:01:36.810> should<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.140> touching<00:01:37.409> your<00:01:37.799> hand

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
your back should be touching your hand
