some paint I mean you're gonna get down
there<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:55.820> it<00:00:55.940> picked<00:00:56.179> that<00:00:56.329> much<00:00:56.539> oh<00:00:56.809> well

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
there and it picked that much oh well

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.939 
there and it picked that much oh well
you<00:00:58.250> just<00:00:58.280> are<00:00:58.839> but<00:00:59.839> uh<00:00:59.870> I<00:01:00.140> think<00:01:00.379> I'd<00:01:00.649> left<00:01:00.829> to

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
you just are but uh I think I'd left to

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.500 
you just are but uh I think I'd left to
do<00:01:01.129> I've<00:01:01.760> got<00:01:02.239> a<00:01:02.809> little<00:01:03.350> Hut<00:01:03.679> of<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.510> little

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
do I've got a little Hut of the little

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.170 
do I've got a little Hut of the little
files<00:01:05.720> on<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.680> valve<00:01:07.400> wheels<00:01:07.700> I'm<00:01:08.000> probably

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
files on the valve wheels I'm probably

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.630 
files on the valve wheels I'm probably
on<00:01:08.300> a<00:01:08.360> color<00:01:08.630> code<00:01:08.900> dam<00:01:09.230> as<00:01:10.010> they're<00:01:10.340> set<00:01:10.610> up

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
on a color code dam as they're set up

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.830 
on a color code dam as they're set up
and<00:01:11.120> just<00:01:11.720> do<00:01:11.900> some<00:01:12.170> washes<00:01:12.830> on<00:01:12.980> them<00:01:13.160> and<00:01:13.840> give

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
and just do some washes on them and give

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.470 
and just do some washes on them and give
it<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:14.990> little<00:01:15.170> bit<00:01:15.350> more<00:01:16.360> detailing<00:01:17.360> but<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:20.330> be

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
it a little bit more detailing but to be

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.970 
it a little bit more detailing but to be
frankly<00:01:20.840> honest<00:01:21.140> you<00:01:21.260> could<00:01:21.440> probably<00:01:21.650> just

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
frankly honest you could probably just

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.190 
frankly honest you could probably just
throw<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.640> directions<00:01:23.180> out<00:01:23.360> of<00:01:23.510> this<00:01:23.630> kit<00:01:23.900> and

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
throw the directions out of this kit and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.630 
throw the directions out of this kit and
just<00:01:24.230> have<00:01:24.650> that<00:01:24.680> it<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.160> look<00:01:25.250> at<00:01:25.370> a<00:01:25.430> picture

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
just have that it and look at a picture

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.750 
just have that it and look at a picture
as<00:01:26.000> basically<00:01:26.510> what<00:01:26.720> I<00:01:26.750> did<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:28.280> picture<00:01:28.610> it's

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
as basically what I did the picture it's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.780 
as basically what I did the picture it's
a<00:01:28.820> thing<00:01:29.060> but<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:30.100> mean<00:01:31.100> it's<00:01:31.280> in<00:01:31.400> president

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
a thing but I mean it's in president

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.090 
a thing but I mean it's in president
looking<00:01:32.030> don't<00:01:32.240> get<00:01:32.360> me<00:01:32.480> wrong<00:01:32.510> but<00:01:33.020> that

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
looking don't get me wrong but that

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.200 
looking don't get me wrong but that
instructions<00:01:34.100> are<00:01:34.190> wrong<00:01:34.370> because<00:01:34.580> for

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
instructions are wrong because for

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.730 
instructions are wrong because for
instance<00:01:35.510> like<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.810> says<00:01:36.020> go<00:01:36.260> ahead<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.560> glue

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
instance like it says go ahead and glue

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.800 
instance like it says go ahead and glue
these<00:01:36.920> in<00:01:37.190> here<00:01:37.370> first<00:01:37.670> these<00:01:38.030> pipes<00:01:38.360> up<00:01:38.630> here

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
these in here first these pipes up here

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.750 
these in here first these pipes up here
here<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.260> then<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:39.890> next<00:01:40.220> episodes<00:01:40.580> glue

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
here and then the next episodes glue

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.290 
here and then the next episodes glue
this<00:01:40.940> in<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.450> it's<00:01:41.600> no<00:01:41.810> way<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.050> get<00:01:42.350> this<00:01:42.560> in

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
this in and it's no way to get this in

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.330 
this in and it's no way to get this in
behind<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.630> pipe<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.380> I<00:01:45.410> had<00:01:45.620> to<00:01:45.710> back<00:01:45.920> all<00:01:46.190> the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
behind the pipe so I had to back all the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.210 
behind the pipe so I had to back all the
pipes<00:01:46.610> out<00:01:47.170> yadda<00:01:48.170> yadda<00:01:48.290> yadda<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:48.920> helps

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
pipes out yadda yadda yadda and it helps

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.220 
pipes out yadda yadda yadda and it helps
to<00:01:49.370> if<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.820> base<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.270> flat<00:01:50.480> and<00:01:50.810> not<00:01:50.960> warp

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
to if the base is flat and not warp

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.480 
to if the base is flat and not warp
watch<00:01:51.440> this<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:53.030> can<00:01:53.180> see<00:01:53.450> it

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.899 

you<00:01:58.060> can<00:01:58.210> see<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.479> towers<00:01:58.900> movement<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.640> base

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
you can see the towers movement the base

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.990 
you can see the towers movement the base
is<00:02:01.240> not<00:02:02.070> things<00:02:03.070> for<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.460> threw<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.880> off

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
is not things for that threw it off

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.669 
is not things for that threw it off
