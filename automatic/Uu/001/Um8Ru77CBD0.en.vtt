what I've been up to after getting in
that<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:15.000> Triforce<00:00:15.480> board<00:00:15.809> here

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
that that Triforce board here

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.040 
that that Triforce board here
I<00:00:16.490> turned<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.609> Triforce<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.779> had

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
I turned the Triforce on and had

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.450 
I turned the Triforce on and had
everything<00:00:19.289> hooked<00:00:19.650> up<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.980> actually<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
everything hooked up and actually the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.330 
everything hooked up and actually the
video<00:00:20.670> works<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.840> Triforce<00:00:22.470> which<00:00:23.039> means

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
video works on this Triforce which means

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.230 
video works on this Triforce which means
that<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.210> video<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.900> or<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:26.640> CPU<00:00:27.119> on

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
that the video on this or the the CPU on

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.439 
that the video on this or the the CPU on
this<00:00:27.449> one<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:28.019> not<00:00:28.920> good<00:00:29.400> which<00:00:30.119> means<00:00:30.300> I'm

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
this one is not good which means I'm

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.700 
this one is not good which means I'm
gonna<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.869> either<00:00:30.960> try<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.289> see<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.619> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
gonna have to either try and see if I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.889 
gonna have to either try and see if I
can<00:00:31.859> salvage<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:32.820> pick<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.239> another<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:33.690> so

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
can salvage it or pick up another one so

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.220 
can salvage it or pick up another one so
that<00:00:34.050> bottom<00:00:34.320> one's<00:00:34.500> not<00:00:34.739> working<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.510> got

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
that bottom one's not working but I got

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.139 
that bottom one's not working but I got
this<00:00:37.440> dim<00:00:37.649> board<00:00:37.890> here<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.670> originally

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
this dim board here and I originally

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.450 
this dim board here and I originally
took<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> dim<00:00:39.660> board<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.710> plugged<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.340> in

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
took the dim board and I plugged it in

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.100 
took the dim board and I plugged it in
here<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> now<00:00:42.059> um<00:00:42.270> II<00:00:42.390> tried<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.930> turn<00:00:43.079> it

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
here to the now um II tried to turn it

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.880 
here to the now um II tried to turn it
on<00:00:43.379> hooked<00:00:44.010> everything<00:00:44.340> up<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.289> it<00:00:46.289> took<00:00:46.530> you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
on hooked everything up and it took you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.619 
on hooked everything up and it took you
know<00:00:46.950> quite<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> quite<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> long<00:00:48.030> time<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.570> this

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
know quite a quite a long time for this

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.090 
know quite a quite a long time for this
thing<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.960> register<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:49.829> when<00:00:50.010> it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
thing to register but then when it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.439 
thing to register but then when it
finally<00:00:50.129> did<00:00:50.520> come<00:00:50.730> up<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.030> said<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.329> there

great<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> dim<00:00:59.760> board<00:00:59.940> bad<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.170> I

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
great is the dim board bad or what so I

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.100 
great is the dim board bad or what so I
popped<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.680> back<00:01:01.859> into<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.699> Triforce<00:01:03.329> turned

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
popped it back into the Triforce turned

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.539 
popped it back into the Triforce turned
the<00:01:04.199> Triforce<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.920> went<00:01:05.250> through<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the Triforce on went through the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.120 
the Triforce on went through the
triforces<00:01:06.090> test<00:01:06.869> menu<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.530> test<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.950> dim

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
triforces test menu to test the dim

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.609 
triforces test menu to test the dim
board<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> dim<00:01:08.790> board<00:01:08.970> came<00:01:09.210> out<00:01:09.360> fine<00:01:09.720> so

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
board and the dim board came out fine so

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.570 
board and the dim board came out fine so
I<00:01:11.070> decided<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.210> talk<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.590> Chris<00:01:13.590> also<00:01:14.250> known<00:01:14.400> as

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.050 
higher and if you have D or anything
lower<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.880> can't<00:01:54.119> run<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.509> gd-rom<00:01:55.110> drive<00:01:55.140> so

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
lower you can't run the gd-rom drive so

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.139 
lower you can't run the gd-rom drive so
he<00:01:57.060> also<00:01:57.180> found<00:01:57.570> out<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.049> these<00:01:58.920> chips<00:01:59.640> for

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
he also found out that these chips for

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.480 
he also found out that these chips for
example<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.960> goes<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.469> H<00:02:01.770> he<00:02:02.250> said

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
example I think it goes up to H he said

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.690 
example I think it goes up to H he said
H<00:02:02.909> was<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.420> most<00:02:04.200> sought-after<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:05.310> because

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
H was the most sought-after one because

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.719 
H was the most sought-after one because
it<00:02:05.820> was<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.060> last<00:02:06.299> revision<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.380> BIOS<00:02:07.740> but

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
it was the last revision of the BIOS but

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.240 
it was the last revision of the BIOS but
one<00:02:09.569> interesting<00:02:09.899> thing<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.950> found

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
one interesting thing I found

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.000 
one interesting thing I found
that<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.900> Naomi<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.680> wound<00:02:14.920> up

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
that that Naomi that I wound up

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
that that Naomi that I wound up
repairing<00:02:15.490> with<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:16.000> zombie<00:02:16.930> revenge<00:02:17.440> in<00:02:17.680> it

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
repairing with the zombie revenge in it

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.860 
repairing with the zombie revenge in it
you<00:02:19.030> take<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.240> look<00:02:19.450> at<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:22.630> one

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
you take a look at this this one

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.080 
you take a look at this this one
actually<00:02:23.080> has<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:24.280> H<00:02:24.780> version<00:02:25.780> of<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:27.090> BIOS

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
actually has the H version of the BIOS

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.870 
actually has the H version of the BIOS
on<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.510> which<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.959> am<00:02:29.080> super<00:02:29.530> stoked<00:02:29.590> about<00:02:30.010> so

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
on it which I am super stoked about so

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.120 
on it which I am super stoked about so
that<00:02:31.480> means<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:31.900> another<00:02:32.680> board<00:02:32.920> that

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
that means this is another board that

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.240 
that means this is another board that
can<00:02:33.250> easily<00:02:33.700> work<00:02:34.270> with<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.930> with<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.830> gd-rom

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
can easily work with the with the gd-rom

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
I've been messing around with here I got

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.840 
I've been messing around with here I got
this<00:02:43.840> judea<00:02:44.170> rom<00:02:44.590> drive<00:02:44.770> with<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.250> Triforce

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
this judea rom drive with that Triforce

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.060 
this judea rom drive with that Triforce
over<00:02:46.150> there<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.570> if<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.290> remember<00:02:47.620> right<00:02:47.650> it

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
over there and if you remember right it

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.250 
over there and if you remember right it
was<00:02:48.160> pretty<00:02:48.400> dirty<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:49.420> took<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.020> whole<00:02:50.200> thing

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
was pretty dirty I took the whole thing

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.000 
was pretty dirty I took the whole thing
apart

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
apart

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.760 
apart
cleaned<00:02:51.580> every<00:02:51.880> single<00:02:52.209> part<00:02:52.420> up<00:02:52.600> on<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.959> we

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
cleaned every single part up on it we

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.979 
cleaned every single part up on it we
greased<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.790> rails<00:02:55.000> for<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.330> laser<00:02:55.540> and

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
greased the the rails for the laser and

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.900 
greased the the rails for the laser and
put<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.770> back<00:02:56.890> together<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.250> hopes<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:57.700> it

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
put it back together and hopes that it

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.050 
put it back together and hopes that it
would<00:02:58.000> work<00:02:58.239> now<00:02:59.110> when<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.610> when<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:00.640> went<00:03:00.940> and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
would work now when I when I went and

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.580 
would work now when I when I went and
tried<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.450> hooking<00:03:01.690> it<00:03:01.900> up<00:03:02.020> you<00:03:02.470> know<00:03:02.560> I

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
tried to hooking it up you know I

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.290 
tried to hooking it up you know I
realized<00:03:03.100> that<00:03:03.280> there<00:03:03.400> was<00:03:03.520> one<00:03:03.670> cable<00:03:03.910> over

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
realized that there was one cable over

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.090 
realized that there was one cable over
here<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.690> wasn't<00:03:04.870> hooked<00:03:05.170> up<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.680> was

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
here that wasn't hooked up and I was

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.350 
here that wasn't hooked up and I was
thinking<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.400> myself<00:03:06.459> how<00:03:06.910> does<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.180> thing

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
thinking to myself how does this thing

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.720 
thinking to myself how does this thing
get<00:03:07.510> power<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:08.110> went<00:03:08.830> online<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.459> checked

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
get power I went online and I checked

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.560 
get power I went online and I checked
out<00:03:10.110> some<00:03:11.110> interesting<00:03:11.800> forums<00:03:12.760> where<00:03:13.540> people

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
out some interesting forums where people

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.750 
out some interesting forums where people
were<00:03:13.900> talking<00:03:14.110> about<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.530> power<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.640> way

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
were talking about the power and the way

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.060 
were talking about the power and the way
that<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.090> thing<00:03:16.150> works<00:03:16.660> is<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:17.739> needs<00:03:17.920> an

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
that this thing works is it needs an

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.759 
that this thing works is it needs an
external<00:03:18.370> power<00:03:18.640> cable<00:03:19.150> here<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.769> normally

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
external power cable here and normally

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.699 
external power cable here and normally
there's<00:03:21.519> ones<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.660> can<00:03:22.810> buy<00:03:22.989> for<00:03:23.049> it<00:03:23.380> but

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
there's ones that you can buy for it but

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.500 
there's ones that you can buy for it but
I<00:03:23.739> just<00:03:24.100> made<00:03:24.400> one<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:24.850> I<00:03:24.940> know<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.239> kind<00:03:25.480> of

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
I just made one and I know it's kind of

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.870 
I just made one and I know it's kind of
a<00:03:25.630> sloppy<00:03:25.900> job<00:03:26.260> but<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.620> does<00:03:26.799> does<00:03:27.489> do<00:03:27.760> the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
a sloppy job but it does does do the

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.259 
a sloppy job but it does does do the
trick<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.709> what<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:29.739> did<00:03:29.950> is<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.400> cut<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:30.850> regular

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
trick and what I did is I cut a regular

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.820 
trick and what I did is I cut a regular
connector<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.080> had<00:03:32.320> looked<00:03:33.360> similar<00:03:34.360> to

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
connector that I had looked similar to

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.009 
connector that I had looked similar to
something<00:03:35.830> like<00:03:35.980> this<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.580> just<00:03:37.269> chopped<00:03:37.840> it

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
something like this I just chopped it

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.009 
something like this I just chopped it
from<00:03:38.470> 1<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:39.190> 6<00:03:39.790> because<00:03:40.090> there's<00:03:40.269> six<00:03:40.510> pins<00:03:40.780> on

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
from 1 to 6 because there's six pins on

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.490 
from 1 to 6 because there's six pins on
here<00:03:41.380> although<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.340> only<00:03:42.700> wind<00:03:43.090> up<00:03:43.209> using

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
here although you only wind up using

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.740 
here although you only wind up using
about<00:03:44.500> 4<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:44.920> these<00:03:45.100> pins<00:03:45.489> there<00:03:46.090> are<00:03:46.239> six<00:03:46.510> pins

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
about 4 of these pins there are six pins

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.920 
about 4 of these pins there are six pins
on<00:03:46.959> it<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.709> way<00:03:47.829> that<00:03:48.040> this<00:03:48.160> works<00:03:48.489> is

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
on it and the way that this works is

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.900 
on it and the way that this works is
starting<00:03:49.930> from<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.410> right<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.340> left

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
starting from the right to the left

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.140 
starting from the right to the left
this<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.420> pin<00:03:52.660> one<00:03:53.019> and<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:54.430> last<00:03:54.640> one<00:03:54.820> on<00:03:55.060> the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
this is pin one and the last one on the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.449 
this is pin one and the last one on the
left<00:03:55.360> is<00:03:55.570> pin<00:03:55.780> six<00:03:56.200> this<00:03:57.040> thing<00:03:57.220> is<00:03:57.310> not

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
left is pin six this thing is not

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.240 
left is pin six this thing is not
focusing<00:03:57.940> in<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.329> well<00:03:58.570> but<00:03:59.220> starting<00:04:00.220> with

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
focusing in so well but starting with

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.509 
focusing in so well but starting with
pins<00:04:00.610> 1<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.329> pin<00:04:01.600> -<00:04:01.930> those<00:04:02.620> are<00:04:02.769> your<00:04:02.829> plus<00:04:03.130> 12

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
pins 1 and pin - those are your plus 12

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.560 
pins 1 and pin - those are your plus 12
volts

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
volts

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.190 
volts
starting<00:04:05.310> after<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.670> there's<00:04:07.060> two<00:04:07.989> more

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
starting after that there's two more

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.050 
starting after that there's two more
pins<00:04:08.470> in<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.829> middle<00:04:09.100> and<00:04:09.340> those<00:04:09.519> are<00:04:09.760> your

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
pins in the middle and those are your

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.690 
pins in the middle and those are your
plus<00:04:10.750> 5<00:04:11.049> volts<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.590> then<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.250> last<00:04:12.430> two<00:04:12.670> are

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
plus 5 volts and then the last two are

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.770 
plus 5 volts and then the last two are
your<00:04:13.000> grounds<00:04:13.540> so<00:04:14.079> you<00:04:14.170> have<00:04:14.519> plus<00:04:15.519> 12<00:04:15.940> plus<00:04:16.269> 12

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
your grounds so you have plus 12 plus 12

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.300 
your grounds so you have plus 12 plus 12
plus<00:04:17.109> 5<00:04:17.590> plus<00:04:18.100> 5<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.700> then<00:04:18.760> ground<00:04:19.329> ground

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
plus 5 plus 5 and then ground ground

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.570 
plus 5 plus 5 and then ground ground
Oh<00:04:21.180> pins<00:04:21.900> 1<00:04:22.230> &amp;<00:04:22.410> 2<00:04:22.560> are<00:04:22.950> 12<00:04:23.400> 3<00:04:24.330> &amp;<00:04:24.480> 4<00:04:24.720> are<00:04:25.190> 5<00:04:26.190> and

Oh pins 1 &amp; 2 are 12 3 &amp; 4 are 5 and

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.930 
Oh pins 1 &amp; 2 are 12 3 &amp; 4 are 5 and
then<00:04:26.820> 5<00:04:27.270> &amp;<00:04:28.200> 6<00:04:28.380> are<00:04:28.560> ground<00:04:28.860> but<00:04:29.280> I<00:04:29.520> made<00:04:29.820> that

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
then 5 &amp; 6 are ground but I made that

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.970 
then 5 &amp; 6 are ground but I made that
cable<00:04:30.330> up<00:04:30.450> plug<00:04:30.870> that<00:04:31.050> in<00:04:31.290> got<00:04:31.620> that<00:04:31.830> all

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
cable up plug that in got that all

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.780 
cable up plug that in got that all
connected<00:04:32.820> up<00:04:32.940> here<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:34.230> yeah<00:04:35.190> it's<00:04:35.700> just

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
connected up here and yeah it's just

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.850 
connected up here and yeah it's just
been<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.060> bit<00:04:36.480> of<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.630> hassle<00:04:36.810> here<00:04:37.230> put<00:04:37.500> in<00:04:37.650> the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
been a bit of a hassle here put in the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.080 
been a bit of a hassle here put in the
the<00:04:38.370> gd-rom<00:04:38.850> drive<00:04:39.260> or<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.320> gd-rom<00:04:40.970> put<00:04:41.970> in

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
the gd-rom drive or the gd-rom put in

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.230 
the gd-rom drive or the gd-rom put in
the<00:04:42.210> security<00:04:42.720> chip<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.669> when<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:44.700> booted<00:04:45.090> this

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
the security chip and when I booted this

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.550 
the security chip and when I booted this
thing<00:04:45.419> up<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.690> second<00:04:46.110> time<00:04:46.139> it<00:04:46.440> actually

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
thing up the second time it actually

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.820 
thing up the second time it actually
came<00:04:46.950> up<00:04:46.980> with<00:04:47.190> now<00:04:47.910> only<00:04:48.090> network<00:04:48.830> network

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
came up with now only network network

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.860 
came up with now only network network
something<00:04:50.700> I<00:04:50.820> can't<00:04:51.030> remember<00:04:51.210> what<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:51.690> said

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
something I can't remember what it said

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.340 
something I can't remember what it said
it<00:04:52.650> had<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:52.800> different<00:04:53.010> logo<00:04:53.310> on<00:04:53.639> it<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.350> it

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
it had a different logo on it and it

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.140 
it had a different logo on it and it
took<00:04:55.620> forever<00:04:55.830> for<00:04:56.280> this<00:04:56.580> thing<00:04:56.729> to<00:04:56.850> load<00:04:57.000> the

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
took forever for this thing to load the

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.330 
took forever for this thing to load the
game<00:04:57.330> I've<00:04:58.110> never<00:04:58.410> seen<00:04:58.650> something<00:04:58.889> take<00:04:59.160> so

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
game I've never seen something take so

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
game I've never seen something take so
long<00:04:59.520> it<00:04:59.820> went<00:05:00.030> through<00:05:00.300> a<00:05:00.330> regular<00:05:01.260> check<00:05:01.650> and

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
long it went through a regular check and

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.909 
long it went through a regular check and
check<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.510> see<00:05:03.660> if<00:05:03.750> everything<00:05:04.110> was<00:05:04.229> ok<00:05:04.620> then

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
check to see if everything was ok then

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.280 
check to see if everything was ok then
it<00:05:05.040> went<00:05:05.190> through<00:05:05.400> ROM<00:05:06.210> check<00:05:06.630> then<00:05:07.080> it<00:05:07.169> went

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
it went through ROM check then it went

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.379 
it went through ROM check then it went
through<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.530> ram<00:05:07.889> check<00:05:08.280> and<00:05:08.700> it<00:05:09.060> was<00:05:09.180> going

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
through a ram check and it was going

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.340 
through a ram check and it was going
like<00:05:09.419> I<00:05:09.900> mean<00:05:10.169> just<00:05:10.500> 1%<00:05:10.889> 2%<00:05:11.460> each<00:05:12.120> time<00:05:12.540> so<00:05:12.930> the

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
like I mean just 1% 2% each time so the

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.810 
like I mean just 1% 2% each time so the
whole<00:05:13.470> process<00:05:13.710> took<00:05:14.070> a<00:05:14.130> couple<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.520> minutes

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
whole process took a couple of minutes

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.690 
whole process took a couple of minutes
but<00:05:15.450> once<00:05:15.870> everything<00:05:16.350> gets<00:05:16.650> loaded<00:05:17.430> onto

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
but once everything gets loaded onto

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.440 
but once everything gets loaded onto
this<00:05:18.210> dim<00:05:18.570> board<00:05:18.810> here<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.889> the<00:05:20.460> gd-rom<00:05:20.820> is<00:05:21.210> no

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
this dim board here the the gd-rom is no

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.750 
this dim board here the the gd-rom is no
longer<00:05:21.780> used<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.229> doesn't<00:05:22.530> doesn't<00:05:23.220> start<00:05:23.610> up

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
longer used it doesn't doesn't start up

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.159 
longer used it doesn't doesn't start up
it<00:05:23.910> doesn't<00:05:24.060> spend<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.450> disk<00:05:24.630> so<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:24.870> saves

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
it doesn't spend the disk so it saves

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.640 
it doesn't spend the disk so it saves
the<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:26.490> drive<00:05:27.060> from<00:05:27.450> being<00:05:27.720> constantly<00:05:28.289> on

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
the the drive from being constantly on

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.810 
the the drive from being constantly on
but<00:05:29.370> it<00:05:29.490> loads<00:05:29.610> all<00:05:29.820> the<00:05:29.880> info<00:05:30.270> in<00:05:30.419> here<00:05:30.720> and

to<00:05:42.979> make<00:05:43.099> a<00:05:43.129> long<00:05:43.550> story<00:05:43.789> short<00:05:44.030> it<00:05:44.689> is<00:05:44.749> working

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
to make a long story short it is working

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.050 
to make a long story short it is working
it's<00:05:46.069> working<00:05:46.270> fantastic<00:05:47.949> so<00:05:48.949> like<00:05:49.580> I<00:05:49.729> said<00:05:49.789> it

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
it's working fantastic so like I said it

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.969 
it's working fantastic so like I said it
just<00:05:50.270> took<00:05:50.479> forever<00:05:51.020> for<00:05:51.199> this<00:05:51.469> thing<00:05:51.650> to<00:05:51.800> load

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
just took forever for this thing to load

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.369 
just took forever for this thing to load
up<00:05:52.189> I<00:05:52.430> mean<00:05:52.759> just<00:05:53.240> a<00:05:53.360> really<00:05:53.870> really<00:05:54.139> long<00:05:54.319> time

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:54.379 
up I mean just a really really long time

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:56.739 
up I mean just a really really long time
for<00:05:54.830> everything<00:05:55.039> to<00:05:55.340> get<00:05:55.430> set<00:05:55.729> up<00:05:55.759> but<00:05:56.180> once<00:05:56.509> it

00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:56.749

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:51.659 
only problem with these dim boards as

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:54.260 
only problem with these dim boards as
I've<00:06:52.199> been<00:06:52.469> you<00:06:53.129> know<00:06:53.159> told<00:06:53.550> and<00:06:53.759> as<00:06:53.879> I<00:06:54.029> found

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
I've been you know told and as I found

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.529 
I've been you know told and as I found
out<00:06:54.509> here<00:06:54.930> is<00:06:55.050> that<00:06:55.589> on<00:06:56.099> the<00:06:56.490> back<00:06:56.759> side<00:06:56.819> here

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 
out here is that on the back side here

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:59.450 
out here is that on the back side here
underneath<00:06:58.020> this<00:06:58.319> cover<00:06:58.589> there's<00:06:58.949> a<00:06:59.039> battery

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
underneath this cover there's a battery

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.779 
underneath this cover there's a battery
and<00:06:59.759> once<00:07:00.599> I<00:07:00.719> battery<00:07:00.960> dies<00:07:01.409> which<00:07:02.189> it<00:07:02.400> must

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:02.789 
and once I battery dies which it must

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.850 
and once I battery dies which it must
have<00:07:03.060> died<00:07:03.389> I'm<00:07:03.719> guessing<00:07:04.199> it<00:07:04.349> must<00:07:04.560> have<00:07:04.680> died

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860
