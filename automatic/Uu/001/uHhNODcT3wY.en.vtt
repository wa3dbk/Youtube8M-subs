00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:19.250
 live comments here live from the studio 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.700
 blah blah blah and back and forth and friends 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.860
 I drank four beers and after 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.590
 the second I'm basically times 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.390
 So tipsy not take it amiss yes 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.640
 I'm lapping for two beers after four 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.490
 Beer I was told was what is there 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.410
 I 'm just a victim who somehow 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.740
 the word victim somehow to one 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.230
 become a favorite word 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.420
 But forget that once friends 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.329
 Battlefield 4 is out on the xbox 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.210
 360 I got from a buddy 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.380
 to play but I bought myself 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.329
 because I think it's more of a 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.910
 waste of money that one of the 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.970
 this console will catch you like you 're in there 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.110
 can follow a background waiting 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.939
 small mango thumb he super only one 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.450
 assi dna you can see him behind 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.579
 push battlefield 4 looks right 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.829
 shit out the textures are too late 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:16.219
 the textures are already mushy 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:19.249
 The graphic is generally really bad 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.899
 So correct me so how five years ago 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:22.999
 somehow looks really shit out of the 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.709
 is no easy given the 

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:26.479
 weapons they now precisely the weapons look 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.590
 accordingly quite ridiculous 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.990
 if you look at the weapon 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.149
 and then this one too 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.560
 gangster of the guy of the type 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.509
 one does not step in raffs so one is 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.700
 gene is already as the lambed properly 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:43.639
 So I think it's weird and now 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.490
 an opinion of me and ask to all 

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:48.289
 Battlefield fans just my opinion 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.609
 accept that is my opinion ok me 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.950
 does not have to be your opinion 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.479
 it also has nothing to do with me 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.590
 yes only am and that the not that the 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.899
 catch me here so no it plays 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.709
 it's just that I have that 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:08.220
 just do not play well, I think 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:11.130
 battlefield was 3 and three times as good 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.480
 this is the game it is the graphic 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.800
 worse in my opinion the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.180
 weapons more precisely the maps shitty than 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.950
 the maps are really shit that is 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.190
 here the only merck I like 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.850
 so immediately because of not construction 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.080
 everything else was really bad maps yes 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.630
 I actually have a lot of people 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.010
 played around just to see where 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.870
 what and so the connection is now and then 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.550
 so funny from time to time I need two 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.960
 shot for your opponent and now and then 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.680
 does not stand after a whole 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.930
 magazine 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.910
 especially then it comes to that one 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.160
 after three clicks already munitions 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.600
 has problems and it can not be that 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.360
 I also instructed as yet 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.760
 any rems then ammo 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.840
 give or not 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.200
 different examined times as well 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.209
 i only bob drivers here the k depending on 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.670
 which weapons are not available 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.320
 yes, I'm empty and yes, but me 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.270
 do not get bored now so 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.020
 As I said that is my opinion with the 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.630
 At the game 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.160
 the graphic I do not like at all 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.120
 me it should be better on the pc too 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.350
 Of course, yes, it is logical yes 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.430
 maybe I'll go for the next one 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.650
 Go or something like that 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.900
 cheaper it but I have to say 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.810
 for me, the game is bad 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.080
 Battlefield 3 and alone the wrong one 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.420
 the one who does it here, so to speak 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.090
 will crash well into the ground 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.590
 and as much as I like ghost, I have 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.980
 first feedback from a buddy 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.019
 he got that he says it's a game 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.500
 already good can not do much 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.769
 say online sessions because there are 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.360
 but still like to arms and the 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.460
 whole system and so looks good 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.800
 but still want to 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.260
 I do not say much about it now 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.300
 careful with the statements because 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.990
 otherwise I will crucify him if 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.910
 that is not true and therefore no 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.700
 pig gives me ammo and me here 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.710
 I do not want to divulge anything here 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.320
 everything and nothing at most 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.090
 a one a ball in the head 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.710
 lost 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.330
 yes friends as I said so please 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.710
 just accepted my opinion 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.350
 nothing to do with me staying 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.240
 Of course, do not understand or something 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.440
 it just has to do with that is 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.080
 it is ridiculous that I have three people 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.490
 killer and then no ammo anymore 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.290
 and that the graphics shit is the 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.940
 have absolutely no trouble 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.750
 I find that just a bit of a 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.040
 just do naughty that that is so 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:48.820
 I'll go get it soon 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:51.540
 maybe we'll see the first semester 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.010
 day foundation and death before i get him yes 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.930
 yes, so few, I'll get me 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.490
 maybe it's better than that 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.200
 maybe there is something there by then 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.360
 pushes but I find it a cheekiness 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.610
 that we all assume everyone 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.090
 game idea patched wait two three 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.150
 weeks 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.620
 I think that's a bit of a shit why 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.850
 You can not get the game out of it 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.930
 already works why do you have to 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.480
 the patch is waiting for the game 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.010
 That works a bit 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.100
 shit but that's just what 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.390
 all these new games and I am 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.860
 curious if this will change in the future 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.910
 But you do not believe because everyone is standing 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.100
 only on money money and money and important 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.720
 is sold tell us shit times 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.240
 a beta is out of the triggers 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.640
 community said they will patch her 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.200
 and then there's the fans of 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.900
 call of duty then gives the fanbase and 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.380
 battlefield and diddy diddy are yes 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.640
 anyway, both of them are sure to fight 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.600
 and so it is laborious 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.640
 as I said no my first opinion too 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.800
 Battlefield 4 worse than battlefield 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.180
 3 makes the maps are worse the 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.940
 Graphics is worse the choice of 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.600
 actually everything is more precise 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.640
 actually should not be important 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.930
 idea yes 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.800
 I do not really enjoy this time either 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.270
 and yes you can yours we can 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.730
 of course, your opinion to write 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.260
 but just accept my opinion 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.850
 i am a honest guy i say 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.740
 simply my opinion is again 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.170
 I do not want to misplace the game and 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.360
 There's sure to be people stamping in the ground 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.130
 we like it 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.870
 I'm just the one who likes to 60 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.240
 frames per second game I am one 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.700
 who likes to play liquid and he likes 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.280
 recognizes the counter and Jesus stops 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.650
 The maps are rather difficult to add 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.540
 no idea , I hope you have it 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:40.370
 Please write an opinion 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.750
 what you say otherwise yes me 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.250
 be a few videos then in the future 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.940
 maybe still upload from 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.590
 battlefield 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.930
 Maybe mine remembers 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:51.140
 opinion see thank you for seeing 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.360
 and above all things was like 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.090
 said he has paper behind and 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.490
 additionally it is live commented and 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.980
 actually I have him in front of like 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.780
 We can do more to drink in the future 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.750
 me if I comment live there 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.650
 I go through and liquid and without 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.480
 interruptions so my wife says 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.240
 actually you talk too much garbage but 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.620
 actually I think the guys 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.370
 thanks for seeing you until next time 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.370
 your aschau
