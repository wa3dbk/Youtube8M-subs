00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
between the very edge and the glue so

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.270 
between the very edge and the glue so
that<00:02:45.900> when<00:02:46.050> we<00:02:46.140> smoosh<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.560> down<00:02:46.830> onto<00:02:47.100> the

that when we smoosh it down onto the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.949 
that when we smoosh it down onto the
plate<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.730> glue<00:02:47.880> doesn't<00:02:48.060> seep<00:02:48.390> out<00:02:48.540> at<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
edges but like whatevs if it does that

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.550 
edges but like whatevs if it does that
dries<00:02:51.209> fairly<00:02:51.420> clear<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:51.990> just<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.170> little<00:02:52.380> tip

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560

next with a ruler and permanent marker
I'm<00:05:27.919> just<00:05:28.069> going<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.250> go<00:05:28.370> along<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.910> edges<00:05:29.210> to

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
I'm just going to go along the edges to

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.939 
I'm just going to go along the edges to
outline<00:05:29.720> and<00:05:29.930> define<00:05:30.289> the<00:05:30.440> shape<00:05:30.620> of<00:05:30.680> the

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
outline and define the shape of the

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.800 
outline and define the shape of the
arrow<00:05:31.130> this<00:05:31.669> also<00:05:31.970> makes<00:05:32.150> our<00:05:32.210> edges<00:05:32.539> even

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
arrow this also makes our edges even

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.570 
arrow this also makes our edges even
sharper<00:05:33.169> if<00:05:33.349> you<00:05:33.470> did<00:05:33.680> have<00:05:33.860> any<00:05:34.039> paint<00:05:34.310> seep

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
and to finish off the arrow I decided to

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.530 
and to finish off the arrow I decided to
draw<00:05:41.920> a<00:05:42.070> line<00:05:42.340> down<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.730> center<00:05:42.880> add<00:05:43.210> some

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
draw a line down the center add some
