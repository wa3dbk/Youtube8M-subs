there

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:03:41.460 

you

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.149 

this<00:03:42.470> is<00:03:42.680> uh<00:03:43.659> what's<00:03:44.659> left<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.379> runaround

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
this is uh what's left of the runaround

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.789 
this is uh what's left of the runaround
it's<00:03:46.489> really<00:03:46.670> not<00:03:46.760> that<00:03:46.909> bad<00:03:47.120> but<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.799> service

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
it's really not that bad but the service

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.500 
it's really not that bad but the service
station<00:03:48.980> said<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.610> we<00:03:49.730> probably<00:03:50.000> need<00:03:50.239> to<00:03:50.269> go

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
station said that we probably need to go

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.259 
station said that we probably need to go
and<00:03:50.690> replace<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.230> because<00:03:51.349> I<00:03:51.970> guess<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.120> can

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
and replace it because I guess you can

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:06.339 
and replace it because I guess you can

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
to crack on it so I got this new part

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.530 
to crack on it so I got this new part
from<00:04:13.010> parts<00:04:13.730> geek.com

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540

from parts geek.com
and<00:04:19.840> basically<00:04:20.840> it's<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.350> box<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.190> came<00:04:22.400> in

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
and basically it's the box that came in

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.740 
and basically it's the box that came in
and<00:04:23.410> that<00:04:24.410> was<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.590> part<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.270> my<00:04:26.270> problem<00:04:26.720> I

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
and that was the part and my problem I

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.210 
and that was the part and my problem I
didn't<00:04:26.930> have<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.169> jack<00:04:27.740> up<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:27.979> engine

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
didn't have to jack up the engine

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.640 
didn't have to jack up the engine
nothing<00:04:28.520> just<00:04:29.050> basically<00:04:30.050> just<00:04:30.229> losing<00:04:30.590> the

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
nothing just basically just losing the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.939 
nothing just basically just losing the
bolts<00:04:30.949> take<00:04:31.190> them<00:04:31.310> out<00:04:31.460> put<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.030> new<00:04:32.949> shock

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
bolts take them out put the new shock

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.620 
bolts take them out put the new shock
mount<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:34.370> basically<00:04:34.970> it's<00:04:35.120> just<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.389> shock

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
mount and basically it's just a shock

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.120 
mount and basically it's just a shock
absorber<00:04:36.110> more<00:04:36.289> than<00:04:36.380> anything<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:37.060> that's

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
absorber more than anything and that's

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.640 
absorber more than anything and that's
all<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.250> is

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
all it is

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.680

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
now um toyota also the sienna also has a

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.279 
now um toyota also the sienna also has a
another<00:04:47.860> shock<00:04:48.860> absorber<00:04:49.370> on<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.639> engine

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
another shock absorber on the engine

00:04:50.289 --> 00:05:05.200 
another shock absorber on the engine
basically<00:04:52.479> it<00:04:53.479> is<00:04:57.729> see<00:04:58.729> it<00:04:58.760> there

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210

it's<00:05:05.720> right<00:05:05.930> there<00:05:06.520> this<00:05:07.520> device<00:05:07.940> here<00:05:10.150> right

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
it's right there this device here right

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.279 
it's right there this device here right
there<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:13.180> we<00:05:14.180> replace<00:05:14.539> that<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.900> other<00:05:15.020> day

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
that was no trouble at all didn't I put

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.439 
that was no trouble at all didn't I put
a<00:05:18.199> jack<00:05:18.949> under<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.550> engine<00:05:19.669> just<00:05:20.120> in<00:05:20.270> case

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
a jack under the engine just in case

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.140 
a jack under the engine just in case
that<00:05:20.860> just<00:05:21.860> as<00:05:22.039> a<00:05:22.070> support<00:05:22.490> not<00:05:22.639> to<00:05:22.669> raise<00:05:22.940> it

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
that just as a support not to raise it

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.490 
that just as a support not to raise it
up<00:05:23.210> or<00:05:23.419> anything<00:05:23.560> but<00:05:24.560> I<00:05:24.680> just<00:05:24.860> I<00:05:26.110> just<00:05:27.110> put<00:05:27.470> a

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
up or anything but I just I just put a

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.930 
up or anything but I just I just put a
jack<00:05:27.770> with<00:05:27.979> a<00:05:28.009> board<00:05:28.280> underneath<00:05:28.639> of<00:05:28.789> there

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
jack with a board underneath of there

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.050 
jack with a board underneath of there
and<00:05:29.680> that's<00:05:30.680> just<00:05:30.979> a<00:05:31.070> shock<00:05:31.430> absorber<00:05:31.880> more

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
and that's just a shock absorber more

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.560 
and that's just a shock absorber more
than<00:05:32.210> anything<00:05:32.389> so<00:05:32.630> that's<00:05:33.050> what<00:05:33.259> I<00:05:33.289> did<00:05:33.470> with
