well I like and what most skateboarders

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.279 
well I like and what most skateboarders
confer<00:00:45.890> is<00:00:46.890> when<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.700> feel<00:00:48.210> steady<00:00:48.870> equally

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
confer is when you feel steady equally

level<00:00:50.000> in<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.210> air<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:52.260> best<00:00:52.469> way<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
level in the air the best way to do that

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.240 
level in the air the best way to do that
really<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:54.239> keep<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.690> shoulders<00:00:55.110> level

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
really is to keep your shoulders level

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.139 
really is to keep your shoulders level
that's<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> keep<00:00:56.610> your<00:00:56.820> center<00:00:57.120> of

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
that's going to keep your center of

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.610 
that's going to keep your center of
balance<00:00:57.270> between<00:00:57.989> your<00:00:58.320> two<00:00:58.500> feet<00:01:00.530> when<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
balance between your two feet when you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.070 
balance between your two feet when you
knock<00:01:01.890> your<00:01:02.129> center<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> balance<00:01:02.609> back<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
knock your center of balance back it

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.469 
knock your center of balance back it
keeps<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:05.159> weight<00:01:05.400> back<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.970> then<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> keeps

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
keeps the weight back and then it keeps

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.450 
keeps the weight back and then it keeps
the<00:01:06.689> wheels<00:01:06.930> down<00:01:07.200> now<00:01:08.040> there's<00:01:08.250> other<00:01:08.369> ways

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the wheels down now there's other ways

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.100 
the wheels down now there's other ways
to<00:01:08.790> keep<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> wheels<00:01:09.210> down<00:01:09.420> too<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.750> can
