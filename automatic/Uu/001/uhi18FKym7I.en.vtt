initially<00:01:23.549> at<00:01:24.299> first<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.229> heavy<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
initially at first I was so heavy and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.679 
initially at first I was so heavy and
never<00:01:26.100> felt<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.520> doing<00:01:26.820> anything<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.659> I

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
never felt like doing anything and so I

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.380 
never felt like doing anything and so I
didn't<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.229> basically<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:29.220> let<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.909> lap<00:01:30.119> man

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
didn't I basically just let the lap man

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.539 
didn't I basically just let the lap man
do<00:01:31.079> its<00:01:31.290> thing<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.710> let<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> work<00:01:32.250> and

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
do its thing and let it work and

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
do its thing and let it work and
basically<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.990> lap-band<00:01:34.229> teaches<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
basically the lap-band teaches you to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.490 
basically the lap-band teaches you to
eat<00:01:35.250> like<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.520> human<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:36.990> really<00:01:37.259> what

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
eat like a human and that's really what

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.100 
eat like a human and that's really what
i<00:01:37.560> did<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> then<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.119> was<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.659> simple<00:01:39.810> as

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
i did and then it was just as simple as

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.730 
i did and then it was just as simple as
starting<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.829> walk<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.899> that's<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.560> was
