the<00:03:30.959> end<00:03:31.109> state<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.590> game<00:03:31.739> which<00:03:32.489> we<00:03:32.700> have

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
the end state of the game which we have

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.069 
the end state of the game which we have
a<00:03:32.880> different<00:03:33.209> plan<00:03:33.359> for<00:03:33.389> that<00:03:33.690> which<00:03:33.810> I'll<00:03:33.959> get

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
a different plan for that which I'll get

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.650 
a different plan for that which I'll get
to<00:03:34.139> in<00:03:34.260> just<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.590> second<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.609> this<00:03:36.000> alliance<00:03:36.329> can

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
to in just a second so this alliance can

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.690 
to in just a second so this alliance can
actually<00:03:37.109> work<00:03:37.680> together<00:03:37.920> in<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.430> tight-knit

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
actually work together in a tight-knit

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.120 
actually work together in a tight-knit
way<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.420> other<00:03:39.660> groups<00:03:40.200> cannot<00:03:40.500> do<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:40.950> work

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
way that other groups cannot do and work

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.080 
way that other groups cannot do and work
on<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:42.170> work<00:03:43.170> on<00:03:43.350> goals<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.950> no<00:03:44.220> single<00:03:44.639> player

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
on a work on goals that no single player

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.840 
on a work on goals that no single player
can<00:03:45.540> achieve<00:03:45.900> not<00:03:46.769> only<00:03:46.889> do<00:03:47.130> being<00:03:47.700> an

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
can achieve not only do being an

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.340 
can achieve not only do being an
alliance<00:03:48.090> with<00:03:48.299> somebody<00:03:48.569> guarantee<00:03:49.319> a

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
alliance with somebody guarantee a

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.289 
alliance with somebody guarantee a
certain<00:03:49.680> level<00:03:50.069> of<00:03:50.250> trust<00:03:50.549> with<00:03:50.880> them<00:03:51.030> they

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
certain level of trust with them they

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.479 
certain level of trust with them they
can't<00:03:51.540> fire<00:03:51.750> on<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.139> you<00:03:52.739> know<00:03:52.859> they<00:03:53.010> can't<00:03:53.250> do

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
can't fire on you you know they can't do

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.370 
can't fire on you you know they can't do
basic<00:03:53.880> things<00:03:54.090> without<00:03:54.329> at<00:03:54.630> least<00:03:54.660> dropping

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
basic things without at least dropping

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.050 
basic things without at least dropping
out<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.650> Alliance<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.280> inform<00:03:56.849> you<00:03:57.030> that

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
out of the Alliance to inform you that

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.129 
out of the Alliance to inform you that
there's<00:03:57.420> something<00:03:57.660> wrong<00:03:58.010> but<00:03:59.010> also<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.959> can

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
there's something wrong but also you can

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.080 
there's something wrong but also you can
work<00:04:01.319> on<00:04:01.470> grand<00:04:02.010> projects<00:04:02.670> like<00:04:02.849> for<00:04:03.030> instance

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
work on grand projects like for instance

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.990 
work on grand projects like for instance
you<00:04:03.720> can<00:04:03.870> put<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.019> dyson<00:04:04.530> sphere<00:04:04.859> around<00:04:05.250> and

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
you can put a dyson sphere around and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.180 
you can put a dyson sphere around and
and<00:04:06.329> start<00:04:06.750> collecting<00:04:07.230> massive<00:04:07.889> amounts<00:04:08.190> of

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
and start collecting massive amounts of

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.759 
and start collecting massive amounts of
power<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.819> energy<00:04:09.000> from<00:04:09.419> the<00:04:09.540> Sun<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.959> what's

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
power and energy from the Sun and what's

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.170 
power and energy from the Sun and what's
interesting<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.549> as<00:04:11.819> alliances

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
interesting is that as alliances

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.449 
interesting is that as alliances
continue<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.049> do<00:04:13.169> this<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.739> build<00:04:14.280> up<00:04:14.400> the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
continue to do this and and build up the

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.310 
continue to do this and and build up the
Dyson<00:04:14.910> Sphere<00:04:15.120> it's<00:04:15.299> actually<00:04:15.690> going<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.049> take

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
Dyson Sphere it's actually going to take

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.500 
Dyson Sphere it's actually going to take
power<00:04:16.620> away<00:04:16.769> from<00:04:16.979> other<00:04:17.370> planets<00:04:18.180> as<00:04:18.450> they

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
power away from other planets as they

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.469 
power away from other planets as they
begin<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.739> get<00:04:19.919> less<00:04:20.220> energy<00:04:20.910> from<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.269> sun's

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
begin to get less energy from the sun's

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.960 
begin to get less energy from the sun's
rays<00:04:21.840> so<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:23.039> that<00:04:23.190> sort<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.520> sense<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:23.849> can

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
rays so in that sort of sense you can

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.120 
rays so in that sort of sense you can
create<00:04:24.180> kind<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:24.450> localized<00:04:24.930> change<00:04:25.409> until<00:04:25.740> an

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
create kind of localized change until an

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.810 
create kind of localized change until an
alliance<00:04:26.340> because

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
alliance because

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.630 
alliance because
it's<00:04:26.940> so<00:04:27.570> annoying<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.860> maybe<00:04:29.250> other<00:04:29.550> people

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
it's so annoying that maybe other people

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.780 
it's so annoying that maybe other people
want<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.360> face<00:04:30.540> it<00:04:30.750> our<00:04:31.460> final<00:04:32.460> level<00:04:32.700> is

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
want to face it our final level is

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.940 
want to face it our final level is
called<00:04:33.030> coalition's<00:04:33.750> coalition's<00:04:34.620> aren't

nearly as well bound together

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.860 
nearly as well bound together
mechanically<00:04:38.100> as<00:04:38.370> alliances<00:04:38.700> are<00:04:39.120> there's<00:04:39.720> no

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
mechanically as alliances are there's no

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.560 
mechanically as alliances are there's no

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
to ruin your day in some way but there's

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.370 
to ruin your day in some way but there's
more<00:04:50.100> or<00:04:50.220> less<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.400> public<00:04:50.970> coming<00:04:51.810> together<00:04:51.960> of

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
more or less a public coming together of

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.560 
more or less a public coming together of
multiple<00:04:53.220> alliances<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:54.000> form<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.390> coalition

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
multiple alliances to form a coalition

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.880 
multiple alliances to form a coalition
now<00:04:56.390> we<00:04:57.390> don't<00:04:57.570> want<00:04:57.870> coalition's<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:58.620> become

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
now we don't want coalition's to become

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.140 
now we don't want coalition's to become
like<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.220> end<00:04:59.370> state<00:04:59.760> we're<00:04:59.970> like

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
like the end state we're like

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.700 
like the end state we're like
everybody's<00:05:00.660> just<00:05:00.810> always<00:05:01.020> in<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:01.260> coalition

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
everybody's just always in a coalition

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.380 
everybody's just always in a coalition
all<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.100> time<00:05:02.280> because<00:05:02.490> we've<00:05:02.760> realized<00:05:03.180> that

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
all the time because we've realized that

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.790 
all the time because we've realized that
that's<00:05:03.480> probably<00:05:03.750> not<00:05:04.200> a<00:05:04.260> really<00:05:04.530> good<00:05:04.680> in

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
that's probably not a really good in

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.980 
that's probably not a really good in
state<00:05:05.040> for<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.280> game<00:05:05.460> but<00:05:06.180> we<00:05:06.690> definitely

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
state for the game but we definitely

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.740 
state for the game but we definitely
want<00:05:07.440> goals<00:05:07.710> for<00:05:08.100> coalition<00:05:08.610> that<00:05:08.790> give<00:05:09.720> rise

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
want goals for coalition that give rise

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.470 
want goals for coalition that give rise
to<00:05:10.080> these<00:05:10.590> coalition's<00:05:10.920> for<00:05:11.670> certain<00:05:12.300> things

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
to these coalition's for certain things

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.770 
to these coalition's for certain things
for<00:05:13.170> example<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:14.150> coalition<00:05:15.150> may<00:05:15.420> decide<00:05:15.720> to

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
for example a coalition may decide to

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.440 
for example a coalition may decide to
take<00:05:16.110> over<00:05:16.410> an<00:05:16.500> entire<00:05:16.550> sector<00:05:17.550> of<00:05:17.760> space<00:05:18.030> or

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
take over an entire sector of space or

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.800 
take over an entire sector of space or
maybe<00:05:19.410> a<00:05:19.740> coalition<00:05:20.610> could<00:05:20.850> take<00:05:21.120> on<00:05:21.330> one<00:05:21.780> of

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
maybe a coalition could take on one of

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.380 
maybe a coalition could take on one of
the<00:05:21.960> MPC<00:05:22.530> factions<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:23.310> perhaps<00:05:23.730> either

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
the MPC factions and perhaps either

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.440 
the MPC factions and perhaps either
build<00:05:25.050> them<00:05:25.350> up<00:05:25.380> or<00:05:25.970> eradicate<00:05:26.970> them<00:05:27.180> and

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
build them up or eradicate them and

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.450 
build them up or eradicate them and
therefore<00:05:27.930> coalition's<00:05:28.830> are<00:05:28.980> more<00:05:29.250> like

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
therefore coalition's are more like

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.150 
therefore coalition's are more like
people<00:05:30.450> under<00:05:30.750> a<00:05:30.780> unified<00:05:31.020> goal<00:05:31.590> in<00:05:31.830> order<00:05:32.070> to

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
people under a unified goal in order to

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.540 
people under a unified goal in order to
create<00:05:32.340> an<00:05:32.580> indelible<00:05:33.420> mark<00:05:33.750> on<00:05:34.380> our<00:05:34.980> game<00:05:35.280> and

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
create an indelible mark on our game and

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.640 
create an indelible mark on our game and
we<00:05:35.610> think<00:05:35.970> that's<00:05:36.180> really<00:05:36.570> cool<00:05:36.780> but<00:05:37.440> at<00:05:37.560> the

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
we think that's really cool but at the

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.000 
we think that's really cool but at the
same<00:05:37.830> time<00:05:38.100> between<00:05:38.730> a<00:05:39.770> certain<00:05:40.770> amount<00:05:40.890> of

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
same time between a certain amount of

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.090 
same time between a certain amount of
distrust<00:05:41.370> within<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:41.820> game<00:05:42.000> and<00:05:42.240> also<00:05:43.100> some

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
distrust within the game and also some

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.650 
distrust within the game and also some
other<00:05:44.250> things<00:05:44.610> that<00:05:44.700> we'll<00:05:44.910> talk<00:05:44.940> about<00:05:45.120> when

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
other things that we'll talk about when

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.510 
other things that we'll talk about when
we<00:05:45.690> talk<00:05:45.840> about<00:05:46.050> intelligence<00:05:46.830> and<00:05:47.010> espionage

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
we talk about intelligence and espionage

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.580 
we talk about intelligence and espionage
we<00:05:48.090> don't<00:05:48.270> think<00:05:48.510> that<00:05:48.690> coalition's<00:05:49.440> will

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
we don't think that coalition's will

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.380 
we don't think that coalition's will
become<00:05:49.830> too<00:05:50.040> strong<00:05:50.370> or<00:05:50.580> too<00:05:50.610> powerful<00:05:51.180> the

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
become too strong or too powerful the

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.270 
become too strong or too powerful the

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
cracks within the Empire as the Empire

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.430 
cracks within the Empire as the Empire
grows<00:05:53.610> will<00:05:54.270> eventually<00:05:54.810> lead<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.080> its

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
grows will eventually lead to its

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.090 
grows will eventually lead to its
collapse<00:05:55.800> so<00:05:56.760> I<00:05:57.530> hope<00:05:58.530> that<00:05:58.740> all<00:05:58.860> of<00:05:58.890> you<00:05:59.010> are
