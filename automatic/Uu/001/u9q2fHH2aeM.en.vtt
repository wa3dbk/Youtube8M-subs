00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
simplify it a little bit so this is

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.810 
simplify it a little bit so this is
simple<00:00:54.780> Ock<00:00:54.899> next<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.920> are<00:00:56.070> taking<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.579> look

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
simple Ock next up we are taking a look

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.470 
simple Ock next up we are taking a look
at<00:00:57.000> clear<00:00:57.660> folders<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.440> again<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.850> might<00:01:00.300> be

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
at clear folders and again this might be

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.479 
at clear folders and again this might be
obvious<00:01:00.840> from<00:01:00.870> its<00:01:01.170> name<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:02.010> will<00:01:02.280> give

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
obvious from its name but this will give

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.000 
obvious from its name but this will give
you<00:01:02.670> clear<00:01:03.030> folders<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.750> iOS<00:01:04.229> 7<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:04.890> go

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010
