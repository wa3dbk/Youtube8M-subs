if<00:00:00.450> we<00:00:00.659> know<00:00:00.870> that<00:00:01.079> it's<00:00:01.199> close<00:00:01.380> grip<00:00:01.560> bench

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
if we know that it's close grip bench

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.860 
if we know that it's close grip bench
press<00:00:01.860> builds<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.580> wide<00:00:02.790> grip<00:00:03.000> bench<00:00:03.149> press<00:00:03.270> why

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
press builds a wide grip bench press why

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.809 
press builds a wide grip bench press why
should<00:00:04.140> we<00:00:04.259> even<00:00:04.440> bother<00:00:04.770> training<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.640> one

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
should we even bother training the one

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.340 
should we even bother training the one
the<00:00:06.420> only<00:00:06.569> thing<00:00:06.720> you're<00:00:06.839> really<00:00:06.930> gonna<00:00:07.140> get

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
the only thing you're really gonna get

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.230 
the only thing you're really gonna get
from<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:08.099> lot<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.519> internal<00:00:08.970> shoulder

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
from it is a lot of internal shoulder

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.120 
from it is a lot of internal shoulder
rotation<00:00:09.719> which<00:00:09.990> will<00:00:10.200> cause<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.650> do<00:00:10.920> it

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
rotation which will cause you to do it

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.950 
rotation which will cause you to do it
more<00:00:11.309> frequently<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.179> have<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.480> monitor<00:00:12.809> your

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
more frequently and have to monitor your

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.419 
more frequently and have to monitor your
training<00:00:13.290> accordingly<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.009> at<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> same

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
training accordingly and at the same

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.160 
training accordingly and at the same
time<00:00:14.730> you're<00:00:15.240> getting<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.509> specificity<00:00:16.139> of

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
time you're getting the specificity of

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.510 
time you're getting the specificity of
training<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.590> there<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.160> if<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.369> would

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
training in there so if you would

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.099 
training in there so if you would
compete<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.060> powerlifting<00:00:18.600> meet<00:00:18.840> then<00:00:19.020> you

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
compete in a powerlifting meet then you

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.779 
compete in a powerlifting meet then you
gotta<00:00:19.320> get<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.590> ultra<00:00:20.010> wide<00:00:20.189> bench<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.609> there

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
gotta get that ultra wide bench in there

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.490 
gotta get that ultra wide bench in there
that's<00:00:21.420> pretty<00:00:21.660> much<00:00:21.930> what<00:00:22.170> you'll<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.380> doing

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
that's pretty much what you'll be doing

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.410 
that's pretty much what you'll be doing
you'd<00:00:22.830> be<00:00:22.949> learning<00:00:23.310> who's<00:00:23.760> having<00:00:23.970> for<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
sport but other than that I don't really

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.279 
sport but other than that I don't really
see<00:00:26.580> any<00:00:26.730> purpose<00:00:27.060> for<00:00:27.090> if<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.930> do<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> close

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
see any purpose for if we do a close

see any purpose for if we do a close
compact<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.890> well<00:00:29.130> established<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.880> it

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
compact it's well established that it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.970 
compact it's well established that it

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
will build a workbench basic physiology

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.310

Street<00:00:34.350> banks<00:00:34.739> press<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> longer<00:00:35.430> a

Street banks press is a longer a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.090 
Street banks press is a longer a
demotion<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.420> could<00:00:36.570> typically<00:00:36.960> use<00:00:37.230> 15%

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
demotion and you could typically use 15%

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.950 
demotion and you could typically use 15%
less<00:00:38.309> weight<00:00:38.610> than<00:00:38.640> your<00:00:38.969> wide<00:00:39.149> grip<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.809> if

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
less weight than your wide grip so if

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.450 
less weight than your wide grip so if
you<00:00:40.079> could<00:00:40.260> increase<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.040> strength<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.370> your

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
you could increase the strength of your

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.069 
you could increase the strength of your
closed<00:00:41.670> grip<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.210> long<00:00:42.480> gas<00:00:42.719> range<00:00:42.989> of

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
closed grip with this long gas range of

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.450 
closed grip with this long gas range of
motion<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> shitty<00:00:43.710> leverages<00:00:44.100> with

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
motion with the shitty leverages with

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.830 
motion with the shitty leverages with
everything<00:00:44.820> working<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.660> favor

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
everything working not in your favor

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.500 
everything working not in your favor
when<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.680> widen<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.160> grip<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.969> joke<00:00:48.210> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
when you widen the grip it's a joke I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.630 
when you widen the grip it's a joke I
mean<00:00:49.200> some<00:00:49.469> people<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.039> do<00:00:50.160> 6-inch

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
mean some people that can do 6-inch

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.400 
mean some people that can do 6-inch
presses<00:00:51.090> when<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.420> go<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:51.719> wide<00:00:52.020> when

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
presses when they go really wide when

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.049 
presses when they go really wide when
you<00:00:52.500> compare<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> close<00:00:53.699> commands

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
you compare that to close commands

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.389 
you compare that to close commands
there's<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.930> big<00:00:55.079> difference<00:00:55.230> say<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.219> were

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
there's a big difference say you were

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.970 
there's a big difference say you were
closed<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:56.699> benching<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.360> 25<00:00:57.870> 15<00:00:58.800> repetitions

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
closed for benching to 25 15 repetitions

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.459 
closed for benching to 25 15 repetitions
right<00:00:59.550> chances<00:01:00.149> are<00:01:00.300> right<00:01:00.809> off<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> bat<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
right chances are right off the bat you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.369 
right chances are right off the bat you
could<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.949> 225<00:01:02.730> or<00:01:03.120> 20<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> wide<00:01:04.350> grip

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
could do a 225 or 20 with a wide grip

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.100 
could do a 225 or 20 with a wide grip
now<00:01:05.280> let's<00:01:05.519> say<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> take<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.240> same<00:01:06.750> number

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
now let's say you take that same number

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.780 
now let's say you take that same number
that<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.350> 25<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.950> 15<00:01:08.189> close<00:01:08.400> grip<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that to 25 and 15 close grip and you

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.730 
that to 25 and 15 close grip and you
bring<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> 20<00:01:09.570> reps<00:01:09.780> what<00:01:10.409> things<00:01:10.619> can

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
bring it up to 20 reps what things can

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.469 
bring it up to 20 reps what things can
happen<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> wire<00:01:11.310> bench<00:01:11.700> chances<00:01:12.330> are

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
happen to the wire bench chances are

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.750 
happen to the wire bench chances are
it's<00:01:12.659> gonna<00:01:12.750> be<00:01:12.930> around<00:01:13.110> 25<00:01:13.560> reps<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:14.400> this

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
it's gonna be around 25 reps all this

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.580 
it's gonna be around 25 reps all this
happened<00:01:15.240> without<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.840> having<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.140> Train<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
happened without you having to Train the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800 
happened without you having to Train the
wider<00:01:16.799> bench<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.880> why<00:01:18.150> should<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.420> even

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
wider bench so why should you even

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.840 
wider bench so why should you even
bother<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.740> legitimately<00:01:20.369> want<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
bother with it I I legitimately want to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.190 
bother with it I I legitimately want to
know<00:01:20.939> why<00:01:21.240> should<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.540> bother<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.049> if

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
know why should you bother with it if

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.780 
know why should you bother with it if
it's<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.770> gonna<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.400> only<00:01:23.549> gonna

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
it's all gonna if it's only gonna

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.280 
it's all gonna if it's only gonna
internally<00:01:24.299> rotate<00:01:24.689> your<00:01:24.750> shoulders<00:01:25.080> more

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
internally rotate your shoulders more

their weakness and that tells me a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.839 
their weakness and that tells me a
lot<00:02:06.930> about<00:02:07.049> their<00:02:07.350> strengths<00:02:07.590> why<00:02:08.550> would<00:02:08.759> you

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
lot about their strengths why would you

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.309 
lot about their strengths why would you
want<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.420> situation<00:02:09.989> when<00:02:10.229> you

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
want to have that situation when you

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.630 
want to have that situation when you
could<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.890> clothes<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.400> then<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
could just do the clothes and then the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.730 
could just do the clothes and then the
wives<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.120> get<00:02:12.239> support

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
wives to get support

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.250 
wives to get support
bigger<00:02:13.010> at<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.220> same<00:02:13.430> time<00:02:13.640> honestly<00:02:14.420> it

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
bigger at the same time honestly it

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.060 
bigger at the same time honestly it
makes<00:02:15.410> no<00:02:15.590> sense<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.920> me

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
makes no sense to me

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.100 
makes no sense to me
you<00:02:16.850> might<00:02:17.120> as<00:02:17.210> well<00:02:17.240> just<00:02:17.540> do<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.810> harder

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
you might as well just do the harder

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.960 
you might as well just do the harder
lift<00:02:18.320> then<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.190> white<00:02:19.340> then<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> wider

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
lift then the white then the wider

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.910 
lift then the white then the wider
variation<00:02:20.150> which<00:02:20.570> is<00:02:20.690> easier<00:02:20.990> goes<00:02:21.500> up<00:02:21.740> it's

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
variation which is easier goes up it's

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.290 
variation which is easier goes up it's
much<00:02:22.070> like<00:02:22.280> doing<00:02:22.400> an<00:02:22.580> incline<00:02:22.850> press<00:02:23.090> with

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
much like doing an incline press with

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.330 
much like doing an incline press with
bone<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> flat<00:02:23.780> bench<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.290> decline<00:02:24.860> press<00:02:25.160> will

bone a flat bench a decline press will

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.560 
bone a flat bench a decline press will
also<00:02:25.610> build<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.850> flat<00:02:26.030> base<00:02:26.150> but<00:02:26.330> not<00:02:26.420> as

also build a flat base but not as

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.610 
also build a flat base but not as
efficiently<00:02:26.960> as<00:02:27.080> if<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.290> work<00:02:27.440> through

efficiently as if you work through

efficiently as if you work through
inclines<00:02:27.950> because<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.670> leverages<00:02:29.120> are

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
inclines because the leverages are

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.880 
inclines because the leverages are

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
superior in a decline does that make

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.300 
superior in a decline does that make
sense

because it's harder to do it's a
vertical<00:02:35.510> press<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.050> could<00:02:36.200> use<00:02:36.320> less<00:02:36.530> weight

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
vertical press you could use less weight

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.050 
vertical press you could use less weight
you<00:02:37.040> have<00:02:37.130> shitty<00:02:37.340> leverages<00:02:37.730> when<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:37.970> go

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
you have shitty leverages when you go

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.460 
you have shitty leverages when you go
back<00:02:38.210> to<00:02:38.330> flat<00:02:38.540> bench<00:02:38.720> it's<00:02:39.020> easier<00:02:39.290> a

back to flat bench it's easier a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
of motion so why should you bother it

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.360 
of motion so why should you bother it
with<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.110> regular<00:02:45.260> white<00:02:45.560> good<00:02:45.800> you

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.220 
with the regular white good you
understand<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.910> mean<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:47.510> can<00:02:47.660> still<00:02:47.810> train<00:02:48.110> it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230

a lot of dumbbell presses weighted dips
preferably<00:03:14.210> I<00:03:14.420> mean<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.530> wider<00:03:15.740> bench<00:03:16.160> won't

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
preferably I mean the wider bench won't

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.740 
preferably I mean the wider bench won't
bother<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:16.850> all<00:03:17.360> right

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750

so that will be my argument a closed
commence<00:03:20.090> press<00:03:20.360> will<00:03:20.720> build<00:03:20.990> a<00:03:21.140> what<00:03:21.320> so<00:03:21.920> why

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
commence press will build a what so why

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.070

you guys to dispute my point and you
can't<00:03:25.910> use<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.030> specificity<00:03:26.660> training

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
can't use the specificity training

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.540 
can't use the specificity training
example<00:03:27.350> because<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.770> already<00:03:28.010> debunked<00:03:28.430> that

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
example because I already debunked that
