00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.980
 well it's all alone and crafter &amp; 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.890
 crafts of these stars are going to end up 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.279
 today for a new tutorial 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.519
 new rather tricks on minecraft 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.199
 xbox so that's something that 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.279
 subscribers told me that it was who was 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.469
 possible and achievable 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.879
 it's a trick today that we 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.469
 let's see propose torches so 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.790
 so here I am going to show you this 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.520
 trick and after a new application 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.660
 a tutorial update so during 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.530
 this video so it's nice to you 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.480
 to find because it is true that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.739
 moment I think galley to find 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.640
 tutorial ideas but it's true that I have more 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.860
 too much motivation 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 lately because I find 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.030
 that I turn a little in circles on 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.690
 minecraft xbox and it's hard to 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.739
 take out your fingers as we say and I 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.360
 found that this trick was really 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.470
 smart to give you because if 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.369
 you do not know her really 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.439
 really cool 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.700
 you see that allows you to pose on 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.119
 blocks where normally we can not 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.930
 put torches as I blue 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.350
 the musical block the table of the table of 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.150
 kraft the oven the dispatcher can not 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.159
 ask in my soul nor leverage george 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.780
 hoenig button we can do it on pc 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.070
 so beware this trick does not allow 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.270
 not to put it on any block 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.100
 for example you still can not 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.790
 imposed on the TNT or on tracks on 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.530
 agrees 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.880
 in fact it just makes up for the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.170
 delay we have on the pc version you 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.689
 know that on the pc version we can 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.850
 put torches buttons and that's 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.350
 on these famous block and that its version 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.820
 xbox we can not but there is a 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.689
 solution 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.250
 no I give it to you so here is you 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.659
 see that I put the torches on these 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.280
 blocks there and here I did a little 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.960
 difference I put a lever for you 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.820
 show that we also pose any 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.799
 kind of blog and the advantage is that by 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.490
 example if here we put something 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.049
 in that of its europe 1 so it's in 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.250
 more functional like it's not like 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.409
 if there really was a bug that serve 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.250
 nothing so it can serve 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.810
 so we'll see this trick she's 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.090
 really very simple so you will need 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.009
 a neutral block you will need 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.480
 so ivy in survival for the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.510
 recover it's pretty simple 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.959
 need a pair of scissors that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.489
 normally here the d6 haye and cutting 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.780
 with the shears duliÃ¨re you 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.269
 get the ivy so that's enough 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.560
 easy finally recovered you can 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.540
 even make you ivy shoots 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.269
 it was to decorate it can be great 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.640
 nice so that's it and you'll need it 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.769
 famous block on which you want to ask 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.060
 your button so the age of one year I 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.379
 took all the blocks on which it was 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.680
 possible it is not possible for example 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.090
 on the green neither on the agglo stone nor we 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.040
 Quality I dined on the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.239
 tracks have, for example, been 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.950
 not asked it's possible on the 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.150
 discounter so to get there it's 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.410
 quite simple you have a first 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.109
 technique that involves stacking two 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.480
 blocks so the bottom block will be your 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.280
 blog on which you ask them your 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.750
 torch you put a wall on top for 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.010
 those who are stingy you expect you 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.109
 wait until it grows it goes down in 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.879
 below for what they are not you 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.980
 take a second winging you pose 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.629
 underneath it so here is the sapn 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.859
 all and instantly any case this is the 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.650
 blog from below normally your book 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.450
 is supposed to stay like this here in there in 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.220
 below so not on the ivy beside 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.079
 you ask your blog on which wanted 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.209
 ask an object so here another 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.250
 distance hours and you can ask 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.180
 on top a lever a button torches 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.560
 of redstone torches normal and 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.359
 so it's no we'll see the button 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.489
 because he record is one of only 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.169
 I have not done so the button you aim 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.849
 in fact ivy and you lay on the 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.290
 ivy and the it's going to make disappear the 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.599
 ivy and put you the button instead 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.120
 so if now we are for example 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:45.510
 the blogs in by pressing the 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.980
 sanou button drop the famous block so 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.280
 it's really practical, it catches up with 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.090
 delay 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.349
 the same technical PC version so there 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.880
 you can let crime grow 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.489
 it's not so that it can push on 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.989
 sides normally yes same technique 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.109
 with all in fact I'm going to games you 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.160
 do it like that at 5.5 tackle like that 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.419
 at least one is quiet where against 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.150
 the series of shows we will try to do 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:08.160
 like that how is my favorite 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.930
 but hey, I could not 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.540
 necessarily sacrificing a serious sporting side 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.829
 we're going to sacrifice that one we're going to ask and 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.329
 there you see that one can ask and a 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.180
 button so on the side it works too 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.049
 is a lever is for example a torch 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.500
 like this 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.930
 so here if I put blocks of teeth 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.460
 see it drop 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.800
 that's working too 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.419
 it's pretty handy the buttons too 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.770
 always walk here so no matter 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.080
 break it the fa on which you 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.780
 do it work so it's a trick 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.919
 rather simple is that compared to the 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.509
 pc version may appear but 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.830
 completely useless but good on the 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.930
 pc version just take years 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.330
 mick so it 's squatting for those 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.680
 who would not understand the mosquito he 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.569
 is actually enough on the pc version there 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.430
 just have the object on which we 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.259
 wants to ask to squat as I 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.930
 am and ask but on the pc version 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.419
 xbox it does not work see what we render 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.440
 always in the object in question if 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.699
 it's a kraft table we get into 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.770
 the kraft table and if it blocks him 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.419
 did makhlouf 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.830
 So it's not not practical 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.150
 is this ivy technique that is 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.949
 really very very simple because the 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.000
 ivy is not very expensive and which 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.219
 allow for that 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.539
 simplify your systems to celebrate between 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.310
 quotes because I do not offer 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.830
 not just a useless tutorial I you 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.629
 propose to click on the links that 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.479
 now appear on the video 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:24.180
 so here's to click on the link of the 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.889
 video so posted the notifications it 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.539
 y to the left the tool distributor 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.490
 that I updated that makes it the 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.659
 minecraft tutorial zephyr so for those 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.539
 who want to go see see go see 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:35.039
 directly the minecraft zephyr tutorial 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.569
 if not, then I'll make them you 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.340
 click on the link and if not there is the 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.380
 tutorial right which is actually the 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.349
 armor dispenser as you the 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.219
 see who is updated thanks to 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.960
 this faculty 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.430
 so this is a tutorial that zephyr did 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.289
 not done that I had already done that so 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.000
 I update with this technique 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.580
 which allows to have a system a lot 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.219
 cheaper so here on this I hope 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.319
 this tutorial you will have to think about 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:59.639
 put a gm commented to share there is 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.139
 tutorials that happens do you 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:02.340
 do not worry I do not let go of the version 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:02.879
 xbox you are always on your side 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.789
 worry 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.620
 I do not give up xbox xbox 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.969
 it's just that I'm here I have more 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.529
 too much motivation lately of 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.879
 make cuts because I auriel 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:14.580
 really intend the impression of 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:17.039
 go around in circles and make a door 2 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.819
 by 2 3 by 3 4 by 4 5 by 5 6 by if 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.409
 it's not the kind of thing that 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.400
 I'm interested in what I find that hyper 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.690
 repetitive it's not necessarily 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.629
 interesting who already has millions 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.949
 tutorial on youtube and that here I have 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:27.449
 tried I like trying to find 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:28.949
 stuff a little phone or stuff 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.260
 new stuff really useful because 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.400
 that one door this perfect 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.160
 apart from just for fun I do not find 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.320
 it's obviously very useful so here it is 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.210
 what I'm telling you something else is thinking about 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.140
 click on the links and then at the 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.140
 next week chau at all
