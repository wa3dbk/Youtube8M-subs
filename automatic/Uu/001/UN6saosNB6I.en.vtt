 acts I try to live with my time 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.470

 thick novice fog filled this debate 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.740
 so I last pages and pages 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.900
 and pages come come me 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.790
 not expected to follow doubt barely 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.530
 heart of the storm in a fog 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.270
 thick novice fill women 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.940
 then cast a nest of pages and pages 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.740
 and pages already a lease that I have not 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.660

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.300
 the friends on ina 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.250

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.110
 and there's no cherries we saw a fat 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.940

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.110
 seeming future for a kid who 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.030

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.739

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.930
 the mood is often that the guys are 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.400
 often drunk focused on my are on 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.290
 scene feels the pressure on my shot 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.820

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.910

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.630
 many pierce and face or stack 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.580
 to come out of the shadows or to do everything 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.410

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.770
 the storm in a thick fog 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.390
 novice fill waves then cast 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.290
