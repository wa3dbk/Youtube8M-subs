00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.119
 now underway learn 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.219
 active discussion on the topic after all 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.770
 closer to the truth 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.110
 mana centrism or centrism field ie 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.570
 man still appeared in africa and then 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.520
 spread around the world or on 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.740
 some earlier stage from africa 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.230
 there were some ancestors of man and then 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.280
 relatively independent of each other in 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.840
 different parts of the world formed to say 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:42.770
 different races of homo sapiens and in particular 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:47.020
 I just read a book on the subject 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.010
 archeology of various sites 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.540
 Paleolithic shows there that 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.890
 for example the famous Denis Cave 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.989
 there was an independent evolution 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.050
 archaeological cultures ranging from 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.680
 generally ashel and that is Pithecanthropus 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.200
 cultures 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.450
 yes actually through the middle Paleolithic 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.460
 through the museum and then straight there 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.530
 independent almost earlier than in 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.630
 other parts of europe and asia arise 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.610
 top political culture that is and 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.680
 further it says that it is 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.229
 autochthonous and independent evolution 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.390
 man was going on there as well as in 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.479
 other parts of the world for example the same 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.280
 proven for southeast asia here 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.909
 author 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.409
 famous archeologist russian derevo 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.840
 how do anthropologists look at me 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.670
 the impression is that more archaeologists 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.090
 reeling aside 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.479
 the field of centrism what anthropologists 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.219
 archaeologists 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.240
 especially our archaeologists somehow 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:53.609
 traditionally shied to centrism 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.959
 but now as far as i am 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.299
 I can judge by the publications 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.649
 archaeological many archaeologists on 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.659
 really go into such enough 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.030
 strict she centrism and proved 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.439
 for example, that transitional cultures are attributed 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.819
 to the Upper Paleolithic are in 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.440
 really mixed just 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.090
 transition ensembles where just 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.099
 purely mechanical u rural tool 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.959
 intertwined and intermingled with the top 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.590
 political and in between 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.690
 there is a gap of several thousand years, but 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.640
 besides, archeology is like 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.069
 my definition can't talk about 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.810
 origin to logical people because 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.410
 that people can prick the same 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.920
 guns can indicate different guns 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.379
 modern humanity is there and 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.680
 brilliant example because some people 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.959
 launch satellites to mars other people 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.599
 there still live upper Paleolithic in fact 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.489
 things where I will make stone tools 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.380
 there is someone who has grown to this earth 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.480
 deed someone hunter-gatherer that is 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.940
 there are countless options and 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.829
 nevertheless it is all a single view which 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.669
 biological it is firmly established 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.760
 as one 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:59.849
 so when we talk about complexity here 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.489
 the field can centrism in general all major 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.769
 are the data on anthropology that is 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.230
 only biological materials of the skull 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.329
 bones there somewhere skeletons and other data 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.790
 there on genetics 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.790
 ideally can finally 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.459
 some dotting this 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.560
 question we are currently all the same by 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.569
 all possible data and field 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.040
 anthropological and genetic 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.910
 genetics of modern man and 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.989
 fossil bone paleogenetics 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.180
 concept can centrism after all 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.769
 remains prevailing but with amendments 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.370
 that is, it is not a system Ki-moon 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.290
 centrism 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.970
 but still the ancient people of modern 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.040
 kind of inculcate some 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.139
 Other grandparents got farther with the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.979
 weight until the end more and more more this 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.500
 after all impurity 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.160
 That is not to say that they are there 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.570
 childhood cave 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.880
 local Denisovites emerged downright 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.650
 sapiens and radish genes have fallen to 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.170
 let sapiens know that unit 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.420
 people would appear otherwise we would have one of 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.310
 these genes were not there five percent 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.610
 melanesia cypher even less on the very 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.480
 business 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.380
 and about 56 percent was about 80 percent 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.960
 there in some group 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.280
 however , all of humanity is genetically 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.290
 she is very fairly homogeneous 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.300
 she is surprisingly in some places 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.350
 homogeneous than different chimpanzee groups in 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.350
 africa which seemed
