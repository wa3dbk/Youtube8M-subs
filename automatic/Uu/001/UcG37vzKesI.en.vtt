00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.840 
could then put the second one on ebay
and<00:03:37.110> probably<00:03:37.620> sell<00:03:37.740> it<00:03:37.770> for<00:03:37.890> like<00:03:38.070> 60<00:03:38.400> or<00:03:38.520> 70

and probably sell it for like 60 or 70
bucks<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.240> then<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.750> would<00:03:40.020> take<00:03:40.200> care<00:03:40.350> of

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
bucks and then that would take care of

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.960

so<00:03:43.290> it's<00:03:43.470> such<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.650> dilemma<00:03:43.980> ethically<00:03:44.910> because

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
so it's such a dilemma ethically because

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.850 
so it's such a dilemma ethically because
I<00:03:45.630> feel<00:03:45.840> like<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.230> principle<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.830> matter

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860

because I feel like they just totally

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.120 
because I feel like they just totally
disrespected<00:03:49.350> me<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.680> they're<00:03:49.800> not<00:03:49.920> having
