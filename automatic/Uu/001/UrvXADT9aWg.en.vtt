00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.279
 ah 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.650
 and the truth that is our first year and 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.080
 it's the right time because we have 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.030
 forty and many years already in this 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.240
 industry focused as well says is the 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.150
 world of portable desktop PC but 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.180
 good in trends are changing the 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.820
 tablet today is a very device 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.189
 defendant and we have a platform 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.380
 for tablets platforms for tablets 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.519
 under windows 8 what we are 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.769
 presenting here in the new 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.739
 platforms that we are going to launch as they are 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:38.230
 topics specialized in tablets in 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.130
 portable and vivid after the laps 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.100
 of the spleen 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.530
 this year we have some some equipment 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.540
 that are of audience that represent this 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.100
 you know have the tablet with about 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.800
 performance that until now were 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.860
 possible only in high teams of 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.650
 range that were portable desktops 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.860
 you have that power but you can also 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.170
 have that power in portability 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.850
 with high battery autonomy with a 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.470
 little warming that is also a 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.450
 nice experience for people not 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.790
 what gets hot and then you can 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.550
 have the functionality a total team 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.540
 that you can run your application 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.510
 productivity 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.470
 it can be excel power point in world 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.590
 etcetera more devices that are then 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.650
 like for example the turbo 2 what 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.200
 we have here that you can hook 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.090
 keyboard or not the keyboard spend on your 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.070
 additional graphics card with your disk 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.979
 titling to independently in the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.920
 tablet has those minimum performance 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.920
 to give 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.159
 and our war is less and less 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.770
 consumptions while maintaining the large 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.400
 power performance that we give and there 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.740
 we go 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.260
 because you mentioned is a reality and 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.150
 we here, we, our 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.370
 developer engineers are on top 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.410
 and soon you will see very solutions 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.320
 Interesting 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.960
 the novelty is the tablet now and yes that 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.180
 you are seeing a reduction to the best 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.630
 in the 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.220
 the impulse to buy because it's clear 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.320
 whoever is buying comes a 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.460
 Most of the user's tablet already has 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.680
 your pc 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.250
 and we are also in a situation 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.900
 talking about Spain 'difficult economic and 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.000
 if in some moments with another 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.850
 situation because I had a budget for the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.780
 tablet and improve your current team with 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.980
 the days 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.710
 today we are going to better you go to 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.470
 Novel device he wants is to have 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.230
 that experience and you put up with the 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.570
 full portable device or the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.450
 full table that as you see in 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.180
 a flat tabletop growth is 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.460
 it keeps pretty over the years 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.010
 and what we want is for the 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.270
 tablet will grow a lot of equipment 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.520
 hybrids like the one we're showing 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.490
 here in the mobile world congress is going to 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.090
 be what is going to really come off but 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.000
 on laptops you are going to keep 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.320
 one level with other types of designs something 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.420
 that we used to call the biggest team 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.770
 thought that at such a price point to 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.010
 the best that will change the scenario 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.290
 it's going to change a bit but still 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.819
 there is not the perfect solution with a 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.590
 tablet people who have a tablet 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.510
 this we could discuss a long time 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.689
 final if it is very useful for certain things 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.110
 but you're always going to use your pc 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:29.660
 when users are let's say 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.000
 mature already in the use of the tablet of the 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.670
 current tablet will be giving the following 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.650
 steps to renew the pc because it's going to 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.210
 require more or buy a terminal 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.390
 hybrid 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.820
 as we will see then tablet that turned out 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.130
 racing because in the end it's a name of 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.350
 The industry standard are ultra equipments 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.220
 We have not invented any names 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.070
 in the sector what we have wanted 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.620
 focus these portable computers with 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.989
 fine design 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.969
 high enough performance and 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.769
 autonomies reversing with some points 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.299
 of interesting price the point of 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.579
 price above one thousand euros 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.409
 really believe that we get the 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.760
 technology in relation to what you 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.859
 you mean until the final product 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.829
 it reaches the street because you have been there for a while 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.600
 but now manufacturers like asus 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.720
 manufacturers as acer manufacturers as 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.560
 hp manufacturers as they have other fines 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.760
 the fines 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.639
 and to say names but the order of 599 to 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.980
 his golden 38 hp has two sleep 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.230
 they are touching reality the 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.880
 reality now in the consumer market 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.710
 are reaching the linear of the 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.050
 retailers 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.730
 that is, his time has come as everything 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.450
 but there is what we had to say 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.400
 in the end it has arrived we do not believe in a 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.760
 thousand euro traffic 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.910
 if we create an amount of 600 euros and 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.250
 500 if it can be cheaper is everything 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.590
 nice and cheap for better but yes without 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.050
 forget about all the features 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.820
 and the quality that there is average leading to 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.330
 our two years we are super 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.900
 proud of a customer 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:13.890
 as they are and use our technology in 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.540
 your final device is a very product 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.060
 new with a lot 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.540
 to talk about and we can not forget 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.040
 that not only the ps4 but in 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.200
 three of the four consoles more 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.420
 important today we have our 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.930
 graphics in weight four we have an app 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.350
 the cpu with the gpu but our graphics 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.150
 radeon are in the wind and the wii u 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.729
 they are also on the xbox 360 of 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.599
 microsoft 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.599
 very happy
