00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.639 

followed<00:02:05.140> by<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.829> couple<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.909> tablespoons<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:08.619> a

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
followed by a couple of tablespoons of a

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.860 
followed by a couple of tablespoons of a
dark<00:02:09.610> soy<00:02:09.819> sauce<00:02:09.849> as<00:02:10.390> well<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:12.700> put<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.540> in

dark soy sauce as well just put that in

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.330 
dark soy sauce as well just put that in
now<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.110> could<00:02:14.349> also<00:02:14.530> use<00:02:14.680> light<00:02:15.069> soy<00:02:15.280> sauce

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.220 
now you could also use light soy sauce
but<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.790> prefer<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.300> dark<00:02:16.629> soy<00:02:16.810> sauce<00:02:16.870> because

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
but I prefer the dark soy sauce because

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.330 
but I prefer the dark soy sauce because
it<00:02:17.319> has<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.470> bit<00:02:17.680> more<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.980> caramelized

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
it has a bit more of a caramelized

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.100 
it has a bit more of a caramelized
flavor<00:02:18.700> there<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.569> little<00:02:19.750> bit<00:02:19.870> thicker

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
flavor there it's a little bit thicker

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.110 
flavor there it's a little bit thicker
and<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.799> just<00:02:21.010> gives<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.280> more<00:02:21.489> body<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:21.970> more

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
and it just gives it more body and more

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.150 
and it just gives it more body and more
more<00:02:22.420> more<00:02:22.750> punch<00:02:23.049> to<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.830> flavor<00:02:24.069> of

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
more more punch to that to the flavor of

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.369 
more more punch to that to the flavor of
the<00:02:24.280> source<00:02:24.519> so<00:02:25.269> couple<00:02:25.599> tablespoons<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.200> soy
