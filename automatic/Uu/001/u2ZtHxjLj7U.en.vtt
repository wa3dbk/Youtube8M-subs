00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
first of all the committee does not

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.869 
first of all the committee does not
protect<00:02:50.930> teams<00:02:51.290> beyond<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.220> top<00:02:52.400> four<00:02:52.700> line

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
protect teams beyond the top four line

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.580 
protect teams beyond the top four line
so<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.450> fact<00:02:53.629> that<00:02:53.689> Davidson's<00:02:54.230> playing<00:02:54.409> in

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
so the fact that Davidson's playing in

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.649 
so the fact that Davidson's playing in
the<00:02:54.709> state<00:02:54.919> in<00:02:54.980> Raleigh<00:02:55.459> was<00:02:56.090> not<00:02:56.329> done<00:02:56.540> on

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
the state in Raleigh was not done on

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.000 
the state in Raleigh was not done on
purpose<00:02:56.810> just<00:02:56.989> happen<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.560> be<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.709> way<00:02:57.980> it

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
purpose just happen to be the way it

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.679 
purpose just happen to be the way it
fell<00:02:58.609> that's<00:02:58.879> according<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.389> committee

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
fell that's according to the committee

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:03.009 
fell that's according to the committee
now<00:03:00.139> Gonzaga<00:03:00.739> if<00:03:01.639> Jeff<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.419> think<00:03:02.659> the<00:03:02.720> keeper

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
now Gonzaga if Jeff I think the keeper

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.500 
now Gonzaga if Jeff I think the keeper
Gonzaga<00:03:03.409> is<00:03:03.500> is<00:03:03.709> if<00:03:04.189> Josh<00:03:04.669> hike<00:03:05.000> Bell<00:03:05.269> and

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
Gonzaga is is if Josh hike Bell and

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.509 
Gonzaga is is if Josh hike Bell and
Micah<00:03:05.810> downs<00:03:06.109> can<00:03:06.530> score<00:03:06.919> that<00:03:07.220> they<00:03:07.340> are

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
Micah downs can score that they are

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.819 
Micah downs can score that they are
scores<00:03:08.030> then<00:03:08.659> they<00:03:08.780> become<00:03:09.019> natural<00:03:09.470> problems

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
scores then they become natural problems

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.170 
scores then they become natural problems
for<00:03:09.980> Davidson<00:03:10.489> but<00:03:10.790> they've<00:03:10.939> been<00:03:11.060> in

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
for Davidson but they've been in

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.569 
for Davidson but they've been in
terribly<00:03:11.569> consistently<00:03:12.560> season<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.519> I

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
terribly consistently season and that I

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.339 
terribly consistently season and that I
think<00:03:13.730> it's<00:03:14.030> been<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.209> problem<00:03:14.569> for<00:03:14.780> Gonzaga

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
think it's been a problem for Gonzaga

Bouldin<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:25.340> beat<00:03:25.609> Davidson<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.599> problem<00:03:27.169> is

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
Bouldin to beat Davidson the problem is

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.710 
Bouldin to beat Davidson the problem is
can<00:03:28.159> they<00:03:28.280> all<00:03:28.459> play<00:03:28.729> well<00:03:28.909> at<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.209> same<00:03:29.389> time

can they all play well at the same time
I<00:03:30.019> think<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.680> could<00:03:30.799> argue<00:03:30.949> that<00:03:31.190> this<00:03:31.760> is<00:03:31.940> the

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
I think you could argue that this is the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.300 
I think you could argue that this is the
most<00:03:32.209> balanced<00:03:32.840> offensive<00:03:33.560> team<00:03:33.829> that<00:03:34.069> mark

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
most balanced offensive team that mark

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.819 
most balanced offensive team that mark
few<00:03:34.519> has<00:03:34.579> had<00:03:34.909> in<00:03:35.090> years<00:03:35.389> maybe<00:03:35.959> more<00:03:36.079> so<00:03:36.530> than

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
few has had in years maybe more so than

the<00:03:36.889> adam<00:03:37.190> morrison<00:03:37.370> years<00:03:37.849> but<00:03:38.389> they<00:03:38.510> have

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
the adam morrison years but they have

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.270 
the adam morrison years but they have
not<00:03:38.750> been<00:03:38.930> able<00:03:39.019> to<00:03:39.260> be<00:03:39.349> as<00:03:39.530> consistent<00:03:39.949> as<00:03:40.220> a

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
not been able to be as consistent as a
