in<00:01:23.880> description<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.450> guys<00:01:24.600> missed<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.049> I

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
in description if you guys missed it I

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.200 
in description if you guys missed it I
think<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> moat<00:01:26.310> majority<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.880> saw<00:01:27.090> it

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
think the moat majority of you saw it

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.499 
think the moat majority of you saw it
has<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.600> 450<00:01:28.380> likes<00:01:28.560> or<00:01:28.710> something<00:01:29.009> so

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
has like 450 likes or something so

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.910 
has like 450 likes or something so
that's<00:01:30.509> pretty<00:01:30.810> nice<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.590> could<00:01:31.619> try<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that's pretty nice if we could try to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.800 
that's pretty nice if we could try to
duplicate<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.460> type<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.880> support<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.750> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
duplicate that type of support on this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.200 
duplicate that type of support on this
video<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.229> would<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.380> much<00:01:34.590> appreciated<00:01:35.210> but

a<00:01:40.530> tale<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.829> magma<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.090> pretty<00:01:42.540> big

it's I think it's too big for 66 in my

I<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.920> definitely<00:01:53.009> play<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:54.000> okay<00:01:54.479> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
I can definitely play it I it's okay you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.660 
I can definitely play it I it's okay you
know<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:55.049> don't<00:01:55.439> mind<00:01:55.829> playing<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.520> but

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
know I don't mind playing it but

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.609 
know I don't mind playing it but
obviously<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.149> prefer<00:01:57.570> certain<00:01:57.840> maps<00:01:58.110> over<00:01:58.469> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
obviously I prefer certain maps over it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.010 
obviously I prefer certain maps over it
and<00:01:59.240> that's<00:02:00.240> pretty<00:02:00.390> much<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.810> say<00:02:00.840> about

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
and that's pretty much I can say about

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.950 
and that's pretty much I can say about
all<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.530> DLC<00:02:02.149> even<00:02:03.149> studio<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.540> mean<00:02:03.750> it's

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
all of this DLC even studio I mean it's

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.800 
all of this DLC even studio I mean it's
it's<00:02:04.860> fine<00:02:05.100> range<00:02:05.399> but<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:06.360> not<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.750> know

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
it's fine range but it's not you know

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.290 
it's fine range but it's not you know
the<00:02:07.020> original<00:02:07.140> firing<00:02:07.829> range<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.970> part<00:02:09.209> of

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the original firing range but part of

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.240 
the original firing range but part of
that<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.479> think<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> dlc<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
that I think is with the dlc is just the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.430 
that I think is with the dlc is just the
players<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.940> play<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.569> it's<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.319> whole

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
players that you play is it's a whole

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.850 
players that you play is it's a whole
lot

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
lot

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.400 
lot
a<00:02:13.890> lot<00:02:14.250> better<00:02:14.460> like<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:15.000> would<00:02:15.660> say<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.870> DLC

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
a lot better like I would say like DLC

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.380 
a lot better like I would say like DLC

why<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.720> think<00:02:54.930> that's<00:02:55.080> what<00:02:55.410> people<00:02:55.440> overlook

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
why I think that's what people overlook

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.590 
why I think that's what people overlook
a<00:02:56.160> lot<00:02:56.190> when<00:02:56.550> they<00:02:56.640> talk<00:02:56.850> about<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.150> map<00:02:57.300> X

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
a lot when they talk about the map X

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.420 
a lot when they talk about the map X
they<00:02:58.380> forget<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.010> people<00:02:59.190> they're

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
they forget that the people they're

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.940 
they forget that the people they're
playing<00:02:59.760> are<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> lot<00:03:00.209> better<00:03:00.450> than<00:03:01.410> what

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
playing are a lot better than what

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.949

they're<00:03:02.160> used<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.489> playing<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.630> kind<00:03:03.900> of

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
they're used to playing so it kind of

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.810 
they're used to playing so it kind of
takes<00:03:04.500> away<00:03:04.680> from<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.040> maps<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.430> little<00:03:05.670> bit

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
takes away from the maps a little bit

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.860 
takes away from the maps a little bit
and<00:03:06.150> also<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:07.830> note<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:08.820> do<00:03:09.209> kind<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.750> has

and also on that note we do kind of has

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.100 
and also on that note we do kind of has
a<00:03:10.200> studio<00:03:10.620> trap<00:03:10.980> going<00:03:11.340> down<00:03:11.550> a<00:03:11.580> little<00:03:11.820> bit<00:03:12.110> if

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
a studio trap going down a little bit if

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.020 
a studio trap going down a little bit if
you<00:03:13.230> guys<00:03:13.350> would<00:03:13.530> like<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.709> see<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.310> hit<00:03:14.610> 92

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030

kills<00:03:15.480> someone<00:03:16.320> else<00:03:16.500> on<00:03:16.590> Team<00:03:16.770> hit<00:03:17.090> 120<00:03:18.090> and

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
kills someone else on Team hit 120 and

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.690 
kills someone else on Team hit 120 and
then<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.170> think<00:03:19.500> another<00:03:19.620> person<00:03:19.980> hit<00:03:20.160> like<00:03:20.310> 88

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
then I think another person hit like 88

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.120 
then I think another person hit like 88
or<00:03:21.000> something<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:21.540> almost<00:03:22.410> had<00:03:22.530> three<00:03:22.860> people

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
map is the be flag it's like in like a

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.330 
map is the be flag it's like in like a
little<00:04:35.010> bit<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.780> I<00:04:36.780> don't<00:04:36.990> know<00:04:37.080> it's<00:04:37.440> it's

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
little bit and I don't know it's it's

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.710 
little bit and I don't know it's it's
pretty<00:04:38.610> much<00:04:38.670> a<00:04:38.730> death<00:04:38.970> trap<00:04:39.180> but<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:39.570> gotta

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
pretty much a death trap but you gotta

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.570 
pretty much a death trap but you gotta
you<00:04:40.170> cannot<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:40.650> look<00:04:40.800> at<00:04:40.950> be<00:04:41.130> on<00:04:41.250> this<00:04:41.370> map

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
you cannot so look at be on this map

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.170 
you cannot so look at be on this map
it's<00:04:42.330> it's<00:04:42.960> in<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.170> really<00:04:43.260> bad<00:04:43.500> spot<00:04:43.740> so<00:04:44.280> that's

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
it's it's in a really bad spot so that's

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.610 
it's it's in a really bad spot so that's
premature<00:04:45.450> like<00:04:45.690> I<00:04:45.750> say<00:04:45.930> pick<00:04:46.110> up<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.290> brutal

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
premature like I say pick up the brutal

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
premature like I say pick up the brutal
right<00:04:46.710> there<00:04:46.890> i'm<00:04:46.950> not<00:04:47.070> actually<00:04:47.220> gonna<00:04:47.430> show

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
right there i'm not actually gonna show

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.610 
right there i'm not actually gonna show
the<00:04:47.790> entire<00:04:47.970> 39<00:04:48.540> gunstreak<00:04:49.020> in<00:04:49.230> this<00:04:49.350> video

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
the entire 39 gunstreak in this video

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.050 
the entire 39 gunstreak in this video
because<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.860> was<00:04:49.950> pretty<00:04:50.070> slow<00:04:50.430> paced<00:04:50.700> after<00:04:51.030> i

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
because it was pretty slow paced after i

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.970 
because it was pretty slow paced after i
got<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.270> nuclear<00:04:51.660> as<00:04:51.870> you<00:04:52.590> can<00:04:52.710> see<00:04:52.830> it's

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
got the nuclear as you can see it's

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.980 
got the nuclear as you can see it's
already<00:04:53.070> second<00:04:53.520> round<00:04:53.730> and<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.510> pick<00:04:54.690> up<00:04:54.810> the

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
already second round and I pick up the

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.810 
already second round and I pick up the
nuclear<00:04:55.500> in<00:04:55.560> another<00:04:55.770> like<00:04:55.950> 30<00:04:56.190> seconds<00:04:56.670> so

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
nuclear in another like 30 seconds so

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.130 
nuclear in another like 30 seconds so
for<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.030> last<00:04:57.060> four<00:04:57.420> minutes<00:04:57.570> only<00:04:57.780> got<00:04:58.020> like

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
for the last four minutes only got like

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.710 
for the last four minutes only got like
10<00:04:58.380> kills<00:04:58.650> so<00:04:58.890> that's<00:04:59.670> pretty<00:04:59.910> slow<00:05:00.240> paced<00:05:00.540> I

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
10 kills so that's pretty slow paced I

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.380
