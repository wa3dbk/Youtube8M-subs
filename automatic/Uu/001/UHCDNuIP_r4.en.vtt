they all show the light hovering above

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.690 
they all show the light hovering above
the<00:01:08.880> Dome<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.810> rock<00:01:09.930> after<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:11.040> few<00:01:11.310> seconds

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the Dome of the rock after a few seconds

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.820 
the Dome of the rock after a few seconds
there<00:01:12.000> appears<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.630> some<00:01:12.960> sort<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.290> energy

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
there appears to be some sort of energy

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.990 
there appears to be some sort of energy
burst<00:01:14.070> oh<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.840> light<00:01:16.140> zooms<00:01:16.500> away

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
burst oh and then the light zooms away

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.240 
burst oh and then the light zooms away
so<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.659> proof<00:01:18.990> positive<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.619> aliens

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
so is this proof positive that aliens

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.550 
so is this proof positive that aliens
exist<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.450> nothing<00:01:21.840> more<00:01:22.080> than<00:01:22.320> an

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
exist or is it nothing more than an
