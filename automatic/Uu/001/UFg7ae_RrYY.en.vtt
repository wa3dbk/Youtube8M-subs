00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
self-explanatory connected is you can

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.719 
self-explanatory connected is you can
connect<00:01:22.180> locally<00:01:23.050> I<00:01:23.340> think<00:01:24.340> that's<00:01:24.490> why

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
connect locally I think that's why

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.639 
connect locally I think that's why
Bluetooth<00:01:25.240> I'm<00:01:25.450> guessing<00:01:25.750> or<00:01:25.899> Wi-Fi<00:01:26.350> when<00:01:26.560> I

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
Bluetooth I'm guessing or Wi-Fi when I

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.710 
Bluetooth I'm guessing or Wi-Fi when I
will<00:01:26.770> close<00:01:26.979> it<00:01:27.009> and<00:01:27.880> then<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.090> can<00:01:28.360> complete

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
will close it and then you can complete

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.190 
will close it and then you can complete

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
this camera angle that I'm using anyway

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.380 
this camera angle that I'm using anyway
if<00:03:46.319> there<00:03:46.500> was<00:03:46.590> more<00:03:46.739> yeah<00:03:47.489> so<00:03:47.879> I'll<00:03:48.180> show<00:03:48.359> you

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
all right so that's the game and I

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.250 
all right so that's the game and I
haven't<00:05:05.729> really<00:05:05.940> looked<00:05:06.150> too<00:05:06.840> much<00:05:07.050> through

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
haven't really looked too much through

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.650 
haven't really looked too much through
it<00:05:07.470> but<00:05:07.800> um<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.400> know<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.669> there's<00:05:09.060> basically

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
it but um I know that there's basically

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.280 
it but um I know that there's basically
three<00:05:11.419> single-player<00:05:12.419> game<00:05:12.690> mode<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.199> then

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
three single-player game mode and then

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.830 
three single-player game mode and then
you<00:05:13.410> got<00:05:13.590> connected<00:05:13.919> which<00:05:14.550> is<00:05:14.840> obviously

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
you got connected which is obviously

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.350 
you got connected which is obviously
like<00:05:16.080> playing<00:05:16.380> against<00:05:16.650> people<00:05:17.150> across<00:05:18.150> the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
world or locally or whatever and I don't

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.960 
world or locally or whatever and I don't
really<00:05:22.320> look<00:05:22.530> much<00:05:22.830> through<00:05:23.130> it<00:05:23.190> yet<00:05:23.370> but<00:05:23.699> from

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
really look much through it yet but from

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.700 
really look much through it yet but from
well<00:05:24.150> played<00:05:24.389> in<00:05:24.540> the<00:05:24.630> career<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:25.260> quick<00:05:25.470> race

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
well played in the career and quick race

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.760 
well played in the career and quick race
and<00:05:25.949> time<00:05:26.100> draw<00:05:26.479> it's<00:05:27.479> definitely<00:05:28.440> one<00:05:28.620> of<00:05:28.650> the

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
and time draw it's definitely one of the

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.640 
and time draw it's definitely one of the
best<00:05:28.889> games<00:05:29.270> on<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.510> iPod<00:05:30.900> touch<00:05:31.169> I<00:05:31.440> would

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
best games on the iPod touch I would

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.409
