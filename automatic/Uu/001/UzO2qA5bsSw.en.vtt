00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.510
 This time I received a request . 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.749
 I will explain how to make animation 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:18.540
 First create a new composition 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:22.300
 I created a 720 p composition with 01 kh 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.750
 Well, I will place the text here 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.530
 Ray 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.530
 heart 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.890
 First of all 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.890
 Prepare the first line of text 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.470
 Well first of all to 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.829
 effect 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.489
 Apply the cormorant et al over box 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.489
 And 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.450
 I bra is of the item 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.410
 Select bra radius 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.010
 Add an animation expression 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.010
 And 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.660
 Random 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.470
 Set 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.750
 I went in to we will put a numerical value in this dressed 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.600
 With comma 10 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.200
 Now the blur will continue to move randomly from to 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.200
 It looks like this 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:29.390
 And then move the position randomly Press p and it 's a city ​​item 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.829
 Add animation expression 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.060
 This position is set to move randomly in the vertical direction using an English expression in 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.020
 I will go 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:44.689
 Because it has the syntax, I will copy and use it 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:48.080
 It is so-called middle, but it is only this part if it is usual eagle syntax 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.380
 I move randomly to both lakes I got in 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.920
 This syntax is 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.310
 x in the horizontal direction y 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.800
 You can set the vertical direction respectively 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.850
 And this time I want to move only in the vertical direction 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.850
 Makes the x horizontal value of a child zero 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.660
 And set the fixed number 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.420
 For example 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.860
 55 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.710
 When 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.660
 Movement reflection 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.790
 As a brother 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.790
 Copy this at 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.040
 Paste 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.580
 If you feel like a, it will be like a high-speed building sale with such a feeling 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.580
 If you expression off 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:48.739
 If you turn on the one that has only this kind of blur. 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.940
 The sound is going to be the pitch swing of this gold 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.210
 And then press t 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.010
 I will set the opacity Well roughly 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:03.950
 Hit the key frame in this area 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.950
 It's 100% opacity after one shot 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.720
 80 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:13.060
 If you go back to 100 after another 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.150
 It feels like that and 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.150
 You will get the effect of blinking this serious standard 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.730
 Select the keyframe of the hand and copy with control c 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.940
 Paste with control v 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:34.000
 Furthermore, and this time rurubu ion Nikki at site 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.000
 You will occasionally hand-eye vine such expressions ThatLookLikeThis 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.120
 Next is the effect 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.260
 Of transition 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.350
 Apply the blinds and the direction is 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.350
 90 degree 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.120
 Make the teeth smaller by slightly increasing the conversion value with 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.050
 Four 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.050
 so 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.109
 This is also a rough position day 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.519
 I hit one keyframe 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.930
 End of conversion 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:27.230
 After advancing one frame in the state of zero 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:31.260
 It's about 25% 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.740
 It will be in a state of stripes and further 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.090
 Also complete the one frame 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.630
 0 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.630
 If you 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.130
 This feeling for a moment 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.130
 It will be an expression like a border 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:55.320
 So too 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:59.120
 Select and copy with control c and key with control v to another position 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.120
 I will paste the frame 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.669
 If it looks like this 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.740
 It becomes expression of this feeling 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.590
 It may be good to have a place that can be covered with a little brown 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.470
 I leave this girl 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:51.030
 Now that you 've set up a basic move 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:57.740
 Move the text to the 15 Kumano start position 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.740
 Then duplicate with control d and change letters 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.490
 a 8 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.199
 I like this and start position 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:36.289
 I will shift behind 15 frames 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.540
 Copy one more control d 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:42.680
 Lower it 15 frames behind 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.680
 I will exchange 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.950
 Something like this 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.950
 With that 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.400
 Yes this is complete This is all this time and see you again
