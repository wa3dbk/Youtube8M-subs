it's going to be a lot easier the boil
lot<00:02:37.680> quicker<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.670> also<00:02:39.390> then<00:02:39.630> when<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.840> mix

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
lot quicker and also then when you mix

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.420 
lot quicker and also then when you mix
them<00:02:40.260> it's<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.590> lot<00:02:40.709> easier<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:41.040> suppose<00:02:41.340> you

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
them it's a lot easier I suppose you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.470 
them it's a lot easier I suppose you
could<00:02:41.549> boil<00:02:41.700> them<00:02:41.850> hold<00:02:42.060> that's<00:02:42.269> what<00:02:42.420> I

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.150 
put all that stuff out all nice you guys
when<00:04:10.020> I<00:04:10.050> put<00:04:10.260> away<00:04:10.380> then<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.710> got<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:10.920> get<00:04:10.980> it<00:04:11.100> out

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
when I put away then I got to get it out

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.040 
when I put away then I got to get it out
again<00:04:11.430> but<00:04:11.550> anyway<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.450> then<00:04:12.810> we're<00:04:12.900> going<00:04:12.990> to

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
again but anyway and then we're going to

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.320 
again but anyway and then we're going to
splash<00:04:13.470> your<00:04:13.710> milk<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.580> this<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.090> where<00:04:15.240> it

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
splash your milk and this is where it

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.910 
splash your milk and this is where it
gets<00:04:15.360> tricky<00:04:15.540> because<00:04:15.960> there<00:04:16.350> really<00:04:16.470> isn't

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
gets tricky because there really isn't

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.039 
gets tricky because there really isn't
any<00:04:17.510> set<00:04:19.489> amount<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:21.270> you<00:04:21.359> kind<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.630> have<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.810> do

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
any set amount so you kind of have to do

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.710 
any set amount so you kind of have to do
it<00:04:22.230> by<00:04:23.130> feel<00:04:23.370> so<00:04:24.210> then<00:04:24.360> we're<00:04:24.450> going<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.660> take

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
it by feel so then we're going to take

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.900 
it by feel so then we're going to take
our<00:04:24.780> little<00:04:25.140> handy<00:04:25.500> mirror<00:04:25.770> here<00:04:26.400> or<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.640> turn

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
our little handy mirror here or a turn

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:36.580 
our little handy mirror here or a turn
on

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.110 

but<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.190> trick<00:04:37.400> is<00:04:37.430> you<00:04:37.700> don't<00:04:37.820> want<00:04:37.940> to<00:04:38.030> add

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
but the trick is you don't want to add

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.640 
but the trick is you don't want to add
too<00:04:38.360> much<00:04:38.510> milk<00:04:38.720> or<00:04:38.930> too<00:04:39.020> much<00:04:39.110> butter<00:04:39.380> because

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
too much milk or too much butter because

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.020 
too much milk or too much butter because
then<00:04:39.920> it's<00:04:40.070> going<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.250> get<00:04:40.340> watery<00:04:40.670> nobody

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
then it's going to get watery nobody

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.980 
then it's going to get watery nobody
wants<00:04:41.210> water<00:04:41.330> your<00:04:41.540> mashed<00:04:41.690> potatoes

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
wants water your mashed potatoes

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.030 
wants water your mashed potatoes
especially<00:04:42.410> if<00:04:42.470> you're<00:04:42.560> going<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:42.740> put<00:04:42.860> gravy

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
especially if you're going to put gravy

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.120 
especially if you're going to put gravy
on<00:04:43.160> them<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:43.580> let's<00:04:44.620> keep<00:04:45.620> going<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:45.950> then

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
on them so let's keep going and then

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.820
