affect button one and I'm going to

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.580 
affect button one and I'm going to
switch<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.550> controller<00:03:39.000> type<00:03:39.270> from<00:03:40.080> hold<00:03:40.410> to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
switch the controller type from hold to

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.860 
switch the controller type from hold to
toggle<00:03:41.100> mode<00:03:41.310> meaning<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.240> I<00:03:42.450> don't<00:03:42.630> need<00:03:42.750> to

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
toggle mode meaning that I don't need to

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.690 
toggle mode meaning that I don't need to
hold<00:03:43.080> down<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.530> letter<00:03:43.709> Z<00:03:43.980> for<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.400> effects

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
hold down the letter Z for the effects

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.280 
hold down the letter Z for the effects
to<00:03:44.790> stay<00:03:45.060> on<00:03:45.209> when<00:03:45.450> i<00:03:45.480> switch<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.750> toggle<00:03:46.110> mode

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
to stay on when i switch to toggle mode

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.440 
to stay on when i switch to toggle mode
I<00:03:46.410> can<00:03:46.530> hit<00:03:46.740> apply<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.280> ok<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.000> then<00:03:48.300> now<00:03:48.420> I

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
I can hit apply and ok and then now I

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.390 
I can hit apply and ok and then now I
need<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.780> just<00:03:48.990> tap<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.170> once<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.830> it<00:03:49.950> stays<00:03:50.220> on

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
need to just tap it once and it stays on

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.160 
need to just tap it once and it stays on
so<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.760> doesn't<00:03:51.000> do<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:51.510> that's<00:03:51.900> really

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
so it doesn't do that and that's really

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.540 
so it doesn't do that and that's really
useful<00:03:52.290> for<00:03:52.650> different<00:03:52.890> functions<00:03:53.040> because

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
useful for different functions because

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.190 
useful for different functions because
maybe<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.850> have<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:54.000> midi<00:03:54.180> controller<00:03:54.240> and<00:03:54.810> you

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
maybe you have a midi controller and you

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.510 
maybe you have a midi controller and you
want<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.470> actually<00:03:55.590> hold<00:03:56.040> down<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.490> button

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
want to actually hold down the button

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.040 
want to actually hold down the button
while<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.150> loop<00:03:57.330> is<00:03:57.450> playing<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:57.870> then<00:03:57.959> when

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
while the loop is playing and then when

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.210 
while the loop is playing and then when
you<00:03:58.140> let<00:03:58.290> go<00:03:58.320> of<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.650> button<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.070> loop

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
you let go of the button and the loop

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.530 
you let go of the button and the loop
will<00:03:59.370> continue<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.760> play<00:03:59.970> in<00:04:00.240> its<00:04:00.420> original

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
will continue to play in its original

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.130 
will continue to play in its original

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
position other things that we can do is

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.730 
position other things that we can do is
maybe<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.410> sign<00:04:04.740> to<00:04:05.670> for<00:04:06.660> instance<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.410> knobs

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
maybe a sign to for instance the knobs

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.190 
maybe a sign to for instance the knobs
on<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.040> midi<00:04:08.190> controller<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:09.900> do<00:04:10.020> that<00:04:10.140> I

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
on the midi controller and to do that I

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.750 
on the midi controller and to do that I
go<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.530> MIDI<00:04:10.709> setup<00:04:10.890> section<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.550> I

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
go to the MIDI setup section and I

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.270 
go to the MIDI setup section and I
already<00:04:11.910> have<00:04:12.060> this<00:04:12.209> set<00:04:12.600> up<00:04:12.630> previously<00:04:13.380> but

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
already have this set up previously but

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.370 
already have this set up previously but
I<00:04:14.310> can<00:04:14.550> go<00:04:14.670> ahead<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:14.970> go<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.270> you<00:04:15.840> know<00:04:15.930> affect

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
now for each individual function i have

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.350 
now for each individual function i have
many<00:04:32.280> different<00:04:32.610> attributes<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.090> i<00:04:33.180> can

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
many different attributes that i can

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.240 
many different attributes that i can
assign<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:33.870> for<00:04:34.140> instance<00:04:34.500> that<00:04:34.860> affect

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
assign to it for instance that affect

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.650 
assign to it for instance that affect
knob<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.700> let's<00:04:36.000> say<00:04:36.180> i<00:04:36.210> want<00:04:36.450> that

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
knob to let's say i want that

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.060 
knob to let's say i want that
controller<00:04:36.930> attribute<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.470> be<00:04:37.560> focused<00:04:37.980> on

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
controller attribute to be focused on

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.370 
controller attribute to be focused on
either<00:04:38.220> deck<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.730> B<00:04:39.120> C<00:04:39.420> or<00:04:39.450> D<00:04:39.630> for<00:04:40.080> instance

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
either deck a B C or D for instance

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.080 
either deck a B C or D for instance
right<00:04:40.530> now<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.710> want<00:04:41.040> it<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.130> be<00:04:41.220> only<00:04:41.490> on<00:04:41.670> deck<00:04:41.910> a

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
right now I want it to be only on deck a

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.710 
right now I want it to be only on deck a
and<00:04:43.100> you<00:04:44.100> can<00:04:44.250> actually<00:04:44.520> assign<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.510> type<00:04:45.690> of

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
and you can actually assign the type of

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.870 
and you can actually assign the type of
midi<00:04:45.990> control<00:04:46.380> you<00:04:46.500> have<00:04:46.560> analog<00:04:47.190> fader<00:04:47.550> knob

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
midi control you have analog fader knob

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.900 
midi control you have analog fader knob
and<00:04:48.210> even<00:04:48.510> rotary<00:04:48.870> controls<00:04:49.590> as<00:04:49.740> well<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:50.220> you

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
and even rotary controls as well and you

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.000 
and even rotary controls as well and you
can<00:04:50.940> invert<00:04:51.450> it<00:04:51.510> as<00:04:51.750> well<00:04:52.020> so<00:04:52.290> let's<00:04:52.770> say<00:04:52.920> if

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
can invert it as well so let's say if

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.350 
can invert it as well so let's say if
you're<00:04:53.130> turning<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.490> knob<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:53.820> left<00:04:54.090> but<00:04:54.240> on

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
you're turning the knob to left but on

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.760 
you're turning the knob to left but on
the<00:04:54.450> right<00:04:54.660> it<00:04:54.840> seems<00:04:54.990> like<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.350> knobs<00:04:55.500> going

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
the right it seems like the knobs going

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.410 
the right it seems like the knobs going
to<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.980> right<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:56.640> can<00:04:56.790> go<00:04:56.910> ahead<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.060> invert

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
to the right you can go ahead and invert

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.210 
to the right you can go ahead and invert
that<00:04:57.450> so<00:04:57.720> they<00:04:57.840> move<00:04:58.050> together<00:04:58.560> most<00:04:58.980> more

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
that so they move together most more

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.160 
that so they move together most more
seamlessly<00:04:59.700> so<00:05:00.660> now<00:05:00.810> that<00:05:00.960> i<00:05:00.990> have<00:05:01.110> that
