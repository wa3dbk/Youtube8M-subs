00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.360
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:15.910
 We will deliver data analysis of the 59th Shinzan Memorial Day 2015 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.310
 Aim for a big stage to step here 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:30.160
 The 49th Daily Sports Award Shinzan Memorial 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:36.070
 2012 winner Ma Gen Til Donna later wins a marathon three crowns 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.470
 Last year's winner Mickey Isle as a rating as won the nhk miles cup 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.460
 Is g 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:50.690
 There is an impression that its value has been rising year by year in the 3rd- naked 3-year-old Heavy Award Front 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.900
 The Wakama that can be expected to be active this spring g 1 front line and later will appear 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.050
 right 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:00.230
 A battle to watch out for the future 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.230
 At first we want to check tendency of the past ten years 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:15.990
 The top popular horses are dominant but in the past 10 years at the Shinzan Memorial 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:22.210
 Win No. 1 popular horse winning percentage of Rentai rate of 40.0 percent is the remarkable number and 50.0% 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.810
 Horses that did not win but won 1.9 times or less win 100% consecutive 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:32.149
 It has become a St. 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:33.240
 However, only one out of four horses raced between 2.0 and 2.9 times within three 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:41.250
 Not in 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:42.869
 On the contrary, the horse's performance of 3.0 to 4.9 times is good, and the distribution around this is a reference for prediction 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:51.560
 Seems to be able to 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:51.560
 I also want to remember that there are 12 horses that were more than 10 times in 2nd and 3rd 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.360
 Inward-facing horse numbers dominate 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:03.140
 When we summarize horse number classified results of the past 10 years 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.990
 Bant in the city ​​that ranks high in broadcast rate 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:13.010
 Number 78 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:18.980
 In addition, 34 consecutive numbers become good number with 25.0% 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:26.810
 On the other hand, the horse numbers from 9th to the outside have another score 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:27.470
 Last year's Mickey Ayer won the 12th, but there were no more than 3 horses outside the 13th. 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.370
 The 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.370
 It is likely that the horse that became the outlying horse number needs to be discounted 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:46.090
 Achievements by conditions of war 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:49.050
 There were a lot of horse runs where the war was g 1 in Shinzan Memorial, but the special broadcast rate was 5 million 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:56.670
 It is less than the horse that came from 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:03:00.990
 However , it is the red of 2011 that the Shinzan victory was won with the horse whose war was 5 million lower 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:08.460
 I saw Davis 3 of the horses that were one in the race 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:13.520
 In addition , two horses have won in the past 10 years and have won the long-cum class in the past 10 years. 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.520
 The horse immediately after 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:24.680
 Focus on your debut match record 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:26.239
 In the past seven years since 2008, the solidarity of horses that had been two in their debut match 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:33.709
 in the process of 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:35.170
 Moreover , it is common that 8 players listed in Table 4 have never lost to 3 or less until they give their first victory. 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.520
 There is also a point 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:46.230
 After losing to the second place in the debut match without breaking the score 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.230
 I would like to recommend that you mark the horse that has won your first victory. 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.940
 Find the winning horse 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.240
 for the win 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:59.860
 Pay attention to your second round debut 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:04.000
 In Shinzan Memorial's 2nd debut for 3 consecutive years 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:12.430
 Horses that were the first to win with 1 win are winning 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:15.260
 When these three races won the race, they were gaining popularity by a win of 1x and this year too 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.729
 The second race of the debut of each horse 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.729
 I want to check my grades 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:30.550
