00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
it's getting a MOAB the only thing that

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.170 
it's getting a MOAB the only thing that
makes<00:03:43.980> modern<00:03:44.310> warfare<00:03:44.459> 3<00:03:44.610> worth<00:03:44.910> playing

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
makes modern warfare 3 worth playing

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.240 
makes modern warfare 3 worth playing
there<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.480> go<00:03:45.660> reword<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.320> recycled<00:03:46.980> at<00:03:47.070> it

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
there you go reword that recycled at it

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.520 
there you go reword that recycled at it
yeah<00:03:47.730> it's<00:03:48.209> getting<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.630> MOAB<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.200> only<00:03:49.410> thing

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
yeah it's getting a MOAB the only thing

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.460 
yeah it's getting a MOAB the only thing
that<00:03:49.650> makes<00:03:49.769> mana<00:03:50.160> 143<00:03:50.580> worth<00:03:50.760> playing<00:03:51.030> and

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
that makes mana 143 worth playing and

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.460 
that makes mana 143 worth playing and
you<00:03:52.470> know<00:03:52.620> it's<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.519> may<00:03:53.730> be<00:03:53.790> true<00:03:54.120> but<00:03:54.470> then

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
you know it's that may be true but then

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.540 
you know it's that may be true but then
again<00:03:55.500> at<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.830> same<00:03:56.040> time<00:03:56.220> it's<00:03:56.459> like

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
again at the same time it's like

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.790 
again at the same time it's like
combined<00:03:57.060> player<00:03:57.330> skill<00:03:57.750> with<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.380> bullshit

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
combined player skill with the bullshit

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.620 
combined player skill with the bullshit
of<00:03:58.920> mono<00:03:59.100> or<00:03:59.280> 43<00:03:59.670> and<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.180> makes<00:04:00.360> getting

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
of mono or 43 and that makes getting

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.210 
of mono or 43 and that makes getting
moab<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.470> much<00:04:01.620> harder<00:04:01.860> for<00:04:02.160> the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
moab that that much harder for the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.820 
moab that that much harder for the
average<00:04:02.400> person<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.870> if<00:04:04.080> you<00:04:04.440> can't<00:04:04.709> get<00:04:04.769> a

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
average person so if you can't get a

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.380 
average person so if you can't get a
MOAB<00:04:05.190> just<00:04:05.459> play<00:04:05.580> them<00:04:05.700> on<00:04:05.730> 1<00:04:05.940> for<00:04:06.090> 3<00:04:06.239> on<00:04:06.269> a

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
MOAB just play them on 1 for 3 on a

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.910 
MOAB just play them on 1 for 3 on a
regular<00:04:06.540> basis<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.230> next<00:04:07.560> thing<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:07.769> do<00:04:07.890> is
