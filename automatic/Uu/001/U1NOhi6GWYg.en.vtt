Bank League this season Terenure seemed

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.070 
Bank League this season Terenure seemed
to<00:01:47.910> be<00:01:48.000> running<00:01:48.209> away<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.660> it<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:48.929> they've

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
to be running away with it but they've

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.990 
to be running away with it but they've
been<00:01:49.229> reined<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.649> slightly<00:01:49.950> who's<00:01:50.700> your<00:01:50.849> tip

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
been reined in slightly who's your tip

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.300 
been reined in slightly who's your tip
to<00:01:51.119> take<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.390> title<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:52.770> know<00:01:52.860> I'd<00:01:53.009> say<00:01:53.039> when

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
to take the title you know I'd say when

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.499 
to take the title you know I'd say when
it<00:01:53.399> comes<00:01:53.429> down<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.970> Sammy's<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
it comes down to the Sammy's and the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.660 
it comes down to the Sammy's and the
finals<00:01:54.959> it's<00:01:55.800> no<00:01:55.920> longer<00:01:56.099> winner-takes-all

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
finals it's no longer winner-takes-all

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.820 
finals it's no longer winner-takes-all
so<00:01:57.119> I'm<00:01:57.539> hoping<00:01:57.959> Clontarf<00:01:58.349> will<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.649> there

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
so I'm hoping Clontarf will be there

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.660 
so I'm hoping Clontarf will be there
there<00:01:59.039> baritone<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.759> overuse<00:02:00.090> 15<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.509> ease
