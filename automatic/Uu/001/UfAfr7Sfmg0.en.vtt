there we go I mean to me that is that's
something<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.709> guess<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.070> Brit<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.400> I

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
something I guess is a Brit that I

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.979 
something I guess is a Brit that I
really<00:03:24.090> struggle<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.450> get<00:03:24.570> my<00:03:24.690> head<00:03:24.870> around

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
really struggle to get my head around

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.390 
really struggle to get my head around
and<00:03:25.290> we're<00:03:25.410> not<00:03:25.500> gonna<00:03:25.650> solve<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.100> here<00:03:26.250> in<00:03:26.340> a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
and we're not gonna solve it here in a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.540 
and we're not gonna solve it here in a
couple<00:03:26.520> of<00:03:26.670> minutes<00:03:26.940> but<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.420> mean<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.140> just

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
couple of minutes but I mean it's just

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.250 
couple of minutes but I mean it's just
essentially<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.580> dangerous<00:03:30.570> combination<00:03:30.810> to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
essentially a dangerous combination to

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260 
essentially a dangerous combination to

promoting violence in some ways football
games<00:03:39.150> can<00:03:39.300> be<00:03:39.330> pretty<00:03:39.570> aggressive<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.830> lot

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
games can be pretty aggressive and a lot

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.770
