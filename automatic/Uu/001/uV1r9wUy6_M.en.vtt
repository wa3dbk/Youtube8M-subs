the day dome light would come on which

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.410 
the day dome light would come on which
basically<00:00:13.259> would<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.610> dash<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:15.299> would

basically would be on the dash it would

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.980 
basically would be on the dash it would
show<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.170> was<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.289> door<00:00:16.590> ajar<00:00:16.680> switch<00:00:17.160> so

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
show that it was the door ajar switch so

but<00:00:28.470> I'm<00:00:28.650> gonna<00:00:28.800> try<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.279> with<00:00:29.460> one

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
but I'm gonna try to do this with one

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.080 
but I'm gonna try to do this with one
hand<00:00:29.699> video<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> other<00:00:31.009> but

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
hand video with the other but

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.310 
hand video with the other but
essentially<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> did<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.750> as<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.079> tricked

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
essentially what I did was as I tricked

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.540 
essentially what I did was as I tricked
the<00:00:34.380> system<00:00:34.710> opened<00:00:34.950> all<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.100> doors<00:00:35.219> I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the system opened all the doors I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.430 
the system opened all the doors I
pressed<00:00:36.180> all<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> locks<00:00:36.690> inward<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.410> a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
pressed all the locks inward with a

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.160 
pressed all the locks inward with a
screwdriver<00:00:37.710> basically<00:00:38.930> making<00:00:39.930> them

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
screwdriver basically making them

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.630 
screwdriver basically making them
believe<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.680> doors<00:00:40.920> were<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
believe that the doors were in the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.209 
believe that the doors were in the
closed<00:00:41.879> position<00:00:42.620> during<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.680> time<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> did

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
closed position during the time I did

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.760 
closed position during the time I did
this<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.700> caught<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> car<00:00:45.329> when<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.770> jar

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
this I caught the car when the jar

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.010 
this I caught the car when the jar
switch<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.430> basically<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.090> flickering<00:00:48.809> on

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
switch was basically just flickering on

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.189 
switch was basically just flickering on
and<00:00:49.710> off<00:00:49.950> repetitively<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.079> so

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and off repetitively so and it so

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.709 
and off repetitively so and it so

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
opened up all the doors trick the system

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.270 
opened up all the doors trick the system
think<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.660> was<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.800> doors<00:01:02.039> were<00:01:02.250> shut

right rear and I did I moved it out did
the<00:01:11.760> same<00:01:11.909> thing<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.689> I'd<00:01:12.750> already

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the same thing with it and I'd already

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.230 
the same thing with it and I'd already
had<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.200> door<00:01:13.439> apart<00:01:13.799> before<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.850> clean<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
had this door apart before and clean the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.800 
had this door apart before and clean the
switch<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:17.430> obviously<00:01:17.970> didn't<00:01:18.570> do<00:01:18.659> much

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
switch but it obviously didn't do much

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.109 
switch but it obviously didn't do much
good<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.659> pushed<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.810> lock<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.320> and

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
good but I pushed the lock in and

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.399 
good but I pushed the lock in and
sometimes<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.299> would<00:01:24.420> turn<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> light<00:01:25.200> off

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
sometimes it would turn the light off

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
sometimes it would turn the light off
and<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.860> stay<00:01:26.070> off<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.580> sometimes<00:01:27.000> it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and it would stay off and sometimes it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.940 
and it would stay off and sometimes it
would<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:28.110> basically<00:01:28.619> her<00:01:28.710> back<00:01:28.829> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
thing you got two little tabs there's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.700 
thing you got two little tabs there's
one<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> top<00:01:50.970> right<00:01:51.329> here<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.470> push

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
one on the top right here you just push

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.300 
one on the top right here you just push
in<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> screwdriver<00:01:53.430> or<00:01:54.079> a<00:01:55.219> putty<00:01:56.219> knife

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
in with a screwdriver or a putty knife

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.670 
in with a screwdriver or a putty knife
from<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.820> top<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.360> one<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.079> bottom<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
from the top and one on the bottom and

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.230 
from the top and one on the bottom and
this<00:01:58.740> thing<00:01:58.920> pull<00:01:59.219> out<00:01:59.399> these<00:01:59.939> are<00:02:00.090> pretty

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
this thing pull out these are pretty

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.889 
this thing pull out these are pretty
much<00:02:00.450> sprung<00:02:00.950> but<00:02:01.950> what<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.640> did<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.540> just

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
much sprung but what I did was I just

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.560 
much sprung but what I did was I just
bypassed<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.710> door<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.119> position

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
bypassed that door so in the position

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.789 
bypassed that door so in the position
the<00:02:06.659> way<00:02:06.780> I've<00:02:06.899> got<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.110> door<00:02:07.320> set<00:02:07.530> up<00:02:07.619> now

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
the way I've got this door set up now

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.330 
the way I've got this door set up now
which<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> right<00:02:08.700> rear<00:02:08.970> passenger<00:02:09.690> rear

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
which is the right rear passenger rear

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.770 
which is the right rear passenger rear
when<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.430> open<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.970> dome<00:02:12.150> light<00:02:12.180> will<00:02:12.540> not

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
when you open it the dome light will not

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.550 
when you open it the dome light will not
come<00:02:13.080> on

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
come on

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.890 
come on
because<00:02:13.739> I've<00:02:13.860> overridden<00:02:14.489> everything<00:02:15.030> to

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
because I've overridden everything to

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.199 
because I've overridden everything to
basically<00:02:16.319> think<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.670> stays<00:02:17.940> and

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
basically think that it stays and

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.320 
basically think that it stays and
closing<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.690> closed<00:02:18.900> position<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:21.150> do

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
closing the closed position and to do

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.300 
closing the closed position and to do
that<00:02:21.599> what<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.230> did<00:02:22.440> was<00:02:22.650> rather<00:02:22.950> than<00:02:23.160> it's

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that what I did was rather than it's

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.620 
that what I did was rather than it's
going<00:02:23.520> on<00:02:23.610> spending<00:02:24.180> hundreds<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.569> dollars

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
going on spending hundreds of dollars

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.420 
going on spending hundreds of dollars
for<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> new<00:02:25.140> lock<00:02:25.500> system<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:27.230> there's<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.470> looks

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
for a new lock system I there's a looks

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.030 
for a new lock system I there's a looks
like<00:02:29.580> it's<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.300> black-and-white

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
like it's a it's a black-and-white

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.650 
like it's a it's a black-and-white
stripe<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.280> one<00:02:32.400> right<00:02:32.489> here<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.880> then

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
stripe this one right here and then

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.740 
stripe this one right here and then
there's<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.650> pink<00:02:35.010> blue<00:02:35.700> it's<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.330> next<00:02:36.569> row<00:02:36.720> of

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
there's a pink blue it's the next row of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.670 
there's a pink blue it's the next row of
wires<00:02:37.019> up

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
wires up

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.250 
wires up
it's<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.489> wire<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.630> center<00:02:40.110> between

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
it's the wire in the center between

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.500 
it's the wire in the center between
those<00:02:40.620> three<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:41.190> can't<00:02:41.880> really<00:02:42.030> get<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.239> color

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
those three I can't really get a color

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.550 
those three I can't really get a color
on<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:43.290> what<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.470> did<00:02:43.709> was<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.370> took<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.970> a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.350 

homemade<00:02:49.560> contraption<00:02:50.340> basically<00:02:51.090> checked

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
homemade contraption basically checked

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.970 
homemade contraption basically checked
continuity<00:02:51.930> between<00:02:52.049> them<00:02:52.440> until<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.739> lights

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
continuity between them until the lights

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.090 
continuity between them until the lights
flickered<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:54.120> when<00:02:54.930> they<00:02:55.019> did<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.470> pulled

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
flickered and when they did I pulled

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.070 
flickered and when they did I pulled
this<00:02:56.220> thing<00:02:56.430> apart<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.060> up<00:02:57.269> inside<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.780> pins

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
this thing apart and up inside the pins

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.740 
this thing apart and up inside the pins
I<00:02:58.349> took<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.040> real<00:02:59.310> small<00:02:59.849> hard<00:03:00.180> piece<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.420> wire

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
I took a real small hard piece of wire

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.370 
I took a real small hard piece of wire
it's<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.549> like<00:03:02.549> a<00:03:02.970> telephone<00:03:03.420> wire<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.140> hard

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
it's a like a telephone wire the hard

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.229 
it's a like a telephone wire the hard
hard<00:03:04.739> core<00:03:04.920> wire<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:05.519> basically<00:03:05.790> stuck<00:03:06.120> it

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
hard core wire and basically stuck it

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.020 
hard core wire and basically stuck it
into<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.630> hole<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:08.010> black<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.849> white

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
into the hole and black and the white

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.759 
into the hole and black and the white
and<00:03:09.209> then<00:03:09.420> went<00:03:09.630> over<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.319> other<00:03:10.530> wire

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
and then went over to the other wire

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.580 
and then went over to the other wire
which<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> pink<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:11.910> maybe<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.239> maybe<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.900> blue

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
which is a pink and maybe a maybe a blue

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.800 
which is a pink and maybe a maybe a blue
or<00:03:13.739> turquoise<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.400> put<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.090> in<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.239> hole<00:03:15.630> and

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
or turquoise and put it in that hole and

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.780 
or turquoise and put it in that hole and
basically<00:03:16.530> put<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:16.890> plug<00:03:17.069> together<00:03:17.280> so

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
basically put that plug together so

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.640 
basically put that plug together so
inside<00:03:18.329> this<00:03:18.570> I've<00:03:18.780> basically<00:03:18.989> created<00:03:19.590> a

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
inside this I've basically created a

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.440 
inside this I've basically created a
continuity<00:03:20.070> chain<00:03:20.459> between<00:03:20.700> those<00:03:21.090> two<00:03:21.239> wires

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
continuity chain between those two wires

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.740 
continuity chain between those two wires
to<00:03:22.290> think<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.310> lights<00:03:23.579> are<00:03:23.850> or<00:03:24.600> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
to think that the the lights are or the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.050 
to think that the the lights are or the
doors<00:03:24.959> in<00:03:25.109> closed<00:03:25.380> position<00:03:25.530> at<00:03:25.920> all<00:03:26.010> times<00:03:26.070> so

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
doors in closed position at all times so

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.610 
doors in closed position at all times so
far<00:03:27.329> for<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.600> last<00:03:27.810> two<00:03:27.959> nights<00:03:27.989> everything

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
far for the last two nights everything

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.370 
far for the last two nights everything
seems<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:28.950> have<00:03:29.040> worked<00:03:29.280> good<00:03:29.690> however<00:03:32.269> now

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
seems to have worked good however now

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.500 
seems to have worked good however now
when<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.560> open<00:03:34.920> this<00:03:35.069> door<00:03:35.340> up<00:03:35.700> which<00:03:36.329> is<00:03:36.480> a

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
when you open this door up which is a

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.970 
when you open this door up which is a
strawberry<00:03:36.840> rule<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:39.440> right<00:03:40.440> rear<00:03:40.590> door<00:03:40.769> when

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
strawberry rule the right rear door when

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.979
