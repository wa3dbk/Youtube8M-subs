information that I found here online now

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.849 
information that I found here online now
this<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.089> leaked<00:00:06.450> information<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.589> might

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
this is leaked information so this might

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.650 
this is leaked information so this might
not<00:00:08.040> actually<00:00:08.309> be<00:00:08.580> what<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.330> going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.599> come

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660

i<00:00:24.449> made<00:00:24.660> actually<00:00:24.960> went<00:00:25.289> over<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.890> four

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
i made actually went over the four

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.529 
i made actually went over the four
processors<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:26.939> they're<00:00:27.210> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> come

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
processors that they're going to come

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.929 
processors that they're going to come
out<00:00:27.570> with<00:00:27.810> first<00:00:28.140> hi<00:00:28.830> ascend<00:00:29.160> being<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> FX

will be unlocked and this processor has

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.990 
will be unlocked and this processor has
some<00:00:47.670> pretty<00:00:48.510> crazy<00:00:48.989> specs<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.730> course

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
some pretty crazy specs to it of course

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.389 
some pretty crazy specs to it of course
it's<00:00:51.210> based<00:00:51.420> off<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> 32<00:00:52.170> nanometer

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
it's based off the 32 nanometer

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.709 
it's based off the 32 nanometer
architecture<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.969> hundred<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.420> forty

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
architecture it's a hundred and forty

watt<00:00:54.899> TDP<00:00:55.610> it's<00:00:56.610> am3+<00:00:57.770> socket<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.920> course<00:00:59.219> and

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
watt TDP it's am3+ socket of course and

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.610 
watt TDP it's am3+ socket of course and
it<00:00:59.969> will<00:01:00.090> feature<00:01:00.270> eight<00:01:00.629> megabytes<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.230> l2

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
it will feature eight megabytes of l2

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.920 
it will feature eight megabytes of l2
cache<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.460> eight<00:01:02.640> megabytes<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.359> l3<00:01:03.570> cache

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
cache up to eight megabytes of l3 cache

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.530 
cache up to eight megabytes of l3 cache
it's<00:01:04.589> an<00:01:04.710> eight-core<00:01:05.129> processor<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:06.030> I'm

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
it's an eight-core processor and I'm

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.359 
it's an eight-core processor and I'm
sure<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.750> l3<00:01:07.590> cache<00:01:07.619> will<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.220> eight

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
sure the l3 cache will be eight

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.030 
sure the l3 cache will be eight
megabytes<00:01:08.700> will<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.119> one<00:01:09.360> megabyte<00:01:10.200> per<00:01:10.560> core

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
megabytes will be one megabyte per core

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.190 
megabytes will be one megabyte per core
but<00:01:11.280> it'll<00:01:11.460> probably<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.970> shared<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.990> most

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
but it'll probably be shared like most

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.320 
but it'll probably be shared like most
of<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> l3<00:01:13.770> cache<00:01:13.799> azhar<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.520> cpus<00:01:15.090> these

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
of the l3 cache azhar and cpus these

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200 
of the l3 cache azhar and cpus these
days<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.590> cpu<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.400> actually<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
days but this cpu is actually going to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.359 
days but this cpu is actually going to
be<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:20.689> from<00:01:21.979> just<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> stock<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.479> be

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
be a from just a stock it's going to be

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.630 
be a from just a stock it's going to be
four<00:01:26.369> point<00:01:26.670> two<00:01:26.970> gigahertz<00:01:28.250> okay<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.400> clock

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
four point two gigahertz okay the clock

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.520 
four point two gigahertz okay the clock
speed<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.299> nominal<00:01:30.720> clock<00:01:30.960> speeds<00:01:31.259> gonna<00:01:31.409> be

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
speed the nominal clock speeds gonna be

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.710 
speed the nominal clock speeds gonna be
four<00:01:31.770> point<00:01:32.070> two<00:01:32.310> gigahertz<00:01:32.729> which<00:01:33.600> is

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
four point two gigahertz which is

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.069 
four point two gigahertz which is
already<00:01:33.990> insane<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:35.640> these<00:01:36.360> cpus<00:01:36.840> are<00:01:36.869> going

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
already insane but these cpus are going

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.080 
already insane but these cpus are going
to<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.290> turbo<00:01:37.740> core<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> turbo

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
to have turbo core on them and the turbo

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.600 
to have turbo core on them and the turbo
core<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:40.140> going<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.740> 4.7

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
core is actually going to go up to 4.7

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.319 
core is actually going to go up to 4.7
gigahertz<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.329> insane

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
gigahertz so that is just insane

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.350 
gigahertz so that is just insane

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.039 
for cpu especially an AMD cpu to be
coming<00:02:05.369> from<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.820> factory<00:02:06.329> with<00:02:06.360> 4.2

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
coming from the factory with 4.2

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.760 
coming from the factory with 4.2
gigahertz<00:02:07.469> clock<00:02:07.890> speeds<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:09.390> 140<00:02:10.289> watt<00:02:10.440> TDP

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
gigahertz clock speeds and 140 watt TDP

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.020 
gigahertz clock speeds and 140 watt TDP
that's<00:02:11.129> just<00:02:11.310> amazing

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
that's just amazing

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.180 
that's just amazing
so<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.450> got<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.020> feeling<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.380> reaching<00:02:13.980> 5

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
so I got a feeling that reaching 5

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.610 
so I got a feeling that reaching 5
gigahertz<00:02:14.610> will<00:02:15.270> not<00:02:15.510> be<00:02:15.780> hard<00:02:16.380> at<00:02:16.530> all

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
gigahertz will not be hard at all

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.990 
gigahertz will not be hard at all
especially<00:02:16.920> because<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:17.580> going<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:17.880> an

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
especially because it's going to have an

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.300 
especially because it's going to have an
unlocked<00:02:18.300> multiplier<00:02:18.590> I'm<00:02:19.590> not<00:02:19.740> exactly<00:02:20.100> sure

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
unlocked multiplier I'm not exactly sure

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.680 
unlocked multiplier I'm not exactly sure
what<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.819> coolers<00:02:21.180> are<00:02:21.330> going<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.510> look<00:02:21.660> like

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
what the coolers are going to look like

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.870 
what the coolers are going to look like
on<00:02:21.990> these<00:02:22.230> because<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.920> said<00:02:22.980> there's<00:02:23.310> 140

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
on these because like I said there's 140

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.620 
on these because like I said there's 140
wat<00:02:24.150> TDP<00:02:24.660> CPU<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:27.060> going<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.270> be<00:02:27.360> putting

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
wat TDP CPU so it's going to be putting

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.479 
wat TDP CPU so it's going to be putting
out<00:02:27.780> quite<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.170> bit<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.500> heat<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:29.340> going

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
out quite a bit of heat but it's going

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.250 
out quite a bit of heat but it's going
to<00:02:29.550> be<00:02:29.670> based<00:02:29.910> on<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.180> 32<00:02:30.480> nanometer<00:02:30.810> process

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
to be based on the 32 nanometer process

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.860 
to be based on the 32 nanometer process
of<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> voltages<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.209> CPU<00:02:33.630> we're<00:02:33.750> going

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
of the voltages on the CPU we're going

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.690 
of the voltages on the CPU we're going
to<00:02:33.930> be<00:02:34.020> quite<00:02:34.350> low<00:02:34.590> I'm<00:02:34.890> guessing<00:02:35.310> anywhere

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
to be quite low I'm guessing anywhere

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.590 
to be quite low I'm guessing anywhere
from<00:02:36.560> maybe<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.709> little<00:02:37.890> lesson<00:02:38.130> 1<00:02:38.520> volt<00:02:38.790> with

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
from maybe a little lesson 1 volt with

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.660 
from maybe a little lesson 1 volt with
cool<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.050> quiet<00:02:40.230> enabled<00:02:40.770> up<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.220> anywhere

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
cool and quiet enabled up to anywhere

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.110 
cool and quiet enabled up to anywhere
maybe<00:02:42.410> 1.3<00:02:43.410> 1.35<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.640> going<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.880> be<00:02:44.970> what

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
maybe 1.3 1.35 is going to be what

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.600 
maybe 1.3 1.35 is going to be what
they'll<00:02:45.300> probably<00:02:45.540> rate<00:02:45.810> these<00:02:45.959> up<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.610> and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
they'll probably rate these up to and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.090 
they'll probably rate these up to and
the<00:02:49.580> 8130<00:02:50.580> p<00:02:51.239> as<00:02:52.080> i<00:02:52.230> stayed<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.709> last<00:02:52.920> video

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
the 8130 p as i stayed in the last video

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.440 
the 8130 p as i stayed in the last video
is<00:02:53.370> going<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.550> be<00:02:53.640> around<00:02:53.790> three<00:02:54.180> hundred<00:02:54.209> and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
is going to be around three hundred and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.720 
is going to be around three hundred and
twenty<00:02:54.750> dollars<00:02:55.050> us<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:56.070> i'm<00:02:56.220> guessing<00:02:56.489> the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
twenty dollars us so i'm guessing the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.900 
twenty dollars us so i'm guessing the
8080<00:02:57.600> 150<00:02:58.380> p<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.890> going<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.160> be<00:02:59.280> anywhere<00:02:59.730> in<00:02:59.819> a
