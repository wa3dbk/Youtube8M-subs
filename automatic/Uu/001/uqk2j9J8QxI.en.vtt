00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
doesn't like you know die out and stuff

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.660 
doesn't like you know die out and stuff
like<00:00:46.559> titanfall<00:00:46.920> kind<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.309> did<00:00:47.460> like

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
like titanfall kind of did like

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.510 
like titanfall kind of did like
titanfall<00:00:48.239> was<00:00:48.539> hyped<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.350> ages<00:00:50.010> and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
titanfall was hyped for like ages and

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.250

suddenly<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> game<00:00:51.090> came<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.329> no<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.719> played

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.470 
suddenly the game came out no one played
it<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.670> hopefully<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.820> game<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.210> not<00:00:54.300> better

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
it so hopefully this game is not better

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.110 
it so hopefully this game is not better
on<00:00:54.840> beta<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.379> already<00:00:55.649> out<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.160> don't<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:57.030> if

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
on beta is already out I don't know if

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.450 
on beta is already out I don't know if
I'm<00:00:57.239> gonna<00:00:57.360> get<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.750> though<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.280> probably<00:00:59.480> so

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
I'm gonna get it though but probably so

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.109 
I'm gonna get it though but probably so
it<00:01:02.460> deals<00:01:03.300> 109<00:01:04.140> damage<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.129> 48<00:01:05.549> rounds<00:01:05.760> in

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
it deals 109 damage it is 48 rounds in

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.399 
it deals 109 damage it is 48 rounds in
its<00:01:06.420> drum<00:01:07.290> magazine<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:09.180> fires<00:01:09.630> at<00:01:09.869> 900

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
its drum magazine and it fires at 900

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.890 
its drum magazine and it fires at 900
rounds<00:01:10.619> per<00:01:10.740> minute<00:01:10.830> which<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.900> relatively

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
rounds per minute which is relatively

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.539 
rounds per minute which is relatively
fast<00:01:13.170> firing<00:01:13.470> obviously<00:01:14.070> there's<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.400> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
fast firing obviously there's like a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.700 
fast firing obviously there's like a
thousand<00:01:14.970> rpms<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.540> tire<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.049> stuff<00:01:16.229> but

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
thousand rpms and tire and stuff but

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.359 
thousand rpms and tire and stuff but
this<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.040> still<00:01:17.280> really<00:01:17.670> fast<00:01:17.909> now<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.869> course

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
this is still really fast now of course

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.219 
this is still really fast now of course
since<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.580> fast<00:01:20.790> firing<00:01:21.030> they<00:01:21.689> had<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.110> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
since it's fast firing they had to you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.109 
since it's fast firing they had to you
know<00:01:22.350> somehow<00:01:22.619> make<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.490> even<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.000> not

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
know somehow make it even so it's not

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.450 
know somehow make it even so it's not
too<00:01:24.270> overpowered<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.380> got<00:01:25.710> extremely<00:01:26.310> high

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
too overpowered it's got extremely high

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.300 
too overpowered it's got extremely high
recoil<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:28.049> can't<00:01:28.320> really<00:01:28.500> use<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.130> at

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
recoil so you can't really use this at

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.539 
recoil so you can't really use this at
long<00:01:29.490> ranges<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> wiki<00:01:31.530> page<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.400> it

design<00:02:23.140> basically<00:02:23.709> what<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:23.920> did<00:02:24.130> was<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.459> took

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
design basically what I did was I took

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.260 
design basically what I did was I took
some<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.180> your<00:02:25.450> I'll<00:02:26.080> just<00:02:26.230> show<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:27.150> here<00:02:28.150> it

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
some of your I'll just show you here it

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.260 
some of your I'll just show you here it
is<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:28.840> too<00:02:29.260> wide<00:02:29.530> but<00:02:29.920> adding<00:02:30.700> these<00:02:30.850> little

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
is it's too wide but adding these little

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.990 
is it's too wide but adding these little
plates<00:02:32.050> on<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.350> side<00:02:32.500> makes<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.580> round

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
plates on the side makes it a round

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.360 
plates on the side makes it a round
force<00:02:34.390> that's<00:02:34.630> wide<00:02:34.870> which<00:02:35.260> makes<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.190> a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
force that's wide which makes it a

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.340 
force that's wide which makes it a
comfortable<00:02:37.000> handle<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.390> hold<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.780> extremely

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
just fell now the gameplay I've seen I

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.090 
just fell now the gameplay I've seen I
honestly<00:03:10.720> don't<00:03:10.900> know<00:03:11.019> if<00:03:11.080> this<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:11.620> thing<00:03:11.950> I

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
honestly don't know if this this thing I

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.190 
honestly don't know if this this thing I
don't<00:03:12.340> know<00:03:12.430> if<00:03:12.549> it's<00:03:12.670> some<00:03:12.850> like<00:03:13.569> magical

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
don't know if it's some like magical

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.780 
don't know if it's some like magical
magnetic<00:03:14.830> thing<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.130> puts<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.519> on<00:03:15.640> or

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
magnetic thing that puts it on or

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.250 
magnetic thing that puts it on or
something<00:03:16.090> but<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.540> assume<00:03:16.900> it's<00:03:17.049> something

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
something but I assume it's something

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.930 
something but I assume it's something
like<00:03:17.470> this<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:18.310> it's<00:03:18.400> still<00:03:18.640> got<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
like this so it's still got the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.670 
like this so it's still got the
traditional<00:03:19.570> magazine<00:03:19.810> design<00:03:20.230> it's<00:03:20.590> not

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
traditional magazine design it's not

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.050 
traditional magazine design it's not
that<00:03:21.160> futuristic<00:03:21.900> um<00:03:22.900> no<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.859> first<00:03:24.160> person<00:03:24.489> it

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
that futuristic um no in first person it

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.810 
that futuristic um no in first person it
actually<00:03:25.630> has<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.230> ammo<00:03:26.590> catcher<00:03:26.829> right<00:03:27.579> here

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
actually has the ammo catcher right here

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.060 
actually has the ammo catcher right here
now<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.570> do<00:03:28.630> not<00:03:28.930> have<00:03:29.170> any<00:03:29.380> of<00:03:29.500> those<00:03:29.680> printed

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
bricks with numbers on him so I couldn't

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.890 
bricks with numbers on him so I couldn't
really<00:03:32.109> replicate<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:32.859> but<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:34.000> has<00:03:34.239> 48<00:03:34.750> rounds

in the magazine so it's supposed to say
48<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.150> then<00:03:37.239> when<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.510> shoot<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.350> number

48 and then when you shoot the number

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.500 
48 and then when you shoot the number
goes<00:03:38.799> down<00:03:38.850> depending<00:03:39.850> on<00:03:40.030> how<00:03:40.180> many<00:03:40.329> bolts

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.000 
goes down depending on how many bolts
you<00:03:40.660> have<00:03:40.840> left<00:03:41.350> so<00:03:43.380> game<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.560> can<00:03:44.739> remember

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010

that<00:03:45.280> from<00:03:45.519> its<00:03:45.670> halo<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.030> mean<00:03:46.420> pretty<00:03:47.019> much

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
that from its halo I mean pretty much

that from its halo I mean pretty much
all<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.440> guns<00:03:47.620> had<00:03:47.769> an<00:03:47.920> ammo<00:03:48.190> counter<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:48.670> yeah

all the guns had an ammo counter so yeah

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.410 
all the guns had an ammo counter so yeah
I<00:03:49.450> guess<00:03:49.750> halo<00:03:50.109> did<00:03:50.290> influence<00:03:51.150> destiny<00:03:52.150> quite

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
and of course you can use the iron

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.730 
and of course you can use the iron
sights<00:04:36.759> here<00:04:37.090> they<00:04:37.210> are<00:04:37.360> now<00:04:38.080> they<00:04:38.560> aren't

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
sights here they are now they aren't

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.689 
sights here they are now they aren't
100%<00:04:39.250> game<00:04:39.669> accurate<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:41.650> top<00:04:41.949> aren't

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
100% game accurate the top aren't

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:43.860 
100% game accurate the top aren't
supposed<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.090> be<00:04:43.210> sloped<00:04:43.449> bricks<00:04:43.569> they're

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
supposed to be sloped bricks they're

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.890 
supposed to be sloped bricks they're
supposed<00:04:44.169> to<00:04:44.259> be<00:04:44.469> like<00:04:44.849> kind<00:04:45.849> of<00:04:45.939> hooks<00:04:46.389> that

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
supposed to be like kind of hooks that

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.339 
supposed to be like kind of hooks that
are<00:04:47.229> slightly<00:04:48.159> angled<00:04:48.669> but<00:04:49.509> of<00:04:49.780> course<00:04:50.110> I

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
are slightly angled but of course I

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.080 
are slightly angled but of course I
wanted<00:04:50.800> it<00:04:50.949> to<00:04:51.069> be<00:04:51.159> game<00:04:51.340> accurate<00:04:51.789> with<00:04:51.969> the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
wanted it to be game accurate with the

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.209 
wanted it to be game accurate with the
thickness<00:04:52.509> of<00:04:52.689> the<00:04:52.930> in-game<00:04:53.469> sort<00:04:53.830> of<00:04:53.919> model

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:54.219 
thickness of the in-game sort of model

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.700 
thickness of the in-game sort of model
so<00:04:54.939> I<00:04:54.969> couldn't<00:04:55.389> really<00:04:55.539> do<00:04:55.960> that<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.379> hundred

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
so I couldn't really do that a hundred

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.350 
so I couldn't really do that a hundred
percent<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:57.280> just<00:04:57.610> went<00:04:57.789> with<00:04:57.879> so<00:04:58.090> bricks

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
percent so I just went with so bricks

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.510 
percent so I just went with so bricks
for<00:04:58.659> the<00:04:58.689> front<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.110> back<00:04:59.349> it<00:05:00.099> doesn't

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
for the front and the back it doesn't

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.279 
for the front and the back it doesn't
look<00:05:01.560> honestly<00:05:02.560> that<00:05:02.789> bad<00:05:03.819> but<00:05:04.449> it<00:05:04.990> kind<00:05:05.229> of

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
look honestly that bad but it kind of

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:06.629 
look honestly that bad but it kind of
just<00:05:05.469> looks<00:05:05.620> like<00:05:05.770> a<00:05:05.889> red<00:05:06.129> dot<00:05:06.279> sight<00:05:06.490> that

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
just looks like a red dot sight that

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.149 
just looks like a red dot sight that
lost<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:07.000> top<00:05:07.180> piece<00:05:07.389> and<00:05:08.009> speaking<00:05:09.009> of<00:05:09.069> red

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
lost the top piece and speaking of red

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.040 
lost the top piece and speaking of red
dot<00:05:09.370> sights<00:05:09.639> the<00:05:09.909> in-game<00:05:10.300> moss<00:05:10.599> I<00:05:10.840> actually

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
dot sights the in-game moss I actually

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.159 
dot sights the in-game moss I actually
has<00:05:11.289> like<00:05:11.500> a<00:05:11.529> red<00:05:11.770> dot<00:05:12.009> for<00:05:12.219> aiming<00:05:13.050> but<00:05:14.050> of

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
has like a red dot for aiming but of

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.360 
has like a red dot for aiming but of
course<00:05:14.409> you<00:05:14.529> can't<00:05:14.710> make<00:05:14.860> things<00:05:15.069> full<00:05:15.219> in

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
course you can't make things full in

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.429 
course you can't make things full in
real<00:05:15.550> life<00:05:15.870> but<00:05:17.039> that's<00:05:18.039> basically<00:05:18.969> it<00:05:19.389> so<00:05:19.810> I

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
real life but that's basically it so I

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:24.140 
real life but that's basically it so I
