that point was a tourist site when I got

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.610 
that point was a tourist site when I got
there<00:00:40.460> I<00:00:40.489> decided<00:00:41.030> that<00:00:41.180> I<00:00:41.570> really<00:00:41.900> wanted<00:00:42.530> to

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
there I decided that I really wanted to

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.829 
there I decided that I really wanted to
record<00:00:42.949> it<00:00:43.159> as<00:00:43.309> a<00:00:43.339> place<00:00:43.760> in<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:44.150> present<00:00:44.629> as<00:00:44.780> a

tourist site and not anything from the
past<00:00:47.540> I<00:00:49.870> got<00:00:50.870> home<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.199> my<00:00:51.320> studio<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:51.739> I

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
past I got home to my studio and I

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.500 
past I got home to my studio and I
realized<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.370> most<00:00:52.610> of<00:00:52.729> the<00:00:52.820> images<00:00:53.180> or<00:00:53.329> all

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
realized that most of the images or all

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.060 
realized that most of the images or all
of<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.750> images<00:00:54.110> just<00:00:54.140> about<00:00:54.559> that<00:00:54.739> I<00:00:54.829> shot

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
of the images just about that I shot

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.939 
of the images just about that I shot
were<00:00:55.190> on<00:00:55.309> tripod<00:00:55.789> and<00:00:56.440> how<00:00:57.440> was<00:00:57.590> I<00:00:57.680> going<00:00:57.829> to

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
were on tripod and how was I going to

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.299 
were on tripod and how was I going to
bring<00:00:58.070> life<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.519> these<00:00:58.699> images<00:01:01.719> and<00:01:02.719> so<00:01:02.989> I<00:01:03.019> took

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
bring life to these images and so I took

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.600 
bring life to these images and so I took
channels<00:01:04.309> 1<00:01:04.489> &amp;<00:01:04.640> 3<00:01:04.789> &amp;<00:01:04.940> 2<00:01:05.149> &amp;<00:01:05.179> 4<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:06.250> created<00:01:07.250> pairs

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
channels 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 and created pairs

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.779 
channels 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 and created pairs
to<00:01:08.090> move<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.780> viewer<00:01:09.050> in<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.380> sense<00:01:09.830> through

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
to move the viewer in a sense through

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.750 
to move the viewer in a sense through
the<00:01:11.450> experience<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.410> going<00:01:12.770> through<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.100> camp

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.270 

it<00:01:18.360> starts<00:01:18.840> out<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.470> outside<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
it starts out with the outside of the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.200 
it starts out with the outside of the
camp<00:01:21.620> traffic<00:01:22.620> passing<00:01:23.220> tourists<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
camp traffic passing tourists on the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.290 
camp traffic passing tourists on the
inside<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.740> guard<00:01:25.980> tower<00:01:26.250> became<00:01:26.760> a<00:01:26.820> focal

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
inside the guard tower became a focal

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.440 
inside the guard tower became a focal
point<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.280> there's<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.340> constant<00:01:30.000> interplay

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
point and there's a constant interplay

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.560 
point and there's a constant interplay
between<00:01:30.540> far<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.830> near<00:01:32.390> in<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:35.510> so<00:01:36.510> you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
between far and near in and out so you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.130 
between far and near in and out so you
have<00:01:36.690> barracks<00:01:37.610> from<00:01:38.610> close<00:01:39.480> up<00:01:39.510> barracks

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
have barracks from close up barracks

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.890 
have barracks from close up barracks
from<00:01:40.440> far<00:01:40.740> from<00:01:41.730> the<00:01:42.000> outside<00:01:42.480> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> walls

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
from far from the outside of the walls

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.600 
from far from the outside of the walls
to<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.200> inside<00:01:43.650> of<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.890> walls<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
to the inside of the walls and in a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.970 
to the inside of the walls and in a
sense<00:01:44.940> you<00:01:45.300> go<00:01:45.510> through<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.080> experience<00:01:46.200> that

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
sense you go through the experience that

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.160 
sense you go through the experience that
an<00:01:47.160> inmate<00:01:47.520> might<00:01:47.730> have<00:01:47.910> gone<00:01:48.060> through<00:01:48.390> until

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
an inmate might have gone through until

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.370 
an inmate might have gone through until
you<00:01:49.200> finally<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.670> end<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.150> work

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
you finally at the end of the work

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.570 
you finally at the end of the work
you're<00:01:52.380> crossing<00:01:53.370> a<00:01:53.880> ridge<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:55.050> where<00:01:55.580> to

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
you're crossing a ridge to where to

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.930 
you're crossing a ridge to where to
where<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.850> crematoria<00:01:57.420> are<00:01:58.640> also<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.700> see

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
where the crematoria are also you see

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.090 
where the crematoria are also you see
these<00:02:00.060> little<00:02:00.240> blanks<00:02:00.780> every<00:02:01.560> channel<00:02:01.950> was

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
these little blanks every channel was

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.610 
these little blanks every channel was
given<00:02:02.400> its<00:02:02.520> own<00:02:02.640> rhythm<00:02:02.990> but<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.200> me<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.560> was

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
given its own rhythm but to me this was

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.510 
given its own rhythm but to me this was
my<00:02:04.800> innocence<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.850> quartet<00:02:06.510> and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
feet against the gravel there are you

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.130

know mothers playing with their children
outside<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:44.010> crematoria<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:44.940> have<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
outside the crematoria so you have the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.910 
outside the crematoria so you have the
eerie<00:02:45.990> sound<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.590> people<00:02:47.310> laughing<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:51.920> and

eerie sound of people laughing and and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.710 
eerie sound of people laughing and and
so<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.250> present<00:02:53.760> place<00:02:53.970> was<00:02:54.240> very<00:02:54.450> very

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
so the present place was very very

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.600 
so the present place was very very
important<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.320> me<00:02:55.530> what<00:02:55.740> it<00:02:55.860> does<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.220> that

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
important to me what it does and that

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.850 
important to me what it does and that
relationship<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> past<00:02:57.720> but<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.680> thing

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
relationship to the past but the thing

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.890 
relationship to the past but the thing
that<00:02:59.010> held<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.310> together<00:02:59.459> was<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.209> this

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
that held it together was this this
