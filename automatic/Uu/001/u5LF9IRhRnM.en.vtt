that<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.809> does<00:00:33.989> actually<00:00:34.290> keep<00:00:34.800> things

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that it does actually keep things

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.399 
that it does actually keep things
fresher<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.790> more<00:00:35.970> spontaneous<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.230> good

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:37.409 
fresher and more spontaneous the good

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.460 
fresher and more spontaneous the good
things<00:00:37.650> are<00:00:37.890> usually<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.519> moments<00:00:39.320> where<00:00:40.320> you

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
things are usually the moments where you

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.380 
things are usually the moments where you
show<00:00:40.739> up<00:00:40.920> together<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.640> surprising<00:00:42.239> one
