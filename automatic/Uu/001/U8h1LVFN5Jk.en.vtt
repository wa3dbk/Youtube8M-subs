and<00:01:21.460> we<00:01:21.700> can<00:01:22.030> actually<00:01:22.300> produce<00:01:22.660> sparks<00:01:23.410> out

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
and we can actually produce sparks out

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.790

myself a broken piece of file okay and I

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.410 
myself a broken piece of file okay and I
was<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.800> know<00:01:50.860> testing<00:01:51.820> with<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.090> piece<00:01:52.390> of

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
was you know testing with a piece of

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.960 
was you know testing with a piece of
parts<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.470> I<00:01:53.620> got<00:01:53.830> at<00:01:53.979> my<00:01:54.130> place<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.790> was

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
parts that I got at my place and I was

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.350 
parts that I got at my place and I was
surprised<00:01:55.630> by<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:55.990> amount<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:57.150> sparks<00:01:58.150> that<00:01:58.240> I

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
surprised by the amount of sparks that I

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.310 
surprised by the amount of sparks that I
could<00:01:58.630> get<00:01:59.500> out<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.799> that<00:02:00.040> parts<00:02:00.600> all<00:02:01.600> of<00:02:02.200> the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
could get out of that parts all of the

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.420 
could get out of that parts all of the
attraction<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.130> friction<00:02:03.580> in<00:02:03.670> all<00:02:03.909> of

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
attraction the friction in all of

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.740 
attraction the friction in all of
the<00:02:04.840> box<00:02:05.840> in<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.320> metal<00:02:06.650> so<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:08.149> actually

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
the box in the metal so it actually

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.200 
the box in the metal so it actually
works<00:02:09.229> away<00:02:09.530> better<00:02:09.770> than<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.100> more<00:02:10.340> it's<00:02:10.850> a

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
works away better than the more it's a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.860 
works away better than the more it's a
