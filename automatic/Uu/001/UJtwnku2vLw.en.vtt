00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
you come into this big huge cavern

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.420 
you come into this big huge cavern

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
you're gonna want to bring a bunch of

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.799 
you're gonna want to bring a bunch of
sand<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.090> cuz<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.329> got<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> go<00:00:33.630> down

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
sand with you cuz you got to go down

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.440 
sand with you cuz you got to go down
some<00:00:34.230> sand<00:00:34.710> or<00:00:34.890> gravel<00:00:35.130> or<00:00:35.460> whatever<00:00:36.149> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
some sand or gravel or whatever I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.209 
some sand or gravel or whatever I
usually<00:00:36.930> use<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.829> drop<00:00:38.040> it

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
usually use that so I can just drop it

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.459 
usually use that so I can just drop it
down<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.579> then<00:00:38.700> dig<00:00:39.480> my<00:00:39.660> way<00:00:39.870> down<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.260> pillar

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
down and then dig my way down the pillar

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.389 
down and then dig my way down the pillar
that<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:40.980> made

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that I just made

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.490 
that I just made
so<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.420> case<00:00:42.690> you're<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.469> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
so in this case you're just going to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.740 
so in this case you're just going to
want<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.770> go<00:00:43.890> over<00:00:44.129> here<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:47.660> you're<00:00:48.660> gonna

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
want to go over here and you're gonna

00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:01.069 
want to go over here and you're gonna
need<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.140> from<00:00:49.469> here<00:00:50.190> down<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.670> there<00:01:00.079> it's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.969 
actually we'll go through here just a
little<00:01:21.570> bit<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.869> guys<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.080> haven't<00:01:22.590> explored

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
little bit you guys I haven't explored

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.740 
little bit you guys I haven't explored
at<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> just<00:01:23.580> went<00:01:23.909> looking<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.390> couple

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
at all I just went looking for a couple

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.899 
at all I just went looking for a couple
of<00:01:24.840> things<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.729> main<00:01:26.939> thing<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.420> was<00:01:27.630> after

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
of things the main thing I was after

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:36.999 
of things the main thing I was after
here<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:35.520> here's<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:36.060> your<00:01:36.270> nether<00:01:36.600> wart

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
here is this here's all your nether wart

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.260 
here is this here's all your nether wart
I'm<00:01:38.009> not<00:01:38.189> sure<00:01:38.400> where<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.729> was<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.270> found<00:01:39.659> a

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
I'm not sure where it was but I found a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.120 
I'm not sure where it was but I found a
blaze<00:01:42.270> spawner<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:43.049> well<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> could

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
blaze spawner as well here so you could

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.649 
blaze spawner as well here so you could
get<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.460> blaze<00:01:44.670> rods<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.420> kind<00:01:45.600> of

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
get your blaze rods and that kind of

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.740 
get your blaze rods and that kind of
thing<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.200> anyways<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.850> quite<00:01:48.090> close<00:01:48.360> to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
thing so anyways it's quite close to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.080 
thing so anyways it's quite close to
spawn<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.680> should<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.979> reasonably<00:01:50.579> easy<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
spawn so it should be reasonably easy to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.120 
spawn so it should be reasonably easy to
find<00:01:51.299> for<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.990> coordinates<00:01:52.350> were<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
find for you the coordinates were in the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.429 
find for you the coordinates were in the
description<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:53.790> well<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.810> I'll<00:01:55.020> show<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.290> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
description as well and I'll show you a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.100 
description as well and I'll show you a
couple<00:01:55.680> quick<00:01:56.100> things<00:01:56.130> up<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.939> top<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.630> didn't

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
couple quick things up on top I didn't

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.179 
couple quick things up on top I didn't
really<00:01:58.500> explore<00:01:59.399> the<00:02:00.469> upper<00:02:01.469> world<00:02:01.680> all<00:02:02.009> that

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189

much<00:02:02.750> just<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.869> little<00:02:04.079> bit<00:02:04.229> not<00:02:04.409> too<00:02:04.439> far<00:02:04.920> from

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
much just a little bit not too far from

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.529 
much just a little bit not too far from
spawn<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.960> get<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.500> village<00:02:08.119> which<00:02:09.119> has<00:02:09.509> a

spawn you get this village which has a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.820 
spawn you get this village which has a
blacksmith<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:15.080> go<00:02:16.080> take<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.319> look<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.650> see

let's let you bet not much else and then
I<00:02:25.110> did<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.800> check<00:02:26.069> out<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> pyramid<00:02:27.150> that's<00:02:27.330> just

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
I did go check out a pyramid that's just

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.070 
I did go check out a pyramid that's just
right<00:02:28.020> over<00:02:28.319> here<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:30.450> was<00:02:30.599> actually

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
right over here and it was actually

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.070 
right over here and it was actually
pretty<00:02:31.319> neat

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.960 

I'll<00:02:34.200> show<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.530> why<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.190> second<00:02:35.640> as<00:02:35.730> soon<00:02:35.850> as

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
I'll show you why in a second as soon as

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.000 
I'll show you why in a second as soon as
I<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.150> find<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.570> again<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:39.470> think<00:02:40.470> maybe<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:40.890> was

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
I can find it again I think maybe it was

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:52.860 
I can find it again I think maybe it was
here<00:02:43.790> No

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:01.110 

systems<00:02:53.770> pretty<00:02:53.950> laggy<00:02:54.280> today<00:02:54.760> sorry<00:03:00.120> there

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
systems pretty laggy today sorry there

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.100 
systems pretty laggy today sorry there
it<00:03:01.270> is

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.570 

so<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.650> reason<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.010> thought<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.280> was<00:03:08.370> got<00:03:08.550> a

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
so the reason I thought it was got a

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.390 
so the reason I thought it was got a
need<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:09.290> practically<00:03:10.290> buried<00:03:10.920> under<00:03:11.220> this

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
need is practically buried under this

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.090 
need is practically buried under this
hill<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.940> sand<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.990> kind<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.350> imagine<00:03:13.590> big
