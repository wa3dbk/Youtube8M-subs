Deepwoods<00:00:11.400> food<00:00:11.940> plot<00:00:12.240> now<00:00:12.990> as<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.349> can<00:00:13.530> see

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
Deepwoods food plot now as you can see

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.650 
Deepwoods food plot now as you can see
I'm<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.219> bright<00:00:14.519> Sun<00:00:14.910> right<00:00:15.150> here<00:00:15.450> and

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
I'm in the bright Sun right here and

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.429 
I'm in the bright Sun right here and
back<00:00:16.260> right<00:00:16.529> behind<00:00:16.890> me<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.869> forest<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.320> in

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
back right behind me is forest and in

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.679 
back right behind me is forest and in
fact<00:00:19.680> on<00:00:20.010> all<00:00:20.340> sides<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.850> me<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.090> pretty<00:00:21.449> good

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
fact on all sides of me is pretty good

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.290 
fact on all sides of me is pretty good
section<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.289> timber<00:00:22.710> but<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.580> one<00:00:23.880> spot

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
section of timber but this one spot

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.550 
section of timber but this one spot
right<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:24.830> gets<00:00:25.830> good<00:00:26.130> sunlight<00:00:27.500> now<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
right here gets good sunlight now the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.800 
right here gets good sunlight now the
reason<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.699> because<00:00:29.730> several<00:00:30.330> trees

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
reason for that is because several trees

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.260 
reason for that is because several trees
have<00:00:31.140> fallen<00:00:31.470> down<00:00:31.800> right<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.460> location

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
have fallen down right in this location

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.510 
have fallen down right in this location
and<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:34.230> allowed<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> sunlight<00:00:35.250> to

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
and that allowed for the sunlight to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.580 
and that allowed for the sunlight to
come<00:00:35.730> through<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> went<00:00:36.840> ahead<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.290> cleared

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
come through so I went ahead and cleared

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.770 
come through so I went ahead and cleared
those<00:00:37.860> trees<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:39.000> cleared<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
those trees out of here cleared the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.560 
those trees out of here cleared the
ground<00:00:39.809> off<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:41.550> planted<00:00:41.910> my<00:00:42.059> food<00:00:42.300> plot

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
ground off and I planted my food plot

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.440 
ground off and I planted my food plot
now<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.960> order<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.120> used<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.270> little

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
now in order to do that I used a little

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.660 
now in order to do that I used a little
lime<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> pH<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.250> soil

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
lime for the pH of the soil

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.430 
lime for the pH of the soil
I<00:00:47.820> also<00:00:48.300> added<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.289> got<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> 50-pound<00:00:50.640> bag<00:00:50.969> of

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
I also added I got a 50-pound bag of

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
I also added I got a 50-pound bag of
pellet<00:00:52.440> fertilizer<00:00:53.070> brought<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.149> out<00:00:54.239> here

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
pellet fertilizer brought it out here

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.619 
pellet fertilizer brought it out here
spread<00:00:55.170> 25<00:00:55.920> pounds<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.360> plot

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
spread 25 pounds of it on the plot

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.220 
spread 25 pounds of it on the plot
initially<00:00:58.440> came<00:00:59.340> back<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> month<00:00:59.730> later<00:01:00.230> gave

of the bag now a couple things to keep
in<00:01:09.930> mind<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.500> these<00:01:10.650> Deepwood<00:01:11.130> food<00:01:11.400> plots

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
in mind with these Deepwood food plots

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.300 
in mind with these Deepwood food plots
is<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.060> need<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> minimum<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.439> four<00:01:13.830> hours<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
is they need a minimum of four hours of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.980 
is they need a minimum of four hours of
sunlight<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.939> day<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.479> they're<00:01:15.600> not<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
sunlight a day or they're not going to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.260 
sunlight a day or they're not going to
grow<00:01:16.259> most<00:01:16.890> seeds<00:01:17.159> anyway<00:01:17.670> you'll<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
grow most seeds anyway you'll have to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.450 
grow most seeds anyway you'll have to
look<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:19.530> type<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.740> seed<00:01:20.040> you're<00:01:20.189> trying

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
look at what type of seed you're trying

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.550 
look at what type of seed you're trying
to<00:01:20.610> use<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.240> how<00:01:21.509> much<00:01:21.750> sunlight<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.409> going

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
to use and how much sunlight it's going

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.880 
to use and how much sunlight it's going
to<00:01:22.619> require<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.960> go<00:01:25.320> into<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.740> woods

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
to require so if you go into the woods

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.789 
to require so if you go into the woods
and<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.509> pick<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:27.659> favorite<00:01:27.720> tree<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> try

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and just pick your favorite tree and try

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.800 
and just pick your favorite tree and try
to<00:01:28.860> put<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> food<00:01:29.340> plot<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.790> around<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.329> it's

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to put a food plot in around it it's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.539 
to put a food plot in around it it's
possibly<00:01:31.530> not<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> work<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:32.369> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
possibly not going to work because you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.760 
possibly not going to work because you
don't<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.909> enough<00:01:33.180> sunlight<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.439> that's<00:01:34.619> why

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
don't have enough sunlight so that's why

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.039 
don't have enough sunlight so that's why
I<00:01:34.799> chose<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.490> location<00:01:35.759> because<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.689> these

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
I chose this location because of these

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
I chose this location because of these
trees<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.829> fallen<00:01:37.860> down<00:01:38.369> it's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
trees that have fallen down it's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.940 
trees that have fallen down it's
providing<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.720> sunlight<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.470> needed<00:01:40.799> for

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
providing the sunlight that I needed for

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.249 
providing the sunlight that I needed for
this<00:01:41.070> food<00:01:41.369> plot<00:01:41.570> now<00:01:42.570> another<00:01:42.869> thing<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.140> keep

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
this food plot now another thing to keep

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.870 
this food plot now another thing to keep
in<00:01:43.409> mind<00:01:43.470> when<00:01:43.890> you're<00:01:44.009> using<00:01:44.280> these<00:01:44.579> food

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
in mind when you're using these food

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.420 
in mind when you're using these food
plots<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.479> how<00:01:45.930> are<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> deer<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.100> use

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
plots is how are the deer going to use

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.389 
plots is how are the deer going to use
this<00:01:47.700> area<00:01:48.030> now<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.290> particular<00:01:49.500> plot<00:01:50.159> is

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
this area now this particular plot is

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.940 
this area now this particular plot is
about<00:01:50.640> 30<00:01:51.060> yards<00:01:51.479> long<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.140> about<00:01:52.320> 20<00:01:52.770> yards

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
about 30 yards long and about 20 yards

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.330 
about 30 yards long and about 20 yards
wide<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.270> real<00:01:54.840> big<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:55.950> enough

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
wide it's not real big but it's enough

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.179

it's<00:02:43.290> it's<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.680> better<00:02:43.890> vantage<00:02:44.340> point<00:02:44.370> for

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
it's it's a better vantage point for

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.790 
it's it's a better vantage point for
them<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.810> brings<00:02:45.989> me<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.290> another<00:02:46.320> point

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
them so that brings me to another point

them so that brings me to another point
when<00:02:47.070> you're<00:02:47.250> utilizing<00:02:47.580> one<00:02:48.239> of<00:02:48.360> these<00:02:48.480> types

when you're utilizing one of these types

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.470 
when you're utilizing one of these types
of<00:02:48.870> food<00:02:49.140> plots<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.770> you're<00:02:50.550> deciding<00:02:51.060> what

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
of food plots and you're deciding what

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.410 
of food plots and you're deciding what
time<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.750> day<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.110> best<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.920> also<00:02:53.850> what<00:02:54.239> is

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
time of day is best for it also what is

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.410 
time of day is best for it also what is
the<00:02:54.630> prevailing<00:02:55.320> wind<00:02:55.560> directions<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:57.060> time

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
the prevailing wind directions that time

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.610 
the prevailing wind directions that time
of<00:02:57.570> day<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.440> if<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:59.070> put<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.519> food<00:02:59.790> plot<00:03:00.060> on<00:03:00.620> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
of day so if I put this food plot on the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.690 
of day so if I put this food plot on the
upwind<00:03:02.370> side<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.890> feeding<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.519> main

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
upwind side of the feeding the main

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.130 
upwind side of the feeding the main
feeding<00:03:06.180> area<00:03:06.420> where<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.690> deer<00:03:06.870> are<00:03:06.959> going<00:03:07.080> to

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
feeding area where the deer are going to

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.259 
feeding area where the deer are going to
be<00:03:07.200> coming<00:03:07.410> from<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.860> may<00:03:08.130> never<00:03:08.370> see<00:03:08.670> deer<00:03:08.940> here

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
be coming from I may never see deer here

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.530 
be coming from I may never see deer here
because<00:03:10.110> my<00:03:10.650> scent<00:03:11.130> may<00:03:11.459> be<00:03:11.519> blowing<00:03:12.000> right<00:03:12.269> to

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
because my scent may be blowing right to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.350 
because my scent may be blowing right to
the<00:03:12.690> deer<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.230> again<00:03:13.920> look<00:03:14.430> at<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.700> prevailing

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
the deer so again look at the prevailing

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.759 
the deer so again look at the prevailing
wind<00:03:15.600> directions<00:03:15.870> when<00:03:16.290> you're<00:03:16.440> trying<00:03:16.650> to

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
wind directions when you're trying to

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:17.810 
wind directions when you're trying to
find<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.130> spot<00:03:17.400> like<00:03:17.580> this

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
find a spot like this

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.910 
find a spot like this
these<00:03:18.239> can<00:03:18.510> be<00:03:18.630> tough<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.959> find<00:03:19.380> these<00:03:19.650> deep

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
these can be tough to find these deep

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.100 
these can be tough to find these deep
with<00:03:20.130> food<00:03:20.430> plot<00:03:20.670> areas<00:03:21.030> but<00:03:21.570> when<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.900> do

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
with food plot areas but when you do

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.930 
with food plot areas but when you do
find<00:03:22.470> one<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:22.920> get<00:03:23.070> one<00:03:23.130> set<00:03:23.579> up<00:03:23.700> like

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
find one and you get one set up like

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
find one and you get one set up like
this<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.810> can<00:03:24.989> be<00:03:25.019> very<00:03:25.500> productive
