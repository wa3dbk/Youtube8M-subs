00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 wall kids like we are watching me 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.790
 glad man I'm glad I'll explain 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.069
 today how the class system works 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.110
 of this cloud call of duty cost and good 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.790
 also then I'll talk about how you can have 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.860
 the gusts and then later I'll do like 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.540
 would be the kind that I take to go 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.279
 a knife not good to start you see 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.010
 Here are a few possible advantages 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.769
 hollows for 12 advantages exactly 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.539
 and as we go filling this here 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.330
 they are going, they are going, they are going, they are going 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.820
 alone we put a lethal one you see that 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.689
 has dropped one we put this you see that low 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.250
 other 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.440
 We need positions that go 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.790
 increasing and the same goes with the sixth 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.309
 is for example that I can spare this is 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.520
 the new kind of weapons you do not see that has 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.120
 lowered ones the accessories do not have 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.129
 nothing to see 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.770
 that is, they work the other time 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.989
 occupies space the same with the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.600
 secondary not occupying a little space 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.370
 in what is this the secondary itself yes 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.530
 and good the way of how the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.020
 the advantages then you see that here we have 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.579
 seven types exactly in speed 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.690
 steering turned awareness resistance 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.050
 team and elite 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.670
 there it was good and you see that it has 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.170
 every advantage has a number there that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.300
 it is at the lower left corner 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.220
 those are the gaps that occupies is to say 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.950
 is here is going to occupy a hole as you see 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.880
 here will occupy two is here will occupy 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.060
 three and then he's here 4 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.050
 up to here for 5 us according 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.240
 we use these advantages here we will have 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.490
 more options and if we are not more others 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.780
 to the right we will have less we can 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.640
 combine the ones we want there are not 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.630
 no problem there is no limit anymore 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.330
 between each between each mode of this and what 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.160
 same happens with the gusts because we will have 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.200
 the high coves that are typical 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.030
 I'll explain it later in the high 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.030
 they are the typical ones it helps them as it is what 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.930
 same not just choose the number of 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.760
 gusts and has appeared explain a little 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.970
 more then for example if I love myself 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.690
 put 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.740
 this is not I'm not feeding 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.740
 doing nothing in particular 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.909
 in 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:08.800
 Well, here we will have 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:11.940
 because they are the options we are removing that 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.560
 they are coming out more holes are coming out 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.730
 good at the time of making the pages 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.709
 because this specialist is going to work 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.080
 like we're going to fill in here I'm with 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.569
 I'm not served this was nothing 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.750
 interesting in kind of waiting year in 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.700
 the specialist package we are going to 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.170
 choose three three advantages depends what 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.840
 advantages whether it costs more or 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.700
 minus the first the first advantage goes to 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.340
 like more or less gotten we put 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.900
 this is the maximum the first one is going 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.480
 to cost a streak of six for 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.489
 get the change we put this one 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.620
 run of two and as they add up we 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.720
 we put this a streak of eight in case 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.299
 we get to put one of those and 94 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.780
 for example if we put this without dye and 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.700
 we have 246 and below with some of eight the 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.379
 of eight are gusts that just do not get to 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.180
 eight are unlocked all of the pull 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.710
 then I do do so are the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.770
 eggs that we have 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.380
 the gaps are occupied I knew that here 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.640
 sorry there were eight holes here we have 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.080
 eight hollow pages for example one of 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.300
 this and one of three because we would have 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.270
 five advantages of specialist and of the 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.020
 otherwise we could have dinner with 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.330
 some more does not get up arrived 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.550
 without so much forgiveness 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.470
 and this would have a total of three 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.510
 first plus another five below 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.370
 now let's move on after the class that 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.070
 I carry myself for the knife obviously 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.840
 I have a knife, there was no second 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.140
 and the lethal one obviously I heard 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.450
 throw away now the advantages I carry 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.100
 marathon since I know how to run 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.860
 unlimitedly and not worth it 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.260
 bring the agility done tests and in 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.480
 a fairly long distance the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.250
 difference of less than half a second and 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.720
 Well, I said it was taken from group two 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.490
 hollows always but I to other things not 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.050
 I take it reflex is also a 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.090
 advantage that is like more agile hands or 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.180
 less and they allow to launch much faster 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.950
 the team to throw the shots is or the 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.470
 thrown forgiveness is much much more 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.990
 fast, this is also a new streak 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.370
 which it is an advantage that new forgiveness 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.770
 strong arm flame serves us to launch 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.930
 further the throwing knife or good 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.630
 or the grenades in general the whole team 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.340
 as he has a couple of other things that we 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.769
 allows to keep the grenades longer 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.390
 and return them more easily Well 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.459
 so I have this because at the time of 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.950
 throw the thrower so the best should 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:28.090
 reaching 5 meters and therefore reaches 7 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.890
 and then also the ram for 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.840
 retrieve them the throwing knife only 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.850
 recover one and if we do not have it and if 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.080
 we have one we have the option of 2 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.780
 throw with which I will mark 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.550
 now and we have 1 and we kill someone not 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.890
 is going to recover the second we have to 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.060
 base above so that you retrieve it and 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.950
 the truth is that it is a pretty bitch 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.570
 great of that but good that is going to 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.520
 I do it because it comes 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.260
 well and such and I do not find anything else that 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.930
 we can be more useful later also 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.540
 this temple is called when you fall 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.070
 on the ground you do not hurt yourself and finally 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.080
 arrives from above that usually demands what 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.520
 which is when you kill someone not 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.260
 will appear in the skull that appears 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.880
 always when you kill someone we will 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.950
 center behind the agent he can 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.300
 be quite useful and good to see is that 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.789
 some interesting advantages 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.979
 As you can see we have this player who is 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:16.180
 an advantage of a thor is already here of 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.880
 ping that killed someone and 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.530
 and it appears like a kind of people 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.720
 up close not not a kind of radar very 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.190
 very short but good has gone this and this 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.520
 that I guess and the probabilities of 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.560
 kill someone a stronger impact a 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.330
 critical impact as it will be called is 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.330
 more likely to finish the class 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.060
 anyway 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.230
 here was in fight the range to arrived 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.550
 specialist since I the first one took 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.760
 hard line 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.410
 lightweight or whatever is called agility of 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.690
 the uci that is to regenerate faster 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:56.730
 health in less red time and then the 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.210
 assistance to blindness tremor what 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.100
 I reduce 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.100
 and finally because it is not very good which 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:06.550
 take'm taking this land d 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.260
 the ghost and I also the elite 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.850
 Well when you already have some of 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.030
 these follow better can be curious then 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:15.010
 there is no and good for kids that 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.210
 has been all well explained more or less 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.830
 how does it work 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.660
 remember that I'm going to upload more videos of 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.790
 all this in plan explaining the best 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.300
 classes and all the fishing thanks and already 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.300
 see you later
