tech<00:02:21.640> done<00:02:21.850> on<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.330> it's<00:02:22.959> sort<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.319> evolved

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
tech done on it and it's sort of evolved

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.340 
tech done on it and it's sort of evolved
from<00:02:24.160> there<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.330> more<00:02:25.600> like<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:26.020> version

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
from there this is more like the version

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.080 
from there this is more like the version
that<00:02:26.380> got<00:02:26.590> run<00:02:26.770> last<00:02:27.160> week<00:02:27.459> in<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.850> Sydney

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090

5,000<00:02:28.750> except<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.200> differences<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:30.100> think

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
5,000 except the differences I think

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.730 
5,000 except the differences I think
expected<00:02:31.120> spectral<00:02:31.810> possession<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.350> insane

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
expected spectral possession is insane

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.800 
expected spectral possession is insane

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.930 
play against a very day I yeah there's
fairies<00:03:35.860> all<00:03:35.980> over<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.250> top<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.610> Swiss<00:03:36.790> is

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
fairies all over the top of the Swiss is

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.039 
fairies all over the top of the Swiss is
actually<00:03:37.180> kind<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:37.329> a<00:03:37.420> bad<00:03:37.540> break<00:03:37.720> for<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.900> so

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
actually kind of a bad break for you so

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.330 
actually kind of a bad break for you so
you<00:03:38.170> think<00:03:38.350> fairies<00:03:38.590> is<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.739> good<00:03:38.920> matchup<00:03:39.130> for

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
you think fairies is a good matchup for

you think fairies is a good matchup for
this<00:03:39.519> deck<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:39.970> think<00:03:40.900> it's<00:03:41.049> pretty<00:03:41.200> solid<00:03:41.380> I

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
this deck I think it's pretty solid I

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.930 
this deck I think it's pretty solid I
think<00:03:41.739> especially<00:03:41.860> like<00:03:42.430> if<00:03:42.579> you<00:03:42.670> can<00:03:42.790> get<00:03:42.910> a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
think especially like if you can get a

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.610 
think especially like if you can get a
turn<00:03:43.299> one<00:03:43.450> more<00:03:43.630> fanatic<00:03:44.049> out<00:03:44.200> you're<00:03:44.350> going<00:03:44.560> a

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
turn one more fanatic out you're going a

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.530 
turn one more fanatic out you're going a
long<00:03:44.769> way<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.010> winning<00:03:45.549> that<00:03:45.670> match<00:03:45.910> up<00:03:45.970> okay

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
long way to winning that match up okay

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.870 
long way to winning that match up okay
as<00:03:46.780> ridiculous<00:03:47.350> as<00:03:47.829> that<00:03:47.890> sounds<00:03:48.100> getting

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
as ridiculous as that sounds getting

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.870 
as ridiculous as that sounds getting
like<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.930> decent<00:03:50.560> one<00:03:50.680> drop<00:03:50.920> out<00:03:51.100> yeah<00:03:51.610> inner

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
like a decent one drop out yeah inner

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.069 
like a decent one drop out yeah inner

you<00:04:08.470> know<00:04:08.500> it's<00:04:08.890> really<00:04:09.190> really<00:04:09.520> going<00:04:09.730> to<00:04:09.820> be

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
you know it's really really going to be

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.730 
you know it's really really going to be
problematic<00:04:10.420> for<00:04:10.570> the<00:04:10.660> ferry<00:04:10.870> decks<00:04:11.170> so<00:04:11.500> I

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
problematic for the ferry decks so I

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.010 
problematic for the ferry decks so I
don't<00:04:12.670> think<00:04:12.790> that's<00:04:12.940> too<00:04:13.150> bad<00:04:13.330> and<00:04:13.690> then<00:04:13.900> it

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
don't think that's too bad and then it

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.300 
don't think that's too bad and then it
really<00:04:14.200> want<00:04:14.410> to<00:04:14.470> waste<00:04:14.560> their<00:04:14.800> removal<00:04:15.040> wanna
