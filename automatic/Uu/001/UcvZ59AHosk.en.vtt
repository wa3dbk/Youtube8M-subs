00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.860
 I can not overtake you more but this is 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.019
 a summary of more or less what 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.949
 they are going to see 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.550
 things with bare backs to the 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.550
 maximum 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:33.210
 much shine is night shoulders eighties 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:37.030
 Mine is a little woman deprived of that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.629
 black gold in winter 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.490
 at some point I have worked colors and 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.070
 I enjoy it 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:50.180
 last summer for example I had 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.060
 a lot of color but it always calls me the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.780
 attention the black much shine the night 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.530
 I am nocturnal and on the other hand the subject of 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.530
 shoulder pads 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:09.590
 I am eighties that I can tell you with 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.160
 very much the dni in the cotton the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.480
 I use a lot of shirts 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.130
 Peruvian cotton 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.800
 unfortunately in my brand I do not use 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.400
 Peruvian inputs 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:29.740
 but for a simple reason because Peru 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.740
 produces flat woven cottons of ning 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.710
 and that kind of thing 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.440
 in my case I work with 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.510
 of the European ones because they are the ones 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.380
 make 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:51.350
 living brocades is lace weaves in 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.350
 silk that does not produce peru 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.960
 we have the main store that 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.049
 it's the original little one the block 5 of 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.340
 conquerors it seems that we are in a 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.700
 process of expanding it grow we have it 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.750

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:17.530

 page on facebook with almost 14 thousand fans 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.040
