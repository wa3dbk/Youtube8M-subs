00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.670
 I had the opportunity to also be 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.170
 the first generations are some 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.450
 assignments that were consolidated in the 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.820
 formation of dynamics not in 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.090
 colleges science humanities in a 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.660
 school on the other hand Marist let's say 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:27.289
 that contrasted the training 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.930
 free and autonomous self-training but 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.420
 in a field on the other hand also more 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.150
 rigorous 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.230
 I did my exam for college 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.610
 nationally and timely 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.660
 you can enter it 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.280
 I took my professional information here 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.950
 it was a professional training that 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.380
 It greatly enriched for me this stage of 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.620
 life is this time of mid 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.870
 the 80's allowed us this generation 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.870
 to live a very different school we are 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.640
 sitting in an intermediate impass that was 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.120
 let's say what they give as spirit and 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.250
 large separation 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.950
 Y 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.140
 begin those of the seventies against the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.840
 recreation and self - government movement 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.479
 separation from school and when I 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.750
 I start studying school 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.850
 began the practicing planning 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.120
 when I was studying I started school 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.210
 of urbanism 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.970
 when I was also in the studies 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.530
 the landscape school then in a few 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.140
 words 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.690
 what I think it was our turn to 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.560
 generation and be part of the birth of 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.560
 what is today 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.260
 a faculty very different from what I've 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.299
 been and is a faculty that today has 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.110
 is this new conformation after 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.560
 twenty 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.870
 what happened to me happened to me I know what happens to them 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.690
 to many of the students today 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.370
 that the culture graduates us and we go out to 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.370
 professional world and the field the 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.530
 audience and now that is and for me is 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.720
 teamwork has been a very part 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.750
 important of what is my philosophy 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.250
 from school and nvidia 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.910
 and in the professional life the same thing happened 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.550
 I partnered with two of my colleagues with 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.830
 the thesis we started a small office 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.050
 in the colony joke 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.500
 and that's where my professional life began 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.580
 for about 15 years I was very 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.070
 involved in different typologies 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.230
 architectural and at the same time in others 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.910
 areas of mobility also the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.530
 terrestrial mobility that has been one of 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.500
 the subjects that I have been passionate about 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.489
 recent years what has allowed me is 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.080
 On the one hand, compensating what is the 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.920
 professional work that is also 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.200
 fundamental towards also spilling 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.090
 part of this training towards asia the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.690
 teaching part and practically since 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.690
 grows I made the decision to 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.420
 to participate in college and I started 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.920
 from the lower parts as an adjunct 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.820
 of several teachers who were also 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.760
 extraordinary 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.500
 I had the opportunity to develop 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.500
 and examination of position of the table 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.600
 subject matter and water are practically 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.770
 23 years without involvement with the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.660
 university that was sometimes deeper 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.660
 first he was as coordinator of the level 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.870
 I was invited by a group of teachers 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.150
 from a workshop to participate in the election 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.320
 for workshop coordinator I received the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.480
 invitation from the architect 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.170
 also to be part of your 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.640
 coordination team bonding 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.950
 of the part of the second period 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.120
 allowed to take the secretary 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.120
 of the technical council of the faculty 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.020
 the address does not mean being in the 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:53.840
 head but propose to the cloister to all 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.569
 the community that way 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.190
 to carry in that sense what is the 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.800
 path is a path that helps us 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.599
 pick up part of some values ​​that is 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.940
 enjoy views are lost in a 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.489
 very delicate balance that should be 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.989
 base ruled in response the 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.239
 importance the fiber units before 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.540
 but also in the sciences and 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.709
 technologies in practice and in 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.949
 social sciences more and more 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.670
 and this part has come together unbalanced 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:26.360
 we 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.160
 our school has forgotten a little is 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.400
 that presence in this need to 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.500
 approaching the practical exercise a 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.390
 symptom of this is the lack by 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.490
 example laboratories practical workshops 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.630
 didactic laboratory and if there have been 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.510
 a 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.150
 I do not forget a way of relegating 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.010
 scientific technical training but that is 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.050
 part of what you have to take back and that's 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.640
 part of what what 60 my proposal 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.560
 of work in the transmission of 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.390
 2000 knowledge if the part is treated 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.420
 more important and here is a challenge 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.420
 important enrollment growth 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.420
 as 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.710
 with few resources attend to this 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.020
 amount of population keeping the 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.139
 standards and parameters of care 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.840
 we have resources and how can we go 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.659
 resolving them equally in 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.860
 all schools without distinction the 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:22.560
 The main objective is to have a series of 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.700
 quality professional programs for 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.650
 I had more teachers 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.570
 I think the priority is in 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.880
 conclude the modification processes to 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.350
 the study plans 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.510
 of architecture degree 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.280
 we must also rush the confusion of 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.580
 the plans of 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.330
 the landscape the same happens in the 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.520
 plans programs 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.039
 programs in architecture and humanism 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.830
 postgraduate our obligation that's not what 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:55.500
 we can lose sight of and it is to form 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:57.969
 trained professionals aware 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.400
 aware of the impacts that 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.500
 we cause society and how is it 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.140
 we interact with him 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.710
 and to come out especially with this one 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.040
 balanced preparation 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.240
 that we leave with this possibility d 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.080
 to perform 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.729
 in any of the lines 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.099
 occasional 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:22.259
 what you have to do is redefine the 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.629
 direction of the research lines of 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.909
 way to address issues that are today 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:28.620
 current tables that are current and 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:30.089
 issues that are necessary to address 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.099
 since we have to keep doing 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:33.569
 historical research of course 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:36.300
 connectivity is an investigation of 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:38.339
 others but the reyno here is like 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.360
 we enter these other fields of 

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:43.349
 initiation of 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.349
 and we approach them
