the<00:00:06.180> young<00:00:06.390> horse<00:00:06.919> to<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.309> sitting<00:00:08.610> trot<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
the young horse to the sitting trot the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.759 
the young horse to the sitting trot the
biggest<00:00:09.809> mistake<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.139> most<00:00:10.410> people<00:00:10.559> make

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
biggest mistake that most people make

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.610 
biggest mistake that most people make
with<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.150> they<00:00:12.330> sit<00:00:12.630> too<00:00:12.900> long<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.530> young

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
with this is they sit too long the young

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.589 
with this is they sit too long the young
horses<00:00:13.860> backs<00:00:14.190> take<00:00:14.460> quite<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.759> while<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.269> form

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
horses backs take quite a while to form

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.230 
horses backs take quite a while to form
and<00:00:15.870> if<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.470> just<00:00:16.619> drop<00:00:17.039> your<00:00:17.070> stirrups<00:00:17.880> as<00:00:18.060> so

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
and if you just drop your stirrups as so

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.779 
and if you just drop your stirrups as so
many<00:00:18.420> people<00:00:18.630> like<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.920> will<00:00:20.100> probably

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
many people like to do you will probably

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.220 
many people like to do you will probably
end<00:00:20.939> up<00:00:21.119> hollowing<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.630> back<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> horse

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
end up hollowing the back of the horse

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.359 
end up hollowing the back of the horse
because<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> horse<00:00:22.680> won't<00:00:22.800> be<00:00:22.949> able<00:00:23.100> to

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
because the horse won't be able to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.340 
because the horse won't be able to
sustain<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.510> your<00:00:24.600> first<00:00:24.810> beginning

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
sustain it so in your first beginning

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.109 
sustain it so in your first beginning
the<00:00:25.769> sitting<00:00:26.070> trot<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> horse<00:00:26.760> what<00:00:27.000> you

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the sitting trot on a horse what you

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.580 
the sitting trot on a horse what you
want<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.539> get<00:00:27.720> them<00:00:27.869> into<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> stretch

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
want to do is get them into the stretch

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.700 
want to do is get them into the stretch
and<00:00:28.859> then<00:00:29.099> sit<00:00:29.609> only<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.140> stretch<00:00:31.439> this

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and then sit only in the stretch this

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.319 
and then sit only in the stretch this
teaches<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> rider<00:00:32.430> independence<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.300> well

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
teaches the rider independence as well

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.600 
teaches the rider independence as well
so<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.079> Sarah<00:00:34.350> my<00:00:34.739> student<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.130> doing<00:00:35.280> here

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
so as Sarah my student is doing here

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.250 
so as Sarah my student is doing here
this<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> horse<00:00:36.450> that's<00:00:36.600> only<00:00:36.750> had<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> few

this is a horse that's only had a few

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
this is a horse that's only had a few
weeks<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.770> dressage<00:00:38.280> training<00:00:38.460> has<00:00:39.120> learned

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
weeks of dressage training has learned

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.299 
weeks of dressage training has learned
to<00:00:39.540> stretch<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.710> get<00:00:40.800> us<00:00:40.920> back<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.219> the

to stretch and can get us back in the
right<00:00:41.399> place<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.670> she<00:00:41.850> takes<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.270> moment<00:00:42.420> till

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
right place so she takes a moment till

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.600 
right place so she takes a moment till
she<00:00:43.230> gets<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.620> horse<00:00:43.770> into<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> stretch<00:00:44.340> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
up where it can sustain the weight of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.250 
up where it can sustain the weight of
the<00:01:00.090> rider<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.570> she's<00:01:00.719> gonna<00:01:00.870> sit<00:01:01.109> three

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
strides again and then again she starts

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.020 
strides again and then again she starts
to<00:01:03.329> rise<00:01:03.510> when<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.589> correct<00:01:05.159> our<00:01:05.430> goal<00:01:05.729> is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
to rise when it is correct our goal is

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.030 
to rise when it is correct our goal is
to<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.390> no<00:01:06.630> change<00:01:07.020> between<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.650> sitting<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
to see no change between the sitting and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.399 
to see no change between the sitting and
rising<00:01:08.430> trot<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.240> often<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.720> dressage<00:01:09.869> today

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
rising trot so often in dressage today

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.899 
rising trot so often in dressage today
we<00:01:10.590> see<00:01:10.740> people<00:01:10.920> rise<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.460> trot<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.790> soon

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
we see people rise in the trot as soon

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.490 
we see people rise in the trot as soon
as<00:01:12.000> they<00:01:12.090> sit<00:01:12.150> they<00:01:12.510> shortened<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> gates<00:01:13.320> of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
as they sit they shortened the gates of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.410 
as they sit they shortened the gates of
the<00:01:13.590> horse<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.369> will<00:01:14.610> ruin<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.090> horse's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the horse that will ruin the horse's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300 
the horse that will ruin the horse's
gait<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.259> learn<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.590> sit<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.040> real

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
gait so we have to learn to sit to real

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.789 
gait so we have to learn to sit to real
true<00:01:17.700> working<00:01:18.180> gates<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:19.080> best<00:01:19.290> way<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.470> do<00:01:19.680> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
true working gates the best way to do it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.039 
true working gates the best way to do it
even<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> rider<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.090> introduce<00:01:21.299> your

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
even for the rider is to introduce your

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
even for the rider is to introduce your
strides<00:01:22.409> at<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> time<00:01:22.920> instead<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.640> idea<00:01:23.909> of

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
strides at a time instead of the idea of

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.340 
strides at a time instead of the idea of
dropping<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> stirrups<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.869> sitting<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
dropping the stirrups and sitting for a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.380 
dropping the stirrups and sitting for a
half<00:01:25.530> an<00:01:25.619> hour<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.950> time<00:01:26.130> which<00:01:26.850> will<00:01:27.030> ruin<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
half an hour of time which will ruin the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.819 
half an hour of time which will ruin the
horse's<00:01:27.780> back<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.619> we'll<00:01:28.710> also

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
horse's back and we'll also

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.789 
horse's back and we'll also
interestingly<00:01:29.790> enough<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:31.259> create<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> lot<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
interestingly enough can create a lot of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.399 
interestingly enough can create a lot of
damage<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> riders<00:01:33.210> back<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
damage to the riders back is that the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.899 
damage to the riders back is that the
