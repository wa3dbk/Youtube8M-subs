hey guys so today what I want to work on

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.500 
hey guys so today what I want to work on
is<00:00:05.750> some<00:00:06.750> small<00:00:06.870> basis<00:00:07.290> for<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.760> blood<00:00:09.179> angels

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
is some small basis for the blood angels

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.820 
is some small basis for the blood angels
tactical<00:00:10.110> Marines<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:10.469> I'm<00:00:10.559> going<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.740> be

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
tactical Marines that I'm going to be

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.129 
tactical Marines that I'm going to be
doing<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.340> speed<00:00:11.700> painting<00:00:11.880> video<00:00:12.210> that

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
doing in the speed painting video that

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.450 
doing in the speed painting video that
you<00:00:13.290> will<00:00:13.559> probably<00:00:13.799> see<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.130> next<00:00:14.219> couple

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
you will probably see in the next couple

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.570 
you will probably see in the next couple
of<00:00:14.610> days<00:00:14.929> but<00:00:15.929> I'd<00:00:16.350> like<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.590> specifically<00:00:17.310> use

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
of days but I'd like to specifically use

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.700 
of days but I'd like to specifically use
some<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.910> these<00:00:18.029> base<00:00:18.449> craft<00:00:18.690> materials<00:00:19.199> that

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
some of these base craft materials that

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.170 
some of these base craft materials that
I<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:20.130> picked<00:00:20.310> up<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.910> might<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.090> seen

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
I just picked up you might have seen

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.790 
I just picked up you might have seen
those<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.600> other<00:00:21.900> video<00:00:22.170> where<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.650> was

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
those in the other video where I was

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.080 
those in the other video where I was
showing<00:00:22.920> off<00:00:23.039> some<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> stuff<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.640> had

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
showing off some of the stuff I had

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.349 
showing off some of the stuff I had
picked<00:00:24.300> up<00:00:24.420> from<00:00:24.539> them<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:26.119> mostly<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.210> think

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
picked up from them and mostly I think

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.529 
picked up from them and mostly I think
we're<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.750> use<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.439> rock<00:00:29.099> debris<00:00:29.539> stuff

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
we're going to use the rock debris stuff

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.450 
we're going to use the rock debris stuff
and<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:31.140> actually<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.529> really<00:00:31.769> nice<00:00:31.949> mix<00:00:32.309> of

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
and it's actually a really nice mix of

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.510 
and it's actually a really nice mix of
some<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> finer<00:00:34.050> stuff<00:00:34.770> down<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:35.309> as

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
some of the finer stuff down here as

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
some of the finer stuff down here as
well<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.180> some<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> larger<00:00:36.809> rocks<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.200> here

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
well as some of the larger rocks up here

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.740 
well as some of the larger rocks up here
so<00:00:37.829> that'll<00:00:38.100> give<00:00:38.219> us<00:00:38.329> some<00:00:39.329> interesting

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
so that'll give us some interesting

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.959 
so that'll give us some interesting
textural<00:00:40.140> differences<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.280> also<00:00:41.430> really

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
textural differences and I also really

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.810 
textural differences and I also really
love<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.870> leaves<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.860> they've<00:00:44.010> got<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.550> I'm

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
love the leaves that they've got so I'm

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.420 
love the leaves that they've got so I'm
thinking<00:00:45.120> sort<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.680> dried-up<00:00:46.680> drought

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
thinking sort of a dried-up drought

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.850 
thinking sort of a dried-up drought
wasteland<00:00:48.270> sort<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.989> appearance<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.680> we're

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
wasteland sort of appearance so we're

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.470 
wasteland sort of appearance so we're
mostly<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.340> using<00:00:50.520> these<00:00:50.700> may<00:00:51.449> be

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
mostly going to be using these may be

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.330 
mostly going to be using these may be
some<00:00:51.960> little<00:00:52.140> tiny<00:00:52.379> Tufts<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.770> grass<00:00:52.829> here

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
some little tiny Tufts of grass here

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
some little tiny Tufts of grass here
there<00:00:54.800> but<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.129> think<00:00:56.430> these<00:00:56.579> two<00:00:56.850> will<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.180> our

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
there but I think these two will be our

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.090 
there but I think these two will be our
main<00:00:57.899> parts<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.660> we'll<00:01:00.770> we'll<00:01:01.770> start<00:01:02.010> with

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
main parts and we'll we'll start with

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.920 
main parts and we'll we'll start with
that<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.520> what<00:01:03.059> we're<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.420> first<00:01:03.660> is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that so what we're going to do first is

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.359 
that so what we're going to do first is
we're<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.010> take<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.939> base<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.369> I'm

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
we're going to take the base and I'm

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.020 
we're going to take the base and I'm
actually<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.760> break<00:01:09.030> out<00:01:10.760> some<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.909> this

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
actually going to break out some of this

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.620 
actually going to break out some of this
onto<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.950> sheet<00:01:14.220> here<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.210> here<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.479> go

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
onto a little sheet here so here we go

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.020 
onto a little sheet here so here we go
I've<00:01:15.840> poured<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> contents<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.340> rock

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
I've poured out the contents of the rock

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.050 
I've poured out the contents of the rock
debris<00:01:18.270> pot<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.890> could<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.880> can

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
debris pot just so that we could we can

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.969 
debris pot just so that we could we can
more<00:01:21.390> easily<00:01:21.420> access<00:01:22.229> some<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> different

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
more easily access some of the different

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.820 
more easily access some of the different
layers<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:24.140> rock<00:01:25.140> debris<00:01:25.350> that's<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.710> there

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
layers of rock debris that's in there

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.590 
layers of rock debris that's in there
we've<00:01:25.950> got<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.310> really<00:01:26.670> large<00:01:26.850> stones<00:01:27.299> we've

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
we've got the really large stones we've

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.390 
we've got the really large stones we've
got<00:01:27.720> some<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.020> medium<00:01:28.439> sized<00:01:28.650> stones<00:01:28.950> here

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
got some of the medium sized stones here

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.190 
got some of the medium sized stones here
mo<00:01:29.520> get<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.790> really<00:01:29.970> fine<00:01:30.360> debris<00:01:30.750> up<00:01:30.900> here

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
mo get this really fine debris up here

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.990 
mo get this really fine debris up here
so<00:01:31.799> we're<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.220> using<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.549> mixture<00:01:32.880> of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
so we're going to be using a mixture of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.240 
so we're going to be using a mixture of
that<00:01:33.210> when<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> power<00:01:34.590> hour<00:01:34.829> base

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
that when we we do a power hour base

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.940 
that when we we do a power hour base
closer<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> edge<00:01:38.670> okay<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.170> I'm<00:01:40.770> just

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
closer to the edge okay so I'm just

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.499 
closer to the edge okay so I'm just
going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.130> use<00:01:41.369> some<00:01:41.790> CA<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:44.509> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
going to use some CA for this now you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.330 
going to use some CA for this now you
guys<00:01:45.600> don't<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.170> use<00:01:46.350> CA<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.220> use

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
guys don't have to use CA you can use

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.139 
guys don't have to use CA you can use
PVA<00:01:48.350> CA<00:01:49.350> being<00:01:49.680> saina<00:01:50.189> acrylate<00:01:50.759> which<00:01:50.970> is

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
PVA CA being saina acrylate which is

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.270 
PVA CA being saina acrylate which is
super<00:01:51.600> glue<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.619> happen<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.070> lot

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
super glue I just happen to have a lot

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.480 
super glue I just happen to have a lot
of<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
of it and

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.910 
of it and
won't<00:01:54.729> work<00:01:54.820> quickly<00:01:55.119> here<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.500> we're<00:01:56.829> going

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
won't work quickly here so we're going

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.520 
won't work quickly here so we're going
to<00:01:57.040> using<00:01:57.220> this<00:01:57.310> because<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.640> sets<00:01:58.530> just

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
to using this because it sets just

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.600 
to using this because it sets just
instantly<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:02.070> i'm<00:02:03.070> just<00:02:03.310> going<00:02:03.430> to<00:02:03.460> use<00:02:03.580> a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
instantly so and i'm just going to use a

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.370 
instantly so and i'm just going to use a
little<00:02:03.700> piece<00:02:04.000> of<00:02:04.060> plastic<00:02:04.570> here<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.899> make

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
little piece of plastic here to make

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.270 
little piece of plastic here to make
sure<00:02:05.409> it<00:02:05.619> comes<00:02:05.710> way<00:02:06.100> out<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.430> edges<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
sure it comes way out to the edges and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:22.080 
sure it comes way out to the edges and
what<00:02:12.849> i'm<00:02:12.910> going<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.060> do<00:02:13.209> is<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:21.580> cover<00:02:21.910> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
what i'm going to do is just cover the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.400 
what i'm going to do is just cover the
base<00:02:22.269> some<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.440> finer<00:02:24.190> stuff<00:02:24.519> here<00:02:25.410> maybe

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
base some of the finer stuff here maybe

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:39.360 
base some of the finer stuff here maybe
stick<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.769> large<00:02:27.610> rock<00:02:27.880> in<00:02:28.120> there

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.059 

all<00:02:40.030> right<00:02:40.500> going<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.560> hit<00:02:41.620> this<00:02:41.799> with<00:02:41.980> a

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
all right going to hit this with a

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.690 
all right going to hit this with a
little<00:02:42.220> bit<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.400> accelerator<00:02:47.310> should<00:02:48.310> set<00:02:48.670> it

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
little bit of accelerator should set it

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.490 
little bit of accelerator should set it
up<00:02:48.879> nice<00:02:49.569> and<00:02:49.599> quick<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.840> I've<00:02:52.930> coded<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.319> base

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
up nice and quick so I've coded the base

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.899 
up nice and quick so I've coded the base
in<00:02:53.799> a<00:02:53.920> brown<00:02:54.190> spray<00:02:54.670> paint<00:02:54.970> as<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.780> primer<00:02:56.200> layer

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
in a brown spray paint as a primer layer

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.660 
in a brown spray paint as a primer layer
this<00:02:57.909> is<00:02:58.090> not<00:02:58.269> special<00:02:59.170> paint<00:02:59.980> by<00:03:00.190> any<00:03:00.519> stretch

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
this is not special paint by any stretch

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.280 
this is not special paint by any stretch
of<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.909> imagination<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.720> just<00:03:01.959> standard

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
of the imagination it's just standard

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.270 
of the imagination it's just standard
stuff<00:03:02.530> from<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.890> hardware<00:03:03.129> store

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.320 

so<00:03:07.280> now<00:03:07.430> we're<00:03:07.670> going<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.880> do<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:07.970> little<00:03:08.030> bit<00:03:08.270> of

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
so now we're going to do a little bit of

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.690 
so now we're going to do a little bit of
dry<00:03:08.540> brush<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:08.900> here<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.550> we're<00:03:10.550> going<00:03:10.670> to

touch of skull white into the mix we're

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.980 
touch of skull white into the mix we're
going<00:04:23.730> to<00:04:23.820> go<00:04:23.880> for<00:04:24.120> one<00:04:24.380> final<00:04:25.380> light<00:04:25.950> pass

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
base that we want those grass spots to

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.610 
base that we want those grass spots to
land<00:04:51.470> and<00:04:52.450> to<00:04:53.450> help<00:04:53.600> us<00:04:53.720> do<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:53.900> we've<00:04:54.410> got<00:04:54.440> a

land and to help us do that we've got a

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.530 
land and to help us do that we've got a
piece<00:04:54.950> of<00:04:54.980> plastic<00:04:55.430> card<00:04:55.640> that<00:04:56.030> we've<00:04:56.300> put

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
piece of plastic card that we've put

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.150 
piece of plastic card that we've put
glue<00:04:56.930> on<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.170> end<00:04:57.200> of<00:04:57.560> and<00:04:57.830> it's<00:04:57.980> going<00:04:58.100> to

to go back to the pot of meadow grass
with<00:05:17.870> a<00:05:17.900> pair<00:05:18.080> of<00:05:18.110> tweezers<00:05:18.410> and<00:05:18.830> we're<00:05:19.280> just

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
with a pair of tweezers and we're just

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.390 
with a pair of tweezers and we're just
going<00:05:19.520> to<00:05:19.550> grab<00:05:19.700> little<00:05:20.330> Tufts<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.400> we're

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
going to grab little Tufts and we're

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.240 
going to grab little Tufts and we're
going<00:05:22.550> to<00:05:23.650> drop<00:05:24.650> those<00:05:24.890> into<00:05:24.950> place<00:05:27.130> you<00:05:28.130> can

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
going to drop those into place you can

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.040 
going to drop those into place you can
also<00:05:28.400> get<00:05:28.760> larger<00:05:29.210> tough<00:05:29.390> since<00:05:29.600> it's<00:05:29.810> sort<00:05:29.930> of

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
also get larger tough since it's sort of

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.420 
also get larger tough since it's sort of
data<00:05:30.290> at<00:05:30.470> it<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:30.680> the<00:05:30.770> glue<00:05:30.950> will<00:05:31.070> take<00:05:31.250> what

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
data at it and the glue will take what

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:39.810 
data at it and the glue will take what
it<00:05:31.520> wants

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.420 

you

so<00:05:45.430> here<00:05:45.639> we<00:05:45.760> are<00:05:45.940> got<00:05:46.690> the<00:05:46.870> Tufts<00:05:47.350> of<00:05:47.470> grass

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
so here we are got the Tufts of grass

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.060 
so here we are got the Tufts of grass
down<00:05:48.480> sort<00:05:49.480> of<00:05:49.630> push<00:05:50.020> those<00:05:50.230> into<00:05:50.590> the<00:05:50.620> final

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
down sort of push those into the final

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.720 
down sort of push those into the final
position<00:05:54.780> now<00:05:55.780> the<00:05:56.290> same<00:05:56.500> plastic<00:05:57.160> card<00:05:57.490> trick

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730
