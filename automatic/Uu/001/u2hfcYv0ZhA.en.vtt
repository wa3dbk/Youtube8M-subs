00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.789 
so I'm going to leave that in there for
about<00:01:53.130> another<00:01:53.369> 30<00:01:53.820> seconds<00:01:54.359> just<00:01:54.450> to

minutes<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.049> that's<00:02:22.739> now<00:02:22.980> come<00:02:23.220> out<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.519> oven

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
minutes so that's now come out the oven

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.830

beautifully<00:02:24.780> cooked<00:02:25.549> I'm<00:02:26.549> just<00:02:26.849> going<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.150> cut

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
beautifully cooked I'm just going to cut

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.199 
beautifully cooked I'm just going to cut
it<00:02:28.019> on<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> angle<00:02:28.910> because<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:29.970> think<00:02:30.030> it

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
it on the angle because I think it

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.479 
it on the angle because I think it
presents<00:02:30.329> nicer<00:02:31.040> I've<00:02:32.040> just<00:02:32.220> got<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> little

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
presents nicer I've just got a little

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.150 
presents nicer I've just got a little
bit<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.819> red<00:02:33.540> cabbage<00:02:33.780> here<00:02:34.200> just<00:02:34.829> for<00:02:34.980> color

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
bit of red cabbage here just for color

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.309 
bit of red cabbage here just for color
so<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.760> think<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.000> looks<00:02:36.180> nicer<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:37.110> I'm<00:02:37.200> going

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
so I think it looks nicer so I'm going

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.380 
so I think it looks nicer so I'm going
to<00:02:37.349> plate<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.590> up<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.329> is<00:02:39.540> how<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.739> cook

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
to plate that up and that is how to cook

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.349 
to plate that up and that is how to cook
deer<00:02:42.390> or<00:02:42.629> venison<00:02:43.079> steak
