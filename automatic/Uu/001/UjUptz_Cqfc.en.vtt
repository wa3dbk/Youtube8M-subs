three<00:01:26.230> six<00:01:28.960> we<00:01:29.960> gonna<00:01:30.140> say<00:01:30.440> flat

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.580

three<00:01:46.070> three<00:01:49.220> flat<00:01:50.220> for

flat<00:01:54.110> 6<00:01:55.750> 6

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.900 

everybody<00:02:13.290> think<00:02:13.500> about<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.450> and

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
everybody think about that one and

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.550 
everybody think about that one and
that's<00:02:17.910> flat<00:02:18.239> fire

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.640 

and<00:02:21.860> that's<00:02:22.480> flat<00:02:23.480> file<00:02:23.720> could<00:02:23.930> do<00:02:24.140> five<00:02:24.470> you

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
and that's flat file could do five you

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.309 
and that's flat file could do five you
flatter<00:02:24.980> that's<00:02:25.340> 4<00:02:25.490> 5<00:02:25.760> flat<00:02:26.600> 6<00:02:26.840> because<00:02:27.170> that's

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
flatter that's 4 5 flat 6 because that's

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.040 
flatter that's 4 5 flat 6 because that's
what<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.560> cigs<00:02:27.770> not<00:02:28.010> flat<00:02:28.300> so<00:02:29.300> that's<00:02:29.840> why<00:02:30.020> I

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
what the cigs not flat so that's why I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:42.970 
what the cigs not flat so that's why I
got<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:33.040> 3<00:02:34.040> flat<00:02:34.819> 5<00:02:35.060> flat<00:02:35.660> 6<00:02:41.470> straight<00:02:42.470> so

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
got the 3 flat 5 flat 6 straight so

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.890 
got the 3 flat 5 flat 6 straight so
number<00:02:43.280> wise<00:02:43.540> 1<00:02:44.540> 7<00:02:45.470> 2<00:02:46.190> 6<00:02:46.790> 5

number wise 1 7 2 6 5

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.300 
number wise 1 7 2 6 5
that's<00:02:48.140> 4<00:02:48.470> times<00:02:49.330> 3<00:02:50.330> 3<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:51.020> a<00:02:51.410> half<00:02:51.620> because<00:02:51.890> on

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
that's 4 times 3 3 and a half because on

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:22.130 
that's 4 times 3 3 and a half because on
the<00:02:52.790> 4th<00:02:53.209> one

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.160 

number-wise<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.560> can<00:03:24.010> help<00:03:24.190> you<00:03:25.140> hope<00:03:26.140> that
