00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.120
 everyone is very happy to have a very happy ending 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.389
 The longer the game Switzerland vs Turkey he wants to see 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.199
 I am convinced we are highly motivated and full throttle 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.699
 both would use last chance to pocket quarterfinal I 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.470
 personally see Black or a little bit away I am 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.199
 one hundred percent too 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.259
 Pretoria that's like fry fat 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.939
 Ulrich Thamer Clinics Schwartzel himself 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.740
 enforce and the intrigues of the investment scoreless from this trio the big question 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.500
 yes, who replaces the injured question and now reinforced by their own 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.740
 Fans booed Georg r 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.980
 there is still a 20-year-old who will be allowed to do so 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.630
 Forgot that the Swiss did not really unhappy the first game 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.469
 lost we are the better team 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.649
 Sick leave due to the problems of the city Sandstorm they become 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.350
 win the game 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.839
 the Dieter and 2 0 even 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.929
 sometimes we fold the cart 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.020
 the trend in the browser 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.670
 still a bit more expensive 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.630
 the transfer market again moderate 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.650
 Tommy Haas de s 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.920
 2 c minor 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.620
 Many Thanks 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.410
 Shots initially fell as he does not regret 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.970
 which have problems 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.930
 9 I am fine 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.930
 many do not even hope so bad 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.270
 that was the reason 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.230
 small teams a story is an e-mail get when a accompany 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.650
 the approach wants to re-create the fears for the number 1 again 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.590
 allowed to drive 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.680
 but Kati therefore did not run perfectly he is in an impact 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.160
 represent 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.729
 from there to any place possible 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.549
 bitter that we have the video and publish like a new video with 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.910
 good arguments 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.560
 because we really want to get ahead 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.500
 like to remember 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.070
 if the woods deliver some good arguments throughout his team 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.699
 Oh that's it
