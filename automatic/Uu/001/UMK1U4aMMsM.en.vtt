results<00:01:46.319> so<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.069> best<00:01:47.279> to<00:01:47.369> experiment<00:01:47.999> at

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
results so it's best to experiment at

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.269 
results so it's best to experiment at
first<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.139> is<00:01:49.289> worth<00:01:49.529> checking<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:50.039> as

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:50.279 
first but it is worth checking out as
