00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
don't know if I'll ever even do a

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.770 
don't know if I'll ever even do a
different<00:00:11.370> game<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.910> isn't<00:00:12.179> modern<00:00:12.570> warfare

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
different game that isn't modern warfare

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.530 
different game that isn't modern warfare
2<00:00:13.110> maybe<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.309> next<00:00:14.460> call<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.969> duty<00:00:15.240> games<00:00:15.420> that

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
2 maybe the next call of duty games that

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.230 
2 maybe the next call of duty games that
comes<00:00:15.719> out<00:00:15.920> most<00:00:16.920> likely<00:00:17.130> that'll<00:00:17.820> be<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.060> or

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
comes out most likely that'll be it or

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.960 
comes out most likely that'll be it or
maybe<00:00:19.140> I'll<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> let's<00:00:19.680> play<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.250> some

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
maybe I'll do a let's play on some

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.599 
maybe I'll do a let's play on some
random<00:00:21.180> game<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.960> pick<00:00:22.350> up<00:00:22.500> anyways<00:00:23.430> this

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
random game that I pick up anyways this

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.550 
random game that I pick up anyways this
is<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.850> domination<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.779> Seatown<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:27.560> most

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
is a domination on Seatown and most

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.990 
is a domination on Seatown and most
people<00:00:28.680> play<00:00:28.980> domination<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
people play domination just for the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.810 
people play domination just for the
kills<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.769> it's<00:00:31.769> always<00:00:31.920> been<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
kills and it's always been like that and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.729 
kills and it's always been like that and
I<00:00:33.059> guess<00:00:33.360> Infinity<00:00:33.840> Ward<00:00:34.020> thought<00:00:34.230> hey<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.440> we

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
I guess Infinity Ward thought hey if we

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.000 
I guess Infinity Ward thought hey if we
introduce<00:00:35.309> point<00:00:35.579> streaks<00:00:36.590> people<00:00:37.590> will<00:00:37.860> go

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
introduce point streaks people will go

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.139 
introduce point streaks people will go
for<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.250> flags<00:00:38.489> because<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.940> will<00:00:39.030> count

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
for the flags because it will count

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.850 
for the flags because it will count
towards<00:00:39.480> their<00:00:39.690> kill<00:00:40.079> streaks<00:00:40.350> or<00:00:40.559> point

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
towards their kill streaks or point

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.100 
towards their kill streaks or point
streaks<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.250> they'll<00:00:41.430> get<00:00:41.670> cool<00:00:42.059> stuff<00:00:42.360> by

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
streaks and they'll get cool stuff by

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.940 
streaks and they'll get cool stuff by
unlocking<00:00:43.530> more<00:00:43.980> point<00:00:44.789> streaks<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.960> yeah<00:00:46.920> I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
unlocking more point streaks but yeah I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.590 
unlocking more point streaks but yeah I
guess<00:00:47.219> that's<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.520> case<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> little<00:00:48.180> bit<00:00:48.329> but

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
guess that's the case a little bit but

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.740 
guess that's the case a little bit but
even<00:00:49.530> even<00:00:49.890> still<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.000> still<00:00:51.180> played<00:00:51.570> just

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
even even still it's still played just

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.410 
even even still it's still played just
mostly<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.350> kills<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.860> if<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.149> saw<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
mostly for kills and if you saw on the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.740 
mostly for kills and if you saw on the
beginning<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.899> captured<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> flag<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:56.010> 40

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
beginning I captured the flag just 40

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.939 
beginning I captured the flag just 40
because<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:58.020> already<00:00:58.199> there<00:00:58.469> no<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.800> was

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
because it was already there no one was

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.069 
because it was already there no one was
around<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.670> mainly<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.020> can

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
around but I mainly do it just so I can

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.799 
around but I mainly do it just so I can
get<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> point<00:01:01.500> trick<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.010> mean<00:01:02.210> even<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.600> lose

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
get a point trick I mean even if we lose

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.320 
get a point trick I mean even if we lose
I<00:01:04.260> still<00:01:04.559> most<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.640> time<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.060> play

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
I still most of the time when we play

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.630 
I still most of the time when we play
domination<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.990> our<00:01:07.260> team<00:01:07.409> loses<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.979> still

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
domination and our team loses I still

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.940 
domination and our team loses I still
have<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> most<00:01:09.000> points<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> hole

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
have the most points out of the hole

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.289 
have the most points out of the hole
everyone<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> leader<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.729> lobby

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
everyone in the leader of the lobby

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.020 
everyone in the leader of the lobby
because<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.040> get<00:01:14.159> high<00:01:14.490> amounts<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
because I like to get high amounts of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.859 
because I like to get high amounts of
kills<00:01:16.220> which<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> no-no<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.659> right<00:01:18.840> now

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
kills which is a no-no see right now

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.960 
kills which is a no-no see right now
we're<00:01:19.049> being<00:01:19.170> totally<00:01:19.500> dominated<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.189> I'm

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
we're being totally dominated and I'm

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.480 
we're being totally dominated and I'm
just<00:01:21.240> not<00:01:21.420> even<00:01:21.659> caring<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.770> kills<00:01:23.220> is

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
just not even caring because kills is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.870 
just not even caring because kills is
where<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.659> flew<00:01:24.869> off<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
where it's at like I just flew off and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.249 
where it's at like I just flew off and
