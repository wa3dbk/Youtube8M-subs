00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
forward in moves forwards etc but for

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.370 
forward in moves forwards etc but for
now<00:01:13.470> we're<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.800> turn<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.280> off<00:01:15.380> so

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
now we're going to turn that one off so

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.160 
now we're going to turn that one off so
as<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.619> say<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.130> go<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.850> has<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> range<00:01:18.509> quite

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
as I say here we go it has a range quite

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.940 
as I say here we go it has a range quite
a<00:01:19.200> nice<00:01:19.410> range<00:01:19.910> and<00:01:20.910> so<00:01:21.840> far<00:01:22.050> in<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> house<00:01:22.560> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
a nice range and so far in the house I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.420 
a nice range and so far in the house I
haven't<00:01:23.250> had<00:01:23.460> any<00:01:23.670> glitches<00:01:24.060> etc<00:01:25.399> so<00:01:26.399> let's

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
haven't had any glitches etc so let's

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.780 
haven't had any glitches etc so let's
see<00:01:26.850> how<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.180> goes<00:01:27.390> shall<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:28.190> so<00:01:29.190> basically

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
see how it goes shall we so basically

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.580 
see how it goes shall we so basically
it's<00:01:29.940> very<00:01:30.090> simple<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.960> forwards

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
it's very simple we just have forwards

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.240 
it's very simple we just have forwards
backwards<00:01:31.800> left<00:01:32.990> right<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.350> then<00:01:34.410> camera<00:01:35.039> up

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
backwards left right and then camera up

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.249 
backwards left right and then camera up
to<00:01:36.350> point<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.890> then<00:01:38.759> camera<00:01:39.149> down<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
to point up and then camera down to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.540 
to point up and then camera down to
point<00:01:40.500> down<00:01:40.709> so<00:01:41.340> let's<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.819> go<00:01:43.429> so<00:01:44.429> we're

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
point down so let's have a go so we're

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.410 
point down so let's have a go so we're
just<00:01:44.580> going<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.000> go<00:01:45.209> out<00:01:45.240> here

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.899 

and<00:01:48.990> obviously<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.619> can't<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.400> tank<00:01:50.640> so

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
and obviously I can't see the tank so

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.560 
and obviously I can't see the tank so
I'm<00:01:51.030> purely<00:01:51.509> relying<00:01:51.900> on<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:53.790> video<00:01:54.090> feed

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
I'm purely relying on the video feed

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.149 
I'm purely relying on the video feed
from<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:57.659> tank<00:01:57.930> itself<00:01:58.350> coming<00:01:58.799> onto<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
from the tank itself coming onto the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.200 
from the tank itself coming onto the
iPad<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> lot<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> fun<00:02:02.850> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.270 
camera we can take photos like this you
see<00:03:10.670> photographed<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.120> saved<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.980> if<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.130> want

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
see photographed and saved so if we want

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.490 
see photographed and saved so if we want
to<00:03:14.310> take<00:03:14.490> a<00:03:14.520> photo<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:17.160> feed<00:03:17.430> when<00:03:17.850> we're

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
to take a photo of the feed when we're

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.130 
to take a photo of the feed when we're
out<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.860> can<00:03:20.040> simply<00:03:20.430> press<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:21.540> photograph

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
out you can simply press the photograph

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.540 
out you can simply press the photograph
button<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.830> then<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.250> will<00:03:23.340> take<00:03:23.490> a

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
button and then that will take a

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.140 
button and then that will take a
photograph<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:25.310> as<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.430> say<00:03:26.640> we<00:03:26.760> also<00:03:26.910> have

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
photograph and as I say we also have

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.840 
photograph and as I say we also have
this<00:03:27.300> function<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.230> one<00:03:28.380> where<00:03:28.620> we<00:03:29.370> can<00:03:29.520> tilt

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
this function the one where we can tilt

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.930 
this function the one where we can tilt
like<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.890> it's<00:03:31.890> very<00:03:32.130> hard<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.460> see<00:03:32.640> on<00:03:32.670> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
like this it's very hard to see on the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.370 
like this it's very hard to see on the
video<00:03:33.030> obviously<00:03:33.420> because<00:03:33.960> I'm<00:03:34.080> having<00:03:34.290> to

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
video obviously because I'm having to

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.730 
video obviously because I'm having to
tilt<00:03:34.710> it<00:03:35.840> which<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:36.960> why<00:03:37.110> we<00:03:37.230> will<00:03:37.290> turn<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.650> off

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
tilt it which is why we will turn it off

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.880 
tilt it which is why we will turn it off
but<00:03:38.250> it's<00:03:38.430> all<00:03:38.730> very<00:03:39.180> very<00:03:39.540> good

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
but it's all very very good

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.450 
but it's all very very good
functionality<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:42.750> is<00:03:42.990> genuine<00:03:43.740> fun<00:03:44.220> as

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
functionality and it is genuine fun as

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.100 
functionality and it is genuine fun as
well<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:44.850> it's<00:03:45.000> actually<00:03:45.150> very<00:03:45.540> easy<00:03:45.660> to

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
well and it's actually very easy to

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.130 
well and it's actually very easy to
control<00:03:46.410> often<00:03:47.010> with<00:03:47.430> f<00:03:47.580> fpv<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.690> think<00:03:48.960> you

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
control often with f fpv you think you

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.450 
control often with f fpv you think you
know<00:03:49.290> when<00:03:49.470> you're<00:03:49.590> not<00:03:49.650> actually<00:03:49.800> looking<00:03:50.310> at

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
know when you're not actually looking at

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.580 
know when you're not actually looking at
it<00:03:50.640> it's<00:03:51.480> difficult<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:53.610> control<00:03:54.200> but<00:03:55.200> this

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
it it's difficult to to control but this

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.810 
it it's difficult to to control but this
is<00:03:55.890> actually<00:03:56.340> very<00:03:56.550> easy<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:57.150> control<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:59.400> as

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
is actually very easy to control and as

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.450 
is actually very easy to control and as
you<00:03:59.940> can<00:04:00.090> see<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.600> know<00:04:00.720> it's<00:04:01.110> it's<00:04:01.470> it's<00:04:02.310> a

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
you can see you know it's it's it's a

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.610 
you can see you know it's it's it's a
lot<00:04:02.490> of<00:04:02.610> fun<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:05.480> it's<00:04:06.480> relatively<00:04:07.080> easy<00:04:07.200> to

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
lot of fun and it's relatively easy to

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.060 
lot of fun and it's relatively easy to
control<00:04:08.040> as<00:04:08.310> well<00:04:08.990> from<00:04:09.990> looking<00:04:10.350> at<00:04:10.560> the

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
control as well from looking at the

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.980 
control as well from looking at the
camera<00:04:12.060> feed<00:04:14.180> okay<00:04:15.210> so<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.630> think<00:04:15.840> that's

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
camera feed okay so I think that's

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.350 
camera feed okay so I think that's
enough<00:04:16.430> demonstration<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.700> hope<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.120> get<00:04:18.210> the

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.360 
enough demonstration I hope you get the

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.950 
enough demonstration I hope you get the
idea

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960
