and 3 sorry and so far I like this
better<00:00:50.670> than<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.910> Duckett's<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> Duckett's

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
better than the Duckett's the Duckett's

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.860 
better than the Duckett's the Duckett's
are<00:00:51.960> heavier<00:00:52.320> they're<00:00:52.860> more<00:00:53.730> stocky<00:00:54.149> more

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
are heavier they're more stocky more

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.590 
are heavier they're more stocky more
strong<00:00:55.230> built<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.610> break<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.120> mean<00:00:57.390> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
strong built but they break I mean I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.049 
strong built but they break I mean I
broke<00:00:57.899> three<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> them<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.920> don't<00:00:59.609> know<00:00:59.699> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
broke three of them so I don't know I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.000 
broke three of them so I don't know I
haven't<00:01:01.050> broke<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:01.789> Veritas<00:01:02.789> yet<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:04.010> guess

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
haven't broke my Veritas yet so I guess

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.920 
haven't broke my Veritas yet so I guess
we'll<00:01:05.670> see<00:01:06.090> which<00:01:06.210> one's<00:01:06.420> better<00:01:06.600> for<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
we'll see which one's better for the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.450 
we'll see which one's better for the
money<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:08.330> it's<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.750> great<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:11.189> got

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
money but it's a really great it's got

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.130 
money but it's a really great it's got
