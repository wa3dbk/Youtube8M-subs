00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
another chord in a moment alright so I'm

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.850 
another chord in a moment alright so I'm
going<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.300> take<00:02:20.420> my<00:02:20.720> fourth<00:02:21.200> finger<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.650> tap

going to take my fourth finger and tap
on<00:02:22.040> with<00:02:22.250> my<00:02:22.340> fourth<00:02:22.580> finger<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.620> then<00:02:24.620> pull

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
on with my fourth finger and then pull

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.100 
on with my fourth finger and then pull
off<00:02:25.130> like<00:02:25.430> I'm<00:02:25.580> strumming<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.600> string<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:26.990> my

off like I'm strumming the string of my
fourth<00:02:27.500> finger<00:02:31.210> and<00:02:32.560> then<00:02:33.560> simply<00:02:33.920> alternate

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
fourth finger and then simply alternate

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.570 
fourth finger and then simply alternate
these

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:55.449 

and<00:02:42.580> then<00:02:43.300> try<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.750> get<00:02:43.870> faster<00:02:44.230> with

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.619 

alright<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:56.550> that's<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:56.790> one<00:02:56.940> chord<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.510> can

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
alright so that's just one chord we can

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.750 
alright so that's just one chord we can
tab<00:02:57.810> that's<00:02:57.989> at<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.260> major<00:02:58.530> chord<00:02:58.950> all<00:02:59.640> right

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
tab that's at a major chord all right

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.339 
tab that's at a major chord all right
let's<00:02:59.940> make<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.090> an<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.330> minor<00:03:00.629> chord<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:01.170> you

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
let's make it an a minor chord if you

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.750 
let's make it an a minor chord if you
know<00:03:01.470> what<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> minor<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> minor<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.519> just<00:03:02.670> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
know what a minor is a minor is just a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.880 
know what a minor is a minor is just a
flat<00:03:03.000> third<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.959> one<00:03:04.200> flat<00:03:04.500> 3rd<00:03:04.709> and

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
flat third so it's a one flat 3rd and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.770 
flat third so it's a one flat 3rd and
5th<00:03:05.129> so<00:03:05.819> all<00:03:05.940> we're<00:03:06.030> going<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.180> do<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.420> keep<00:03:06.569> all

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
5th so all we're going to do is keep all

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.119 
5th so all we're going to do is keep all
these<00:03:06.900> notes<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.230> same<00:03:07.470> we're<00:03:07.800> just<00:03:07.950> going<00:03:08.099> to

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
these notes the same we're just going to

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.890 
these notes the same we're just going to
take<00:03:08.340> our<00:03:08.580> fourth<00:03:09.090> finger<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.629> move<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.840> down

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
take our fourth finger and move it down

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.400 
take our fourth finger and move it down
one<00:03:10.319> fret<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.580> 8th<00:03:11.849> fret<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.390> do<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.230> same

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
one fret to the 8th fret and do the same

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:23.910 
one fret to the 8th fret and do the same
exact<00:03:13.800> pattern

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.140 

okay<00:03:24.920> then<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.430> can<00:03:25.550> alternate<00:03:25.970> these

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
okay then you can alternate these

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:38.340 
okay then you can alternate these
between<00:03:26.510> majors<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:26.990> minor

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.900 

all<00:03:39.350> right<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:40.040> like<00:03:40.130> I'll<00:03:40.310> saying<00:03:40.550> is<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.760> if

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
all right so like I'll saying is that if

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.309 
all right so like I'll saying is that if
that's<00:03:41.120> too<00:03:41.270> much<00:03:41.300> of<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.600> stretch<00:03:41.870> for<00:03:42.200> you

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
that's too much of a stretch for you

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.490 
that's too much of a stretch for you
let's<00:03:42.740> change<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:44.020> voicing<00:03:45.020> pattern<00:03:45.350> with

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
let's change the voicing pattern with

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.160 
let's change the voicing pattern with
this<00:03:45.650> instead<00:03:46.340> of<00:03:46.459> playing<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:47.060> a<00:03:47.090> down<00:03:47.930> here

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
this instead of playing the a down here

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.230 
this instead of playing the a down here
on<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.470> 5th<00:03:48.680> fret<00:03:48.830> let's<00:03:49.670> keep<00:03:49.910> these<00:03:50.030> knows

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
on the 5th fret let's keep these knows

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.000 
on the 5th fret let's keep these knows
the<00:03:50.360> same<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.900> ninth<00:03:51.110> and<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.410> 12th<00:03:51.830> and

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
the same the ninth and the 12th and

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.150 
the same the ninth and the 12th and
let's<00:03:52.400> put<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.670> a<00:03:52.870> up<00:03:53.870> here<00:03:54.230> on<00:03:54.380> 17th<00:03:54.950> fret

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
let's put the a up here on 17th fret

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.570 
let's put the a up here on 17th fret
okay<00:03:55.959> so<00:03:56.959> we're<00:03:57.080> just<00:03:57.110> moving<00:03:57.350> it<00:03:57.590> from<00:03:58.430> the

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
okay so we're just moving it from the

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.080 
okay so we're just moving it from the
fifth<00:03:59.050> all<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.230> way<00:04:00.350> up<00:04:00.470> octave<00:04:00.830> up<00:04:00.980> okay<00:04:01.490> so

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
fifth all the way up octave up okay so

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.080 
fifth all the way up octave up okay so
then<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.330> pattern<00:04:02.660> becomes<00:04:06.850> so<00:04:07.850> then<00:04:08.000> you

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
then the pattern becomes so then you

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.250 
then the pattern becomes so then you
don't<00:04:08.209> have<00:04:08.390> that<00:04:08.510> that<00:04:08.870> far<00:04:09.080> of<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.230> stretch

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
don't have that that far of a stretch

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.050 
don't have that that far of a stretch
between<00:04:09.680> your<00:04:10.130> first<00:04:10.610> finger<00:04:10.820> and<00:04:11.000> your

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
between your first finger and your

between your first finger and your
fourth<00:04:11.270> finger<00:04:11.330> with<00:04:11.750> your<00:04:11.780> left<00:04:12.080> hand<00:04:12.230> or

like<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.180> use<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.940> could<00:04:20.030> do<00:04:20.150> this<00:04:20.299> as<00:04:20.450> many

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
like to use you could do this as many

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.270 
like to use you could do this as many
different<00:04:20.780> ways<00:04:20.989> as<00:04:21.140> possible<00:04:21.200> if<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.130> want
