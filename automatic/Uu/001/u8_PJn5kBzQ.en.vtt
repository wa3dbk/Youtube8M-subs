version<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.940> pump<00:01:15.890> before<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.550> had<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
version with a pump before I had the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.880 
version with a pump before I had the
tube<00:01:19.280> but<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.520> prefer<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.300> lot<00:01:21.570> more<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.170> pump
