food that he ate the night before the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.300 
food that he ate the night before the
watermelon<00:03:08.989> was<00:03:09.110> just<00:03:09.320> catching<00:03:09.739> up<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.160> it

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
watermelon was just catching up to it

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.350 
watermelon was just catching up to it
and<00:03:10.519> it<00:03:10.820> was<00:03:10.940> causing<00:03:11.269> this<00:03:12.040> massive<00:03:13.040> gas<00:03:13.549> pain

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
and it was causing this massive gas pain

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.820 
and it was causing this massive gas pain
for<00:03:14.959> this<00:03:15.110> guy

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
for this guy

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.009 
for this guy
so<00:03:16.250> if<00:03:16.670> he<00:03:16.850> didn't<00:03:17.060> eat<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.390> food<00:03:17.600> if<00:03:17.810> he<00:03:17.900> ate

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
so if he didn't eat that food if he ate

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.440 
so if he didn't eat that food if he ate
like<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.290> nice<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:19.250> know<00:03:19.280> faster<00:03:19.940> jesting

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
like a nice you know faster jesting

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.330 
like a nice you know faster jesting
plant<00:03:20.989> foods<00:03:21.290> dinner<00:03:21.590> then<00:03:22.130> he<00:03:22.190> had

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
plant foods dinner then he had

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.710 
plant foods dinner then he had
watermelon<00:03:22.820> in<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:22.970> morning<00:03:23.330> he's<00:03:23.480> not

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
watermelon in the morning he's not

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.479 
watermelon in the morning he's not
likely<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.110> get<00:03:24.320> that<00:03:24.380> but<00:03:24.980> there<00:03:25.130> still<00:03:25.220> might

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
likely to get that but there still might

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.220 
likely to get that but there still might
be<00:03:25.549> a<00:03:25.700> little<00:03:26.090> bit<00:03:26.239> of<00:03:26.360> that<00:03:26.510> because<00:03:26.720> cooked

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
be a little bit of that because cooked

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.530 
be a little bit of that because cooked
food<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.799> fruit<00:03:28.130> digests<00:03:29.030> at<00:03:29.120> different

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
food and fruit digests at different

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.170 
food and fruit digests at different
rates<00:03:29.750> okay<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.709> more<00:03:30.890> water<00:03:31.160> in<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.430> food<00:03:31.670> the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
rates okay the more water in a food the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.949 
rates okay the more water in a food the
faster<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.900> isn't<00:03:33.200> going<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.860> digest<00:03:34.400> so

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
faster it isn't going to digest so

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.420 
faster it isn't going to digest so
another<00:03:35.959> thing<00:03:36.049> can<00:03:36.530> be<00:03:36.709> for<00:03:36.980> bloating

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
another thing can be for bloating

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.360 
another thing can be for bloating
if<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:38.269> have<00:03:38.480> an<00:03:38.630> inner<00:03:38.959> fish<00:03:39.170> in<00:03:39.380> :<00:03:40.070> you're

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
if you have an inner fish in : you're

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.970 
if you have an inner fish in : you're
not<00:03:40.549> very<00:03:40.820> fit<00:03:41.260> okay<00:03:42.260> that's<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.590> big<00:03:42.799> one

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
not very fit okay that's a big one

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.830 
not very fit okay that's a big one
because<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.400> love<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.730> population<00:03:44.390> is<00:03:44.600> not

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
because I love the population is not

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.820 
because I love the population is not
very<00:03:45.110> fit

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
very fit

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.190 
very fit
so<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.549> feeder<00:03:46.820> you<00:03:47.060> become<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.989> more

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
so the feeder you become the more

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.110 
so the feeder you become the more
efficient<00:03:48.830> your<00:03:49.010> colon<00:03:49.580> becomes<00:03:49.910> that

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
efficient your colon becomes that

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.830 
efficient your colon becomes that
eliminating<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.019> waste<00:03:51.130> pushing<00:03:52.130> it<00:03:52.280> through

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
eliminating the waste pushing it through

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.840 
eliminating the waste pushing it through
okay<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:53.900> that<00:03:54.440> really<00:03:55.010> really<00:03:55.220> is<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.430> big<00:03:55.670> one

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
okay so that really really is a big one

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.680 
okay so that really really is a big one
and<00:03:56.150> also<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:57.100> hydration<00:03:58.100> hydration<00:03:58.640> is<00:03:59.269> a<00:03:59.299> huge

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
and also a hydration hydration is a huge

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.199 
and also a hydration hydration is a huge
one<00:03:59.900> if<00:04:00.080> you<00:04:00.290> don't<00:04:00.440> have<00:04:00.590> enough<00:04:01.160> water<00:04:01.209> in

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
one if you don't have enough water in

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.500 
one if you don't have enough water in
your<00:04:02.690> belly<00:04:03.049> before<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.160> start<00:04:04.489> eating<00:04:04.910> then

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
your belly before you start eating then

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.570 
your belly before you start eating then
your<00:04:06.130> digestive<00:04:07.130> ends

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
your digestive ends

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.240 
your digestive ends
aren't<00:04:07.970> going<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.180> be<00:04:08.270> activated<00:04:08.780> properly<00:04:09.770> so

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
aren't going to be activated properly so

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.740 
aren't going to be activated properly so
those<00:04:10.400> suggestive<00:04:10.940> ends<00:04:11.090> I'm<00:04:11.270> saying<00:04:11.510> need

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
those suggestive ends I'm saying need

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.340 
those suggestive ends I'm saying need
water<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.920> be<00:04:13.190> bathing<00:04:13.730> in<00:04:14.060> your<00:04:14.480> stomach<00:04:14.930> to

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
water to be bathing in your stomach to

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.070 
water to be bathing in your stomach to
digest<00:04:15.650> food<00:04:16.340> properly<00:04:16.850> so<00:04:17.600> you've<00:04:17.720> got<00:04:17.959> to

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
digest food properly so you've got to

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.630 
digest food properly so you've got to
make<00:04:18.230> sure<00:04:18.260> you're<00:04:18.739> drinking<00:04:19.160> enough<00:04:19.610> water

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
make sure you're drinking enough water

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.300

do you think of any other floating
reasons<00:05:47.270> posture<00:05:48.020> Oh<00:05:48.940> salt<00:05:49.940> yes<00:05:50.570> yes<00:05:51.140> so

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
reasons posture Oh salt yes yes so

sodium<00:05:51.650> is<00:05:51.890> a<00:05:51.950> big<00:05:52.100> one<00:05:52.280> because<00:05:52.430> if<00:05:53.000> you<00:05:53.210> have

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
sodium is a big one because if you have

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.090 
sodium is a big one because if you have
a<00:05:53.540> high<00:05:53.750> salt<00:05:54.020> diet<00:05:54.229> you<00:05:54.530> are<00:05:54.560> going<00:05:54.860> to<00:05:55.010> be

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
a high salt diet you are going to be

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.920 
a high salt diet you are going to be
retaining<00:05:55.669> fluid<00:05:56.000> around<00:05:56.300> your<00:05:56.720> body
