00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:14.790
 teacher uses the delicious 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.609
 The recipe we are going to make today is the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.029
 power and the hill or jerimum as we 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.340
 Northeastern we used to talk she serves 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.189
 as the accompaniment for meats 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.039
 salty, preferably the sweet taste goes 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.710
 contrast count not healthy and is a 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.660
 low calorie power in addition to being rich 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.559
 beta-carotene, which is a precursor 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.950
 Vitamin 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.530
 You do you'll need half 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:47.039
 half a cup of ricotta 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:50.489
 half a glass of skim milk a spoon 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.110
 mines grated cheese soup one 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 pinch of nutmeg pepper to taste 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.739
 The first step is to put water in the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.520
 coastal 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.189
 the cooking process here is new with 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.750
 How should we cook good too? 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.750
 part of the vegetables to not have the 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.470
 nutritional value of these vegetables now 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.680
 let's wait a few minutes about 10 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.900
 to 20 minutes depends on the cut of the genius 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.759
 that you owe the texture of genius who 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.759
 some got faster than 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.119
 others but you will try it later 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.170
 with gas arises to mount conflict then 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.170
 let's wait 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.380
 as we can see that today's world 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.649
 is cooked 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.200
 so let's go to a next step that is 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.200
 to march today Sunday 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.910
 see when it 's hot and wet 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.470
 it serves well the pressure of the fork 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.950
 let's put several ingredients 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.550
 place in grated fresh mines 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.400
 let's put the ball or ricotta is de is a 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:13.190
 low calorie cheese you will put 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:17.600
 still milk depending on the texture of the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:22.910
 the ball you will put more or less 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.670
 some grandmother's milk recipe speaks 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.000
 half a glass of milk but if you do, crime 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.160
 already enough is already in the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.700
 pain does not need to put my glass of 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.550
 milk 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.440
 now let's summon a pinch of 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.900
 nutmeg to give a taste does not need 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.810
 just a pinch because our key is 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.750
 very strong 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:51.080
 we put the salt to taste 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.780
 Since the mouth is sweet, the balance is only for 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.190
 counterbalance, but not 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.680
 You need to use a 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.320
 pepper we're using pepper 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:09.430
 calabresa but you can use pepper 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.430
 yours today can be a black pepper 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.190
 now we are going to finalize 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.970
 you will put 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.360
 Glacier with the dog and you will give 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.700
 an escape 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:32.480
 This bracket is for you to heat the 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:37.100
 cheese gives an improvement in cheeses i gives 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:41.890
 a dry one can not find any 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.890
 sequinha more consistency 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.170
 completed this step we will mount the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.860
 dish remembering how much they 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.380
 Four is the yield after it four 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:02.770
 Portions and you 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.770
 each of the functions with heat 87 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:18.079
 so our plate is full is are a 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.049
 suggestion to serve is with a steak 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:26.650
 sunflower stew will stay 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.650
 simply delicious enjoy
