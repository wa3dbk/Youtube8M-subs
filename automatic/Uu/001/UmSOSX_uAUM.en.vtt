00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the future of the sharks it'll be really

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.880 
the future of the sharks it'll be really
interesting<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.600> sort<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.350> sharks

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
interesting to see what sort of sharks

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.010

we<00:01:08.070> come<00:01:08.310> across<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.850> far<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.240> maturity<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
we come across as far as maturity you

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.149 
we come across as far as maturity you
know<00:01:10.140> they<00:01:10.290> see<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.530> lot<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.799> them<00:01:11.010> mature

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
know they see a lot of them mature

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.310 
know they see a lot of them mature
sharks<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.090> area<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.020> want<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
sharks in this area and we do want to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.810 
sharks in this area and we do want to
get<00:01:13.439> tags<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.979> these<00:01:14.130> immature<00:01:14.430> sharks

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
get tags on these immature sharks

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.999 
get tags on these immature sharks
because<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.270> will<00:01:15.450> define<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.259> nursery<00:01:16.799> if

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
because they will define the nursery if

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.520 
because they will define the nursery if
the<00:01:17.340> Sharks<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.790> not<00:01:17.909> succeeding<00:01:18.390> there<00:01:18.869> you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the Sharks are not succeeding there you

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.950 
the Sharks are not succeeding there you
do<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> bright<00:01:20.490> future<00:01:20.540> we<00:01:21.540> are<00:01:21.750> also

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
do not have a bright future we are also

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.010 
do not have a bright future we are also
hoping<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.799> run<00:01:22.979> into<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> occasional<00:01:24.360> large

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
hoping to run into the occasional large

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.140 
hoping to run into the occasional large
mature<00:01:25.409> animal<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> particularly<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.820> large

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150

mature<00:01:27.450> female<00:01:28.080> because<00:01:28.409> she<00:01:28.619> will<00:01:28.799> reveal<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
mature female because she will reveal to

I<00:01:53.840> believe<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.740> work<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.130> are<00:01:56.159> planning

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
I believe that the work we are planning

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.179 
I believe that the work we are planning
to<00:01:56.850> do<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.479> they'll<00:01:57.689> search<00:01:57.990> using<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.920> pot

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
to do if they'll search using this pot

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.910 
to do if they'll search using this pot
tag<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.820> pop-up<00:02:00.420> tag<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.320> acoustic<00:02:01.710> tag

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
tag the pop-up tag and the acoustic tag

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.399 
tag the pop-up tag and the acoustic tag
together<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.180> perfect<00:02:03.540> combination<00:02:03.840> even

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
together is the perfect combination even

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.380 
together is the perfect combination even
if<00:02:04.799> they<00:02:04.950> don't<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> surface<00:02:05.939> we

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
if they don't go up to the surface we

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.819 
if they don't go up to the surface we
will<00:02:06.479> be<00:02:06.600> able<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.930> detect<00:02:07.229> them<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.680> the

will be able to detect them with the
