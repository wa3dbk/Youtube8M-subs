zombies won't attack you there reaching
glitches<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.540> they<00:00:42.629> could<00:00:42.780> pause<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
glitches so that they could pause the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
glitches so that they could pause the
game<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.710> which<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.219> actually<00:00:44.760> hurting<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
leaderboards because now the leader

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.930 
leaderboards because now the leader
boards<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.219> filled<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.579> people<00:00:47.789> just

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
boards are filled with people just

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.090 
boards are filled with people just
glitching<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> top<00:00:49.289> spot<00:00:49.500> because<00:00:49.800> as

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
glitching to the top spot because as

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.950 
glitching to the top spot because as
more<00:00:50.370> people<00:00:50.520> use<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.149> glitches<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.750> pause

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.820 
do is write your name write your address
and<00:01:12.450> then<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.810> actually<00:01:12.960> don't<00:01:13.200> really<00:01:13.710> need

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
and then we actually don't really need

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.740 
and then we actually don't really need
to<00:01:13.979> write<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.400> address<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.509> put<00:01:15.659> in

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
to write your address you can put in

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.179 
to write your address you can put in
whatever<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> fitting

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
whatever you want it can be a fitting

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.380 
whatever you want it can be a fitting
addressed<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.640> doesn't<00:01:17.909> really<00:01:18.000> matter<00:01:18.240> for

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
addressed it doesn't really matter for

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.880 
addressed it doesn't really matter for
something<00:01:18.840> digital<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.710> I'd

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
something digital like this so I'd

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.200 
something digital like this so I'd
recommend<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.400> putting<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.759> fake<00:01:20.939> address

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
recommend just putting in a fake address

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.600 
recommend just putting in a fake address
but<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.960> put<00:01:22.110> your<00:01:22.229> name<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.560> then<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.369> ship

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
but you put your name in then you ship

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.399 
but you put your name in then you ship
it<00:01:23.729> off<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.540> we're<00:01:24.750> hoping<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.259> at

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it off and that we're hoping to get at

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.710 
it off and that we're hoping to get at
least<00:01:25.439> 200<00:01:26.100> possibly<00:01:26.580> more<00:01:26.790> signatures<00:01:27.479> I'm

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
least 200 possibly more signatures I'm

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.359 
least 200 possibly more signatures I'm
going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.930> send<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.200> off<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.680> sledgehammer

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
going to send it off to sledgehammer
