00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.069
 with lines in addition to having 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.639
 she tells us about a process called thermoforming 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.420
 what practically consists of heating a piece of plastic and putting them on 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:21.950
 some molds so that it takes the shape of its controls as it is in this image 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.899
 and well I'll show you the process that was needed to create those pieces 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.959
 and everything starts with the molds or street in this case so made with nfc 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.359
 They are cut on the numerical control machine 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:38.300
 who then visas by hand and by the hundred 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.030
 with all the akaba that is uncovered that this functions 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.110
 you are within 11 were few Germans expected 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.910
 in what is said the bottom part this piece arrive 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.120
 if you wanted around they have 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.550
 percent like 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.830
 1 the species is what was done to it so that it will be created a little more 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.409
 above 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.909
 on the platform and that can be held ends formed 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.710
 in the best possible way here is sealing the piece 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.020
 so I can get it right out of the plastic iquique percent the best 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.570
 possible he ends 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.090
 we made the machine that form it 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.170
 what you want and most important is that there is a bed where the 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.920
 pieces 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.930
 that have small perforations where they can be corrected 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.210
 the air creates the vacuum that is uncovered that the pieces are formed 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.120
 at the bottom you have the area where the plastic is heated 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.060
 and good low you have the compressor and pessimistic tone pistons for this 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.330
 apple sencion 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.190
 here we see the bottom part the tubes that 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.190
 that help this one is mentioning before 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.760
 that's where you put plastic speech and that plastic one who moss with the 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.220
 they take out 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.380
 and hey here he knows us place 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 machine 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.110
 to later put the face to the area where the orchestra of the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.110
 left of screen 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.690
 so as not to remove it again and place it on the pieces of wood that 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.679
 next let's see 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:15.089
 the idea is like a thousand pieces were placed vehemently 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.089
 Arming to the possible space 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.169
 and there it is and in the room inside 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:24.169
 of the heat and we see how to start Spain 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.499
 then it is to take out the piece 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:30.780
 and goes up 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.419
 the hand of stan 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.669
 part this theme for the mountains 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.359
 and squares will create wrinkles 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.069
 that's obviously not ideal but in this case the piece of plastic is 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.889
 He warmed up too 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.090
 It was the first one 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.599
 prada that was made millÃ¡n the following 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.599
 the woman later on that everything went 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.109
 month more fluid and a little better p 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.109
 then you have to the little for what 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.519
 so that no piece of bread is given to the piece 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.159
 dt to get enough stiffness but you do not want it to cool 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.310
 massively because if not it stays traps the piece of wood inside and aena informs 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:14.480
 that lane neal x as they are taking out they tied the pieces a little bit because 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:19.869
 per cent does not have angles of would be as pronounced as I should have 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.949
 but in the end he on his feet 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.609
 here is the second one 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.250
 the second round I do not know if they do it where the plastic was found 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:32.259
 perfectly fine point 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:33.619
 and it was possible 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:35.679
 I fear 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:37.079
 much much better 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.319
 here we have already done that on the banks of the mountains as little by little it goes 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.549
 pulling 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.649
 ready to determine your beloved perfect much better than the previous 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:47.510
 n 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.620
 because it is given a little 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.929
 - from time ago beck 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:54.929
 Donzis was without any problem 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:00.109
 There are those who are already getting 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.109
 the plastic of the machine 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.769
 percent hits herself a little bit more perverse she 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.809
 nor ready has the piece 

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:15.809
 thermo form 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.909
 look and we can see the difference between the two 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.719
 like one has wrinkles 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:25.719
 and the other one went perfect 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.960
 here we can see in three images in sequence as there is starting to 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.099
 to form 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.919
 chilla was decided forming and is totally form the piece 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.860
 i something important that does not mention you is that all families are rather 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.430
 around the entire edge of the bed is where informed center fell 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.440
 ee with a step what serves to stay 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.879
 that seal that is needed for what 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.099
 the air is 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.269
 can correct it all the piece tells us that if so 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.849
 Finally, the piece is measured because there are certain changes, the 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.629
 material 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.629
 and finally pasasa cut the piece 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.960
 avn machinery that 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.819
 what better c 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.979
 suits the pair that you're cutting kind of that are two visions 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:16.790
 different 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.300
 but at the end of the day you have your pieces already 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.240
 finished to then do what 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.349
 be in the process 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.520
 and well I hope you have been a little clearer what is needed 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.750
 thermoformed 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.780
 the time this one - puntocom installations
