00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.400 
figure change in the viewfinder at the

now in order to take your basic picture

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.240 
now in order to take your basic picture
you<00:01:44.450> want<00:01:44.540> to<00:01:44.630> use<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.930> program<00:01:45.350> mode<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.100> your

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
you want to use the program mode so your

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.740 
you want to use the program mode so your
mode<00:01:46.460> dial<00:01:46.490> should<00:01:46.910> be<00:01:47.120> on<00:01:47.420> P<00:01:49.510> I'm<00:01:50.510> going<00:01:50.690> to

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
mode dial should be on P I'm going to

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.690 
mode dial should be on P I'm going to
assume<00:01:51.050> we're<00:01:51.260> outdoors<00:01:51.410> so<00:01:52.220> I'd<00:01:52.340> like<00:01:52.550> to

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
assume we're outdoors so I'd like to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.750 
assume we're outdoors so I'd like to
have<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.180> ISO<00:01:53.690> set<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.080> 100<00:01:54.680> we're<00:01:55.340> in<00:01:55.520> broad

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
have the ISO set to 100 we're in broad

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.280 
have the ISO set to 100 we're in broad
daylight<00:01:55.970> so<00:01:56.180> I<00:01:56.420> really<00:01:56.690> don't<00:01:56.930> need<00:01:57.110> the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
daylight so I really don't need the

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.110 
daylight so I really don't need the
camera<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.710> be<00:01:57.830> any<00:01:58.040> more<00:01:58.220> sensitive<00:01:58.820> than

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
camera to be any more sensitive than

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.800 
camera to be any more sensitive than
that<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.200> I'll<00:02:00.290> press<00:02:00.530> ISO<00:02:01.070> use<00:02:01.760> my<00:02:02.240> up<00:02:02.540> and
