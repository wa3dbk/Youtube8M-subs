the<00:01:28.110> rebounding<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.619> little<00:01:28.860> better<00:01:29.060> not<00:01:30.060> bad

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the rebounding a little better not bad

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.760 
the rebounding a little better not bad
not<00:01:30.750> bad<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:30.960> all<00:01:31.110> one<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> things<00:01:31.710> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
not bad at all one of the things that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.920 
not bad at all one of the things that
did<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.189> down<00:01:32.220> between<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.090> Emerald<00:01:33.540> Drummond

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
did go down between the Emerald Drummond

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.330 
did go down between the Emerald Drummond
and<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> Ruby<00:01:34.470> Drummond<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> block

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
and the Ruby Drummond is the block

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.179 
and the Ruby Drummond is the block
rating<00:01:35.640> from<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.850> 96<00:01:36.329> 2<00:01:36.450> +<00:01:36.600> 91<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.799> Emerald

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
rating from a 96 2 + 91 and the Emerald

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.580 
rating from a 96 2 + 91 and the Emerald
Drummond<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.299> there's<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> Emerald

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
Drummond and the there's the Emerald

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.469 
Drummond and the there's the Emerald
Drummond<00:01:40.829> real<00:01:40.979> quick<00:01:41.130> he's<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> 77<00:01:42.060> overall

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
Drummond real quick he's a 77 overall

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.590 
Drummond real quick he's a 77 overall
and<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.040> silver<00:01:44.430> Drummond<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
and then the silver Drummond and the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.880 
and then the silver Drummond and the
Emerald<00:01:45.930> Drummond<00:01:46.200> were<00:01:46.320> very<00:01:46.590> very<00:01:46.770> close

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
Emerald Drummond were very very close

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.520 
Emerald Drummond were very very close
and<00:01:47.310> stats<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.909> overall<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.320> Ruby

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and stats so overall I like the Ruby

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.920 
and stats so overall I like the Ruby
Drummond<00:01:49.979> best<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.759> far<00:01:50.790> let's<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.659> get<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
Drummond best so far let's just get a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.840 
Drummond best so far let's just get a
regular<00:01:52.110> comparison<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.700> check

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
regular comparison here you can check

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.580 
regular comparison here you can check
the<00:01:54.030> stats<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.509> everything<00:01:54.600> pretty<00:01:55.170> much<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the stats and everything pretty much the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.950 
the stats and everything pretty much the
same<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.159> Emerald<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.670> again<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.630> silver

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
same as the Emerald one again the silver

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.170 
same as the Emerald one again the silver
the<00:01:57.990> Emerald<00:01:58.350> are<00:01:58.439> very<00:01:58.799> very<00:01:59.070> close<00:01:59.460> but

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the Emerald are very very close but

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.090 
the Emerald are very very close but
overall<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> Ruby<00:02:01.590> Drummond<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
overall I like the Ruby Drummond the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.249 
overall I like the Ruby Drummond the
best<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.850> got<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> couple<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.540> updated<00:02:03.990> stats

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
best it's got a couple of updated stats

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.709 
best it's got a couple of updated stats
Ruby<00:02:04.890> Drummond<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> 79<00:02:06.000> overall<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.600> can

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
Ruby Drummond is a 79 overall you can

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.660 
Ruby Drummond is a 79 overall you can
see<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> silver<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.439> there<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> 74<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
see the silver one there is a 74 and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.460 
see the silver one there is a 74 and
then<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.479> get<00:02:09.599> into<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.899> Emerald<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.349> is

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
then if you get into the Emerald one is

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.530 
then if you get into the Emerald one is
a<00:02:10.500> 77<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> bus<00:02:11.580> route<00:02:11.819> one<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.270> ruby

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
a 77 so the bus route one is a ruby

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.490 
a 77 so the bus route one is a ruby
