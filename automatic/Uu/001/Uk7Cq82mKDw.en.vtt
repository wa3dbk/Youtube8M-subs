00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.319
 the Swiss Federal Railways SBB had the problem with both of them 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.659
 three-axle bogies in the 50s of the last century 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.839
 procured 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:41.299
 to haul heavy trains across the Gotthard because the machines soon 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.619
 in letters Spur Krenz and seemed beyond the normal too 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:45.739
 wear out 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.719
 At the following locomotive the six axles were distributed to three bogies 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.799
 being the middle Brega places strongly laterally displaceable 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.399
 a representative of this series one of the RBS 6 6 m also at SBB Cargo 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:02.839
 has been discontinued as a novelty 81 already presented here 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:08.199
 Now Merck introduces the cargo model of an Arie 6 6 as Ai 610 in the 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.659
 current coloring and scam 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.730
 The driving characteristics of this 6-liter 11-gram heavyweight are very high 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:15.439
 Well 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.439
 there is no jerking the scheme is silky soft 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.089
 The chassis is articulated enough to handle even difficult turnouts safely 

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:24.639
 by measure 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.180
 The tractional qualities are excellent thanks to the veterinarian tire 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.840
 on the outer wheels of the drive is active 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.289
 and the middle wheels, which are a fraction of a fraction higher 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:39.529
 This console Solar entail that the weight of the locomotive on the Metav tires 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.800
 loaded wheels loaded 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.830
 The transmission of this model is despite his forehead wheels off 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.060
 Sound barely audible only under load at work made itself felt 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.039
 with the mob as the snow picking up some operating noise over 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.580
 switched sound in driving to what the consultant switched 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.889
 become 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.319
 is unsatisfactory 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.499
 that the hem level is sinking so FIFA was turned on 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.449
 Also do not satisfy that the braking creaking begins so late 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:09.680
 namely only at 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.629
 for the blog post has come to a standstill 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.629
 the pressure is completely unusual for a model from GÃ¶ppingen not without 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:18.759
 error 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:23.490
 at the place name Landquart on the grinder ahead right side of the 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.490
 Lok is the crossbeam that the incomplete 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.409
 Of course, the model does not show the Swiss change 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:34.300
 however, the tail light can not be switched off 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.340
 According to the Mortgage need a corner for Switzerland, the model is one
