 Hey, how are youtube friends today? 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.430
 I'm going to teach how to play michael life 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.109
 jackson this super read that ran to 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.820
 van halen and here I am going to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.280
 teach perfectly on guitar 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.170
 acoustics let's use a room 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.170
 standard and notice how we started 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.890
 d 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.590
 Y 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.620
 let's start already has been sold 1 2 3 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:39.580
 and 4 we will start by placing the finger 2 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.670
 in fret number 3 string number 6 and 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:47.530
 we started first with a museum and 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.670
 then to the air now we do touch down 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.690
 with finger 1 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.740
 Fret two strings five after 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.460
 stretch of the little finger 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:03.050
 until the 5 string 4 fret and then with 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.050
 the 1 fret 2 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.520
 okay 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.170
 Y 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.390
 we go back to making museum and we do technique 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.939
 Cameron here is with finger 1 and with the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.039
 finger number 3 we make the cameron towards 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.039
 the fret number 4 15 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.140
 and then nothing else is pure blows to the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.670
 air but like that turning off 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.240
 immediately the sound 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.240
 let's do it very slowly 3 2 1 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.560
 Y 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.840
 we repeat practically what 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.400
 same nothing but ends in a hit 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.310
 only at the end 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.680
 Y 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.930
 ok it's a pure circle this is all 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.370
 all the time he is giving circles we are going to 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.390
 to do it very slowly and we are giving it 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:13.900
 speed little by little 3 2 1 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.900
 Y 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.750
 Y 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.239
 Y 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.110
 Y 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.430
 perfect as you realize it's a riff 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.020
 very, very simple but very melodic 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.850
 is suitable for those who are starting 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.130
 so with riffs and then they go forward 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.680
 little by little very well leave me down here
