00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
this looks like an Atlantis map but I

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.210 
this looks like an Atlantis map but I
would<00:00:16.289> not<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.590> worried<00:00:16.859> about<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.130> especially

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
would not be worried about it especially

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.250 
would not be worried about it especially
once<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.699> see<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:17.940> you'll<00:00:18.150> understand<00:00:18.510> so

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
once you see it you'll understand so

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.529 
once you see it you'll understand so
here<00:00:19.439> we<00:00:19.470> see<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.890> fully<00:00:20.340> zombified<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.420> now

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
here we see is fully zombified and now

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.660 
here we see is fully zombified and now
becoming<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.080> demonic<00:00:22.500> announcer<00:00:23.130> or<00:00:23.310> god

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
becoming this demonic announcer or god

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.920 
becoming this demonic announcer or god
of<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> zombies<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.600> he's<00:00:24.689> gonna<00:00:24.779> be

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
of the zombies that he's gonna be

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.570 
of the zombies that he's gonna be
controlling<00:00:25.350> everything<00:00:25.650> from<00:00:25.949> now<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.340> so

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
controlling everything from now on so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.800 
controlling everything from now on so
that's<00:00:26.760> what<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> look<00:00:27.240> forward<00:00:27.570> to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
that's what we have to look forward to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.349 
that's what we have to look forward to
in<00:00:27.990> our<00:00:28.140> final<00:00:28.680> chapter<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.340> EXO<00:00:29.820> zombies<00:00:29.849> in

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
in our final chapter of EXO zombies in

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.420 
in our final chapter of EXO zombies in
this<00:00:30.480> map<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.769> see<00:00:31.920> here<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.250> probably

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
this map so we see here this is probably

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.910 
this map so we see here this is probably
the<00:00:32.579> intro<00:00:33.030> cutscene<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.899> EXO<00:00:34.290> zombies<00:00:34.320> and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
the intro cutscene for EXO zombies and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.889 
the intro cutscene for EXO zombies and
it<00:00:35.010> actually<00:00:35.160> looks<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.579> oz<00:00:35.820> blows<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.750> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
it actually looks like oz blows it up a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.240 
it actually looks like oz blows it up a
little<00:00:37.079> bit<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> ship<00:00:37.680> manage<00:00:37.980> ship<00:00:38.129> is

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
little bit of the ship manage ship is

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.380 
little bit of the ship manage ship is
blowing<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.520> itself<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.000> looks<00:00:39.120> like<00:00:39.149> oz

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
blowing up itself but it looks like oz

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.360 
blowing up itself but it looks like oz
cause<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.290> then<00:00:40.379> jumps<00:00:40.770> down<00:00:41.040> and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
cause of this and then jumps down and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.530 
cause of this and then jumps down and
this<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.610> how<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.910> assume<00:00:42.120> we're<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
this is how we can assume we're going to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
this is how we can assume we're going to
the<00:00:42.629> next<00:00:42.780> Atlas<00:00:43.320> base<00:00:43.559> underseas<00:00:44.309> we're<00:00:44.550> not

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the next Atlas base underseas we're not

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.190 
the next Atlas base underseas we're not
really<00:00:44.820> sure<00:00:45.000> how<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.360> makes<00:00:45.570> sense<00:00:45.930> but

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
really sure how that makes sense but

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.139 
really sure how that makes sense but
we'll<00:00:46.739> see<00:00:46.950> how<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.160> plays<00:00:47.430> out<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> real

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
we'll see how that plays out in the real

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.970 
we'll see how that plays out in the real
trailer<00:00:48.660> once<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.170> playing<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> game<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
trailer once we get playing the game I

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.430 
trailer once we get playing the game I
don't<00:00:50.910> get<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> look<00:00:51.239> at<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.719> base<00:00:51.930> once<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.320> get

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
don't get a look at the base once we get

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709 
don't get a look at the base once we get
down<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.789> really<00:00:54.270> interesting

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
down here is this really interesting

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.650 
down here is this really interesting
idea<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.920> Triton<00:00:56.520> facility<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.420> we'll

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
idea of this Triton facility and we'll

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.389 
idea of this Triton facility and we'll
see<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> lot<00:00:57.989> more<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.379> writing<00:00:58.800> thing<00:00:58.920> play

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
see a lot more this writing thing play

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.310 
see a lot more this writing thing play
more<00:00:59.940> perspectives<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:01.050> probably

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
more perspectives and it's probably

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.349 
more perspectives and it's probably
named<00:01:01.559> training<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.129> Atlas<00:01:02.489> base<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.239> want

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
named training as Atlas base but I want

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.000 
named training as Atlas base but I want
you<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.480> take<00:01:03.570> notice<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.140> green<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.830> the

gonna<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:10.260> our<00:01:10.560> teleporter<00:01:11.130> zombies<00:01:11.520> which

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
gonna see our teleporter zombies which

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.100 
gonna see our teleporter zombies which
you're<00:01:11.790> introducing<00:01:12.210> them<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:12.510> last<00:01:12.780> map<00:01:12.990> have

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
you're introducing them at last map have

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.840 
you're introducing them at last map have
been<00:01:13.229> almost<00:01:13.380> mixed<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.070> others<00:01:14.310> office<00:01:14.640> so

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
been almost mixed with others office so

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
been almost mixed with others office so
then<00:01:15.000> he<00:01:15.119> comes<00:01:15.270> over<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.659> explodes<00:01:16.200> so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
then he comes over here and explodes so

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.749 
then he comes over here and explodes so
it<00:01:16.590> looks<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.890> our<00:01:17.009> teleporter<00:01:17.340> mixed<00:01:17.670> with

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it looks like our teleporter mixed with

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.999 
it looks like our teleporter mixed with
the<00:01:17.880> acid<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.659> will<00:01:18.810> see<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> recurring

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the acid we will see this as a recurring

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
the acid we will see this as a recurring
a<00:01:20.159> factor<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.640> these<00:01:21.060> teleporting<00:01:21.720> zombies

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
a factor for these teleporting zombies

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.330 
a factor for these teleporting zombies
they've<00:01:22.200> definitely<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> game<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> little

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
they've definitely up the game a little

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.980 
they've definitely up the game a little
bit<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.060> should<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.330> interesting<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.840> see

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
bit and it should be interesting to see

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.929 
bit and it should be interesting to see
how<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.229> plays<00:01:25.409> out<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.640> I'm<00:01:26.880> probably

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
how that plays out I know I'm probably

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.520 
how that plays out I know I'm probably
not<00:01:27.270> fun<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> first<00:01:27.689> couple<00:01:27.930> times<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.380> play

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
not fun the first couple times I play

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.319 
not fun the first couple times I play
this<00:01:28.650> game<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.130> we'll<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.490> after<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.119> how

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
this game but we'll see after that how

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.450 
this game but we'll see after that how
this<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:30.720> progresses<00:01:31.350> now<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.310> we

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
this really progresses now as we

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.830 
this really progresses now as we
continue<00:01:32.790> through<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> trailer<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.509> actually

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
continue through the trailer we actually

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.990 
continue through the trailer we actually
get<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> new<00:01:34.610> blunderbuss<00:01:35.610> that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
get to see the new blunderbuss that
Lilith<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.140> using<00:01:37.470> over<00:01:37.650> there<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.890> right

the map and we get a lot of these tanks
and<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.170> see<00:01:58.290> we're<00:01:58.409> underwater<00:01:58.829> so

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
and we can see we're underwater so

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.249 
and we can see we're underwater so
whatever<00:01:59.430> Leon<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.759> under<00:02:00.090> deck<00:02:00.750> facility

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
whatever Leon this under deck facility

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.709 
whatever Leon this under deck facility
we<00:02:01.439> might<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.740> these<00:02:02.090> aquatic<00:02:03.090> shelters<00:02:03.689> in

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
we might have these aquatic shelters in

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.999 
we might have these aquatic shelters in
there<00:02:03.960> too<00:02:04.170> much<00:02:04.350> might<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.710> something<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
there too much might be something to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:05.929 
there too much might be something to
look<00:02:05.040> forward<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.640> also<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:05.909> our

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
look forward to but we also have our

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.340 
look forward to but we also have our
Goliath<00:02:06.210> suit<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.659> will<00:02:06.750> see<00:02:06.899> later<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.140> this

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
Goliath suit that will see later on this

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.109 
Goliath suit that will see later on this
gameplay<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.399> interesting<00:02:08.759> stuff

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
gameplay but just interesting stuff

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.369 
gameplay but just interesting stuff
to<00:02:09.299> point<00:02:09.509> out<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.899> then<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.170> little

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
to point out and then we have little

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.330 
to point out and then we have little
walk<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.739> here<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:10.920> again<00:02:11.099> we<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
walk in here and again we have the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.589 
walk in here and again we have the
blunderbuss<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.000> what<00:02:12.150> looks<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.510> be

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
blunderbuss and what looks like to be

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.360 
blunderbuss and what looks like to be
the<00:02:12.750> exosuit<00:02:13.319> station<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.890> background

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
the exosuit station in the background

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.309 
the exosuit station in the background
again<00:02:15.090> another<00:02:15.269> one<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.510> those<00:02:15.599> cocktails<00:02:16.140> at

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
again another one of those cocktails at

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.720 
again another one of those cocktails at
the<00:02:16.379> bottom<00:02:16.799> it<00:02:16.950> seems<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:17.459> we're<00:02:17.640> still

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
the bottom it seems like we're still

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.280 
the bottom it seems like we're still
gonna<00:02:17.849> have<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.150> multi-level<00:02:18.840> feeling<00:02:19.200> to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
gonna have that multi-level feeling to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.690 
gonna have that multi-level feeling to
this<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.590> seems<00:02:19.709> like<00:02:19.980> there's<00:02:20.190> almost<00:02:20.310> three

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
this it seems like there's almost three

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.089 
this it seems like there's almost three
or<00:02:20.909> four<00:02:21.269> levels<00:02:21.659> to<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:21.989> map<00:02:22.379> so<00:02:22.709> that'll<00:02:23.010> be

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
or four levels to this map so that'll be

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.920 
or four levels to this map so that'll be
something<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.370> look<00:02:23.430> forward<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.879> and<00:02:24.090> what

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
something to look forward to and what

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.030 
something to look forward to and what
let's<00:02:25.080> continue<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.440> with<00:02:25.620> trailer<00:02:25.829> and<00:02:25.980> I'll

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
let's continue on with trailer and I'll

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.250 
let's continue on with trailer and I'll
show<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.280> what<00:02:26.400> I'm<00:02:26.519> talking<00:02:26.549> about<00:02:27.140> as<00:02:28.140> you

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
continue here we're getting a split

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.949 
continue here we're getting a split
second<00:02:29.849> here<00:02:30.000> we're<00:02:30.150> going<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.329> see<00:02:30.450> our<00:02:30.629> necks

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
second here we're going to see our necks

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.350 
second here we're going to see our necks
come<00:02:31.319> back<00:02:31.500> combination<00:02:32.430> teleporter<00:02:32.970> zombie

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
come back combination teleporter zombie

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.390 
come back combination teleporter zombie

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
it looks like we have our red spike guy

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.800 
it looks like we have our red spike guy
combined<00:02:35.849> with<00:02:36.030> what<00:02:36.269> was<00:02:36.450> our<00:02:36.629> blue

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
combined with what was our blue

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.180
