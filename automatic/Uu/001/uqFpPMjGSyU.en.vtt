00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.130
 Today we want to show you how you are 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.619
 make a vegetable pulp yourself 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.380
 and we will assist again 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.809
 steffi goldenbaum nutritionist 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.699
 the company's role 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.579
 we are preparing a potato today 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.559
 carrot free to we have here now 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.879
 ever started 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.860
 carrot and potatoes too 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.970
 peel and become only now 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.769
 then cut small 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.900
 the carrot and the potato go 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:56.640
 then subsequently into the pot of be 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:00.510
 Steamed with a little water for about 20 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.239
 minutes exactly 20 to 30 minutes 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.309
 can you then cook the vegetables in the pot 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.920
 or cook would also be a 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.509
 steamer can also have the vegetables in the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.390
 to prepare steamers 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.909
 but I think in heerdt is the common one 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.520
 method 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:22.350
 and if everything is well cooked now you are 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.480
 you can just check it by her 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.450
 Let's see the vegetables then pop 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.490
 he is still very hard or is it already 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.860
 become soft 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.150
 we'll let it simmer here and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.880
 Of course we already have something 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.909
 we have already prepared here 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.320
 the finished carrots of potato porridge 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.570
 Then do it like this after having it here 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.510
 vegetables with a hand blender once 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.000
 have touched if you have too much water 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.030
 you have to disconnect then you just go 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.549
 little bit of the cooking water but 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.900
 otherwise you can have the vegetables right in 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.690
 parry the pot too 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.549
 something of that with that residual water 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.310
 the thinnest remaining is a fourth 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.259
 taste quite good 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.590
 Of course , the price does not have to 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.900
 be seasoned and not salted 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.440
 it is very big for the babies 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.220
 Taste the vegetables 1 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.590
 So you do not have to do anything 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.260
 It would be important to add that in 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.300
 In this area people eat all the way 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.820
 get some rape oil 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.500
 The price is almost fat-free 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.200
 that's why there just has to be one here 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:43.800
 little oil to be added there 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.380
 To add two teaspoons it would be now 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.820
 just the carrot potato 3 of the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.050
 Of course it can be extended 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.400
 for example, with 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.150
 flake if you have one 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.310
 would like to choose a vegetarian variant 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.440
 but was also with, for example 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.300
 meat would be there for example 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.920
 content could be glazed for this purpose 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.820
 you could of course use one 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.450
 meat and mash itself thinnest 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.110
 and then the carrot potato too wide 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.990
 give 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.490
 So there is the decision for everyone 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.620
 let alone or glass 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:25.380
 would like to use or meat itself 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:28.709
 I want to prepare it think if you 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:33.209
 cooks himself cooks the free or 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.739
 KÃ¼sschen is the must as I said 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.860
 everyone decide for themselves 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.600
 it is important if you cook that yourself 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.250
 you look where they come from 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.070
 vegetables 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.690
 either you have a gardener rest that 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.880
 refer directly to you in the vicinity 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.070
 then you know that it too 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.170
 little regionality is involved and 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.600
 could also ask like that 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.060
 vegetables are grown 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.790
 whether to use any injections 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.940
 or other things or you 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.150
 just have to bio vegetables 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.660
 To fall back on 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.820
 your advantage the glass is cost that 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.870
 the high legal requirements 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.330
 correspond 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.850
 and especially in the selection of raw materials 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.560
 is there 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.860
 They really care for baby food 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.950
 are suitable we wish you now 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.320
 Have fun trying it out if you have one 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.850
 Price prepared or just times 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.870
 you through the glass variety 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.870
 Try a lot of fun
