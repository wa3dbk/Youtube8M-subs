00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939

playing directly from the box without

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.060 
playing directly from the box without
issue<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.280> also<00:01:11.520> passes<00:01:11.970> DTS<00:01:12.750> audio<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.500> Dolby

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
Digital Audio to a home theater receiver

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.600 
Digital Audio to a home theater receiver
so<00:01:16.259> what<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.830> with<00:01:16.950> my<00:01:16.979> blu-rays<00:01:17.430> is

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
so what I like to do with my blu-rays is

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.300 
so what I like to do with my blu-rays is
basically<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.060> take<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.080> disc<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.590> write

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
basically just take the disc and write

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
basically just take the disc and write
it<00:01:20.430> out<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.700> MKV<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:21.540> store<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.110> mymy

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
it out to MKV and then store it on mymy

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.859 
it out to MKV and then store it on mymy
cloud<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.580> play<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:23.909> any<00:01:24.090> TV<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
cloud so I can play it on any TV in the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.899 
cloud so I can play it on any TV in the
house<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:26.070> has<00:01:26.220> been<00:01:26.340> able<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.549> play<00:01:26.790> it

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
house and this has been able to play it

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.149 
house and this has been able to play it
back<00:01:27.060> only<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.479> Roku<00:01:27.840> has<00:01:28.020> been<00:01:28.229> able<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.040> do

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
back only the Roku has been able to do

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.830 
back only the Roku has been able to do
that<00:01:29.310> up<00:01:29.430> until<00:01:29.579> now<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:29.909> that's<00:01:30.240> been<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> good

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that up until now so that's been a good

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.469 
that up until now so that's been a good
little<00:01:31.829> thing<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.640> say<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.970> pretty

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
little thing there so it's say a pretty

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.539 
little thing there so it's say a pretty
complete<00:01:34.049> device<00:01:34.380> although<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.220> lacking

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
complete device although it is lacking

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.910 
complete device although it is lacking
Netflix<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.630> won't<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.110> able<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.320> do

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
Netflix so you won't be able to do

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.550 
Netflix so you won't be able to do
Netflix<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.479> does<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.659> YouTube

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
Netflix on it but it does have YouTube

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.899 
Netflix on it but it does have YouTube
so<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:40.860> you're<00:01:40.950> watching<00:01:41.250> me<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.369> YouTube<00:01:41.790> you

hard<00:01:58.170> wired<00:01:58.380> Ethernet<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.070> actually

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
hard wired Ethernet and I actually

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.520 
hard wired Ethernet and I actually
suggest<00:01:59.600> using<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> Ethernet<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
suggest using the Ethernet and the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.380 
suggest using the Ethernet and the
reason<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.219> especially<00:02:03.180> when<00:02:03.299> you're

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
reason is is that especially when you're

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.090 
reason is is that especially when you're

possible to playback that file and I

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.780

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
pull that up and what it does is it

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.850

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
now we're connected to my plex server

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.500 
now we're connected to my plex server
via<00:03:43.860> DLNA<00:03:44.459> it's<00:03:44.640> going<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.820> take<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:44.970> second<00:03:45.390> for

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
via DLNA it's going to take a second for

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.210 
via DLNA it's going to take a second for
it<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.630> stream<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.019> video<00:03:46.260> up<00:03:46.560> but<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:46.830> believe

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
it to stream the video up but I believe

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.560 
it to stream the video up but I believe
it<00:03:47.370> should<00:03:47.400> start<00:03:47.790> playing<00:03:48.090> pretty<00:03:48.299> quickly

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
it should start playing pretty quickly

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
it should start playing pretty quickly
yep<00:03:48.959> there<00:03:49.140> we<00:03:49.260> go

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
yep there we go

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.530 
yep there we go

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
what's neat about this video player is

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.660 
what's neat about this video player is
that<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.410> will<00:03:52.620> work<00:03:52.860> with<00:03:53.130> whatever<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.640> have

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
storage because what I have here is a

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.050 
storage because what I have here is a
little<00:04:01.260> memory<00:04:01.530> card<00:04:01.950> with<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.700> couple<00:04:02.970> of

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
little memory card with a couple of

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.310 
little memory card with a couple of

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.010 
cloud I can scan my blu-ray library and
then<00:04:43.590> select<00:04:44.040> a<00:04:44.820> movie<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.600> maybe<00:04:45.900> we'll

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
then select a movie and maybe we'll

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.870 
then select a movie and maybe we'll
watch<00:04:46.140> some<00:04:46.290> spider-man<00:04:46.800> hit<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.610> button

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
watch some spider-man hit the button

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.540 
watch some spider-man hit the button
here<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:48.720> will<00:04:48.900> start<00:04:49.410> up<00:04:50.010> pretty<00:04:50.250> quickly

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
here and it will start up pretty quickly

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.790 
here and it will start up pretty quickly
and<00:04:50.700> again<00:04:50.940> this<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.270> full<00:04:51.660> blu-ray<00:04:52.410> movie

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
and I and I like it again strictly

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.360 
and I and I like it again strictly
because<00:05:24.270> it<00:05:24.570> can<00:05:24.690> playback<00:05:24.960> so<00:05:25.590> much<00:05:26.010> and<00:05:26.340> I

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
because it can playback so much and I

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.190 
because it can playback so much and I
think<00:05:26.430> that's<00:05:26.760> something<00:05:27.000> that<00:05:27.180> has<00:05:27.570> been

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
think that's something that has been

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.530 
think that's something that has been
lacking<00:05:28.440> from<00:05:28.800> other<00:05:29.010> devices<00:05:29.430> my<00:05:29.790> favourite
