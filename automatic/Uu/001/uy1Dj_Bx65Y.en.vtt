00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
steering with the Leaning the board is

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.359 
steering with the Leaning the board is
kind<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.080> curved<00:01:22.890> upward<00:01:23.869> really<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:25.020> that

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
kind of curved upward really like that

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.800 
kind of curved upward really like that
just<00:01:26.369> kind<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:27.110> gives<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.350> nice<00:01:29.420> bounce<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
just kind of gives it a nice bounce to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.640 
just kind of gives it a nice bounce to
it<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:32.250> wheels<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:33.470> MPs<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:35.040> go<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.280> about

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
it the wheels are MPs they go to about

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.800 
it the wheels are MPs they go to about
60<00:01:39.140> 60<00:01:40.140> psi<00:01:40.680> for<00:01:41.280> max<00:01:41.670> inflation<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.890> then<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
60 60 psi for max inflation and then the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.080 
60 60 psi for max inflation and then the
trucks<00:01:45.810> are<00:01:46.200> vectors<00:01:47.479> by<00:01:48.479> MBS<00:01:49.250> it's<00:01:50.250> right

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
trucks are vectors by MBS it's right

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.270 
trucks are vectors by MBS it's right
there<00:01:51.350> it's<00:01:52.350> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> great<00:01:52.799> suspension

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
there it's going to great suspension

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.440 
there it's going to great suspension
shock<00:01:53.960> in<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.640> board<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.030> basically

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
shock in there so the board is basically

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.660 
shock in there so the board is basically
the<00:01:57.509> same<00:01:57.570> designs<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.280> pretty<00:01:59.460> good

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the same designs is it's a pretty good

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.990 
the same designs is it's a pretty good
bored<00:02:00.140> it's<00:02:01.140> sturdy<00:02:01.560> seems<00:02:02.009> pretty<00:02:02.250> reliable

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
bored it's sturdy seems pretty reliable

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.440 
bored it's sturdy seems pretty reliable
you<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.420> attach<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.409> break<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.030> overall<00:02:06.030> MBS
