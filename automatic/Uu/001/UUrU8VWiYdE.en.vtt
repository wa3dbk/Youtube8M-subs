tap achievement now getting up to this

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
tap achievement now getting up to this
point<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.300> really<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:45.989> difficult<00:00:46.230> just

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
point is really really difficult just

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.750 
point is really really difficult just
because<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.250> how<00:00:47.690> you<00:00:48.690> know<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.840> how<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.469> guess

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
because of how you know just how I guess

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
really all you have to do is just get

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.170 
really all you have to do is just get
strong<00:00:56.010> guns<00:00:56.309> out<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> box<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.000> that's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
strong guns out of the box but that's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.970 
strong guns out of the box but that's
easier<00:00:57.600> said<00:00:57.660> than<00:00:57.960> done<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.170> got<00:00:58.410> really<00:00:58.770> lucky

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
easier said than done I got really lucky

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.580 
easier said than done I got really lucky
with<00:00:59.219> my<00:00:59.399> box<00:00:59.670> pulled<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:01.050> think<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.410> like

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
with my box pulled and I think in like

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.260 
with my box pulled and I think in like
four<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:01.980> five<00:01:02.039> hits<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.609> meant<00:01:02.820> she<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
four or five hits I meant she get the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.140 
four or five hits I meant she get the
blunderbuss<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.899> Trident<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:05.580> think<00:01:06.060> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
blunderbuss the Trident and I think it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.230 
blunderbuss the Trident and I think it
was<00:01:06.240> nano<00:01:06.450> swarms<00:01:07.250> either<00:01:08.250> way<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:08.909> want

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
was nano swarms either way you just want

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.719 
was nano swarms either way you just want
to<00:01:09.299> try<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:10.470> strong<00:01:10.830> guns<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.189> highly

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
to try and get strong guns I highly

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
to try and get strong guns I highly
recommend<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> blunderbuss<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.049> if<00:01:13.500> you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
recommend the blunderbuss and if you

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.710 
recommend the blunderbuss and if you
can't<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.070> at<00:01:14.130> least<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.610> cel-3<00:01:15.150> just

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
can't get that at least get cel-3 just

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.580 
can't get that at least get cel-3 just
because<00:01:15.960> it'll<00:01:16.110> make<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> lot<00:01:16.530> easier

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
because it'll make it a lot easier

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.789 
because it'll make it a lot easier
killing<00:01:17.250> oz<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.840> other<00:01:18.840> than<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.259> really

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
killing oz and other than that really

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
killing oz and other than that really
all<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.070> need<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
all you need to do is just get the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.270 
all you need to do is just get the
strongest<00:01:21.869> guns<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.200> possibly<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.860> since

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
strongest guns you possibly can since

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.590 
strongest guns you possibly can since
there's<00:01:23.490> no<00:01:23.610> point<00:01:23.850> trying<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.240> get<00:01:24.360> point

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
there's no point trying to get point

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.410 
there's no point trying to get point
whoring<00:01:24.900> guns<00:01:25.610> since<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.759> don't<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.030> points

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
whoring guns since you don't get points

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.810 
whoring guns since you don't get points
like<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.049> double<00:01:28.439> feature<00:01:28.820> another

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
like that and double feature another

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.580 
like that and double feature another
thing<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.150> take<00:01:30.270> note<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.500> I

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
thing to take note of is that like I

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.230 
thing to take note of is that like I
said<00:01:31.770> earlier<00:01:32.070> try<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> blunderbuss

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
said earlier try to get the blunderbuss

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.260 
said earlier try to get the blunderbuss
it's<00:01:33.689> by<00:01:34.290> far<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.100> strongest<00:01:35.490> gun<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.119> you

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
it's by far the strongest gun that you

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.550 
it's by far the strongest gun that you
can<00:01:36.420> use<00:01:36.600> against<00:01:37.110> oz<00:01:37.549> two<00:01:38.549> shots<00:01:39.020> each<00:01:40.020> time

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
can use against oz two shots each time

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.179 
can use against oz two shots each time
you<00:01:41.299> decontaminate<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.570> guess<00:01:43.380> decontaminate

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
you decontaminate I guess decontaminate

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.999 
you decontaminate I guess decontaminate
him<00:01:44.509> we'll<00:01:45.509> send<00:01:45.780> him<00:01:45.930> into<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.500> next<00:01:46.829> phase

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
him we'll send him into the next phase

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.889 
him we'll send him into the next phase
where<00:01:47.310> he'll<00:01:47.490> teleport<00:01:47.970> away<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.540> zombies

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
where he'll teleport away and on zombies

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.510 
where he'll teleport away and on zombies
will<00:01:49.020> spawn<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.890> really<00:01:50.159> that's<00:01:50.369> all

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
will spawn in it so really that's all

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.310 
will spawn in it so really that's all
you<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:51.000> which<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.990> said<00:01:52.020> is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
you have to do which like I said is

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.539 
you have to do which like I said is
easier<00:01:52.619> said<00:01:52.710> than<00:01:53.250> done

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
easier said than done

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.030 
easier said than done
so<00:01:53.939> at<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> end<00:01:54.720> you'll<00:01:55.140> see<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> video<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.740> me
