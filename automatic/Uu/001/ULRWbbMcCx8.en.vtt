pads it is a sealed headphone I did find

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.739 
pads it is a sealed headphone I did find
that<00:01:49.039> I<00:01:49.069> could<00:01:49.310> get<00:01:49.429> a<00:01:49.490> good<00:01:49.969> seal<00:01:50.420> when<00:01:50.689> I

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
that I could get a good seal when I

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:55.569 
that I could get a good seal when I
measured<00:01:51.259> these<00:01:51.409> headphones<00:01:51.679> but<00:01:53.049> I<00:01:54.429> think<00:01:55.429> in

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
measured these headphones but I think in

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.249 
measured these headphones but I think in
practice<00:01:56.149> it's<00:01:56.359> going<00:01:56.539> to<00:01:56.600> be<00:01:56.719> a<00:01:56.749> little<00:01:56.990> hard

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
practice it's going to be a little hard

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.690 
practice it's going to be a little hard
to<00:01:57.439> keep<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.740> good<00:01:57.770> seal<00:01:58.159> with<00:01:58.310> this<00:01:58.490> type<00:01:58.670> of

to keep a good seal with this type of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.769 
to keep a good seal with this type of
headphone<00:01:59.149> I<00:01:59.359> mean<00:01:59.509> that's<00:01:59.659> just

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
traditionally the case there are very

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.039 
traditionally the case there are very

200<00:02:28.420> -<00:02:28.959> 2<00:02:30.540> sends<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.599> lot<00:02:31.780> better<00:02:32.049> and<00:02:32.379> is

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
200 - 2 sends a lot better and is

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:41.240 
200 - 2 sends a lot better and is
remarkably<00:02:33.549> smaller<00:02:34.079> this<00:02:35.079> headphone<00:02:35.760> folds

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.740 

into<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.430> very<00:02:43.060> small<00:02:43.989> size<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:45.159> you<00:02:45.970> can<00:02:46.000> just

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
into a very small size that you can just

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.589 
into a very small size that you can just
easily<00:02:47.079> fit<00:02:47.590> into<00:02:47.889> your<00:02:48.099> pocket<00:02:48.760> or<00:02:48.909> and<00:02:49.389> it

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
easily fit into your pocket or and it

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.179 
easily fit into your pocket or and it
comes<00:02:49.810> with<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:50.049> small<00:02:50.169> carrying<00:02:50.650> case<00:02:50.829> as<00:02:51.010> well

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
comes with a small carrying case as well

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:56.089 
comes with a small carrying case as well
but<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.609> mean<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:52.419> headphone<00:02:53.169> is<00:02:53.500> much<00:02:54.459> larger

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
but I mean this headphone is much larger

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:03.569 
but I mean this headphone is much larger
when<00:02:57.099> folded<00:02:58.319> as<00:02:59.319> you<00:02:59.530> can<00:02:59.680> see<00:02:59.919> so<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:03.400> is

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
when folded as you can see so I this is

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.270 
when folded as you can see so I this is
also<00:03:03.790> similar<00:03:04.389> to<00:03:04.419> the<00:03:04.659> cost<00:03:05.439> Porter<00:03:06.069> pro

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
also similar to the cost Porter pro

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.339 
also similar to the cost Porter pro
headphone<00:03:06.700> that<00:03:06.730> also<00:03:07.329> gets<00:03:07.599> much<00:03:07.989> smaller

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
headphone that also gets much smaller

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.580 
headphone that also gets much smaller
when<00:03:08.680> it's<00:03:09.659> folded<00:03:10.659> up<00:03:10.750> for<00:03:10.810> storage<00:03:11.470> or

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
when it's folded up for storage or

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.789 
when it's folded up for storage or
travel<00:03:12.069> so<00:03:12.819> while<00:03:13.569> they're<00:03:13.900> relatively<00:03:14.590> small

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
travel so while they're relatively small

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.009 
travel so while they're relatively small
or<00:03:15.549> should<00:03:15.849> be<00:03:16.000> relatively<00:03:16.419> small<00:03:16.569> headphone

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
or should be relatively small headphone

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.860 
or should be relatively small headphone
that<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.799> really<00:03:18.040> don't<00:03:18.159> gain<00:03:18.489> much<00:03:18.909> in<00:03:19.659> terms

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
that you really don't gain much in terms

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.839 
that you really don't gain much in terms
of<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.169> size<00:03:20.409> like<00:03:20.799> I<00:03:20.919> say<00:03:21.099> this<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.430> fairly

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
of the size like I say this is a fairly

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:29.099 
of the size like I say this is a fairly
big<00:03:22.180> pouch<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.959> be<00:03:23.260> carrying<00:03:23.680> around<00:03:27.449> also<00:03:28.449> the

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
big pouch to be carrying around also the

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.050 
big pouch to be carrying around also the
ear<00:03:29.349> pads<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:32.349> Sennheiser<00:03:32.829> as<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:33.639> can<00:03:33.790> see

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
ear pads the Sennheiser as you can see

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:42.089 
ear pads the Sennheiser as you can see
here<00:03:35.040> line<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.220> cable<00:03:40.530> but<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.680> Sennheiser

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
here line the cable but the Sennheiser

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.640 
here line the cable but the Sennheiser
earpieces<00:03:42.729> as<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.150> can<00:03:43.329> see<00:03:43.510> wiggle<00:03:44.019> in<00:03:44.260> all

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
earpieces as you can see wiggle in all

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.180 
earpieces as you can see wiggle in all
directions<00:03:45.359> very<00:03:46.359> easily<00:03:46.659> and<00:03:47.190> these

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
directions very easily and these

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.670 
directions very easily and these
headphones<00:03:49.109> can<00:03:50.109> turn<00:03:50.349> in<00:03:50.530> this<00:03:50.620> direction

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
headphones can turn in this direction

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.119 
headphones can turn in this direction
but<00:03:51.340> they<00:03:51.519> don't<00:03:51.819> really<00:03:52.810> turn<00:03:53.260> very<00:03:53.620> much<00:03:53.889> in

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
but they don't really turn very much in

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.979 
but they don't really turn very much in
this<00:03:54.370> direction<00:03:54.579> and<00:03:55.120> when<00:03:55.269> I<00:03:55.299> put<00:03:55.599> them<00:03:55.780> on

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
this direction and when I put them on

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.500 
this direction and when I put them on
they<00:03:56.859> tend<00:03:57.189> to<00:03:57.250> have<00:03:57.400> more<00:03:57.669> pressure<00:03:58.060> at<00:03:58.389> the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
they tend to have more pressure at the

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.719 
they tend to have more pressure at the
bottom<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:59.049> my<00:03:59.079> ear<00:03:59.379> than<00:03:59.799> at<00:03:59.919> the<00:04:00.040> top<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.549> my

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
bottom of my ear than at the top of my

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:04.890 
bottom of my ear than at the top of my
ear<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:02.099> in<00:04:03.099> as<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.849> and<00:04:04.150> you<00:04:04.389> really<00:04:04.689> can't

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
ear and in as a and you really can't

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.050 
ear and in as a and you really can't
adjust<00:04:05.319> that<00:04:05.560> it's<00:04:06.340> just<00:04:06.519> gonna<00:04:06.669> stay<00:04:07.030> that

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
adjust that it's just gonna stay that

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.740 
adjust that it's just gonna stay that
way<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.919> found<00:04:09.159> some<00:04:09.310> organ<00:04:09.639> Amish<00:04:09.970> issues

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
way so I found some organ Amish issues

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.659 
way so I found some organ Amish issues
with<00:04:10.900> these<00:04:11.049> headphones<00:04:11.290> as<00:04:11.650> well<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:12.099> then

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
with these headphones as well and then

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.759 
with these headphones as well and then
there's<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:13.030> sound<00:04:13.209> quality<00:04:13.780> which<00:04:14.079> has

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
there's the sound quality which has

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.499 
there's the sound quality which has
fairly<00:04:15.069> good<00:04:15.310> bass<00:04:15.459> response<00:04:15.669> fairly<00:04:16.329> flat

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:16.509 
fairly good bass response fairly flat

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:18.599 
fairly good bass response fairly flat
goes<00:04:16.840> fairly<00:04:17.109> low<00:04:17.409> fairly<00:04:17.859> well<00:04:18.009> extended<00:04:18.489> if

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
goes fairly low fairly well extended if

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.300 
goes fairly low fairly well extended if
you<00:04:18.699> can<00:04:18.820> get<00:04:18.909> a<00:04:18.940> good<00:04:19.150> seal<00:04:19.389> on<00:04:19.419> here<00:04:19.959> and

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
you can get a good seal on here and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.280 
you can get a good seal on here and
you<00:04:20.700> can<00:04:21.000> get<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.329> good<00:04:21.510> seal<00:04:21.780> I<00:04:21.810> don't<00:04:22.109> know<00:04:22.200> if

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
you can get a good seal I don't know if

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.540 
you can get a good seal I don't know if
you're<00:04:22.410> going<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.620> keep<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.950> good<00:04:23.100> seal

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
you're going to keep a good seal

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.590 
you're going to keep a good seal
but<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:25.710> mid-range<00:04:26.250> is<00:04:26.490> terribly<00:04:27.060> uneven

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
but the mid-range is terribly uneven

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.960 
but the mid-range is terribly uneven
sounds<00:04:28.110> kind<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.350> honky<00:04:28.889> and<00:04:29.100> boxy<00:04:29.520> sounding

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
sounds kind of honky and boxy sounding

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.020 
sounds kind of honky and boxy sounding
the<00:04:30.150> treble<00:04:30.510> is<00:04:30.720> is<00:04:31.320> not<00:04:31.530> bad<00:04:31.830> but<00:04:32.130> it's<00:04:32.370> very

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
the treble is is not bad but it's very

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.030 
the treble is is not bad but it's very
low<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.419> level<00:04:33.810> relative<00:04:34.169> to<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.650> mid-range

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
low and level relative to the mid-range

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.260 
low and level relative to the mid-range
and<00:04:35.310> bass<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:35.760> you<00:04:35.820> end<00:04:36.030> up<00:04:36.120> with<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.380> kind<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.440> a

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
and bass so you end up with a kind of a

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.680 
and bass so you end up with a kind of a
murky<00:04:40.100> confused<00:04:41.270> roll<00:04:42.270> off<00:04:42.570> but<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.800> know

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
murky confused roll off but you know

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:51.560 
murky confused roll off but you know
muffled<00:04:46.040> mess<00:04:47.660> but<00:04:49.010> as<00:04:50.010> I<00:04:50.160> say<00:04:50.370> it's<00:04:50.610> not<00:04:50.669> it's

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
muffled mess but as I say it's not it's

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.480 
muffled mess but as I say it's not it's
not<00:04:51.690> horrible<00:04:52.020> it's<00:04:52.560> just<00:04:52.830> that<00:04:52.979> you<00:04:53.070> can<00:04:53.250> get

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
not horrible it's just that you can get

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.610 
not horrible it's just that you can get
so<00:04:53.880> much<00:04:54.030> better<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.630> here's<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.410> thing<00:04:55.560> that

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
so much better and here's the thing that

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.909 
so much better and here's the thing that
really<00:04:55.950> bothers<00:04:56.460> me<00:04:56.490> about<00:04:56.639> this<00:04:57.919> these

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
really bothers me about this these

1 8 le this headphone it's a limited
edition<00:05:26.789> headphone<00:05:27.450> I<00:05:27.479> think<00:05:27.750> they're

edition headphone I think they're

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.870 
edition headphone I think they're
getting<00:05:27.960> near<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:28.380> end<00:05:28.550> used<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.760> be

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
getting near the end used to be

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.900 
getting near the end used to be
available<00:05:30.030> in<00:05:30.780> a<00:05:31.110> beautiful<00:05:31.770> green<00:05:31.979> that<00:05:32.760> was

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
available in a beautiful green that was

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.350 
available in a beautiful green that was
just<00:05:33.390> like<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.810> Quincy<00:05:34.140> Jones<00:05:34.440> green<00:05:34.830> and

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
just like the Quincy Jones green and

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.719 
just like the Quincy Jones green and
could<00:05:36.360> have<00:05:36.510> had<00:05:36.660> green<00:05:37.320> cables<00:05:37.890> if<00:05:38.130> they<00:05:38.430> so

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
could have had green cables if they so

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.040 
could have had green cables if they so
wanted<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.419> this<00:05:40.200> headphone<00:05:40.910> is<00:05:41.910> not<00:05:42.479> that

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
wanted and this headphone is not that

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:53.090 
wanted and this headphone is not that
much<00:05:43.380> larger<00:05:44.630> than<00:05:45.630> the<00:05:46.550> Q<00:05:47.550> 460<00:05:49.340> I<00:05:51.800> mean<00:05:52.800> it<00:05:52.919> is

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
much larger than the Q 460 I mean it is

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.980 
much larger than the Q 460 I mean it is
larger<00:05:53.610> there's<00:05:53.820> no<00:05:53.940> doubt<00:05:54.210> but<00:05:54.539> I<00:05:54.600> think<00:05:54.870> it's

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
larger there's no doubt but I think it's

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.290 
larger there's no doubt but I think it's
not<00:05:55.169> hugely<00:05:55.800> larger<00:05:56.370> this<00:05:56.580> isn't<00:05:56.910> gonna<00:05:57.030> fit

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
not hugely larger this isn't gonna fit

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.659 
not hugely larger this isn't gonna fit
in<00:05:57.389> your<00:05:57.479> pocket<00:05:57.720> anyway<00:05:58.320> within<00:05:58.860> this<00:05:59.340> case

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
in your pocket anyway within this case

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.850 
in your pocket anyway within this case
so<00:06:00.270> if<00:06:00.630> you're<00:06:00.840> gonna<00:06:00.930> put<00:06:01.169> it<00:06:01.260> in<00:06:01.350> a<00:06:01.410> bag<00:06:01.620> you

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
so if you're gonna put it in a bag you

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.350 
so if you're gonna put it in a bag you
might<00:06:01.979> as<00:06:02.100> well<00:06:02.190> have<00:06:02.310> something<00:06:02.550> larger<00:06:03.090> and

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
might as well have something larger and

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.500 
might as well have something larger and
this<00:06:04.200> headphone<00:06:04.680> seals<00:06:05.190> much<00:06:05.700> better<00:06:05.970> so<00:06:06.419> you

this headphone seals much better so you
