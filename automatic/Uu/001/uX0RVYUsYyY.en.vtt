now<00:02:07.030> as<00:02:07.180> you<00:02:07.270> can<00:02:07.360> see<00:02:07.420> right<00:02:07.720> here<00:02:07.750> the

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
now as you can see right here the

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.869 
now as you can see right here the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
factory installed loader joystick it is

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.630 
factory installed loader joystick it is
a<00:02:09.910> nice<00:02:10.239> clean<00:02:10.929> fit<00:02:11.379> and<00:02:11.530> finish<00:02:11.860> it's

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
a nice clean fit and finish it's

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.220 
a nice clean fit and finish it's
integrated<00:02:13.210> into<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.450> right-hand<00:02:13.600> console

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
integrated into the right-hand console

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.750 
integrated into the right-hand console
in<00:02:14.350> its<00:02:14.440> position<00:02:14.710> right<00:02:15.430> there<00:02:15.580> for<00:02:15.700> the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
in its position right there for the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.250 
in its position right there for the
operator<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.210> grab<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.630> operate<00:02:16.720> it

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
operator to grab it and operate it

operator to grab it and operate it
so<00:02:17.500> it's<00:02:17.830> conveniently-placed<00:02:18.430> but<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.330> just

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
so it's conveniently-placed but it just

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.180

your loader connection the dealer
doesn't<00:02:32.049> have<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.319> install<00:02:32.739> them<00:02:32.920> there's<00:02:33.730> not

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
doesn't have to install them there's not

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.430 
doesn't have to install them there's not
a<00:02:33.910> kit<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.180> has<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.540> come<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:34.900> for<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.260> it's

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
a kit that has to come in for it it's

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.170 
a kit that has to come in for it it's
all<00:02:35.560> done<00:02:35.799> at<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.010> factory<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.670> again<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.060> get

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
all done at the factory so again you get

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.970 
all done at the factory so again you get
the<00:02:37.330> factory<00:02:37.810> fit<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.410> finish<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.920> the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
the factory fit and finish and the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.030 
the factory fit and finish and the
assembly<00:02:39.720> for<00:02:40.720> all<00:02:40.930> 4600<00:02:41.650> series<00:02:41.860> it's

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
assembly for all 4600 series it's

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.949 
assembly for all 4600 series it's
certainly<00:02:42.280> capable<00:02:42.519> of<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.329> saves<00:02:43.840> the

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
certainly capable of it so it saves the

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.780 
certainly capable of it so it saves the
dealer<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.290> time<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.650> installation<00:02:45.220> but<00:02:45.670> it's

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
dealer the time of installation but it's

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.819 
dealer the time of installation but it's
also<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:46.329> nice<00:02:46.629> factory<00:02:47.530> fit<00:02:47.709> and

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
also just that nice factory fit and

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.380 
also just that nice factory fit and
finish<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.129> comes<00:02:48.340> with<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.640> we<00:02:49.180> talked

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
finish that comes with it we talked

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.729 
finish that comes with it we talked
about<00:02:49.540> load<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:49.930> joysticks<00:02:50.319> on<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.440> lot<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.650> your

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
about load of joysticks on a lot of your

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.380 
about load of joysticks on a lot of your
competition<00:02:51.160> it's<00:02:51.910> almost<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.299> the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
competition it's almost like the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.030 
competition it's almost like the
tractors<00:02:52.750> they<00:02:53.019> hadn't<00:02:53.290> thought<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.530> loaders

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
tractors they hadn't thought of loaders

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.530 
tractors they hadn't thought of loaders
when<00:02:54.250> they<00:02:54.340> were<00:02:54.400> designing<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.849> tractor<00:02:55.209> the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
when they were designing the tractor the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.030 
when they were designing the tractor the
loader<00:02:55.750> joystick<00:02:56.170> it's<00:02:56.290> kind<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.560> bolt-on

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
loader joystick it's kind of a bolt-on

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.220 
loader joystick it's kind of a bolt-on
design<00:02:57.519> it's<00:02:57.819> like<00:02:57.970> oh<00:02:58.209> there<00:02:59.079> was<00:02:59.170> an

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
design it's like oh there was an

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.960 
design it's like oh there was an
afterthought<00:02:59.650> right<00:03:00.010> with<00:03:00.519> honors<00:03:00.760> it's<00:03:00.940> a

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
afterthought right with honors it's a

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.910 
afterthought right with honors it's a
nice<00:03:01.090> fit<00:03:01.359> and<00:03:01.390> finish<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.930> it's<00:03:02.019> just<00:03:02.200> these

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
nice fit and finish and it's just these

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.220 
nice fit and finish and it's just these
tractors<00:03:03.250> were<00:03:03.400> designed<00:03:03.940> for<00:03:04.390> loader<00:03:04.930> work

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
tractors were designed for loader work

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.069 
tractors were designed for loader work
and<00:03:05.650> with<00:03:05.859> a<00:03:05.890> 70<00:03:06.340> or<00:03:06.370> over<00:03:07.030> 17<00:03:07.569> gallon<00:03:07.870> minute

would<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.599> cost<00:03:22.720> your<00:03:22.930> operation<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.560> not<00:03:23.889> have

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
would it cost your operation to not have
