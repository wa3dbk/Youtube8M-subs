his fleet he they've been used with the
same<00:01:45.960> fuel<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.649> same<00:01:46.860> driving<00:01:47.430> habits<00:01:47.909> and

same fuel the same driving habits and

same fuel the same driving habits and
whatnot<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.540> he<00:01:48.630> did<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> very<00:01:49.070> extensive

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
whatnot and he did a very extensive

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.520 
whatnot and he did a very extensive
study<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.610> terms<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.210> increasing<00:01:52.200> fuel

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
study in terms of increasing fuel

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.830 
study in terms of increasing fuel
economy<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:53.130> these<00:01:53.280> trucks<00:01:53.640> when<00:01:54.570> he<00:01:54.630> first

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
economy of these trucks when he first

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.749 
economy of these trucks when he first
started<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.380> his<00:01:55.619> baseline<00:01:56.070> fuel<00:01:56.549> economy

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
started this his baseline fuel economy

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.310 
started this his baseline fuel economy
was<00:01:57.180> twelve<00:01:57.450> point<00:01:57.659> eight<00:01:57.810> miles<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.290> gallon

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
was twelve point eight miles a gallon

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.200 
was twelve point eight miles a gallon
that<00:01:58.680> seems<00:01:59.340> terrible<00:01:59.790> but<00:01:59.969> when<00:02:00.090> you're

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that seems terrible but when you're

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.459 
that seems terrible but when you're
talking<00:02:00.270> about<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.600> big<00:02:00.750> box<00:02:00.960> truck<00:02:01.259> that's

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
talking about a big box truck that's

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.469 
talking about a big box truck that's
kind<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.950> way<00:02:02.100> they<00:02:02.280> run<00:02:02.490> he<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.240> getting

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
kind of way they run he was getting

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.480 
kind of way they run he was getting
three<00:02:03.659> hundred<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:03.990> sixty<00:02:04.380> miles<00:02:04.619> per<00:02:04.950> 28

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
three hundred and sixty miles per 28

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.969 
three hundred and sixty miles per 28
gallons<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.719> he<00:02:07.110> wanted<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.469> do<00:02:07.590> some<00:02:07.770> things

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
gallons so he wanted to do some things

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.070 
gallons so he wanted to do some things
to<00:02:08.129> try<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.340> increase<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.209> most<00:02:10.020> of

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
to try to increase that and most of

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.479 
to try to increase that and most of
modern<00:02:10.170> fuel<00:02:10.500> injection<00:02:10.890> systems<00:02:11.310> on

very<00:02:13.540> rich<00:02:13.980> when<00:02:14.980> they're<00:02:15.160> cold<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.730> mean<00:02:16.000> it's

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
very rich when they're cold I mean it's

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.400 
very rich when they're cold I mean it's
kind<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.510> choke<00:02:16.750> sticking<00:02:17.200> on<00:02:17.290> an

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
kind of like the choke sticking on an

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.400 
kind of like the choke sticking on an
old<00:02:17.560> car<00:02:17.830> if<00:02:18.760> anybody<00:02:19.750> else<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.990> remember

sticking<00:02:22.870> choke<00:02:23.080> was<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.290> real<00:02:23.590> problem<00:02:23.980> when

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
sticking choke was a real problem when

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.800 
sticking choke was a real problem when
it<00:02:24.400> came<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.700> fill<00:02:24.850> how<00:02:25.030> many<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.330> guzzle

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
it came to fill how many just guzzle

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.090 
it came to fill how many just guzzle
fill<00:02:25.990> it's<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.290> same<00:02:26.500> thing<00:02:26.710> with<00:02:26.800> modern

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
fill it's the same thing with modern

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.560 
fill it's the same thing with modern
fuel<00:02:27.280> injection<00:02:27.670> if<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.210> engine<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.510> not

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
completely warmed up it's going to get

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.640 
completely warmed up it's going to get
poor<00:02:30.910> fuel<00:02:31.120> economy<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.780> he<00:02:31.990> instituted<00:02:32.560> a

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
poor fuel economy so he instituted a

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.130 
poor fuel economy so he instituted a
program<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.730> showing<00:02:34.330> up<00:02:34.450> early<00:02:34.750> before<00:02:34.870> his

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
program of showing up early before his

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.330 
program of showing up early before his
workers<00:02:35.440> got<00:02:35.620> there<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:35.920> got<00:02:35.980> all<00:02:36.160> eight

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
workers got there and got all eight

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.670 
workers got there and got all eight
trucks<00:02:36.610> up<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.090> running<00:02:37.330> for<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.230> day<00:02:38.410> and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
trucks up and running for the day and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.730 
trucks up and running for the day and
what<00:02:39.580> happened<00:02:40.060> was<00:02:40.180> extremely<00:02:40.900> significant

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
what happened was extremely significant

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.480 
what happened was extremely significant
he<00:02:42.190> went<00:02:42.400> from<00:02:42.760> 360<00:02:43.660> miles<00:02:43.900> per<00:02:44.230> 28<00:02:44.650> gallons<00:02:45.040> to

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
he went from 360 miles per 28 gallons to

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.300 
he went from 360 miles per 28 gallons to
420<00:02:46.330> miles<00:02:46.480> for<00:02:46.750> 28<00:02:47.080> gallons<00:02:47.310> effectively

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
420 miles for 28 gallons effectively

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.740 
420 miles for 28 gallons effectively
went<00:02:48.490> from<00:02:48.640> twelve<00:02:48.970> point<00:02:49.209> eight<00:02:49.360> miles<00:02:49.570> a

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
went from twelve point eight miles a

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.110 
went from twelve point eight miles a
gallon<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:50.410> fifteen<00:02:50.860> miles<00:02:51.130> per<00:02:51.370> gallon<00:02:51.730> now

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
gallon to fifteen miles per gallon now

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.180 
gallon to fifteen miles per gallon now
that<00:02:52.630> seemed<00:02:52.930> incredible<00:02:53.709> when<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.890> start

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
that seemed incredible when you start

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.100 
that seemed incredible when you start
talking<00:02:54.489> about<00:02:54.520> eight<00:02:54.850> trucks<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.420> four

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
talking about eight trucks and four

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.720 
talking about eight trucks and four
dollars<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.560> gallon<00:02:56.709> for<00:02:56.920> diesel<00:02:57.070> fuel<00:02:57.580> but

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
dollars a gallon for diesel fuel but

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.000 
dollars a gallon for diesel fuel but
that's<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.060> very<00:02:58.270> significant<00:02:58.959> increase<00:02:59.110> just

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
that's a very significant increase just

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.240 
that's a very significant increase just
by<00:03:00.190> allowing<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.330> vehicle<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.930> warm<00:03:02.500> up<00:03:02.739> now

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
by allowing the vehicle to warm up now

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.040 
by allowing the vehicle to warm up now
he<00:03:03.310> went<00:03:03.580> further<00:03:03.910> then<00:03:04.239> increased<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.810> tire

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
he went further then increased the tire

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.490 
he went further then increased the tire
pressures<00:03:05.560> from<00:03:05.739> 50<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.880> 65<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:08.170> he<00:03:08.320> also

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
pressures from 50 to 65 and he also

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.130 
pressures from 50 to 65 and he also
instituted<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.400> pretty<00:03:09.670> extensive<00:03:10.239> GPS

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
instituted a pretty extensive GPS

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.870 
instituted a pretty extensive GPS
tracking<00:03:11.500> system<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.250> make<00:03:12.400> sure<00:03:12.550> that<00:03:12.730> his

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
tracking system to make sure that his

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.400 
tracking system to make sure that his
drivers<00:03:13.480> aren't<00:03:13.690> running<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.020> tar<00:03:14.230> out<00:03:14.380> of

drivers aren't running the tar out of
the<00:03:14.530> vehicles<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.150> he<00:03:16.150> was<00:03:16.480> able<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.810> get<00:03:17.170> them

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
the vehicles and he was able to get them

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.990 
the vehicles and he was able to get them
under<00:03:17.620> control<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.130> keep<00:03:18.310> him<00:03:18.459> under<00:03:18.610> 70

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
under control and keep him under 70

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.900 
under control and keep him under 70
miles<00:03:19.209> an<00:03:20.080> hour<00:03:20.260> what<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.160> did<00:03:21.430> was<00:03:21.610> it<00:03:21.640> took

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
miles an hour what that did was it took

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.710 
miles an hour what that did was it took
him<00:03:22.090> from<00:03:22.209> 420<00:03:23.110> miles<00:03:23.290> per<00:03:23.560> tankful<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.489> 438<00:03:25.480> so

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720
