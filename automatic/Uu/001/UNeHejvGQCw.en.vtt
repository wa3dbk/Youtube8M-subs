yeah<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.020> course<00:00:22.290> the<00:00:22.650> new<00:00:22.860> jungle

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
yeah this is of course the new jungle

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.640 
yeah this is of course the new jungle
map<00:00:23.640> some<00:00:24.000> gameplay<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.690> it<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.170> its<00:00:25.290> very

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
map some gameplay of it in its very

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.780 
map some gameplay of it in its very
first<00:00:26.060> incarnation<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.750> will<00:00:27.840> notice<00:00:28.140> that

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
first incarnation you will notice that

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.220 
first incarnation you will notice that
there's<00:00:29.790> a<00:00:29.910> distinct<00:00:30.450> lack<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.630> textures

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
there's a distinct lack of textures

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.200 
there's a distinct lack of textures
everywhere<00:00:31.680> and<00:00:31.980> everything<00:00:32.490> looks<00:00:32.850> kind<00:00:33.120> of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
everywhere and everything looks kind of

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.900 
everywhere and everything looks kind of
white<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.740> just<00:00:35.190> because<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.640> very

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
white that is just because it's very

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.990 
white that is just because it's very
early<00:00:36.090> stages<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.810> we're<00:00:36.960> testing<00:00:37.620> out

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
early stages and we're testing out

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.730 
early stages and we're testing out
basically<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.240> design<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.990> the<00:00:40.050> scale<00:00:40.680> of

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
basically the design and the scale of

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.090 
basically the design and the scale of
the<00:00:41.220> map<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.120> particular<00:00:42.390> stage<00:00:43.100> before

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the map at this particular stage before

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.010 
the map at this particular stage before
it<00:00:44.460> would<00:00:44.580> be<00:00:44.730> obviously<00:00:45.120> quite<00:00:45.360> interesting

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
it would be obviously quite interesting

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.780 
it would be obviously quite interesting
to<00:00:46.050> show<00:00:46.380> you<00:00:46.440> guys<00:00:46.590> where<00:00:47.160> we're<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.550> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
saw the last video we talked about the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
saw the last video we talked about the
different<00:01:04.259> layouts<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.979> were<00:01:05.280> available

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
different layouts that were available

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.600 
different layouts that were available
for<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.390> community<00:01:06.630> map<00:01:07.259> and<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.890> spoke<00:01:08.250> about

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
for this community map and I spoke about

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.870 
for this community map and I spoke about
how<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> liked<00:01:09.330> lay<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.890> layup<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.610> but

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
how I liked lay out a and layup see but

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
how I liked lay out a and layup see but
ultimately<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.659> was<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> few<00:01:13.229> guys<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.830> decide

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
ultimately it was a few guys to decide

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.090 
ultimately it was a few guys to decide
well<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.880> seems<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.330> layout<00:01:15.570> c<00:01:16.170> has<00:01:16.469> one<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
well it seems that layout c has one and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.739 
well it seems that layout c has one and
the<00:01:17.640> gameplay<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.119> see<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> background

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:18.749 
the gameplay you see in the background

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:20.510 
the gameplay you see in the background
is<00:01:19.140> way<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.499> see<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.859> fact<00:01:20.070> i'll<00:01:20.310> put

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
is way out see in fact i'll put

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.340 
is way out see in fact i'll put
something<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:20.969> screen<00:01:21.329> showing<00:01:21.929> you<00:01:22.140> how

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
something on screen showing you how

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.609 
something on screen showing you how
layout<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:23.159> looks<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.969> I<00:01:24.359> for<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> record<00:01:25.200> i

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
layout see looks and I for the record i

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.559 
layout see looks and I for the record i
actually<00:01:26.009> did<00:01:26.219> vote<00:01:26.249> for<00:01:26.490> layout<00:01:26.969> see<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
actually did vote for layout see in the

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.419 
actually did vote for layout see in the
end<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.170> after<00:01:28.859> quite<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> bit<00:01:29.340> of

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
end and after quite a bit of

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.279 
end and after quite a bit of
deliberation<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.270> i<00:01:30.359> wanted<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.140> it

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
deliberation because i wanted to get it

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.580 
deliberation because i wanted to get it
correct<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.859> know<00:01:32.479> also<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.109> say<00:01:34.409> as

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
correct you know also just to say as

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.099 
correct you know also just to say as
well<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.579> will<00:01:36.240> notice<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:37.020> it

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
well that you will notice that it

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.770 
well that you will notice that it
doesn't<00:01:37.560> look<00:01:37.859> very<00:01:37.920> jungly<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.390> suppose

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
doesn't look very jungly and I suppose

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.889 
doesn't look very jungly and I suppose
that<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.499> jungly<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> word<00:01:41.609> on<00:01:41.819> my<00:01:41.969> squeeze<00:01:42.359> but

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that is jungly a word on my squeeze but

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.080 
that is jungly a word on my squeeze but
you<00:01:43.259> guys<00:01:43.439> know<00:01:43.679> what<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.859> mean<00:01:44.039> right<00:01:44.249> but<00:01:45.060> I

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you guys know what I mean right but I

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.969 
you guys know what I mean right but I
was<00:01:45.240> thinking<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.840> doesn't<00:01:45.869> look<00:01:46.380> very<00:01:46.409> jungly

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
was thinking it doesn't look very jungly

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.129 
was thinking it doesn't look very jungly
there's<00:01:47.399> not<00:01:47.579> lots<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.939> trees<00:01:48.240> everywhere<00:01:48.719> but

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:49.139 
there's not lots of trees everywhere but

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:52.309 
there's not lots of trees everywhere but
that's<00:01:49.350> kind<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.889> not<00:01:50.850> well<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.600> what<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.079> want

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
that's kind of not well is what we want

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.410 
that's kind of not well is what we want
but<00:01:52.469> what<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.829> imagine<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.670> guys<00:01:53.880> wanting<00:01:54.240> what

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
but what I imagine you guys wanting what

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.899 
but what I imagine you guys wanting what
I<00:01:54.450> certainly<00:01:55.139> would<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.130> lots<00:01:56.189> of

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
I certainly would like to see is lots of

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.899 
I certainly would like to see is lots of
foliage<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:57.959> well<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.319> trees<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:59.219> these<00:01:59.429> open

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
everywhere so that you have lots of

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.960 
everywhere so that you have lots of
coverage<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:39.260> basically<00:02:39.739> see<00:02:40.069> get<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.700> kind

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
coverage and basically see get that kind

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.390 
coverage and basically see get that kind

now<00:02:44.150> where<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.390> am<00:02:44.629> at<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.080> moment<00:02:45.379> is<00:02:45.769> in<00:02:46.099> and

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
now where I am at the moment is in and

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.369 
now where I am at the moment is in and
around<00:02:46.489> see<00:02:46.910> flag<00:02:47.239> which<00:02:47.510> is<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.840> middle<00:02:48.049> of

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
around see flag which is the middle of

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.800 
around see flag which is the middle of
the<00:02:48.440> five<00:02:48.829> flags<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.549> this<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.180> actually<00:02:50.360> going

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
the five flags so this is actually going

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.740 
the five flags so this is actually going
to<00:02:50.989> be<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.170> very<00:02:51.590> hotly<00:02:51.980> contested<00:02:52.159> area<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.599> in

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
to be a very hotly contested area and in

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.900 
to be a very hotly contested area and in
my<00:02:53.900> plate<00:02:54.260> time<00:02:54.530> on<00:02:54.709> here<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.129> is<00:02:55.310> where<00:02:55.519> most

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
my plate time on here this is where most

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.509 
my plate time on here this is where most
of<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.269> battles<00:02:56.720> happen<00:02:57.140> if<00:02:57.319> you're<00:02:57.920> nearer<00:02:58.310> a

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
of the battles happen if you're nearer a

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.759 
of the battles happen if you're nearer a
and<00:02:58.730> B<00:02:58.910> your<00:02:59.299> team<00:02:59.540> tends<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.049> take<00:03:00.260> those<00:03:00.500> two

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
and B your team tends to take those two

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.699 
and B your team tends to take those two
flags<00:03:01.099> and<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.489> vice<00:03:01.670> versa<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:02.390> with<00:03:02.569> D<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.500> E

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
flags and in vice versa so with D and E

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.190 
flags and in vice versa so with D and E
if<00:03:03.950> you're<00:03:04.340> nearer<00:03:04.609> those<00:03:04.879> so<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:05.959> where

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
if you're nearer those so this is where

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.099 
if you're nearer those so this is where
a<00:03:06.230> lot<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.920> battles<00:03:07.459> will<00:03:07.700> happen<00:03:08.239> now<00:03:08.810> up

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
a lot of the battles will happen now up

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.509 
a lot of the battles will happen now up
on<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.440> hill<00:03:09.709> where<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.069> can<00:03:10.190> see<00:03:10.370> me

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
on that hill where you can see me

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.819 
on that hill where you can see me
peering<00:03:11.030> at<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.239> moment<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:12.140> kind<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.709> like

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
peering at the moment is kind of like

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.610 
peering at the moment is kind of like
it's<00:03:13.099> snipers<00:03:13.340> paradise<00:03:14.030> at<00:03:14.359> least<00:03:14.660> with<00:03:15.410> the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
it's snipers paradise at least with the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.619 
it's snipers paradise at least with the
map<00:03:15.890> in<00:03:16.129> this<00:03:16.340> early<00:03:16.549> stage<00:03:16.730> because<00:03:17.450> there's

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
map in this early stage because there's

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.569 
map in this early stage because there's
no<00:03:17.780> visible<00:03:18.230> cover<00:03:18.560> no<00:03:18.829> matter<00:03:19.040> where<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:19.400> are

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
no visible cover no matter where you are

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.119 
no visible cover no matter where you are
but<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.090> think<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:20.599> can<00:03:20.629> see<00:03:21.049> that<00:03:21.230> continuing<00:03:21.890> if

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
but I think I can see that continuing if

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.430 
but I think I can see that continuing if
you're<00:03:22.310> quite<00:03:22.609> a<00:03:22.640> big<00:03:23.000> sniper<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:23.870> think<00:03:24.319> you'll

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
you're quite a big sniper I think you'll

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.710 
you're quite a big sniper I think you'll
probably<00:03:24.709> like<00:03:25.190> this<00:03:25.459> map<00:03:25.730> if<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.150> can<00:03:26.329> get<00:03:26.540> in

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
probably like this map if you can get in

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.780 
probably like this map if you can get in
and<00:03:26.870> around<00:03:27.079> see<00:03:27.500> because<00:03:28.069> there's<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:28.639> much

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
and around see because there's so much

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.030 
and around see because there's so much
activity<00:03:29.030> going<00:03:29.480> on<00:03:29.870> here<00:03:30.079> you<00:03:30.169> can<00:03:30.349> see<00:03:30.560> on<00:03:30.829> my

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
activity going on here you can see on my

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.559 
activity going on here you can see on my
screen<00:03:31.069> at<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.459> moment<00:03:31.819> there's<00:03:32.180> lots<00:03:32.419> of

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
screen at the moment there's lots of

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.870 
screen at the moment there's lots of
enemies<00:03:32.750> lots<00:03:33.200> of<00:03:33.440> friendlies<00:03:33.919> all<00:03:34.130> fighting

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
enemies lots of friendlies all fighting

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.449 
enemies lots of friendlies all fighting
over<00:03:35.000> this<00:03:35.299> flag<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:36.230> get<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.500> free<00:03:36.739> flag<00:03:37.069> cap

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
over this flag to get the free flag cap

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.309 
over this flag to get the free flag cap
so<00:03:38.120> this<00:03:38.419> is<00:03:38.540> where<00:03:38.750> it's<00:03:38.900> all<00:03:39.049> going<00:03:39.230> to

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
so this is where it's all going to

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.449 
so this is where it's all going to
happen<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:39.829> if<00:03:39.919> you're<00:03:40.069> a<00:03:40.099> sniper

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
happen and if you're a sniper

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.550 
happen and if you're a sniper
overlooking<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.239> you'll<00:03:41.450> be<00:03:41.599> able<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:42.049> pick

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
overlooking it you'll be able to pick

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.920 
overlooking it you'll be able to pick
off<00:03:42.799> lots<00:03:43.069> of<00:03:43.250> kills<00:03:43.489> clearly<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.450> foliage

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
off lots of kills clearly the foliage

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.319 
off lots of kills clearly the foliage
and<00:03:45.169> how<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:46.099> different<00:03:46.329> characteristics

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
and how the different characteristics

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.539 
and how the different characteristics
are<00:03:47.450> added<00:03:47.750> onto<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.230> map<00:03:48.410> will<00:03:48.769> make<00:03:49.130> quite

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
are added onto the map will make quite

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.300 
are added onto the map will make quite
large<00:03:49.849> difference<00:03:50.419> there<00:03:50.750> but<00:03:51.440> obviously

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
large difference there but obviously

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.900 
large difference there but obviously
that<00:03:52.609> does<00:03:52.849> remain<00:03:53.359> to<00:03:53.630> be<00:03:53.750> seen<00:03:53.780> as<00:03:54.260> well<00:03:54.530> I

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
that does remain to be seen as well I

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.610 
that does remain to be seen as well I
also<00:03:55.910> think<00:03:56.209> that<00:03:56.329> this<00:03:56.540> map<00:03:56.840> is<00:03:56.870> going<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:57.440> be

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
also think that this map is going to be

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.370 
also think that this map is going to be
very<00:03:57.889> fun<00:03:58.549> if<00:03:58.849> you<00:03:59.120> really<00:03:59.450> into<00:03:59.900> infantry

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
very fun if you really into infantry

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.490 
very fun if you really into infantry
style<00:04:00.950> battlefield<00:04:01.730> yes<00:04:02.630> there<00:04:03.019> are<00:04:03.169> vehicle

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
style battlefield yes there are vehicle

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.409 
style battlefield yes there are vehicle
assets<00:04:03.829> on<00:04:03.980> here<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.400> saw<00:04:04.700> me<00:04:04.849> in<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.060> tank

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
assets on here you saw me in the tank

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.379 
assets on here you saw me in the tank
earlier<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:06.079> think<00:04:06.859> though<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.549> way<00:04:07.819> it's<00:04:08.150> laid

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
earlier I think though the way it's laid

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.629 
earlier I think though the way it's laid
out<00:04:08.450> is<00:04:09.230> going<00:04:09.739> to<00:04:09.889> make<00:04:10.099> for<00:04:10.400> some

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
out is going to make for some

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.119 
out is going to make for some
interesting<00:04:11.230> infantry<00:04:12.230> combat<00:04:12.620> and

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
interesting infantry combat and

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.970 
interesting infantry combat and
obviously<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.120> lot<00:04:14.359> of<00:04:14.510> that<00:04:14.690> depends<00:04:15.139> on<00:04:15.470> how

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
obviously a lot of that depends on how

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.120 
obviously a lot of that depends on how
the<00:04:16.039> final<00:04:16.880> map<00:04:17.150> is<00:04:17.840> brought<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.470> us<00:04:18.650> what

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
the final map is brought to us what

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.069 
the final map is brought to us what
vehicle<00:04:19.549> assets<00:04:19.880> are<00:04:20.060> put<00:04:20.209> in<00:04:20.359> there<00:04:20.599> but<00:04:20.959> if

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
vehicle assets are put in there but if

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.689 
vehicle assets are put in there but if
it's<00:04:21.229> going<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.560> be<00:04:21.799> as<00:04:22.010> it<00:04:22.070> is<00:04:22.340> at<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:22.669> moment

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
it's going to be as it is at the moment

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.140 
it's going to be as it is at the moment
then<00:04:23.690> I<00:04:24.020> can<00:04:24.500> see<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.889> being<00:04:25.070> very<00:04:25.430> infantry

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
then I can see it being very infantry

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.570 
then I can see it being very infantry
focused<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:27.020> lot<00:04:27.229> of<00:04:27.260> fun<00:04:27.590> for<00:04:27.800> those<00:04:28.340> of

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
focused and a lot of fun for those of

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.520 
focused and a lot of fun for those of
you<00:04:28.729> that<00:04:28.940> like<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.419> go<00:04:29.570> and<00:04:29.690> play<00:04:29.840> those<00:04:30.080> types

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
you that like to go and play those types

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.670 
you that like to go and play those types
of<00:04:30.740> game<00:04:31.400> modes<00:04:31.640> I<00:04:31.940> do<00:04:32.000> but<00:04:32.870> then<00:04:33.020> again<00:04:33.140> I<00:04:33.469> like

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
of game modes I do but then again I like

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.860 
of game modes I do but then again I like
to<00:04:33.740> mix<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.280> up<00:04:34.310> as<00:04:34.520> well

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
to mix it up as well

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.110 
to mix it up as well
do<00:04:34.990> like<00:04:35.170> my<00:04:35.350> vehicle<00:04:35.740> combat<00:04:35.980> too<00:04:36.430> but<00:04:37.000> it's

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
do like my vehicle combat too but it's

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.760 
do like my vehicle combat too but it's
always<00:04:37.270> nice<00:04:37.630> to<00:04:37.660> have<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.170> map<00:04:38.440> in<00:04:38.620> your

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
always nice to have that map in your

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.560 
always nice to have that map in your
arsenal<00:04:39.130> and<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:39.790> think<00:04:39.970> art<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:40.420> know<00:04:40.540> I

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
arsenal and you think art you know I

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.300 
arsenal and you think art you know I
just<00:04:40.750> want<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.230> go<00:04:41.350> and<00:04:41.440> play<00:04:41.590> some<00:04:41.650> infantry

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
just want to go and play some infantry

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.730 
just want to go and play some infantry
style<00:04:42.730> any<00:04:43.300> perhaps<00:04:43.840> you're<00:04:44.020> sick<00:04:44.200> of<00:04:44.230> lockers

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
style any perhaps you're sick of lockers

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.190 
style any perhaps you're sick of lockers
so<00:04:45.100> this<00:04:45.850> might<00:04:46.180> be<00:04:46.330> one<00:04:46.480> of<00:04:46.510> those<00:04:46.690> maps<00:04:46.990> where

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
so this might be one of those maps where

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.750 
so this might be one of those maps where
you<00:04:47.320> can<00:04:47.470> do<00:04:47.680> that<00:04:47.860> and<00:04:48.040> perhaps<00:04:48.430> there<00:04:48.700> will

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
you can do that and perhaps there will

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.830 
you can do that and perhaps there will
only<00:04:48.880> be<00:04:49.030> one<00:04:49.420> enemy<00:04:49.750> tank<00:04:51.240> harassing<00:04:52.240> you<00:04:52.420> but

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
only be one enemy tank harassing you but

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.080 
only be one enemy tank harassing you but
again<00:04:53.200> those<00:04:53.530> kinds<00:04:54.040> of<00:04:54.130> numbers<00:04:54.370> are<00:04:54.880> still

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
again those kinds of numbers are still

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.180 
again those kinds of numbers are still
to<00:04:55.300> be<00:04:55.330> decided<00:04:55.780> this<00:04:56.140> is<00:04:56.200> very<00:04:56.560> early<00:04:56.860> stages

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
to be decided this is very early stages

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.970 
to be decided this is very early stages
and<00:04:57.910> I'm<00:04:58.060> going<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.390> be<00:04:58.660> sort<00:04:59.230> of<00:04:59.260> continuing

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
and I'm going to be sort of continuing

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.310
