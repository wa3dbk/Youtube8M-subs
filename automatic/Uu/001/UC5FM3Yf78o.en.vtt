00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.570
 not so long ago so new 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.910
 episode 14 w04 to and who adds a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 completely mind-blowing order and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.529
 completely gorgeous that I'm going to you 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.689
 show right now we will give you a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.160
 funny thing 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:28.980
 even those of particles so here's the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.210
 command is called slash particles 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.610
 this is obviously yes it's not that 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.559
 partick do not need the mobster as a 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.210
 con and then there you have exactly 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.610
 all you need for you to do 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.379
 know particles it's like every 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.250
 article l 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.920
 then the honda to explain the name on 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.079
 will take over there it s' there are so one 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.079
 will take about you know 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:04.430
 I always magnify that then x 10 xy 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.189
 z that's the radius in relation to 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.539
 the place you chose so there 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:15.549
 for example on a radius of 5 5 5 after 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:18.200
 speed sa c6 is more or less fast 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.880
 but you are 0.5 that's what is 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.619
 advisable 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.930
 How much are we 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.939
 example and anti player so that's not it 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.850
 obliged but for example that it starts from the 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.470
 that it leaves the center is the person 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.360
 So here I am 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.970
 I pressed where it's me the center 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.369
 and will create 200 world as if we put 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.069
 two thousand we put twenty thousand but 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.600
 to walk a little bit here and there maybe 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:47.149
 that speed is a bit too fast 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:51.649
 while the om is rom to nice then we 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.270
 can give cool stuff then that's it 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.179
 the sound you hear 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.610
 it's a slash command pl ace hood 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:02.060
 washing liquid to pop this is the name 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.410
 for the little couple the nail that we see 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.250
 there it is there we have the impression that 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.379
 more fireballs 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:12.950
 I like this frankly without speaking 

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:15.580
 it lag and other particles are 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.580
 also do jupiter random expose 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.640
 and for you and nothing explodes it's just 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.300
 the particles of the explosion and room 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.340
 explodes from auch wood this is 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.660
 nice so then game there are full 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.770
 full and I kept the best ones for 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.110
 you 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.570
 it's good water is not the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.630
 better it's enough the flames it's 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.670
 portage then water is this plh 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.580
 arrow and then portal to have the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.610
 list do you know by tic and there the 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.800
 the tab key and you have the list 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.490
 then the list there are full full 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.040
 a fagot fireworks park we will try 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:01.500

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.040
 small star 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.310
 So that's it that makes you small 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.420
 stars that's portal so that was 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.990

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.690
 so and then to add some evening 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:21.210
 you can possibly take notes 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.210

 locke in beijing molson where lÃ© 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.020
 so this one is for example 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.090
 so that's also it's like a 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.440

 content but I like it 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.889
 well that frankly it would be 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:52.249
 really cool what when when when 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:56.239
 come up with that and that 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:57.489
 for example we do 5 when we arrive 

00:05:56.239 --> 00:06:04.719
 for example 

00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:08.569
 slash effect to respect life is 6 0 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:10.129
 for a second it is for example 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:13.039
 it could be nice for me 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:16.700
 painting it would be a plate one can 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:21.969
 to regain life that we have to mix 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:23.949
 we will take the fly so at the wedding 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:27.179
 and it would be understood that plate 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:30.179
 could earn some life for example 

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:30.179
 here 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.070
 I'm fast 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:39.110
 showing you the sizes 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.630
 and for example when we would walk on 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:45.250
 the pressure plate of the waffles and the 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:49.570
 little hearts ah that's it if you have to pour 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.570
 from their base pb 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.160
 still a little trouble in time it's 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.540
 it's just been inaugurated so it's 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.760
 stuttered and so that's it 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:01.580
 you have been healing what it is by 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.580
 example if convenient 0 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.780
 boom and where we treated with 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:09.039
 little hearts and this time I have 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:14.139
 the impression that they are closest to 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:16.659
 me not at all at home so did not 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.280
 that's it for the particles these 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:20.979
 novelties of the shock stap 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.349
 others for example that's it I do not know 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:24.849
 not maybe you'll see on 

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:31.539
 other videos marcinaccio is not 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:34.659
 done for video and paf so here's a 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:36.719
 nas admits having to look at it 

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:38.710
 a lot of videos right now but 

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:41.710
 I try to do it when I like it 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:45.490
 really and that's something that is 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:47.259
 really for the list I showed you 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.409
 how to do it and I would put you a 

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:51.969
 example of commands in the description 

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:53.620
 like that you could agree the coop 

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:54.879
 and he copied it will be a lot more 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.180
 simple that look in my orders 

00:07:54.879 --> 00:08:02.130
 doc every time 

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:02.130
 that's it and well hi to all
