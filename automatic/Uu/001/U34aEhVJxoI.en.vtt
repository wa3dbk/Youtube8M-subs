00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.370
 hi all the toothbrushes are doctor 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.960
 wise we are here with a video dedicated to 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.759
 fifa 14 users 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.789
 today we are going to see the basics of the game 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.199
 how to make many credits at the beginning of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.660
 our adventure begs four years 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.910
 on the top you start immediately first 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.320
 I recommend using the modifiers of 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.359
 credits you find my sports 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.220
 football club the game catalog 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.170
 this because because they will allow you to 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.809
 have up to 1000 more credits 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.180
 obtained at the end of each game is 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.800
 however, it is very important not to redeem them 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.120
 all these objects together because they don't 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.010
 they will add up so you won't be able to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.930
 get 10 min and match policies but 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.350
 you will lose them so I recommend one 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.050
 at a time for about 50 60 matches a 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.610
 get easily and more credits vi 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.949
 I also remember that this year it is 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.809
 Possible to give away the contents 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.989
 in the pd catalog you can ask a friend 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.579
 if he will also give you some 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.680
 other advice credit modifiers 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.000
 as soon as we open a tweet in this one 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.559
 which sets it apart in the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 last two three versions are the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.010
 coach assignments 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.630
 these are the very easy loads that 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.760
 they go from playing a part in a tournament 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.040
 to buy a player with buy now a 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.990
 challenge the team of the week 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.780
 therefore actions that can be performed in 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.060
 about an hour of play even less really 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.880
 fast the prize is a gold package 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.710
 I am notoriously unlucky therefore not 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.720
 I found no one in mine since bull 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.909
 however they will be able to give contracts 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.439
 physical forms objects they can have 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.520
 a value especially at the beginning for 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.259
 live another year not to spend 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.299
 money for contracts 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.500
 the team with which to start this 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.570
 team is the one he was using 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.700
 I for offline tournaments 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.439
 this is because at the beginning you can 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.490
 quietly play offline if not 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.590
 you have a great team 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.899
 I did nothing with all the bronzes 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.040
 I went to the beginning of the game and with the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.290
 gifts that went into the packages 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.509
 every day I made this team that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.530
 it's not strong at all but offline 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.090
 assert yourself 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.560
 I played the tournament offline is 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.009
 easy enough to win it in addition vi 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.689
 they give about 1500 result credits 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.369
 thanks to the modifiers we have seen 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.659
 of ea sports football club 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.550
 these are the tournaments 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.009
 very easy the most difficult and has 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.760
 expert difficulty so nothing 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.160
 impossible 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.720
 I advise you to do these games with 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.970
 an offline team don't use yours 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.379
 principales team and you have starts from 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.459
 build because you will be wasted 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.920
 contracts 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.930
 what will you do when in fact the contracts 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.090
 they will end up with these players 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.459
 you will go to discard this because because 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.650
 it's not worth spending on contracts 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.540
 especially the game with players who 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.129
 then they do not participate in our squad is 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.140
 however they are not top players I am not 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.420
 very strong players we want the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.250
 penalty to keep the team at our best 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.069
 result we can get it if 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.709
 we take gold players at 300 which is 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.459
 the scrap price of gold players 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.200
 this is not easy to find at 300 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.660
 especially the strong ones though of 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.940
 players with 75 76 evaluations a 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.459
 sometimes it's easy to find them at that price 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.190
 you offer 300 credits for these 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.620
 players maybe not even to have 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.989
 the agreement therefore also means an agreement 90 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.430
 80 is fine so the important thing is to do i 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.069
 set against the computer they are 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.200
 naturally very easy to dispute 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.910
 you will easily succeed in winning too 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.040
 with a team not exceptional with 1 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.889
 div intesa one hundred and also with the players 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.329
 they were not the righteous so what we will do at 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.709
 term that will expire the contract of 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.019
 these players will discard them and 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.459
 we will recover 300 credits we have 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.500
 spent to buy them 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.810
 however, we have obtained many credits 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.700
 especially if modifiers are used 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.919
 so we can get a little done 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.630
 budget that can be invested for 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.130
 buying and selling expertise build the 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.470
 our base team 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.780
 chapter of the basic saga I have chosen 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.970
 a series I didn't take the top players 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.889
 so I don't recommend investing for 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.690
 go and try to take players 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.130
 like balotelli what in about 40 thousand 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.359
 believe because these will come down 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.620
 quite a lot of 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.780
 I chose the players maybe like 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.459
 cerci I managed to take 1200 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.489
 so you don't think I will go much 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.780
 to lose a lot when I want to resell it 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.030
 or you can quiet 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.440
 buy the first mobile players 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.350
 week I remind you of the video I made 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.270
 on the advice for the sale or 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.310
 take those of these of which then 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.830
 milito maybe you can find it i already have 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.870
 seen on the 15,000 credits therefore vi 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.239
 I advise you not to aim at the top immediately 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.519
 player as chiellini vidal buffon ma 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.940
 first build a team maybe with 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.570
 players 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.190
 spending a thousand credits and starting a 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.320
 buy contracts you 've been in 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.639
 that some are very important to me 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.260
 they go away at a low price 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.210
 so try to take why 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.930
 could be decisive in sardines 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.610
 our teams 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.190
 I close with the last chapter that 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.870
 dedicated to non-purchased packages 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.560
 absolutely packages with credits 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.720
 real 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.180
 this is because 7,500 drops are 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.919
 the best to keep them for building 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.110
 the team to trade if 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.760
 just want to open the packages do it 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.560
 with points qualification 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.060
 take care not to force you to open i 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.040
 pack this then if you are 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.660
 willing to put 20 euros 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.400
 this is the right time to do it 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.320
 because why many players go away 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.600
 a really high price we take 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.070
 also simply costs also is not a 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.990
 exceptional player but ok 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.760
 3000 credits because this is why 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.650
 the only left-back in the series a 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.510
 he then decides if you need to open the 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.640
 packages with the ritual then I recommend 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.160
 to do it now rather try not to 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.300
 put contracts and physical forms because 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.419
 these could gain value 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.640
 passing this last thing over time 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.400
 regards the channel of more recent 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.320
 how spaces will be treated i 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.690
 upcoming videos dedicated fifa 14 ho 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.000
 going to bring you a video with 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.860
 all the new species of fifa 14 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.300
 objects then from the modules from the chemistry 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.430
 you are etc. and so on 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.590
 a specific video on chemistry sai 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.390
 because they are so many they have a 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.430
 factor that has not been much explained 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.190
 during representations concerning i 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.680
 values ​​that increase depending on 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.510
 of the player's and reviews 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.910
 of players players reviews that 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.490
 they will restart we will start from the players 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.800
 standard for the attackers in particular 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.620
 as higuain gomez tevez balotelli 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.030
 so all attackers can 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.680
 change our team the best 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.360
 we will try to understand what it is 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.100
 the best serious attacker 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.660
 mostly 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.160
 I could make him into the game 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.750
 sorry to be able to bring you right away 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.700
 players like ipray 11 but they cost 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.730
 really too much in my opinion are not worth 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.110
 the 800,000 criticisms now ask 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.150
 surely they will come down I will try maybe a 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.280
 bring the first players on the 50 thousand 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.810
 Girl masses credits don't have him 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.550
 concluded if you liked left 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.740
 online with comment east to see channel 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:31.010
 we will see you soon with others verification 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.960
 made rudiments hello everyone and there is 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:36.080
 so i look at the captain more than 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.490
 deserved fabio was cold and shiny 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.490
 he saw the corner but alone
