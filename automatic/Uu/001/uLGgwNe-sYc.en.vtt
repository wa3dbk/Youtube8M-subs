twenty percent from other means and you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.280 
twenty percent from other means and you

in the property or wherever else you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.429 
in the property or wherever else you
might<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.670> borrowed<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.570> fund<00:01:30.780> from<00:01:30.990> you

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
might have borrowed the fund from you

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.950 
might have borrowed the fund from you
know<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.680> 100%<00:01:32.009> financed<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.450> you're<00:01:33.720> over

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
know it's 100% financed you you're over

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.350 
know it's 100% financed you you're over
leveraged<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.250> downside<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.909> being<00:01:36.030> over

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
leveraged so the downside to being over

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.760 
leveraged so the downside to being over
leveraged<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:37.610> let's<00:01:38.610> say<00:01:39.380> based<00:01:40.380> upon<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
leveraged is let's say based upon the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
leveraged is let's say based upon the
market<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> value<00:01:42.799> depreciates

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.850 

the<00:01:47.790> valued<00:01:48.090> appreciates<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> may<00:01:49.380> harm<00:01:49.590> it

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the valued appreciates so it may harm it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.790 
the valued appreciates so it may harm it
may<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.160> difficult<00:01:50.400> for<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.440> to<00:01:52.440> sell<00:01:52.650> that

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
may be difficult for you to to sell that

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.310 
may be difficult for you to to sell that
property<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.340> you'll<00:01:53.550> be<00:01:53.580> underwater<00:01:54.320> so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
property because you'll be underwater so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.140 
property because you'll be underwater so
that's<00:01:55.500> why<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.800> it<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.280> very<00:01:56.670> important<00:01:57.060> to

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
that's why is it for very important to

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.060 
that's why is it for very important to
follow<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.630> three<00:01:57.870> rules<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.260> investing<00:01:58.800> one

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
has the cash flow just number one so if

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.550

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
other way it could be very expensive

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.110 
other way it could be very expensive
well<00:06:02.390> I<00:06:02.510> wish<00:06:02.690> minimize<00:06:03.140> this<00:06:03.350> you<00:06:03.530> know<00:06:04.120> your

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
equity or high appreciation then you use

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.210
