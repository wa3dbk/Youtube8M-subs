distortion it's clean so just remember

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.009 
distortion it's clean so just remember
that<00:00:21.720> too<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:23.269> we<00:00:24.269> start<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> fifth<00:00:24.930> fret

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
that too so we start on the fifth fret

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:40.190 
that too so we start on the fifth fret
and<00:00:26.480> we<00:00:27.480> hit<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:28.880> 7<00:00:30.500> 8<00:00:31.500> 10<00:00:32.540> 8<00:00:34.430> 7<00:00:37.280> is<00:00:38.930> it<00:00:39.930> again

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
and we hit that 7 8 10 8 7 is it again

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.990 
and we hit that 7 8 10 8 7 is it again
this<00:00:41.120> 4<00:00:42.530> 5th<00:00:43.969> 7th

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:00.729 

so<00:00:48.000> far<00:00:48.270> slowly<00:00:49.250> should<00:00:50.250> sound<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.520> this

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.170 

after<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.970> we<00:01:03.500> do<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> slide<00:01:05.009> we<00:01:05.519> slide<00:01:05.909> from

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
after that we do a slide we slide from

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.749 
after that we do a slide we slide from
the<00:01:06.300> second<00:01:06.720> fret<00:01:07.820> up<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> fifth<00:01:09.270> fret

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
the second fret up to the fifth fret

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.969 
the second fret up to the fifth fret
into<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.850> fourth<00:01:12.060> fret<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.770> should

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
into the fourth fret so that should

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.719 
into the fourth fret so that should
sound<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:18.140> so<00:01:19.140> all<00:01:19.320> together<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:20.220> 27

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
sound like this so all together is 27

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:31.550 
sound like this so all together is 27
like<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:29.690> there<00:01:30.690> is<00:01:30.840> another<00:01:31.140> way<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.410> can

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
like this there is another way you can

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.070 
like this there is another way you can
do<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:32.399> at<00:01:32.610> least<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.970> slide<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.899> can

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
do it or at least the slide you can

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.690 
do it or at least the slide you can
substitute<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.770> slide<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.280> something<00:01:35.580> else

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
substitute the slide for something else

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.490 
substitute the slide for something else
and<00:01:35.789> I'll<00:01:35.940> show<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.119> show<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:37.289> it<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.410> I

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
way so instead of doing the slide you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.910 
way so instead of doing the slide you
get<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.619> fit<00:01:43.800> fit<00:01:44.630> spread<00:01:45.630> again
