you'll see that there's actually just a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.650 
you'll see that there's actually just a
little<00:00:35.640> button<00:00:35.880> here<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.239> says<00:00:36.360> enable

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
position here so we can designate

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.720

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and actually if we go ahead and test

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.639 
and actually if we go ahead and test
this<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:48.180> real<00:00:48.510> quick<00:00:48.539> you'll<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.410> able<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.310 
this out real quick you'll be able to
see<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.190> comes<00:00:50.370> up<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.170> should<00:00:52.170> be

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
see that it comes up and should be

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.130 
see that it comes up and should be
placed<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.829> bottom<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> game<00:00:53.960> ok<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.020> I

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
placed at the bottom of the game ok so I

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.990 
placed at the bottom of the game ok so I
got<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> game<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:55.829> test<00:00:56.399> ad<00:00:56.579> should<00:00:56.789> show

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
got the game up here test ad should show

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.810 
got the game up here test ad should show
up<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.300> second<00:00:58.579> wait<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.879> it

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
up in a second wait for it

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.219 
up in a second wait for it
there<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.910> go<00:01:03.090> there's<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:03.989> test

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
there we go there's your test

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.050 
there we go there's your test
advertisement<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.010> as<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.339> as<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.880> see

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
advertisement so as we as you can see

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.480 
advertisement so as we as you can see
this<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.689> where<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> ad<00:01:07.170> would<00:01:07.439> show<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.799> in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
this is where the ad would show up in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.890 
this is where the ad would show up in
the<00:01:08.640> game<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.180> would<00:01:09.299> obviously<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.750> an

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the game it would obviously be an

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
the game it would obviously be an
advertisement<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> test<00:01:10.950> advertisement

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
advertisement not the test advertisement

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
advertisement not the test advertisement
for<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.630> we'd<00:01:12.900> probably<00:01:13.020> want<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> put<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.500> at

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
for this we'd probably want to put it at

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.370 
for this we'd probably want to put it at
the<00:01:13.650> top<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> I'll<00:01:15.780> go<00:01:15.930> ahead<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.170> change<00:01:16.320> that

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the top so I'll go ahead and change that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.710 
the top so I'll go ahead and change that
a<00:01:16.500> second<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.970> didn't<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.420> ads

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
a second but what if we didn't want ads

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.230 
a second but what if we didn't want ads
to<00:01:19.140> show<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.680> every<00:01:20.100> level<00:01:20.250> or<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.970> wanted

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to show up on every level or we wanted

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.640 
to show up on every level or we wanted
it<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.360> show<00:01:21.600> up<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:21.840> specific<00:01:22.259> times<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it to show up at specific times of the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.530 
it to show up at specific times of the
game<00:01:22.860> how<00:01:23.580> would<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:23.880> go<00:01:23.970> about<00:01:24.000> doing<00:01:24.299> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
game how would we go about doing that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.960 
game how would we go about doing that
well<00:01:24.750> again<00:01:25.380> stencil<00:01:26.280> works<00:01:26.430> makes<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.820> very

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
position to the top because it's better

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.280 
position to the top because it's better
suited<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.159> game<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.810> control

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
suited for this game and we can control

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.219 
suited for this game and we can control
the<00:01:38.060> display<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.360> advertisement<00:01:40.079> through

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the display of the advertisement through

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.590 
the display of the advertisement through
a<00:01:40.259> behavior<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.180> gonna

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
a behavior so right now I'm just gonna

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.020 
a behavior so right now I'm just gonna
duplicate<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.799> scene<00:01:44.340> here

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.900 

and<00:01:50.030> we're<00:01:50.240> just<00:01:50.300> going<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.570> rename<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:50.840> to

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
and we're just going to rename this to

00:01:51.910 --> 00:02:00.890 
and we're just going to rename this to
level<00:01:52.910> 2<00:01:53.150> or<00:01:53.300> something

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.110 

go<00:02:01.900> ahead<00:02:02.049> and<00:02:02.170> save<00:02:02.350> it

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
go ahead and save it

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.450 
go ahead and save it
and<00:02:05.120> I'm<00:02:05.420> gonna<00:02:05.660> change<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.140> scene<00:02:06.440> this<00:02:07.130> next

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
and I'm gonna change the scene this next

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.000 
and I'm gonna change the scene this next
scene<00:02:07.640> behavior<00:02:08.150> to<00:02:09.140> go<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.290> level<00:02:09.590> two<00:02:09.770> so

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
scene behavior to go to level two so

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.440 
scene behavior to go to level two so
that<00:02:10.130> we<00:02:10.220> can<00:02:10.369> test<00:02:10.640> out<00:02:10.790> whether<00:02:11.000> or<00:02:11.150> not<00:02:11.270> the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
that we can test out whether or not the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.170 
that we can test out whether or not the
eye<00:02:11.480> ads<00:02:11.750> are<00:02:11.930> showing<00:02:12.170> up<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:14.000> I'm<00:02:14.090> actually

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
eye ads are showing up so I'm actually

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.180 
eye ads are showing up so I'm actually
gonna<00:02:14.420> go<00:02:14.630> over<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.020> game<00:02:15.170> center<00:02:15.410> go<00:02:16.010> over

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
gonna go over to the game center go over

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.020 
gonna go over to the game center go over
to<00:02:16.280> scene<00:02:16.490> behaviors<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.390> I'm<00:02:18.080> just<00:02:18.290> gonna

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
to scene behaviors and I'm just gonna

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.920 
to scene behaviors and I'm just gonna
create<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.120> new<00:02:20.360> behavior<00:02:22.540> I'll<00:02:23.540> put<00:02:23.750> this

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
create a new behavior I'll put this

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.850 
create a new behavior I'll put this
under<00:02:25.480> other<00:02:26.480> because<00:02:27.020> it's<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.260> Naiad<00:02:27.560> kind<00:02:27.800> of

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
under other because it's a Naiad kind of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.110 
under other because it's a Naiad kind of
thing<00:02:28.070> so<00:02:29.000> I'm<00:02:29.090> gonna<00:02:29.210> say<00:02:30.730> hide<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:32.150> add<00:02:34.120> it

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
thing so I'm gonna say hide I add it

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.480 
thing so I'm gonna say hide I add it
create<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.970> I'm<00:02:38.090> actually<00:02:38.410> going<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.650> go<00:02:40.460> over

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
create and I'm actually going to go over

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.770 
create and I'm actually going to go over
to<00:02:41.210> game<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.930> under<00:02:42.380> iOS<00:02:42.740> api's<00:02:43.720> scroll<00:02:44.720> all

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
to game and under iOS api's scroll all

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.970 
to game and under iOS api's scroll all
the<00:02:44.840> way<00:02:44.930> down<00:02:44.990> to<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.320> bottom<00:02:45.620> you'll<00:02:45.890> see

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
the way down to the bottom you'll see

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.580 
the way down to the bottom you'll see
that<00:02:46.250> there<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.460> a<00:02:46.640> behavior<00:02:47.420> for<00:02:47.660> high<00:02:47.930> dyads

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
that there is a behavior for high dyads

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.800 
that there is a behavior for high dyads
and<00:02:49.490> you<00:02:49.640> can<00:02:49.790> also<00:02:49.910> get<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.390> height<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.720> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
and you can also get the height of the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.960 
and you can also get the height of the
eye<00:02:50.840> yet<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.290> if<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:51.500> need<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:51.980> do<00:02:52.070> anything<00:02:52.310> to

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
eye yet so if you need to do anything to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.240 
eye yet so if you need to do anything to
compensate<00:02:53.570> for<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.930> height<00:02:54.710> of<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.950> eye<00:02:55.010> and

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
compensate for the height of the eye and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.670 
compensate for the height of the eye and
you<00:02:55.370> can<00:02:55.670> actually<00:02:55.850> get<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.390> height<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.900> so

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
you can actually get the height of it so

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.800 
you can actually get the height of it so
I'm<00:02:57.740> just<00:02:57.860> gonna<00:02:58.070> pull<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.610> high<00:02:59.300> dyad

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
I'm just gonna pull this high dyad

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.420 
I'm just gonna pull this high dyad
behavior<00:03:00.530> out<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:00.860> stick<00:03:01.070> it<00:03:01.160> in<00:03:01.250> when

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
behavior out and stick it in when

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.850 
behavior out and stick it in when
created<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.420> can<00:03:02.510> also<00:03:02.660> show<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.590> if<00:03:03.709> you

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
created you can also show it so if you

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.890 
created you can also show it so if you
want<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.130> designate<00:03:04.640> when<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.120> want<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.390> when

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
want to designate when I want to when

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.240 
want to designate when I want to when
you<00:03:06.050> want<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.350> show<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.650> when<00:03:06.800> you<00:03:06.890> didn't

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
you want it to show it when you didn't

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.500 
you want it to show it when you didn't
want<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.430> show<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:07.580> like<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:08.000> only<00:03:08.150> show<00:03:08.420> it

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
want to show it like you only show it

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.229 
want to show it like you only show it
when<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:09.530> levels<00:03:09.800> complete<00:03:10.190> or<00:03:10.459> something

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
when the levels complete or something

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.510 
when the levels complete or something
like<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:11.870> can<00:03:11.989> do<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.340> so<00:03:13.340> I'm<00:03:13.430> going

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
like that you can do that so I'm going

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.150 
like that you can do that so I'm going
to<00:03:13.580> go<00:03:13.670> ahead<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:13.910> save<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:15.010> I'm<00:03:16.010> going

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
to go ahead and save that and I'm going

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.949 
to go ahead and save that and I'm going
to<00:03:16.190> go<00:03:16.310> over<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.520> level<00:03:16.730> 2<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.300> apply<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.660> to

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
to go over to level 2 and apply it to

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.900 
to go over to level 2 and apply it to
level<00:03:18.140> 2

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.360 

apply<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:23.990> hide<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.890> add<00:03:26.860> we<00:03:27.860> go<00:03:27.950> ahead<00:03:28.070> and<00:03:28.190> save

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
apply I hide I add we go ahead and save

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.890 
apply I hide I add we go ahead and save
that<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.880> now<00:03:29.300> I'm<00:03:29.420> going<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.630> give<00:03:29.720> this<00:03:29.840> a

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
that and now I'm going to give this a

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.460 
that and now I'm going to give this a
test<00:03:30.430> so<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.730> way<00:03:31.820> this<00:03:31.970> works<00:03:32.240> is<00:03:32.570> that<00:03:33.050> it

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
test so the way this works is that it

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.080 
test so the way this works is that it
you<00:03:33.710> should<00:03:33.890> get<00:03:33.980> an<00:03:34.100> ad<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.610> first<00:03:34.790> level

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
you should get an ad in the first level

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.910 
you should get an ad in the first level
but<00:03:35.300> when<00:03:35.450> we<00:03:35.600> beat<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:36.260> level<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.680> move<00:03:36.800> on

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
but when we beat that level and move on

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
but when we beat that level and move on
to<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.160> second<00:03:37.490> level

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
to the second level

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.090 
to the second level
there<00:03:38.660> should<00:03:38.780> be<00:03:38.810> no<00:03:38.990> I<00:03:39.020> add<00:03:41.470> okay<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:42.860> I<00:03:42.890> have

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
there should be no I add okay so I have

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.340 
there should be no I add okay so I have
the<00:03:43.220> game<00:03:43.370> running<00:03:43.820> here<00:03:44.060> I've<00:03:44.840> moved<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.320> I

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
the game running here I've moved the I

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.290 
the game running here I've moved the I
add<00:03:45.680> position<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.280> top<00:03:46.430> here<00:03:46.640> there<00:03:47.210> you

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
add position to the top here there you
