00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
kinds of just basics eventually we'll

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.729 
kinds of just basics eventually we'll
learn<00:00:57.360> some<00:00:57.600> skills<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.109> will<00:00:58.289> give<00:00:58.379> us<00:00:58.410> some

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739

well<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.250> case<00:00:59.399> spells<00:00:59.760> I'm<00:00:59.940> playing<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
well in this case spells I'm playing a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.470 
well in this case spells I'm playing a
human<00:01:00.570> warlock<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.230> they're<00:01:01.980> kind<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
human warlock so they're kind of a

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.859 
human warlock so they're kind of a
damaged<00:01:03.480> crowd<00:01:03.809> control<00:01:04.229> hybrid<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> guess

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
damaged crowd control hybrid so I guess

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750 
damaged crowd control hybrid so I guess
probably<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.590> bit<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.369> wild

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
probably a little bit like a wild

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.030 
probably a little bit like a wild
warlock<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.270> can<00:01:09.420> only<00:01:09.570> assume<00:01:09.720> maybe<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.590> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
warlock I can only assume maybe not you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.380 
warlock I can only assume maybe not you
do<00:01:11.159> see<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.430> also<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:11.909> intermittent

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
see the top left right there I'll click

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.749 
see the top left right there I'll click
on<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> little<00:01:17.070> bit<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.549> what<00:01:17.580> we

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
on that in a little bit and see what we

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.700 
on that in a little bit and see what we
get<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.720> my<00:01:18.869> staff<00:01:19.110> attack<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
get this is just my staff attack it's a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.800 
get this is just my staff attack it's a
ranged<00:01:20.100> attack<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.670> fairly<00:01:21.150> basic<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
ranged attack it's fairly basic and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.280 
ranged attack it's fairly basic and
there<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> go<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> fight<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.310> over<00:01:24.259> so<00:01:25.259> i

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
there you go the fight is over so i

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.600 
there you go the fight is over so i
think<00:01:25.500> my<00:01:25.619> turn<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.040> my<00:01:26.159> action<00:01:26.400> they<00:01:26.460> take

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
think my turn to my action they take

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.880 
think my turn to my action they take
their<00:01:26.729> turn<00:01:26.850> interaction<00:01:27.360> until<00:01:28.140> someone's

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
their turn interaction until someone's

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.060 
their turn interaction until someone's
dead<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.509> does<00:01:30.659> kind<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.049> put<00:01:31.320> us<00:01:31.650> into<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
dead so it does kind of put us into a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.100 
dead so it does kind of put us into a
little<00:01:32.270> instance<00:01:33.270> fight<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.780> other
