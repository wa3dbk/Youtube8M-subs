be<00:01:27.860> really<00:01:28.010> elaborate<00:01:28.460> but<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.540> knock<00:01:29.750> on

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
be really elaborate but the knock on

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.530 
be really elaborate but the knock on
these<00:01:30.170> was<00:01:30.620> kids<00:01:31.610> were<00:01:31.790> up<00:01:31.910> swallowing<00:01:32.450> the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
these was kids were up swallowing the

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.410 
these was kids were up swallowing the
toys<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.080> choking<00:01:33.920> which<00:01:34.460> is<00:01:34.610> partially<00:01:35.390> the

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
toys and choking which is partially the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.320 
toys and choking which is partially the
reason<00:01:35.750> why<00:01:35.870> they're<00:01:36.020> not<00:01:36.050> in<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.290> u.s.<00:01:37.330> so

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
reason why they're not in the u.s. so

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.790 
reason why they're not in the u.s. so
now<00:01:38.510> I<00:01:38.540> think<00:01:38.690> they've<00:01:38.930> thumbs<00:01:39.200> them<00:01:39.350> down<00:01:39.560> for

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
now I think they've thumbs them down for

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.290 
now I think they've thumbs them down for
the<00:01:40.479> for<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.540> stupid<00:01:41.930> kids<00:01:42.170> who<00:01:43.120> like<00:01:44.120> the

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
the for the stupid kids who like the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.130 
the for the stupid kids who like the
plastic<00:01:46.030> there<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.120> go<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:47.479> I<00:01:47.540> guess<00:01:47.720> this<00:01:47.900> is

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
plastic there you go so I guess this is

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.840
