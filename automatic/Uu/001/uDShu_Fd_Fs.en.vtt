00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.270
 with every month okay 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.340
 if it does not work for a month, but not me 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.490
 I will always take the books because I 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.280
 I believe that education is the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.710
 better way is still ok so this is it 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.400
 thanks people, I'll show you guys 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.090
 now how I made the draw to 9 doubts 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.150
 huh 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.899
 and for now this is a must continue 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.470
 being part of it keep participating and I 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.470
 follow 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.960
 so this friends 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.400
 Now I'll show you how I did it. 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.890
 the drawing of the book is not 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.660
 there is a website called dot 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.240
 com 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.790
 so if you have there go 300 numbers 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.330
 to be able to see one among these 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:09.080
 300 number you put here from one to 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.170
 300 puts the raffle and will leave the already 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.750
 The number you intend to enjoy it. 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.080
 Okay, so what, I created a 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.050
 nec spreadsheet a sample spreadsheet does not 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.330
 I'll show you the emails that are with me. 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.670
 because it is unethical right 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.490
 but here we are going to say that there is a half here 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.860
 half here half kinda means that mail 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.910
 that amid the chemo here up going going 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.180
 going there I have until then and that 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:45.020
 so I see how far e-mail goes. 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.090
 saw it was up to 267 or 300 there is something 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:53.540
 like this 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:56.709
 is simple right I put in a a300 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.489
 site like this case here I place 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:05.630
 all e-mails here the list of e-mails 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:08.330
 I'm all here until 3 6 4 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:13.220
 they will say it was up to 364 of mails there 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:17.600
 that's it I put it here 3 6 3 6 4 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:22.310
 so let's go out there so you gave me the 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:26.620
 number 57 generated the number 17 of the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:32.540
