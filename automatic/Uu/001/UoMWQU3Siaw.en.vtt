00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.900
 to classify each of this type of hair more deeply 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.530
 betting now on the sequence of tables is not dealing with the chairs covered the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.040
 types I can find 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.429
 the open chains 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.650
 unification of specific chains 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.390
 Buildings of Rome 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.509
 in the air as the sequence of screens now 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.659
 then it is up to each season in the open chains cyclic 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.520
 about the type of connection that exists between the positions so I can have 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.230
 head dizziness 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.550
 How do I pronounce carbon chains? 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.560
 is the interest and connection between the positions 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.679
 tasso will be the first example and it has much in the 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.890
 what interests me structure in which the carbons 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.810
 so it is well structured that having one head per hectare 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.420
 when the carbons only in actions 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.510
 simple 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.080
 unsaturated is when there are 500 double positions with philippe le jeune actions 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.300
 we will classify these open cabins for the presence of a 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.830
 hectare or bush 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.950
 if you are the first example this one exists lamented today in calm everything 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.020
 different from carbon function of carbonic chain 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.469
 in projects and gm are at the ends 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.620
 are not among the 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.080
 So I'm interested in what's happening in the chain of charges. 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.890
 then as a genius when there is no straight atom present 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.710
 heterogeneity and between the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.079
 there is a table all 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.300
 as catholic coutinho 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.079
 now let's continue sorting the open strings 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.349
 only as to the classification of positions if we switch primary and 

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:34.619
 secondary I like more than normal chain a chain that presents itself 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.280
 positions in the first example there. 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.200
 then the primary and secondary pentagon is normal 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.390
 the case also today 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.120
 the other unified there will be a chain that has the tertiary or cargolux 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.990
 quaternary covers with the commendation I thought of something in gold then having more than 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.060
 one end 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.979
 their unified heads 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.549
 my life nor the mogi the pact not only because it fits the gap in the classification 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.620
 of the tambaÃº chain will have closed-loop cyclic chairs 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.479
 then the chains there are cyclic or closed or cyclic there 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.799
 kadri classifies the chain of positions as to the type of link between the 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.020
 positions are again 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.930
 saturated course there are five indications 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.020
 unsaturated double bonds with a triple bonds 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:25.009
 still talking about closed booths now regarding the presence of the actor the act 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:29.789
 then it is one of the 5 75 that which is the macabeu cyclic knob you when not 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.589
 there is everything there 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:34.739
 in the chain I want even how much in the chain 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.870
 there is one in which the carbons in the cycle 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.689
 has a conference in Kabul 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.119
 ethics, now referred to as the classification of the type of 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:46.519
 coal then stay is a cyclic closed chain in the cyclic chain 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.849
 those with primary and secondary positions 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.739
 is a branched chain 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.879
 click here and vote 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.859
 tertiary carbons while hernanes andrews there are as cyclical there 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.849
 You only have cable acts. 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.540
 now to finalize is missing what they chains for the mart and carrefour 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.720
 then see how you can classify some head not 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.640
 arctic so we have botafogo and aromatic classification 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.730
 even if they try to mobilize and coi 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.200
 so I can rate 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.660
 as for the number d in the ground christ then mononuclear I have only a profit 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.760
 of December but nuclear coutinho users in the case of benzema scored 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.609
 is another way of sorting the aromatic chains are 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.109
 as to the disposition of these profits were marques then isolated nuclei 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.960
 there is no maximum carbon commitment commitment in which profits in the year 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.990
 the first example 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.430
 in others as closed when the carbon acts of profits 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.659
 when he meets an assembly with armed men 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.299
 what we learned today was a little bit of the introduction of that colleague 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.620
 nick we learned the type of carbon carbon bonds makes it 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.309
 Rating on the chains closed closed romantic 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:57.889
 Do the exercises is a very simple thing to do. 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.619
 came in the wake of new very sweetheart 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.149
 I did not study until the next
