00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.780
 of cargo during all these years 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.050
 forever 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.510
 personally, we have tried to 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.730
 to see something different 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.050
 I have asked for support from my brothers 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.620
 my friends are also in the band 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.959
 about what we could do that we could 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.540
 innovate in the sound of the band makes 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.780
 approximately four or five years by 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.610
 a need that some musicians 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.489
 My friends had two weeks 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.290
 of vacations to mexico then the 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.330
 situation was to stay in three to two 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.030
 weeks in which there is a very committed 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.769
 strong and we could not let it go then 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.540
 far from telling me not to compromise 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.519
 leave us and there we are there we have to 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.380
 do it then suddenly it was me 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.600
 happened to incorporate the sound of what 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.890
 is the bench so that people do not 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.610
 I would have that at that time we were nothing 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.610
 plus 12 musicians 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:05.050
 then it was something that started to work 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.000
 and it was something new in this roll and believe me 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.769
 that everything started from a need and I 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.569
 I think God is so big that inside 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.310
 of everything bad that happens to happen in your 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.050
 life because at that time they were not trying 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.580
 four musicians and they were very bad for 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.560
 us that led me to 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.300
 as head of group go I took 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.210
 make the decision to stop the bass 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.390
 sixth and my concern at that time 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:32.420
 it is becoming fortune and 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:35.920
 innovation as well as it's good for 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.920
 scratch and friend you have to tear 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.560
 while from the skin but that's not 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.830
 true 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:04.390
 this is not useful for me 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:09.250
 If I like it I like it I do not care what 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:14.040
 the more I want is the amount and that they are 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:17.470
