00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
you're got to take for a number one out

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.500 
you're got to take for a number one out
you<00:02:22.390> plug<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> fifth<00:02:23.020> string<00:02:23.350> on<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:23.620> one<00:02:24.510> so

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
you plug the fifth string on this one so

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.670 
you plug the fifth string on this one so
then<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.780> answer<00:02:25.810> would<00:02:26.140> sound<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.410> little<00:02:26.500> bit

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
then the answer would sound a little bit

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:36.490 
then the answer would sound a little bit
like<00:02:26.830> this
