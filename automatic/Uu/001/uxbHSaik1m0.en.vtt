00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.300
 and hi everyone and 10 88 and we get 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.400
 found for the first part of 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.100
 spotlight who on my younger men 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.500
 so as I said more videos 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.960
 short more videos an issue have 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.180
 tried more regular the young that I do not 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.050
 do not know for the moment how much 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.470
 will have two parts of the world at several 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.239
 but there will be several so for 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.930
 start we'll start with 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.850
 energies so what you need to know - 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.540
 kaisen will do the conversion is that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.640
 the mode and in joules unit of measure of 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.440
 mechanisms so for me conversions 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.379
 I'm on strike because I play I 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.600
 am screaming where I'm doing the spotlights 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.800
 on the bio tech easter all the links 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.440
 in the description as usual 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.910
 so that it is in dream that all that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.949
 can change in the file of course from 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.680
 config whose cries for rff conversion 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:07.560
 equals 2.5 joule dijoux makes a goal 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.760
 so if you use biotech by 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.180
 lucas ic2 4f will give a little a way there 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.950
 for conversions so for energy 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.860
 on vacation with transfer cables 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.140
 of energy there are four basic 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.070
 which can carry 200 and rave 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.159
 party qu but also the executives a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.000
 peculiarity is that as in term 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.930
 in the expansion each each cable is 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.570
 a kind of little buffer so that's who 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.250
 can store energy up to the 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.000
 transfer rate so that's 200 rave 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.479
 party each cable will store in addition to 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.860
 100 f for vans 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.860
 we are at eight hundred students per type of 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.439
 transfer is so 800 rf in each 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.540
 cable for the elite 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.020
 so we start having some transform 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.840
 at 3200 partick still with 3200 of 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.910
 block storage and ultimate all 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.300
 assets 2800 and ref 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.820
 if google have debab implants at 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.020
 above years redstone energy cables 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.780
 Conduction of Termoli Expansion 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.060
 four different types of cables so 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.450
 that be different kind of successful match 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:33.860
 you will be doubting so the base itx 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.860
 which can store 800,000 eref 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.300
 the advance 3.2 million lÃ© ref 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:47.270
 elite 12.8 million f 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.270
 and the ultimate being 51 million 200 thousand 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.930
 so here's the presentation of 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.690
 different spring energies to see 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.590
 how it works 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.640
 so the cases not in the explanation 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.760
 it's all stupid but so that the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:09.750
 batteries it is necessary to know it is 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:11.390
 that there the pardon exit then all the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.070
 faces of a cube intends to take a 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:19.709
 mattress so there is empty every phase 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:24.660
 study entries except the one that has the small 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:28.590
 plate here douar leaves an exit or at 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.060
 shelter there we are on an entrance cable 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.350
 and here I take a rule then 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.680
 any any mode 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.380
 Ultra total charges badly March or on 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.670
 the configurator of mechanisms that puts 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.209
 a function we will see in a 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.180
 next video 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.600
 a little click on the side where I want it 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.630
 kind 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.020
 hop it goes out it works too the chief 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.600
 click 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:55.680
 the opposite of where we want it 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.970
 go out so here's just there you 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:03.300
 see that it fills up here for example 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.620
 hop I put him on that side up l200 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.470
 key and then the cables filled themselves 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.720
 they still have energy 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.730
 but the battery can fill up more 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.820
 So here it is here for 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.210
 four batteries 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.020
 so that's empty they're in there 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.549
 there is no animation 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.430
 but that's when it starts to 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.010
 fill the the cube that floats becomes 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.169
 more and more intense and vice versa 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.600
 of reprieve solid m it loses its color 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:38.100
 up another great thing of this mode this is 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.140
 that cables convert all all 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.510
 the stylists and energy do not know 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.950
 like except one the poor man stim pack 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.090
 converter unfortunately does not convert 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:51.150
 not the style but the joules at the base 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.450
 you can connect well to the schedule 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:59.010
 is making doubting a battery to rusher 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:02.419
 f can also be plugged directly 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:07.860
 streets here to recharge directly in 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:10.590
 he and of course also angie 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.800
 directly all over there for me the 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:19.500
 put in there and of course see 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:26.190
 directly ddm so here's converted 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:30.780
 also pop the milks for universal 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:33.120
 electric we are more of 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.810
 unity and that's all for this 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:41.010
 first part on the energy of nice bk 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.120
 I tell you very quickly for the continuation of 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.750
 this spot lights 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.750
 see you soon
