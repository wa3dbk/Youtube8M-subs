00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.709 
couldn't go for some black smoke because
the<00:01:54.840> cars<00:01:55.020> black<00:01:55.460> windows<00:01:56.460> at<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.939> limo<00:01:57.360> tint

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
the cars black windows at that limo tint

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.170 
the cars black windows at that limo tint
and<00:01:58.189> that's<00:01:59.189> pretty<00:01:59.340> much<00:01:59.460> all<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.030> do

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
and that's pretty much all you can do

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.359 
and that's pretty much all you can do
but<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.570> does<00:02:00.750> make<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.290> nice<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:02.189> know<00:02:02.340> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
