00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.299 
the next subject we're going to talk
about<00:00:08.080> our<00:00:08.260> blues<00:00:08.500> study<00:00:08.710> is<00:00:08.889> left<00:00:09.130> hand

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
about our blues study is left hand

about our blues study is left hand
patterns<00:00:09.700> we're<00:00:10.330> gonna<00:00:10.450> go<00:00:10.630> over<00:00:10.719> five

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:11.049 
patterns we're gonna go over five

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.080 
patterns we're gonna go over five
patterns<00:00:11.620> that<00:00:11.889> I<00:00:11.920> found<00:00:12.250> very<00:00:12.340> useful<00:00:12.610> over

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
patterns that I found very useful over

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.730 
patterns that I found very useful over
the<00:00:13.210> course<00:00:13.420> of<00:00:13.540> my<00:00:13.660> career<00:00:13.720> let's<00:00:14.620> get

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
the course of my career let's get

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.249 
the course of my career let's get
started

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:16.259 
started

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.920 
started
left-hand<00:00:17.259> batter<00:00:17.439> number<00:00:17.770> four<00:00:17.980> um<00:00:18.930> this

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
left-hand batter number four um this

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.210 
left-hand batter number four um this
particular<00:00:20.110> pattern<00:00:20.529> is<00:00:20.710> interesting<00:00:21.130> is

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
particular pattern is interesting is

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.769 
particular pattern is interesting is
because<00:00:21.400> for<00:00:21.760> the<00:00:21.820> first<00:00:22.029> three<00:00:22.300> patterns

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
because for the first three patterns

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.570 
because for the first three patterns
we've<00:00:23.020> done<00:00:23.260> really<00:00:23.529> to<00:00:23.890> beat<00:00:24.130> patterns

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
we've done really to beat patterns

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.730 
we've done really to beat patterns
whereas<00:00:25.090> we<00:00:25.300> had<00:00:25.539> it<00:00:25.960> started<00:00:26.230> over<00:00:26.710> again

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
whereas we had it started over again

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.210 
whereas we had it started over again
after<00:00:27.609> two<00:00:27.820> beats<00:00:28.060> for<00:00:28.359> example<00:00:28.869> here's

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
after two beats for example here's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:42.360 
after two beats for example here's
pattern<00:00:30.220> number<00:00:30.340> three<00:00:30.670> we<00:00:30.850> have<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:42.010> starts

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
pattern number three we have it starts

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.200 
pattern number three we have it starts
over<00:00:42.520> again<00:00:42.820> okay

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
over again okay

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.119 
over again okay
now<00:00:43.450> this<00:00:43.660> pattern<00:00:43.930> this<00:00:44.440> is<00:00:44.559> actually<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:44.890> very

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
now this pattern this is actually a very

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.250 
now this pattern this is actually a very
cool<00:00:45.340> pattern<00:00:45.760> okay<00:00:46.059> it's<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.719> full<00:00:47.050> bar

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
cool pattern okay it's a full bar

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:56.420 
cool pattern okay it's a full bar
patterns<00:00:47.680> full<00:00:48.040> bar<00:00:48.280> four<00:00:48.640> here<00:00:48.879> it<00:00:49.000> goes

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.620 

start<00:00:58.320> start

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.079 

okay<00:01:02.630> let's<00:01:03.200> take<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.410> look<00:01:03.530> at<00:01:03.740> this<00:01:03.860> all<00:01:04.760> right

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
okay let's take a look at this all right

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.350 
okay let's take a look at this all right
so<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:07.190> way<00:01:07.310> we<00:01:07.460> started<00:01:07.790> almost<00:01:08.120> all<00:01:08.240> the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
so the way we started almost all the

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.740 
so the way we started almost all the
pattern<00:01:08.630> so<00:01:08.810> far

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.780 

very<00:01:13.290> similar<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:14.190> pattern<00:01:14.760> number<00:01:15.000> three

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
very similar to pattern number three

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.700 
very similar to pattern number three
that<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.540> very<00:01:18.570> similar<00:01:19.140> pattern<00:01:19.470> number

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that one is very similar pattern number

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.980 
that one is very similar pattern number
two<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.190> we're<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.550> see<00:01:20.700> em<00:01:20.820> G<00:01:21.000> twice

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
two so we're going to see em G twice

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.200 
two so we're going to see em G twice
you<00:01:23.229> flat

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
you flat

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:35.870 
you flat
seem<00:01:27.160> gc8<00:01:28.160> twice

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.610 

okay<00:01:36.880> cool<00:01:37.210> let's<00:01:37.600> take<00:01:37.660> a<00:01:37.810> listen<00:01:38.050> this<00:01:38.320> or<00:01:38.500> on

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
okay cool let's take a listen this or on

00:01:38.620 --> 00:02:14.770 
okay cool let's take a listen this or on
all<00:01:38.770> 12<00:01:38.980> bars<00:01:39.460> now

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.420 

March<00:02:15.780> 12

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:31.030 

you

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.099
