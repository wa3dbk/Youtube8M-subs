00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
1.3 megapixel it's a 2 megapixel so very

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.110 
1.3 megapixel it's a 2 megapixel so very
powerful<00:00:43.649> webcams<00:00:44.129> etc<00:00:44.520> now<00:00:44.610> first<00:00:45.000> thing

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
powerful webcams etc now first thing

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.200 
powerful webcams etc now first thing
I'll<00:00:45.180> talk<00:00:45.270> about<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.870> display<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
I'll talk about is the display this is a

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.420 
I'll talk about is the display this is a
15.6<00:00:48.210> inch<00:00:48.329> LED<00:00:48.809> back<00:00:49.020> LCD<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:49.860> actually

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
15.6 inch LED back LCD it's actually

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.209 
15.6 inch LED back LCD it's actually
1600<00:00:51.300> by<00:00:51.719> 900<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.739> your<00:00:52.890> math<00:00:53.010> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
1600 by 900 if you do your math and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.920 
1600 by 900 if you do your math and
divide<00:00:53.399> by<00:00:53.520> 10<00:00:53.699> that's<00:00:53.940> 16<00:00:54.300> by<00:00:54.390> 9<00:00:54.420> aspect<00:00:54.600> ratio

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
divide by 10 that's 16 by 9 aspect ratio

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.229 
divide by 10 that's 16 by 9 aspect ratio
means<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> were<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> play<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.460> high-def

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
means if you were to play a high-def

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.220 
means if you were to play a high-def
video<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.750> would<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:57.960> any<00:00:58.020> type<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
video on here you would get any type of

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.840 
video on here you would get any type of
letterboxing<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> sides<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.550> get

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
letterboxing on the sides you just get

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.340 
letterboxing on the sides you just get
pure<00:01:00.090> full<00:01:00.329> screen<00:01:00.539> video<00:01:00.780> which<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.320> very

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
pure full screen video which is very

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.290 
pure full screen video which is very
very<00:01:01.680> nice<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.640> thing<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.940> powered<00:01:03.270> by

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
very nice now this thing is powered by

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.590 
very nice now this thing is powered by
an<00:01:03.420> Intel<00:01:03.750> Core<00:01:04.019> 2<00:01:04.080> Duo<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:05.010> 80<00:01:05.220> 65<00:01:05.970> 70<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.540> a

those little advantages where the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.740 
those little advantages where the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
products a little bit faster it's got

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
products a little bit faster it's got

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
1333 megahertz

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
1333 megahertz
memory<00:01:15.090> that's<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.540> very<00:01:15.750> common<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.140> laptops

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
memory that's not very common on laptops

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.289 
memory that's not very common on laptops
at<00:01:16.650> all<00:01:16.979> even<00:01:17.280> high-end<00:01:17.640> gaming<00:01:17.850> laptops

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
at all even high-end gaming laptops

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.929 
at all even high-end gaming laptops
don't<00:01:18.479> usually<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.869> memory<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.680> fast<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
don't usually have memory that fast to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.370 
don't usually have memory that fast to
250<00:01:21.240> gigabyte<00:01:21.509> harder<00:01:21.780> that's<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
250 gigabyte harder that's in here is a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.109 
250 gigabyte harder that's in here is a
7200<00:01:23.040> rpm<00:01:23.340> drive<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> little<00:01:24.030> bit

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
7200 rpm drive so it's a little bit

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.730 
7200 rpm drive so it's a little bit
faster<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.750> your<00:01:24.960> standard<00:01:25.200> laptop<00:01:25.320> drives

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
faster and your standard laptop drives

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
faster and your standard laptop drives
well<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.040> access<00:01:26.430> your<00:01:26.460> information<00:01:26.689> quicker
