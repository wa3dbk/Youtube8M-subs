guests that meant that a normal
animation<00:01:38.130> player<00:01:38.340> would<00:01:38.579> not<00:01:38.729> work<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.479> we

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
animation player would not work so we

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.569 
animation player would not work so we
had<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.900> design<00:01:40.229> new<00:01:40.560> ideas<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.280> order<00:01:41.490> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
had to design new ideas in order to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.160 
had to design new ideas in order to
attract<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.000> guest<00:01:42.210> position<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.780> movement

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
attract the guest position and movement

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.679 
attract the guest position and movement
so<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.799> built<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.130> new<00:01:44.310> animation<00:01:44.909> system<00:01:45.329> that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
so we built a new animation system that

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.090 
so we built a new animation system that
would<00:01:45.810> take<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.200> information<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.860> real<00:01:47.070> time

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
would take that information in real time

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.080 
would take that information in real time
and<00:01:47.899> adjust<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.049> our<00:01:49.170> guests<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.280> we're<00:01:50.909> able

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and adjust to our guests so we're able

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.300 
and adjust to our guests so we're able
now<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.450> bring<00:01:52.140> those<00:01:52.290> ghosts<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> life<00:01:52.860> they
