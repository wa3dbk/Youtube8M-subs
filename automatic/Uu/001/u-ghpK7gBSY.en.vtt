different areas in your empire some of

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.080 
different areas in your empire some of
these<00:04:41.050> areas<00:04:41.350> is<00:04:42.100> simply<00:04:42.400> off<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:42.760> on<00:04:42.880> like

these areas is simply off and on like

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.530 
these areas is simply off and on like
for<00:04:43.930> example<00:04:44.020> ship<00:04:44.500> design<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:45.070> can<00:04:45.540> automate

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
for example ship design you can automate

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.219 
for example ship design you can automate
that<00:04:46.930> or<00:04:47.080> not<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:49.030> on<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.240> right<00:04:49.390> here<00:04:49.630> some

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
that or not but on the right here some

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.640 
that or not but on the right here some
of<00:04:50.260> these<00:04:50.410> areas<00:04:50.700> have<00:04:51.700> three<00:04:52.030> levels<00:04:52.660> you<00:04:53.410> can

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
of these areas have three levels you can

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.190 
of these areas have three levels you can
turn<00:04:54.160> it<00:04:54.340> off<00:04:54.460> you<00:04:55.150> can<00:04:55.360> fully<00:04:55.750> automate

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
turn it off you can fully automate

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.440 
turn it off you can fully automate
things<00:04:56.410> or<00:04:56.979> you<00:04:57.010> can<00:04:57.400> go<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:57.970> an<00:04:58.150> intermediate
