completely useless if anything else it's
a<00:02:24.090> liability<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.959> can<00:02:25.050> no<00:02:25.170> longer

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
control ah Sauron excited actually I

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.570 
control ah Sauron excited actually I
don't<00:02:28.560> think<00:02:28.590> either<00:02:28.770> player<00:02:29.099> here<00:02:29.340> really

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
don't think either player here really

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.130 
don't think either player here really
has<00:02:29.610> an<00:02:29.790> advantage<00:02:30.090> they're<00:02:30.450> both<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> air

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
has an advantage they're both in the air

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.140 
has an advantage they're both in the air
arguably<00:02:31.800> minor<00:02:32.129> makers<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.819> little<00:02:33.000> bit

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
arguably minor makers is the little bit

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.910 
arguably minor makers is the little bit
closer<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> ground<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.989> mean<00:02:34.440> if<00:02:34.590> he<00:02:34.709> was

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
closer to the ground I mean if he was

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.830 
closer to the ground I mean if he was
that<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.519> inclined<00:02:35.879> probably<00:02:36.420> spread<00:02:36.660> his

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
that so inclined probably spread his

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.509 
that so inclined probably spread his
legs<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.140> try<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.440> push<00:02:37.590> her<00:02:37.769> onyx<00:02:38.040> out<00:02:38.190> but

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
legs to try and push her onyx out but

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.030 
legs to try and push her onyx out but
really<00:02:39.330> could<00:02:39.629> still<00:02:39.930> go<00:02:40.170> either<00:02:40.440> way<00:02:40.650> here

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
really could still go either way here

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.540 
really could still go either way here
and<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.190> think<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.400> might<00:02:41.550> um

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
and I think we might um

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.150 
and I think we might um
I<00:02:42.610> really<00:02:43.480> am<00:02:43.630> worried<00:02:44.410> about<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.710> right<00:02:44.950> arm

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
I really am worried about that right arm

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.790 
I really am worried about that right arm
sir<00:02:45.460> onyx<00:02:45.760> here<00:02:45.880> that's<00:02:46.060> really<00:02:46.390> gonna<00:02:46.510> walk

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
sir onyx here that's really gonna walk

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.680 
sir onyx here that's really gonna walk
always<00:02:47.800> take<00:02:48.010> he's<00:02:48.190> gone<00:02:48.550> for<00:02:48.730> an<00:02:48.790> aggressive

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
always take he's gone for an aggressive

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.240 
always take he's gone for an aggressive
move<00:02:49.900> there<00:02:50.110> sir<00:02:50.290> alex<00:02:50.530> has<00:02:50.620> gone<00:02:50.770> for<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> very

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
move there sir alex has gone for a very

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.590 
move there sir alex has gone for a very
aggressive<00:02:51.550> move<00:02:51.910> trying<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.210> throw<00:02:52.360> manner

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
aggressive move trying to throw manner

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.840 
aggressive move trying to throw manner
onto<00:02:52.870> his<00:02:52.960> back<00:02:53.170> I'd<00:02:53.920> say<00:02:54.130> minor<00:02:54.430> with<00:02:54.760> the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
onto his back I'd say minor with the

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.670 
onto his back I'd say minor with the
advantage<00:02:55.300> here<00:02:55.480> although<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.780> does<00:02:55.990> look<00:02:56.470> up

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
advantage here although it does look up

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.770 
advantage here although it does look up
maybe<00:02:57.010> not<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.430> looks<00:02:58.000> like<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.180> dismember<00:02:58.660> to

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
maybe not that looks like a dismember to

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.120 
maybe not that looks like a dismember to
me<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.050> that<00:02:59.200> could<00:02:59.350> be<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.440> dismembered<00:02:59.890> hand

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
me so that could be a dismembered hand

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.800 
me so that could be a dismembered hand
actually<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:01.150> could<00:03:01.270> be<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.420> very<00:03:01.570> big

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
actually that could be a very big

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.090 
actually that could be a very big
disadvantage<00:03:02.020> now<00:03:02.320> he<00:03:02.380> can't<00:03:02.590> catch<00:03:02.800> himself

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
disadvantage now he can't catch himself

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.040 
disadvantage now he can't catch himself
at<00:03:03.430> his<00:03:03.490> right<00:03:03.670> hand<00:03:03.730> whereas<00:03:04.600> before<00:03:04.720> he

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
at his right hand whereas before he

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.300 
at his right hand whereas before he
could<00:03:05.200> have<00:03:05.350> without<00:03:05.560> this<00:03:05.740> member<00:03:06.070> now<00:03:06.250> he

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
could have without this member now he

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.760 
could have without this member now he
can't<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.970> think<00:03:07.210> this<00:03:08.050> could<00:03:08.230> be<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.440> deciding

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
can't I think this could be the deciding

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:17.190 
can't I think this could be the deciding
round<00:03:09.040> right<00:03:09.400> here<00:03:12.900> mmm<00:03:13.900> man<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:15.460> oh<00:03:16.200> well

round right here mmm man and oh well

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.450 
round right here mmm man and oh well

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
shit on me that is a fantastic reversal

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.100

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
very very very good reversal let's get a

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.410 
very very very good reversal let's get a
look<00:03:35.860> at<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.160> was<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.340> quick<00:03:37.030> twist

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
look at that that was a quick twist

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
look at that that was a quick twist
right<00:03:37.660> there<00:03:37.840> let's<00:03:37.960> try<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.140> get<00:03:38.230> another

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
right there let's try to get another

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.890 
right there let's try to get another
look<00:03:38.590> at<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:38.740> I<00:03:39.040> did<00:03:39.550> not<00:03:39.850> expect<00:03:40.030> that<00:03:40.420> so

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
look at that I did not expect that so

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.320 
look at that I did not expect that so
kind<00:03:41.560> of<00:03:41.620> rotates<00:03:42.160> under<00:03:42.640> himself<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.210> throw

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
kind of rotates under himself to throw
