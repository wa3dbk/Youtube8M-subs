what is up guys just got done replacing

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.789 
what is up guys just got done replacing
my<00:00:04.529> starter<00:00:05.069> here<00:00:05.839> actually<00:00:06.839> was<00:00:07.350> having<00:00:07.649> some

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
my starter here actually was having some

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.770 
my starter here actually was having some
problems<00:00:08.189> with<00:00:08.280> my<00:00:08.400> car<00:00:08.639> starting<00:00:09.559> so<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.590> had<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
problems with my car starting so I had a

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.740 
problems with my car starting so I had a
change<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.929> out<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.880> had<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.910> take<00:00:15.179> off<00:00:15.360> my

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
change it out I had to take off my

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.429 
change it out I had to take off my
intake<00:00:16.289> manifold<00:00:16.890> my<00:00:17.190> throttle<00:00:17.670> body<00:00:18.320> I'm<00:00:19.320> an

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
intake manifold my throttle body I'm an

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.170 
intake manifold my throttle body I'm an
intake<00:00:19.770> over<00:00:20.130> there<00:00:20.279> know<00:00:20.550> if<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.730> guys<00:00:20.910> can

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
intake over there know if you guys can

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.090 
intake over there know if you guys can
see<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.570> it's<00:00:22.080> got<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> dark<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.980> need

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
see it it's got a dark in here I need

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.060 
see it it's got a dark in here I need
some<00:00:23.340> better<00:00:23.460> lighting<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.109> garage<00:00:25.260> but<00:00:25.800> I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
some better lighting on the garage but I

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.339 
some better lighting on the garage but I
think<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.170> about<00:00:28.349> I'd<00:00:29.279> say<00:00:29.449> 16<00:00:30.449> 17<00:00:30.960> bolts

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
think this is about I'd say 16 17 bolts

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.920 
think this is about I'd say 16 17 bolts
all<00:00:31.500> together<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.980> got<00:00:32.130> four<00:00:32.460> bolts<00:00:32.669> on<00:00:33.390> your

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
all together you got four bolts on your

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.610 
all together you got four bolts on your
throttle<00:00:34.320> body<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:34.969> you<00:00:35.969> got<00:00:36.170> four<00:00:37.170> bolts<00:00:37.350> on

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
throttle body here you got four bolts on

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.299 
throttle body here you got four bolts on
your<00:00:37.649> intake<00:00:38.100> manifold<00:00:38.809> you<00:00:39.809> got<00:00:40.230> two<00:00:40.860> bolts

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
your intake manifold you got two bolts

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.110 
your intake manifold you got two bolts
two<00:00:41.820> long<00:00:42.149> bolts<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.050> your<00:00:43.489> starter<00:00:44.489> they

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
two long bolts on your starter they

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.290 
two long bolts on your starter they
might<00:00:45.329> actually<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:46.140> hard<00:00:46.379> to

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
might actually be really hard to

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.889 
might actually be really hard to
actually<00:00:48.300> break<00:00:48.719> loose<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.870> take<00:00:51.870> your

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
actually break loose so just take your

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.680 
actually break loose so just take your
time<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.890> struggle<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.760> you'll

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
time with it don't struggle and you'll

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.209 
time with it don't struggle and you'll
definitely<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> also<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.070> take

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
definitely get it you also have to take

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.290 
definitely get it you also have to take
some<00:00:56.550> bolts<00:00:57.059> off<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> front<00:00:57.780> here

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
some bolts off on the front here

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.729 
some bolts off on the front here
actually<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.690> reason<00:01:00.870> why<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.500> want<00:01:01.680> to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
actually the reason why is you want to

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.030 
actually the reason why is you want to
pull<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.309> black<00:01:02.760> bar<00:01:03.030> back<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.809> where<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
pull this black bar back here where the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.719 
pull this black bar back here where the
point<00:01:06.030> container<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.520> way<00:01:08.670> you

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
point container is and then that way you

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.850 
point container is and then that way you
can<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.150> out<00:01:09.180> your<00:01:09.299> intake<00:01:09.780> manifold<00:01:10.290> you

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
can get out your intake manifold you

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.700 
can get out your intake manifold you
could<00:01:11.100> actually<00:01:11.659> replace<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:13.110> starter

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
could actually replace your starter

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.100 
could actually replace your starter
without<00:01:14.369> taking<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> intake<00:01:15.420> manifold<00:01:15.960> off

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
without taking the intake manifold off

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.560 
without taking the intake manifold off
but<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> would<00:01:17.070> highly<00:01:17.310> suggest<00:01:17.490> doing<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.360> it's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
but I would highly suggest doing it it's

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.080 
but I would highly suggest doing it it's
a<00:01:18.659> lot<00:01:18.810> easier<00:01:19.159> because<00:01:20.159> you're<00:01:20.610> really<00:01:20.939> going

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
a lot easier because you're really going

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.810 
a lot easier because you're really going
to<00:01:21.150> need<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.259> most<00:01:22.650> movement<00:01:23.250> to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
to need you know the most movement to

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.810 
to need you know the most movement to
break<00:01:24.060> those<00:01:24.299> bolts<00:01:24.750> loose<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.759> hopefully<00:01:26.759> you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
break those bolts loose so hopefully you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.569 
break those bolts loose so hopefully you
guys<00:01:26.909> enjoyed<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.570> video<00:01:27.689> basically

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
guys enjoyed the video basically

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.280 
guys enjoyed the video basically
actually<00:01:29.579> my<00:01:29.759> car<00:01:30.000> didn't<00:01:30.270> start<00:01:30.600> at<00:01:30.810> work<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
actually my car didn't start at work and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.620 
actually my car didn't start at work and
I<00:01:31.740> had<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.920> leave<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> at<00:01:32.369> work<00:01:32.579> which<00:01:33.390> really

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
I had to leave it at work which really

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.160 
I had to leave it at work which really
sucks<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.619> went<00:01:35.520> back<00:01:35.700> today<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.960> hit<00:01:37.140> it

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
sucks so I went back today and I hit it

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.870 
sucks so I went back today and I hit it
with<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.380> hammer<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.280> starter<00:01:38.729> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
with a hammer on the starter and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.640 
with a hammer on the starter and
thankfully<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.659> started<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.320> could<00:01:40.470> drive

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
thankfully it started so I could drive

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.350 
thankfully it started so I could drive
at<00:01:40.829> home<00:01:41.780> it's<00:01:42.780> pretty<00:01:43.409> much<00:01:43.500> saving<00:01:43.950> me<00:01:44.040> about

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
at home it's pretty much saving me about

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.810 
at home it's pretty much saving me about
$230<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:45.720> was<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.470> were<00:01:47.340> like

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
$230 I think was like they were like

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.480 
$230 I think was like they were like
quoting<00:01:48.360> me<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.659> 388<00:01:49.619> dollars<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.220> replace

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
quoting me like 388 dollars to replace

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.899 
quoting me like 388 dollars to replace
this<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.180> I'm<00:01:51.810> doing<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.409> myself<00:01:52.759> for<00:01:53.759> about

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
this and I'm doing it myself for about

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.139 
this and I'm doing it myself for about
150<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.720> get<00:01:54.899> about<00:01:54.990> 17<00:01:55.560> dollars<00:01:55.680> back<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
150 I get about 17 dollars back for the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.740 
150 I get about 17 dollars back for the
original<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.729> there's<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.090> original<00:02:00.540> there

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
original so there's the original there

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.130 
original so there's the original there
but<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.520> easy<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.180> there's<00:02:04.020> only

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
but it's really easy to do there's only

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.340 
but it's really easy to do there's only
like<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.860> think<00:02:05.549> three<00:02:05.850> sensors<00:02:06.479> well<00:02:07.200> there's

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
like I think three sensors well there's

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.499 
like I think three sensors well there's
one<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> power<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.910> goes<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
one for the power that goes to the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.020 
one for the power that goes to the
actual<00:02:09.899> starter<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:11.459> then<00:02:11.640> there's<00:02:11.819> two

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
actual starter and then there's two

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.160 
actual starter and then there's two
sensors<00:02:12.450> there's<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.780> bunch<00:02:12.989> of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
sensors there's a bunch of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.930 
sensors there's a bunch of
censors<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.709> will<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.250> take<00:02:14.430> off<00:02:14.640> so

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
censors you will have to take off so

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.880 
censors you will have to take off so
maybe<00:02:15.150> try<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.930> remember<00:02:16.290> where<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.709> put

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
maybe try to remember where you put

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.600 
maybe try to remember where you put
those<00:02:17.099> sensors<00:02:18.800> and/or<00:02:19.800> where<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.280> actually

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
those sensors and/or where you actually

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.650 
those sensors and/or where you actually
had<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.790> put<00:02:20.910> them<00:02:21.000> back<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.390> because

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
had to put them back on because

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.930 
had to put them back on because
otherwise<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.830> might<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.099> a<00:02:23.190> check<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.610> July

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
otherwise you might get a check in July

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.660 
otherwise you might get a check in July
tor<00:02:24.270> might<00:02:24.540> not<00:02:24.690> start<00:02:25.050> well<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.670> hopefully

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
tor might not start well so hopefully

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.350 
tor might not start well so hopefully
this<00:02:26.849> video<00:02:27.120> helped<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:28.280> 2005<00:02:29.340> RSX<00:02:30.120> it

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
this video helped this is a 2005 RSX it

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.150 
this video helped this is a 2005 RSX it
has<00:02:30.540> almost<00:02:30.870> about<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.140> hundred<00:02:31.739> thousand

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
has almost about a hundred thousand

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.880 
has almost about a hundred thousand
miles<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.480> took<00:02:33.630> about<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.930> hundred<00:02:34.350> hundred

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
miles so it took about a hundred hundred

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.650 
miles so it took about a hundred hundred
thousand<00:02:35.459> miles<00:02:35.640> for<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.120> bitch<00:02:36.390> to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
thousand miles for this bitch to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.710 
thousand miles for this bitch to
actually<00:02:37.140> go<00:02:37.560> out<00:02:37.590> on<00:02:37.950> me<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.540> hopefully<00:02:39.540> this
