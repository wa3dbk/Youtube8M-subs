00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.970
 welcome the important and the company sony 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.010
 different by another quite interesting 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.570
 moment she loves absolutely foolishly 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.429
 call your products for example 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.599
 bluetooth headset headset which 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.900
 I hang around my neck now 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.310
 called dr btn 200 well what 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.080
 ok man it is generally remember 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.970
 Dani what and yes the seller is also the way 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.949
 will not immediately understand what they want from him 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.750
 easier to come up and poke a finger well or 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.189
 just somehow on the very same fingers 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.470
 I want to explain this 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.420
 bluetooth-headset here you are just a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.610
 here we are bluetooth headset today and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.530
 let's see by the way he has one 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.329
 feature except all its technical 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.489
 characteristics which we learn in 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.790
 the very end, that is, in the conclusions 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.980
 so go here and so pretty simple 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.460
 too simple for some 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.239
 headphones rim plastic he's pretty 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.879
 hard stretched though it seems that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.699
 strongly but because of the design does not allow 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.820
 pull yourself over a rather large head 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.370
 so if you have height and size 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.989
 approaching Nikolay Valuev 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.270
 be sure to go pomerte even have 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.670
 you are in principle not the smallest height and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.650
 not the smallest head volumes too 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.570
 try on and there may not be everything 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.369
 definitely 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.439
 the headphones cups are foldable and this 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.360
 great because on the one hand 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.790
 safety is better in the bag on the other 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.799
 the sides of the place are less occupied by one 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.090
 from cups on one of our headphones 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.000
 scope for all 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.240
 plus switch activator of this 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.310
 nfc itself on another headphones button 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.729
 last days reception 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.680
 next big fat fat button 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.350
 on-off 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.280
 Slightly above standard volume rocker 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.840
 even higher notification diode below is such 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.180
 here's the trick switch wheel 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.530
 rewind lever 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.469
 songs and run pause 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.890
 this kinda button is not always convenient 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.870
 press but nonetheless 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.880
 I thought that there would be more parasitic not 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.040
 clicked here I did not find them 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.850
 although anyway the best in this vein 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.130
 decide exactly the volume of the compartment for which 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.760
 are located standard successful micro 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.220
 the connector and the hole a little cuts well and 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.980
 standard here is such a thing microphone 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.680
 here's your headphone data landing on 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.600
 the actual user that is me, I 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.330
 Now as you can see in the glasses with me yet 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.920
 there is a headset and naturally 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.540
 I can't say these headphones 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.550
 I feel some discomfort but 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.890
 no less there is a solution and more 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.570
 sitting comfortably on his head 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.070
 Looks like this from the front 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.690
 if we talk in general before us 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.910
 Of course, bluetooth headphones are necessary 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.860
 understand what good quality music you are 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.530
 they do not get well, we understand 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.739
 Compare this with normal wired 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.870
 solutions however for bluetooth 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.420
 Headphone sound is very decent he 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.540
 more or less uniform over the range 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.640
 more or less elastic bass well I understand 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.220
 with errors on bluetooth again 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.560
 more or less well read 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.070
 middle but there are some 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.049
 tops 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.640
 everything is in principle quite good if you donâ€™t 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.290
 listen to some complicated music 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.209
 some classics where there is a lot 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.610
 tools that can seriously 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.549
 lose your sound this headset 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.110
 can live for a long time and live a week 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.180
 if you will and well of course not round 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.209
 for days to listen so in this case 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.720
 no problem there nfc is convenient 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.940
 responsive landing control 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.150
 I have already said it is necessary to measure for everyone 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.190
 Individually here who as it will 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.900
 of the minuses probably that's it 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.180
 speaking part because if you 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.160
 in a quiet room at home sit then you 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.890
 hears if you go out then 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.269
 most likely you will not hear the wind 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.880
 microphone blows out 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.190
 what are the sounds of your speech 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.870
 clog so will yell and you 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.959
 will constantly ask again what 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.329
 how and where and why well and of course sorry 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.950
 that there is no normal full input 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.109
 under the cable as it is in more expensive 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.750
 solutions from other companies could 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.430
 let's connect the cable and listen 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.890
 more qualitatively but nonetheless that 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.440
 we have t'aime 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.660
 the most pleasant thing is that now these ears 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.340
 You can buy already on the Internet for as long as two 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.350
 half a thousand rubles about that 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.820
 very, very tasty price for this 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.650
 solution so if you find 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.660
 be sure to go try in 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.910
 some store and buy believe me 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.520
 for 200 m thousands it is very interesting 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.050
 little thing that's probably all for today I 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.419
 say goodbye to you but briefly 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.419
 for soon there will be new reviews for now
