00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.300
 hello my love i want to like you 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.340
 we show these super super delicious 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.200
 could make black and white rubys 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.200
 believe me you will love her 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.529
 First you need 100 grams of soft 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.480
 My butter is still a bit 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.450
 hard making it rather gives way that goes 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:36.050
 easier then you need 180 grams 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:38.030
 sugar a pinch of salt and then with you 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.949
 the whole thing so beat that look at me 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.870
 A lot goes with the soft butter 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.340
 a lot easier than there a little bit 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.660
 Radmutter then give her two eggs 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.660
 and stir the whole thing well 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.250
 then she stirs 150 grams of melted 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.250
 Milk chocolate underneath 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.399
 and that makes the whole thing good with each other 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.329
 you can also connect again 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:30.939
 girl now we come to the media 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.179
 you need 225 grams for this 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.179
 Flour 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.100
 a packet of baking powder 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.700
 and then the whole looks into yours 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.170
 chocolate mix 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.730
 you do not have to seven but it does not have to 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.450
 just gets a bit finer and so on 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.680
 it does not take much longer 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.390
 then gently stir the flour 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.770
 down and rent this to a 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.770
 even dough 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.840
 then there are still 150 grams 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.560
 natural yoghurt and the whole mixes then 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.560
 also down again 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.330
 that looks really delicious and 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.890
 actually more or less for 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.900
 the color but also a bit 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.960
 for the taste cocoa powder after 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.030
 Add that it is right 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.030
 beautiful dark brown dough becomes 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.910
 and your dough is ready and now 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.390
 Just give her teaspoons big blobs 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.160
 on a sheet of baking paper eighth 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.870
 on the fact that the blobs enough distance 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.130
 because they bake each other 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.130
 later diverge 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.060
 then you heat the oven to about 180 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.910
 Preheat before and during the oven 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.650
 can you ever have 60 grams of butter with you? 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.880
 100 grams of white chocolate for 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:20.660
 Melt brings in a bowl 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.090
 her 250 grams of cream cheese and more 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.780
 then your melted white chocolate 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.780
 with the rod 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.680
 that told her well together and 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.030
 Optionally you can do something else 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.030
 vanilla powder to offer 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.260
 and well under one the whole 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.290
 this is your finished cream now 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.900
 your dough lexicon then for 10 to about 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.610
 15 minutes in the oven let them 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.110
 cool down a bit and then she could 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.110
 remove from the baking paper 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.580
 Now you take your pouch 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.090
 and fill the whole with the cream cheese 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.090
 cream 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.490
 if your pouch filled then 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.160
 you take one of your dough 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.470
 cookies i say now and times 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.510
 give the cream cheese filling on it 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.640
 Do not make it too far on edge 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.800
 now the second part comes in and pushes 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.350
 Just put a second on top of that so 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.310
 the cream between the two 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.310
 cookies with distributed 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.990
 you do that now with a half 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.690
 until all are filled and believe me 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.190
 Each pot fits a packet so 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.800
 somehow it can go down well with me 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.889
 that they are relatively even 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.699
 or similarly wrong 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.699
 found cookies 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.180
 then you put her ready movies for you 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.490
 at least one hour in the 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.680
 fridge and then the fresh 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.380
 cheese cream with the white chocolate stuck 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.180
 have become and they taste super great 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.650
 it tastes so delicious 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.419
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.610
 Bake and eat 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.610
 Believe me, they are just delicious 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:12.350
 See you in the next video 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.350
 the creative he loves stays there
