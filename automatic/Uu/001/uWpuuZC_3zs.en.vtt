00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.940
 go guys at the end and the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.470
 girls too a game you forget you 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.490
 do not worry I do not forget you 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.960
 girls ok I'm for 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:27.449
 so here's plating with oi bull trip 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.990
 this is some phonics 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.579
 yeah actually at the base we have to put 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.050
 in this place since we said we 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.850
 had a problem of place so we were 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.379
 spent waiting for it's a little bit of a 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.180
 seems to me jousting happy places 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.190
 Wow, it's better you see better 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.739
 yeah it seems to me here we had taken over 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.870
 of rigidity so we were not and because 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.610
 that we were in n 36 of m 48 you 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.039
 remind us to overcome this lack 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.780
 of rigidity and ben listen to me I you 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.350
 proposes to a college rather 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.360
 ugly 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.300
 so you can go as well in placo 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:06.840
 impact governed roques president ur of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.369
 high density plates of that blow 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.560
 avoids too much tremor 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.750
 so already 20 acoustic levels it's 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.659
 better and then good listening we were made 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.490
 the little placo plate that I 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.680
 find very friendly not always 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.420
 justified it depends what you do I 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.580
 will explain in other videos but 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.670
 in some strategic places 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.920
 like here for example 3 decibels 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.710
 plus that basically means 50% of the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.619
 Sound power in less wholesale 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.610
 on your ear you hear that attenuates 1% 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.810
 of sound you finally say it's el 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.710
 sheikh for nothing yeah I'm a little 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.409
 little agreement with you 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.670
 so be careful, I'll explain 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.700
 the latest to small acoustics 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.930
 things you sell between percentages 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.729
 which is marked on the stuff is the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.700
 auditive percentage there is a 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.100
 difference so 3 decibels is equal to 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.520
 1% less in your ear than you 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.820
 hear ok but hey it's always better 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.260
 that nothing ok so the little plate of 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.790
 plaster 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.100
 nick so she is much rarer a 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.060
 standard plate booth plate so 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.030
 to identify here or a placo impact 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.920
 here I like it too to an effect too 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.680
 apathetic because ben more rigid 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.930
 but here it is 1.1 m next here 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.450
 then little technical detail I 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.170
 you had explained in an old audio 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.240
 video that here I want the right edge ok 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.010
 no bormes as well as small 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.080
 him his mouth and tac tac tac and got 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.500
 completed so look at the top what 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.750
 I did it a year ago, I see you 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.260
 did the little pick up so you bought 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.690
 gstaad 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.430
 here I inserted so there it is not 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.750
 this one after he will cut the gall 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.700
 put his structure to make his 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.320
 Roller shutter box memory port 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.510
 go if I make them overtake so here there 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.340
 we fall right on the right edge so 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.980
 here perfect finish 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.770
 ok so here I am quiet I would have 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.750
 no coating of two holes of anything 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.360
 it's a little screw of tranquillou 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.120
 normal or hockey and here I come to my 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.700
 structure then on the central you do not 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.040
 see here then forget you are you 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.470
 see my face so forget I had 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.300
 so do you take an amount every 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.390
 thirty centimeters tac tac tac tac 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.660
 hockey and then you go off to staggering 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.910
 15 cm compared to the one next door and you 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.269
 mugs the amount tac tac tac tac touil 30 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.459
 hockey and suddenly it's 1 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.220
 that is to say that basically you had the 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.680
 two amounts stuck to vice so blow 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.209
 you use the rigidity of both 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.610
 amounts and that's important here ok 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.820
 especially do not forget it and until 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.000
 top 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.440
 I'm listening I hope to appreciate 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.540
 this little tutorial pretty complete 1 between the 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.700
 hard syrup to the tackles to maybe 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.880
 little trick to know and then suddenly 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.420
 beaten before a magnificent job and has 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.170
 marked there is no cut one okay there 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.030
 it's a whole plate 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.590
 we hope to leave the joint to finish at 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.239
 side but I died at the terminals at 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.280
 venice is ok there's no cuts at 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.220
 middle of agreement we'll avoid because 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.590
 you will not be able to reintegrate 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.660
 the small medal metal scraps 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.389
 behind to make your reports so you 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.610
 tarring would count something 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.410
 whole a complete panel in Cairo because 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.200
 that it's a truce here the cut he 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.660
 had after but not on as for 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.600
 the chassis screen you see you the 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.229
 pocket doors avoided good luck 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.270
 listen to me I tell you at us 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.370
 right now they looked like they 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.250
 swallow illegal in game by football fan 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:53.250
 but I have seen there a hazard and chao 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.250
 thank you again thank you ciao
