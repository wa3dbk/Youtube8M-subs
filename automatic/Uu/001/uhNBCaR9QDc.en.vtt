00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
why Batgirl you could not play his

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.340 
why Batgirl you could not play his

background maybe the pie maker as a deal

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.840 
background maybe the pie maker as a deal
see<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:34.770> he<00:01:34.829> could<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.070> put<00:01:35.250> his<00:01:35.369> backer<00:01:35.549> cuz

about<00:01:39.150> Damian<00:01:39.840> right<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.470> more<00:01:40.619> likely

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
about Damian right now but more likely

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.590 
about Damian right now but more likely
he'll<00:01:41.189> probably<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> game<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.479> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
he'll probably be in the game but you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.210 
he'll probably be in the game but you
won't<00:01:42.780> probably<00:01:43.049> play<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.409> him<00:01:43.590> maybe<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
won't probably play as him maybe in the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.340 
won't probably play as him maybe in the
future<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.880> Jason<00:01:45.390> Todd<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:46.170> like

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
future do see Jason Todd I would like

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.840 
future do see Jason Todd I would like
that<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.740> more<00:01:46.920> likely<00:01:47.070> he's<00:01:47.280> gonna<00:01:47.399> play<00:01:47.640> as

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that but more likely he's gonna play as

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.450 
that but more likely he's gonna play as
red<00:01:48.210> hood<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:48.570> an<00:01:48.930> antihero<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.860> he<00:01:50.250> probably

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
red hood as an antihero so he probably

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.620 
red hood as an antihero so he probably
won't<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:50.820> part<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> missions<00:01:51.509> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
won't be part of the missions you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.690 
won't be part of the missions you
probably<00:01:51.930> with<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> way<00:01:53.430> they<00:01:53.579> do

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
probably with you like the way they do

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.280 
probably with you like the way they do
in<00:01:53.820> Gears<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.119> War<00:01:54.240> where<00:01:54.600> they<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> Baird

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
in Gears of War where they have a Baird

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.620 
in Gears of War where they have a Baird
and<00:01:55.409> Coltrane<00:01:55.979> his<00:01:56.790> tagging<00:01:57.149> along<00:01:57.240> that's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
and Coltrane his tagging along that's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.240 
and Coltrane his tagging along that's
why<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.780> feel<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.140> Red<00:01:58.350> Hood<00:01:58.530> might<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.950> part

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
why I feel like Red Hood might be part

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.920 
why I feel like Red Hood might be part
of<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.759> batman<00:02:00.030> arkham<00:02:00.210> knight<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:00.750> not

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
of of the batman arkham knight but not

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
of of the batman arkham knight but not

as playable or to play ask maybe they're

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.429

going to make him a you know one of

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.660 
going to make him a you know one of

Drake now we already played as Tim Drake
in

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
in

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.110 
in
batman<00:02:13.770> arkham<00:02:13.980> city<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.910> best

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
batman arkham city now this is the best

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.600 
batman arkham city now this is the best
time<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.450> play<00:02:15.660> as<00:02:15.870> Dick<00:02:16.410> Grayson<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.400> main

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
time to play as Dick Grayson in the main

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.250 
time to play as Dick Grayson in the main
storyline<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.510> would<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.780> great<00:02:18.990> because

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
storyline this would be great because

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.140 
storyline this would be great because
then<00:02:19.470> we'll<00:02:19.860> get<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.250> play<00:02:20.430> as<00:02:20.460> certain

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
then we'll get to play as certain

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.400 
then we'll get to play as certain
characters<00:02:21.480> because<00:02:21.780> we<00:02:21.900> did<00:02:22.080> get<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.230> play<00:02:22.380> as

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
characters because we did get to play as

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.140 
characters because we did get to play as
Catwoman<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.220> main<00:02:23.370> storyline<00:02:23.910> remember

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
Catwoman in the main storyline remember

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.300 
Catwoman in the main storyline remember
at<00:02:24.270> one<00:02:24.300> part<00:02:24.720> you're<00:02:24.870> playing<00:02:25.200> as<00:02:25.380> Batman<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
at one part you're playing as Batman the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.400 
at one part you're playing as Batman the
next<00:02:26.520> part<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.150> had<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.510> play<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> Catwoman

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
next part you had to play the Catwoman

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.080 
next part you had to play the Catwoman
so<00:02:28.710> that's<00:02:28.920> why<00:02:29.040> I'm<00:02:29.130> expecting<00:02:29.670> for<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> next

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
so that's why I'm expecting for the next

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.580 
so that's why I'm expecting for the next
batman<00:02:30.360> arkham<00:02:30.510> game<00:02:30.810> one<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.350> play<00:02:31.500> as

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
batman arkham game one you can play as

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.800 
batman arkham game one you can play as
Batman<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.370> maybe<00:02:32.640> Tim<00:02:32.850> Drake<00:02:33.120> three-member

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
Batman to maybe Tim Drake three-member

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.750 
Batman to maybe Tim Drake three-member
decreasing<00:02:34.320> fourth<00:02:34.830> one<00:02:35.040> probably<00:02:35.430> asked<00:02:35.580> me

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
decreasing fourth one probably asked me

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.070 
decreasing fourth one probably asked me
out<00:02:35.910> there<00:02:36.090> will<00:02:36.180> be<00:02:36.240> another<00:02:36.420> great<00:02:36.600> topic<00:02:36.960> we

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
out there will be another great topic we

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.420 
out there will be another great topic we
could<00:02:37.230> talk<00:02:37.380> about<00:02:37.410> let's<00:02:38.100> get<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.250> hundred

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
could talk about let's get a hundred

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.620 
could talk about let's get a hundred
like<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.850> i<00:02:38.880> can<00:02:39.060> make<00:02:39.120> another<00:02:39.390> video<00:02:39.510> about
