let's address this issue does skipping

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.600 
let's address this issue does skipping
breakfast<00:02:00.240> make<00:02:00.420> people<00:02:00.750> fat<00:02:01.079> that's<00:02:01.829> that's

quite<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.880> claim<00:02:03.240> you've<00:02:03.450> got<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.869> and

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
quite the claim you've got there and

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.550 
quite the claim you've got there and
admittedly<00:02:04.860> there<00:02:05.610> are<00:02:06.530> studies<00:02:07.530> that

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
admittedly there are studies that

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.999 
admittedly there are studies that

being<00:02:13.749> breakfast<00:02:14.200> but<00:02:14.890> let's<00:02:15.249> remember

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
being breakfast but let's remember

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.119

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
this one almost sounds like it could be

this one almost sounds like it could be
related<00:03:19.239> well<00:03:19.599> after<00:03:19.959> all<00:03:19.989> people<00:03:20.979> are

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
related well after all people are

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.129 
related well after all people are
overweight<00:03:21.609> cuz<00:03:21.849> they<00:03:21.970> eat<00:03:22.090> too<00:03:22.269> much<00:03:22.419> food

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139

overweight cuz they eat too much food
too<00:03:23.379> many<00:03:23.530> calories<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:24.250> if<00:03:24.400> they<00:03:25.060> just<00:03:26.189> if

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:27.189 
too many calories and if they just if

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.069 
too many calories and if they just if
they<00:03:27.430> just<00:03:27.790> skip<00:03:28.090> breakfast<00:03:28.509> it's<00:03:28.689> obviously

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
they just skip breakfast it's obviously

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.229 
they just skip breakfast it's obviously
causing<00:03:29.500> them<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.859> overeat<00:03:30.669> or<00:03:30.699> something

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
causing them to overeat or something

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.909 
causing them to overeat or something
like<00:03:31.389> that<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:31.750> we've<00:03:32.079> got<00:03:32.259> this<00:03:32.470> correlation

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
like that and we've got this correlation

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.270 
like that and we've got this correlation
but<00:03:33.669> does<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.180> actually<00:03:34.829> hold<00:03:35.829> up<00:03:36.009> does<00:03:36.250> it

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
but does it actually hold up does it

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.379 
but does it actually hold up does it
actually<00:03:36.549> happen<00:03:38.189> no<00:03:39.189> because<00:03:39.970> we<00:03:40.180> actually

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
actually happen no because we actually

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.780 
actually happen no because we actually
have<00:03:40.840> science<00:03:41.229> examining<00:03:41.949> what<00:03:42.189> happens<00:03:42.579> when

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
have science examining what happens when

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.550 
have science examining what happens when
people<00:03:42.939> eat<00:03:43.419> breakfast<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:43.959> let's<00:03:44.169> look<00:03:44.439> at

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
people eat breakfast so let's look at

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.830 
people eat breakfast so let's look at
that<00:03:44.709> a<00:03:44.739> little<00:03:44.889> bit

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
that a little bit

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.199 
that a little bit
this<00:03:46.840> study<00:03:47.470> sorted<00:03:48.009> people<00:03:48.340> into<00:03:48.729> two<00:03:48.909> groups

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
this study sorted people into two groups

this study sorted people into two groups
Group<00:03:49.659> one<00:03:49.959> God<00:03:50.319> breakfast<00:03:50.889> group<00:03:51.310> two<00:03:51.609> did

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
Group one God breakfast group two did

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.140 
Group one God breakfast group two did
not<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.449> then<00:03:52.900> at<00:03:53.169> lunch<00:03:54.009> both<00:03:54.579> groups<00:03:54.939> were

not and then at lunch both groups were

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.569 
not and then at lunch both groups were
allowed<00:03:55.659> to<00:03:55.689> eat<00:03:56.169> as<00:03:56.319> much<00:03:56.769> food<00:03:57.099> as<00:03:57.549> they

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.789 
wanted in the researchers recorded
exactly<00:04:00.159> how<00:04:00.340> much<00:04:00.549> they<00:04:00.819> ate<00:04:01.259> now<00:04:02.259> there's<00:04:02.590> no

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
exactly how much they ate now there's no

breakfast<00:04:05.019> ate<00:04:05.290> more<00:04:05.680> calories<00:04:05.739> at<00:04:06.729> lunch<00:04:07.769> but

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
breakfast ate more calories at lunch but

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.300 
breakfast ate more calories at lunch but
did<00:04:10.000> they<00:04:10.269> eat<00:04:10.539> enough<00:04:10.989> calories<00:04:11.289> to<00:04:11.829> make<00:04:12.069> up

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
did they eat enough calories to make up

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.069 
did they eat enough calories to make up
for<00:04:12.609> the<00:04:12.759> breakfast<00:04:13.769> know<00:04:14.769> when<00:04:15.729> the<00:04:16.389> calories
