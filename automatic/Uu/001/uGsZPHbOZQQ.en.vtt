00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.090 
alright so what I have here is a new
trap<00:00:34.219> you<00:00:35.219> push<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.120> push<00:00:36.329> button<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:38.460> release

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
trap you push the push button to release

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.689 
trap you push the push button to release
this<00:00:41.100> housing<00:00:41.960> pull<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.079> your<00:00:43.429> rings<00:00:44.429> that

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
this housing pull out your rings that

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.610 
this housing pull out your rings that
come<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.179> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:46.019> you<00:00:46.170> see<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> ball

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
come with it and then you see the ball

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.500 
come with it and then you see the ball
it's<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.699> there<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:54.359> way

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
it's just it's just in there so the way

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.289 
it's just it's just in there so the way
the<00:00:54.629> ball<00:00:54.839> is<00:00:55.019> made<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.979> made<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.609> only<00:00:56.909> come

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:57.299 
the ball is made it's made to only come

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.669 
the ball is made it's made to only come
out<00:00:57.479> one<00:00:57.870> way<00:00:58.670> if<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.879> were<00:00:59.999> to<00:01:00.379> look<00:01:01.379> at<00:01:01.530> it

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
out one way if you were to look at it

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.060 
out one way if you were to look at it
like<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.549> see<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.149> wide

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
like this you can see that it's wide

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.900 
like this you can see that it's wide
this<00:01:05.070> way<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:06.090> little<00:01:06.270> bit<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:06.810> narrow

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
this way and a little bit more narrow

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.620 
this way and a little bit more narrow
this<00:01:08.910> way<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:10.650> what<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> want<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.450> is<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
this way so what you want to do is you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.110 
this way so what you want to do is you
just<00:01:12.660> want<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.080> tip<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.490> comes<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
just want to tip it so it comes to the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.370 
just want to tip it so it comes to the
to<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> front<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.400> maybe<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.700> keep

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
to the front and then maybe just keep

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.690 
to the front and then maybe just keep
bouncing<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.710> down<00:01:19.830> until<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.550> comes

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
bouncing it up and down until it comes

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:50.490 
bouncing it up and down until it comes
slides<00:01:21.030> out

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.140 

so<00:01:51.500> there<00:01:51.650> is<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.800> little<00:01:52.130> mechanism<00:01:52.729> there

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
so there is a little mechanism there

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.969 
so there is a little mechanism there
that<00:01:53.360> maybe<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:53.659> can<00:01:53.840> adjust<00:01:54.590> if<00:01:54.830> it's

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
that maybe you can adjust if it's

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.790 
that maybe you can adjust if it's
getting<00:01:55.220> stuck<00:01:55.900> you<00:01:56.900> know<00:01:57.110> just<00:01:57.470> but<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.619> can

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
getting stuck you know just but you can

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.070 
getting stuck you know just but you can
hold<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.159> back<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:59.060> then<00:01:59.240> you<00:01:59.299> open<00:01:59.690> it<00:01:59.780> up<00:01:59.869> all

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
hold it back so then you open it up all

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.340 
hold it back so then you open it up all
the<00:02:00.110> way<00:02:00.229> make<00:02:00.830> sure<00:02:00.979> it's<00:02:01.100> open<00:02:01.190> all<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.490> way

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
the way make sure it's open all the way

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.710 
the way make sure it's open all the way
and<00:02:03.350> then<00:02:03.470> do<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:04.210> just<00:02:05.210> seems<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.509> come<00:02:05.690> out

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
and then do it just seems to come out

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.920 
and then do it just seems to come out
every<00:02:06.680> time<00:02:10.120> so<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.150> guess<00:02:11.360> if<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.600> gets<00:02:11.720> stuck

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
every time so I guess if it gets stuck

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.070 
every time so I guess if it gets stuck
sideways<00:02:12.440> like<00:02:12.739> this<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:14.120> could<00:02:14.390> come<00:02:14.630> off<00:02:14.660> to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
sideways like this it could come off to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.920 
sideways like this it could come off to
be<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.200> bit<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.560> pain<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:17.030> get<00:02:17.480> out

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
be a bit of a pain to get out

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.150 
be a bit of a pain to get out
so<00:02:18.350> maybe<00:02:18.530> what<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.680> want<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.860> do<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.040> just

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
so maybe what you want to do is just

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.990 
so maybe what you want to do is just
stick<00:02:19.280> your<00:02:19.400> finger<00:02:19.670> in<00:02:19.760> there<00:02:19.790> and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
stick your finger in there and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.750 
stick your finger in there and
straighten<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.480> out<00:02:21.130> like<00:02:22.130> that<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.610> do<00:02:22.730> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
straighten it out like that and do the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.130 
straighten it out like that and do the
same<00:02:22.850> thing<00:02:23.300> just<00:02:24.580> until<00:02:25.580> it<00:02:25.670> comes<00:02:25.790> out<00:02:26.140> so

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
same thing just until it comes out so

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.509 
same thing just until it comes out so
that's<00:02:27.230> how<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.470> get<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.709> out<00:02:30.250> thanks<00:02:31.250> genie

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519
