and mr. bitchy Subaru the four-wheel
drive<00:03:34.139> colors<00:03:35.269> or<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.689> could<00:03:36.870> say<00:03:37.049> that

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
drive colors or you could say that

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.589 
drive colors or you could say that
they're<00:03:37.470> right<00:03:37.709> weak<00:03:38.069> more<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:38.639> rivalry<00:03:39.180> the

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
they're right weak more like rivalry the

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:46.460 
they're right weak more like rivalry the
master<00:03:41.180> rx-7<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.569> Honda<00:03:42.959> NSX<00:03:44.479> Toyota<00:03:45.479> not

master rx-7 the Honda NSX Toyota not

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.759 
master rx-7 the Honda NSX Toyota not
much<00:03:46.680> presence<00:03:47.340> after<00:03:48.019> their<00:03:49.019> making<00:03:49.530> the

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
much presence after their making the

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:57.289 
much presence after their making the
Supra<00:03:51.199> between<00:03:52.199> power<00:03:52.439> supply<00:03:53.659> and<00:03:56.060> stay<00:03:57.060> one

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
Supra between power supply and stay one

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.240 
Supra between power supply and stay one
more<00:03:57.599> I<00:04:00.199> think<00:04:01.199> that's<00:04:01.709> it

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
more I think that's it

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.860 
more I think that's it
the<00:04:02.609> big<00:04:03.000> six<00:04:03.389> in<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.019> Japan<00:04:04.970> during<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.389> late

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
the big six in the Japan during the late

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:14.360 
the big six in the Japan during the late
1990s<00:04:09.139> and<00:04:10.139> I<00:04:10.439> think<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:11.489> ETL<00:04:12.000> was<00:04:12.359> a<00:04:13.370> leading

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
1990s and I think that ETL was a leading

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.529 
1990s and I think that ETL was a leading
pack<00:04:14.819> I<00:04:15.150> mean<00:04:15.299> ever<00:04:15.720> since<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.380> ever<00:04:17.539> released

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
pack I mean ever since the ever released

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:24.590 
pack I mean ever since the ever released
the<00:04:18.780> Alpha<00:04:19.259> 2<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:20.700> had<00:04:21.060> been<00:04:21.389> keeping<00:04:22.169> us<00:04:22.789> 280

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
the Alpha 2 it had been keeping us 280

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.930 
the Alpha 2 it had been keeping us 280
what's<00:04:25.410> our<00:04:25.680> supposing<00:04:26.400> on<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.730> paper

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
what's our supposing on the paper

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.940 
what's our supposing on the paper
obviously<00:04:27.750> they<00:04:28.020> had<00:04:28.410> more<00:04:29.040> than<00:04:29.250> that<00:04:29.690> if

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
obviously they had more than that if

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.310 
obviously they had more than that if
after<00:04:31.950> their<00:04:32.340> dyno<00:04:33.060> tests<00:04:33.600> they<00:04:33.780> they<00:04:34.140> have

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
after their dyno tests they they have

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
after their dyno tests they they have
like<00:04:34.880> 330<00:04:35.880> horsepower<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:38.900> with<00:04:39.900> very<00:04:40.650> minor

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
like 330 horsepower and with very minor

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.660 
like 330 horsepower and with very minor
tuning<00:04:41.910> they<00:04:42.300> can<00:04:42.540> it<00:04:43.260> can<00:04:43.590> achieve<00:04:43.800> much<00:04:44.340> more

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
tuning they can it can achieve much more

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:54.140 
tuning they can it can achieve much more
power<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:49.160> GTL<00:04:50.160> was<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:51.110> best<00:04:53.120> probably<00:04:54.120> a

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
power and GTL was the best probably a

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.870 
power and GTL was the best probably a
very<00:04:54.570> popular<00:04:55.170> choice<00:04:55.410> for<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:56.040> tuners

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
very popular choice for the tuners

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:05.460 
very popular choice for the tuners
Japanese<00:04:57.870> tuners

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.190 

now<00:05:06.040> will<00:05:06.370> be<00:05:06.580> interesting<00:05:07.330> see<00:05:07.660> one<00:05:07.900> of<00:05:08.020> these

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
now will be interesting see one of these

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.750 
now will be interesting see one of these
over<00:05:08.740> here<00:05:08.980> I<00:05:10.200> think<00:05:11.200> it's<00:05:11.410> one<00:05:12.250> more<00:05:12.460> year

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
over here I think it's one more year

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.090 
over here I think it's one more year
maybe<00:05:13.090> next<00:05:13.420> year<00:05:13.690> they<00:05:13.960> can<00:05:14.200> start<00:05:14.650> importing

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
maybe next year they can start importing

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.150 
maybe next year they can start importing
the<00:05:16.200> 15<00:05:17.200> year<00:05:17.500> old<00:05:18.180> cars<00:05:19.180> from<00:05:19.540> Japan<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:20.740> they

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
the 15 year old cars from Japan and they

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.930 
the 15 year old cars from Japan and they
can<00:05:21.400> use<00:05:21.760> it<00:05:22.000> as<00:05:22.650> take<00:05:23.650> a<00:05:23.680> neighborhood<00:05:24.250> as<00:05:24.550> an

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
can use it as take a neighborhood as an

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.660 
can use it as take a neighborhood as an
antique<00:05:25.780> car<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:26.440> it'll<00:05:26.860> pass<00:05:27.190> through<00:05:29.670> nice

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
antique car and it'll pass through nice

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:37.380 
antique car and it'll pass through nice
