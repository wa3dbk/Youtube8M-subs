00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 the tractor we will give you next 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.899
 want to introduce is with a collector 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.069
 in Alsace at home the green giant has 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.500
 already a few years on the hump 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.020
 has a knee joint and comes out of the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.170
 Home John Deere Weekend Chemtrails 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.779
 Do not harrschler the spry retiree 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.650
 the beautiful Alsace can not be a minute 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.380
 sit still 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.689
 He is passionate fairies tractor 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.240
 and you do not only recognize it by his 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.430
 mailbox always busy 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.100
 the 61-year-old is standing 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.200
 agricultural engineering still counts today 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:47.039
 Restore and collect tractors 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:49.469
 one of his biggest hobbies 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.800
 special copy stands in his yard 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.469
 a john deere 86 30 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.910
 a gigant originally from the usa 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.399
 comes during the toy tractor 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.470
 must be ready for use immediately 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.470
 original still to be prepared 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.830
 The oil has to be driven before every ride 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.230
 controlled and filled up 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.110
 so remo prevents engine damage and 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.700
 unnecessary repairs right after 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.620
 The Alsatian had to buy it 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.340
 First aid measures on the tractor 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.920
 make 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.200
 he did not leave and then I did 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.000
 said if they do not bring then 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.000
 Let's get back to ourselves 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.360
 fit and so we got him one 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.580
 nine months work on and so on 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.860
 We have prepared it so far as it has 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.600
 stands 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.580
 Of course you can do something there 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.860
 a little more lane still something 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.850
 Body but that's fine 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.870
 and the mechanics are lively you can 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.870
 go sit on 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.110
 a six-cylinder john deere engine with 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:16.299
 turbocharger makes it possible the barely twelve 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.730
 tons of heavy kink handlebars 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.200
 top speeds of over 30 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.959
 to bring the hourly kilometers 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.930
 but so easy to use 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.120
 It takes a lot of practice to get to it 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.120
 has the twist out with the kink 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.019
 once you get it on it is 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.329
 especially because everything is so behind 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.629
 pans and suddenly you think in the 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.370
 bring machines 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.670
 to drive in a different way than a normal one 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.670
 stature 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:11.689
 a six-cylinder john deere of 10.5 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:14.780
 liter displacement and that's huge 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:20.000
 for his board watch the other hotel and 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.310
 including the then have 75 and 85 liters 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.409
 motor in it 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.590
 with so much power you need too 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:30.650
 a correspondingly large tank here 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.079
 we see the diesel tank is then 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.769
 the upper PTO that I tap 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.530
 it is the clutch drive 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.680
 directly on the gearbox and below 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.930
 the lecture in drive and pivot point 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.629
 is down and up and here is on the left 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.790
 and on the right is the cylinder for the 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:54.829
 Steering that pulls everything together 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.769
 maximum steering angle reaches the 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.400
 super tractor a turning radius of 11.3 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.799
 meters 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.260
 especially on extreme turns 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.260
 it depends on the right tires 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:19.609
 to the shipowners yes more wheels 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:24.320
 that's with bus rims that weighs 850 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:27.139
 kilo from and around 200 and around the 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.199
 tractor stability what must be concerned 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.449
 you drive eight wheels otherwise it is in 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.870
 balance if you turn around or 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:39.380
 something hilly drives otherwise it could be around 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:44.540
 four wheels fall not only for 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.790
 drive home only briefly as remo hirschler 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.930
 had bought the tractor in bordeaux 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.110
 do not deliver anymore 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.080
 Nobody knew what it was the smart 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.690
 but Alsatian still knows exactly where 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.180
 Tiny detail of the good business 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.280
 damn and now we come to 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.350
 most beautiful part why the tractor in 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.860
 Alsace has landed that's the reason 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:10.460
 The PTO has been blown out of overpressure 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.580
 in gear and then they have one 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.650
 fixed plate to have them 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.410
 made but that did not come true as 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:23.139
 still overpressure in it and that was the 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:26.270
 ground where we got in the tent set 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:29.539
 we the diesel tank left and right 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.160
 rich again has two more 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:37.099
 Filter the filter at the bottom of the engine 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:41.270
 Engine is 45 liters in check of the pump 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:44.260
 a little further and forward water with 50 53 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.880
 liter about the wrong one 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.620
 Type designation on the bonnet remo 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.590
 ruler leads on one 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.349
 replacing the bonnet back but whom 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.419
 This little flaw disturbs already if he 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:00.430
 on Alsatian highways one 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.430
 American giant meets
