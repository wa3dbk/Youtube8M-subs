00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.220
“Here’s some of the stories trending This
Week at NASA!”

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.340
NASA’s Curiosity rover celebrated the 3-year
anniversary of its landing on Mars recently.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.830
Since landing, Curiosity has driven nearly
seven miles to its current location at Mount

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.849
Sharp, and found evidence of past conditions
suitable for microbial life.

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.759
To mark the anniversary, NASA is unveiling
two new online tools that will bring the Mars

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.500
experience to a new generation of explorers.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.410
“Mars Trek” is a free, web-based application
that uses more than 40 years of Mars exploration

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.590
data, to provide high-quality imagery of the
planet’s features.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.019
"Experience Curiosity" is a 3-D simulation
program that also uses real data, to take

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.399
viewers along with Curiosity during the rover’s
expeditions on the Martian surface.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.140
Since NASA’s robotic explorers became the
first to study the Red Planet, advances in

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.609
technology have enabled Mars exploration missions
to continue making important scientific discoveries

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.659
and pave the way for humans to reach Mars
in the 2030s.

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:10.320
During an Aug. 6 visit to Marshall Space Flight
Center, NASA Deputy Administrator Dava Newman

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.280
visited the agency’s Composites Technology
Center to see the massive robot that will

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.810
help NASA build the biggest lightweight composite
parts ever made for space vehicles.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.790
The head on the robot’s 21-foot arm uses
up to 16 spools of “hair-thin” carbon

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.780
fibers to create the precisely shaped parts.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.680
Lightweight composites could increase the
weight an exploration spacecraft, like NASA’s

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.970
new Space Launch System rocket can carry,
while also decreasing the total cost of building

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.290
the vehicle.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.670
NASA astronauts Mark Vande Hei and Jack Fischer
are among those named to the Expeditions 51

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.880
and 52 crews to the station in 2017 that will
continue important research to advance NASA's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.840
journey to Mars and make discoveries that
can benefit all of humanity.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.650
When Vande Hei and his crewmates arrive at
the ISS in March 2017, veteran NASA astronaut

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.370
Peggy Whitson will be part of the crew already
onboard.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:14.200
Fischer will follow as part of the Soyuz crew
scheduled to arrive in May 2017.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.230
The next round of NASA’s CubeSat Launch
Initiative is underway – giving students,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.340
educators and others in the growing community
of space enthusiasts, an opportunity to help

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.810
the agency achieve its space exploration goals.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.620
The initiative provides hands-on experience
in designing, building and operating the small

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.250
research satellites.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.110
The program also provides access to space
for the hardware, as secondary payloads on

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.950
NASA spaceflights.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.540
Not to upstage the man in the moon … but
this shot of the International Space Station

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.670
zipping by the moon is pretty cool.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.790
NASA photographer, Bill Ingalls, captured
the station’s lunar transit on Aug. 2 in

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.100
the skies over Northern Virginia.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:05.650

in your backyard, go to http://spotthestation.nasa.gov.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.130
And on Aug. 5, NASA released another shot
of the moon, but this was from a million miles

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.290
away from Earth:

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.850
A NASA camera aboard the Deep Space Climate
Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite captured this

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.070
unique view of the moon as it moved in front
of the sunlit side of Earth in July.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.540
The series of test images in this animation
shows the fully illuminated “dark side”

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.420
of the moon that is never visible from Earth.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.980
And that’s what’s up this week @NASA …

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.560
