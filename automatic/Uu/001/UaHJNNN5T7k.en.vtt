 tutorial a tutorial tutorial tutorial 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.390
 resale 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.559
 that is to say charming tutelage for those 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.730
 who do not know what the purchase is 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.790
 resale bought himself players down 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.910
 price and resell them more expensive it's up to 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.559
 say make a profit and after must 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.030
 aim for a profit there are some who make 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.559
 small profits between 100 200 300 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.100
 400 etc 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.260
 but we are going to aim a thousand credit 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.230
 that is to say, credit we go we will see 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.769
 we will get two players their true 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.150
 price so we know we know by 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.040
 example that david luiz at this 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.020
 hour it costs 6000 because I have it 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.590
 seen before the video is what we will do 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.619
 with 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.740
 we'll get david luiz and his hosts 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.060
 3-3 precisely precisely 3 3 because this 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.670
 cell the device 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.229
 I think they used the most 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.939
 with the 4 1 hour 2 and the captain but 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.729
 the bone i'm doing the load enters the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.350
 4 3 3 so here we go get david luiz 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.860
 here I leave you pause on the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.799
 video here and seen that david luiz costs 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.380
 6000 entries maximum we will try 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.049
 from the auction track to 5000 there he is 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.610
 we do that we do we look for a david 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.049
 luiz so here we can see that she has 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.990
 many 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.990
 she's not a lot finally not a lot 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.090
 who's going to be they'll become our only 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.219
 the m 5000 sure it's safe on that one by 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.340
 put them back on this folder this is the 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.909
 Wallon is going 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.320
 So now we go there is 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.830
 a lot of people who does with the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.509
 pastorets the Pastore yeah it either 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.700
 the property I do not think this hour 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.160
 it is also selling moman and quality 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.599
 I think late patasse if he sells very 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:30.069
 expensive to see them so we search then 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:37.230
 I hear psg there and that's printed mac 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:37.230
 we are going to look at baiona there is none 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.950
 four backgrounds there is the agreement to 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.180
 four backgrounds there the man at 3600 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.790
 when we're dealing it the clat what 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.120
 you will do 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.260
 we 're going to take that off so that would have 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.390
 been more convenient than I do on 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.950
 the web application but it will be a small 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.410
 a little bit of a hassle because I 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.180
 not a very very good pc here is the 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.680
 now to dream knitting tutorial like 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.120
 you explain to me with david luiz is 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.920
 like so pastore sells 1700 3700 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.780
 pardon and you rent go get to 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.810
 the dawn they had to we are going to put 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.989
 2007 in version wii she announced in 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.380
 47 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.670
 so you do not spend the 2700 after 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.849
 if you want to make a profit 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.430
 at 400 small profits that or in me 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.690
 I know how you are like you 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.840
 do you want to do what you want 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.970
 here after there is also with the loïc 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.459
 remy 1 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:46.440
 so it's the same we're looking in France 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.440
 league 1 ol will fetch its price 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.690
 I think they cost the 4000 loïc 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.410
 remy if I'm not mistaken so here we go 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:07.400
 to have gignac she can not find 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:12.890
 4000 we'll see the 4300 gua there was there 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.250
 catherine 304 decent here is 4200 so we 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.250
 could have that there he is selling at 4200 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.700
 we will look to her for some ten 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.980
 years already we will look at 3200 first 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.870
 go down on December 1st look for 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:36.170
 here we are 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:39.890
 we are going to look so here is leila at 650 in 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:47.390
 starting price is to have it but 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:50.300
 also because he has it alas so here it is 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.150
 we are mainly looking for loïc remy who 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.770
 are who are on the list so you 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.080
 do not worry I put three thousand 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.130
 years old starting price finally I believe 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:05.270
 December 1, 3200 at rsa to sell it to 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.710
 4200 so I think he's going to leave the 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.080
 you already see names that have 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.370
 put to 4000 projects at 3000 the first 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.360
 wood because after if you want you 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.970
 make a profit like I do you 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.980
 explain it thank you very much look at this 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.040
 video finally I hope she will have you 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.750
 which will have weighed a lot too 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.040
 because there are a lot of people who 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.730
 ask how fire to have 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.440
 a lot of fun without opening 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.600
 pasta for example me I'm not going 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:35.240
 lie to you at the beginnings of open fuji 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:37.669
 than 1500 no fischer plan so that's it 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.230
 that is to say that now aged 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:44.180
 100 115 thousand canadians will see as 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.750
 you will see at the beginning of the video I 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.000
 think I have 115000 created credit 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:54.140
 only end with a few few 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.900
 packs in bewilderment if I do that I 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.080
 am seized by the kills with the room 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.990
 but also games 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.349
 my team if you want to see it good 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.409
 I have two teams from the big east who more 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.750
 early finally we know that apples jerky 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.370
 that are selling expensive sooner it's after 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.080
 I love Saudi Arabia that runs very 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.419
 fast is good here he is I have a 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.669
 player is a resin lead so ya not 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:21.030
 your dear hulpe robinho 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:24.139
 So these are the people here 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:29.159
 is expensive enough gbagbo 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:31.460
 now I hope that this tutorial 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:33.810
 will allow you from below you too 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:38.099
 a lot of credit if you galley a 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.810
 little bit so if you dreamed 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:41.639
 not only at the beginning if you feel like it 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.319
