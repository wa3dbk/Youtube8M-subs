00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.400
 breathes 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.270
 how about friends here rooms and welcome 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.980
 to this new video and if indeed I 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.290
 I find myself playing bishop 3 because 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.020
 curiously I reach a point where I 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.700
 I said enough driver and that is not to say 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.700
 be alarmed friends keep going up cody 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.500
 everything simply that always happens to me 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.140
 It's like the starting point of the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.760
 university because he went on vacation and 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.320
 it is pure court pure court for stories 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.930
 center the university with so many tasks 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.460
 more coming just making a point 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.570
 that I get angry and I say I do not want more 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.969
 what to do other things 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.230
 then as I say not not 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.170
 be alarmed because those who have been 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.510
 with me from scratch almost almost know me 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.610
 that sometimes this happens to me but good 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.110
 I want to tell you that in this video I'm going to 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.910
 talk a little about the plans 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.710
 that I have for my channel and especially 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.300
 how do you do something very important I want 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.159
 tell them that they are plans that really 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.930
 I want to take out since my channel 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.670
 begins to grow more and more and I'm 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.890
 very excited and therefore every 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.500
 I speak every thing that lives a thing has to 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.180
 to be serious has to be with desire and 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.100
 with the double effort that I said before 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.680
 before I did 100% but now be 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.389
 even more than that then good 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.580
 first of all what I want to tell you 

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:23.560
 is 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.360
 and they have asked me what is going to happen 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.360
 with the emblems or what will happen with 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.730
 everything what you are going to do in the future first 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.260
 that I'm not going to talk about gta 5 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.870
 some rumors that youtube is not going to 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.430
 to upload videos of this but I 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.770
 I have to report more because I think that 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.780
 if it is going to be able therefore it would be my 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.610
 first game of the series I'm very 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.620
 excited because he will not be distracted like that 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.440
 like what campaign have I played for example 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.720
 EU emission of huétor and I know more 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.970
 or less is the style but but good is 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.440
 like I do not know what to upload I still have 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.500
 to see if they are like the games of 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.960
 online or campaign then as I say 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.330
 It is what I do to start 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.300
 incorporate that game to channel number 2 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.920
 mario and phil 4 but now I do dedicate 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.270
 time because the same thing always happens to me 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.190
 that it's going to be a bar the new end and 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.620
 I say I'm going to play it along 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.260
 time this happens and ended up playing pure 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.820
 with that hour it is not a goal that I have a 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.620
 purpose that I have that as far as 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.020
 come out he's going to look like I 'm not going to play 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.520
 that but I 'm going to play both kot with 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.040
 new slow delphi that way I'm going to 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.720
 can upload channel both things and I think that 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.700
 is going to be very father because nothing else is going 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.300
 to be pure cot cody finally i will be able to 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.120
 give variety 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.500
 that they have asked me so much then 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.230
 one side that number three by a lot 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.900
 time I had series in in code that 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.090
 I just left it like that because then I do not 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.650
 I know for different reasons then what 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.090
 What I want to do now is to take back those 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.880
 series that I had but now yes 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.340
 dedicate them to the maximum is to say if he had 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.070
 to say one urinates nothing more than xp's 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.080
 Real life I had directing or advice 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.180
 or how is it going to me or what if I know has been 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.010
 incorporate the previous ones and still 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.480
 have more variety not only in 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.780
 how many games on the channel, but 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.760
 apart in terms of capture series 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.590
 then apart from this I have to see 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.660
 still so the emblems are 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.240
 moves nothing else to what emblems are 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.850
 for clans or it's just a function 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.650
 for everyone as in black ops then yes 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.810
 it's for everyone I'm going to do again 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.580
 emblems and it's for clans because it's not 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.150
 nothing else to do for clans I do not know yet 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.680
 and another thing that also commented 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.230
 Yesterday we are playing a friend and I 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.570
 verifiqué I said you know that sergio 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.390
 what happens is that I do not touch several and it's 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.230
 a game that nothing else is about although I 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.209
 I bought it 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.310
 and tomorrow or just in a 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.930
 week I will do a professional 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.420
 no or is it something that happens a lot in 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.459
 côte and someone buys code passes a 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.470
 week or two weeks maximum one month and the 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.379
 person can get you a good thing 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.590
 and it's very simple and not so simple 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.569
 but a bar on the weekend is a game that 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.390
 it really requires a lot of 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.629
 experience a lot of arms up playing and 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.190
 play and play and improve and that is not a 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.870
 lots of things therefore if I want 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.730
 be good in bali feel 4 I think I'm going to 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.200
 have to dedicate time for now 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.879
 I say goodbye let me down 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.980
 opinions what do they want to see 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.349
 you with great pleasure then I'm going 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.239
 to take into account and for now nothing 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.070
 More minecraft round minecraft I do not hate 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.630
 minecraft ie I do not hate it 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.280
 just that we are still going to play 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.919
 very well then it is somewhat tedious 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.690
 for me but if in some future I read it 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.639
 me and the whole wave with great pleasure 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.740
 friends then for now I say goodbye 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.740
 See you in the next video and bye
