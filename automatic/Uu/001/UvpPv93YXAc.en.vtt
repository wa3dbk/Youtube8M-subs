00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.860
 Yes last time I was this 3 Bakugan 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.860
 Especially this 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:17.110
 By 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:18.410
 I made a very subtle wheat meal debut, but actually it is then 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.980
 one more 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:27.619
 There are those that had bought it here 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.619
 It is a bomb blast timer 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.890
 It is an official timer when you do a bag like this 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:54.570
 I think this is want without permission count and like you I immediately opened us regularly 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.240
 Contents are the timer and instructions 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.540
 And 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.400
 Say this 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.050
 Gachi detonation 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.980
 It is a guy like a manual 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:10.760
 It is a venture carbonate No. 2 was put i battery 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.270
 Then we think that we want to actually use 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.979
 At first it was the main body 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.979
 Power on 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:26.500
 That's good luck 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.250
 And when you press here it seems that counting starts 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.250
 I will 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.540
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:20.709
 It seems it will pass through 15 times 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.780
 It's an immersive voice every time you press here 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.780
 Counting starts from the beginning 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.110
 In manual says 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.670
 This count is 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:40.450
 City counter is not an accurate class from 10 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.450
 It seems that the count of 1 a from is not accurate 3 seconds 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.599
 Pretty even Well I guess is that a guideline Adeje 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.599
 Really do atmosphere comes out 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:58.150
 Personally I like this great 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:01.409
 It is exciting to have a timer like this on playing men's games 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.060
 I thought I wanted it so but I thought it was a toy 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.470
 Ne was 198 yen 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.470
 I this is was good to buy 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.950
 Pachi-back or Gachi 1 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.340
 I think that I would like to use this when it comes to becoming 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.340
 Goodbye
