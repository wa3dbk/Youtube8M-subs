00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.200
 hello today we'll talk about 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.170
 what window should we choose 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.610
 quickly about what the window consists of 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.170
 plastic profile 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.550
 glass package fittings everything is not all 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.500
 this is a professional installation and 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.539
 high-quality finishing and warming of slopes 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.649
 and so the plastic profile takes 20 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.270
 percent of the entire window area 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.469
 so for glazing cold 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.360
 premises namely balcony loggia 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.969
 production areas we of course 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.410
 recommend installing three-chamber 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.420
 loggia balcony glazing profile 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.329
 apartments and other premises that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.000
 plan to heat we recommend 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.570
 install such a camera system 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.379
 profile for glazing private cottages 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.270
 houses and apartments that are installed 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.000
 heating system 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.390
 we recommend to opt for 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.540
 6 chamber profile system with three 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.970
 sealing contours more about 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.729
 profiles and rubber sealing 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.180
 we talk video where I tell 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.110
 Why have you been working for 8 years with a profile? 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.259
 aluplast 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.400
 now let's talk about the remaining 80 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.400
 percent window 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.460
 through which the main heat goes 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.390
 This is a double-glazed window when it calls me 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.570
 client and says read me one their 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.990
 best hardware best pro 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.950
 And 2 glasses are enough here and so warm 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.740
 I understand the conversation will be long familiar 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.680
 and double-glazed window then there are two glasses now 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.570
 Already, even by law, you need 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.840
 only put out of heat 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.900
 premises in Ukraine 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.110
 you must select a minimum of double glazing 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.640
 consisting of three glasses 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.489
 two-chamber double-glazed window which is not 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.850
 Only quality will keep warm 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.680
 excellent sound insulation but also insure 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.560
 you from misting windows 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.080
 about multifunctional glass we 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.860
 let's talk about in the video about double-glazed windows 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.560
 and so the hardware is 20 percent of the cost 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.160
 the window is occupied by fittings 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.920
 so many one-day firms selling 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.250
 windows from the advertised brand for 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.300
 more gains from cheap not 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.060
 high-quality hardware accessories video 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.880
 I will tell you why fittings from 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.730
 European manufacturer is reliable 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.989
 window work for decades now 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.170
 let's say you understand what exactly you 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.780
 need a window you are defined on the profile 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.880

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.000
 fittings 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.709
 next most important component 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.410
 good quality window 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.460
 This is a professional installation with 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.820
 using by the world 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:19.210
 me and of course without saving on installation 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.810
 materials even the most super cool windows 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.750
 top quality with all the bells and whistles 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.790
 can be ditched by improper installation 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.220
 after improper window installation 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.050
 freeze everything understood and stop 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.530
 to open in six months 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.500
 operating generation component 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.680
 your window is the correct one 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.280
 warmed slope if trim slopes 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.610
 hold the sky technology waiting for you raw 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.490
 wall mold growth and of course 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.310
 rework slope wanna draw your 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.200
 attention to the windowsill I 'm sure 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.690
 save on windowsill it 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.220
 crime for which you need to render 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.770
 Do not forget 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.770
 windows you set for decades 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.720
 take care of quality weatherization 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.330
 opening and installing cheap 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.760
 the window sill is also called the standard 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.150
 then make a quality finish 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.400
 slopes and it turns out that the window sill 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.210
 neighbors though was a little more expensive but 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.760
 looks better yes and not so worn 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:27.010
 many window sellers the pursuit of profit 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.220
 don't even bother offering you 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.800
 something other than standard well and finally 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.560
 I want to say one company to you 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.280
 installs windows 2 will finish 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.790
 slopes 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.940
 3 in a year will be held in two years 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.750
 blame misting on windows or dampness 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.700
 the slope is not found we have been working for more than 8 years 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.770
