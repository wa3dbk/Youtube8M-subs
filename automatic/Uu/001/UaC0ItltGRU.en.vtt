whisk the egg whites first before I

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.249 
whisk the egg whites first before I
start<00:01:26.520> adding<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> sugar<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.110> need

to make sure your bowl is clean so it's

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.840 
to make sure your bowl is clean so it's
not<00:01:30.659> greasy<00:01:31.200> my<00:01:31.740> tip<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.100> heard<00:01:32.340> years<00:01:32.549> ago<00:01:32.759> is

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
not greasy my tip I heard years ago is

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.550 
not greasy my tip I heard years ago is
if<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.060> rub<00:01:33.270> half<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.659> lemon<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> inside<00:01:34.409> of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
if you rub half a lemon on the inside of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.050 
if you rub half a lemon on the inside of
the<00:01:34.650> bowl<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.009> removes<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.400> traces<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.790> grease

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the bowl it removes all traces of grease

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.969 
the bowl it removes all traces of grease
so<00:01:36.720> let's<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.290> some<00:01:37.439> air<00:01:37.650> into<00:01:37.829> this

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
so let's just get some air into this

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.990 
so let's just get some air into this
with<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.280> whisk

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.230 

you<00:01:41.630> do<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:41.870> by<00:01:42.080> hand<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:43.640> just<00:01:43.820> takes<00:01:44.000> a<00:01:44.120> lot

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
you do this by hand it just takes a lot

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.660 
you do this by hand it just takes a lot
longer

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.610 

as<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:48.300> wish<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> egg<00:01:48.720> whites<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.409> turn<00:01:49.680> white

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.270 

okay<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:35.990> I've<00:02:36.200> been<00:02:36.320> whisking<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:36.920> whisking

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
okay so I've been whisking and whisking

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.660 
okay so I've been whisking and whisking
whisking<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.880> think<00:02:38.060> or<00:02:38.240> phrase<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.600> all<00:02:38.720> sugar

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
whisking I think or phrase it all sugar

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.280 
whisking I think or phrase it all sugar
and<00:02:40.670> what<00:02:40.820> I'm<00:02:40.940> left<00:02:41.150> with<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.690> very<00:02:41.810> glossy

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
and what I'm left with is a very glossy

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.070 
and what I'm left with is a very glossy
mixture<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:44.150> actually<00:02:44.690> looks<00:02:44.840> like<00:02:44.960> the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
mixture so actually looks like the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.910 
mixture so actually looks like the
painting<00:02:45.440> all<00:02:45.560> out<00:02:47.500> which<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.650> strange

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
painting all out which is a strange

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.440 
painting all out which is a strange
comment<00:02:49.340> but<00:02:49.700> instead<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.150> being<00:02:50.180> that

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
comment but instead of it being that

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.480 
comment but instead of it being that
sort<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.690> really<00:02:51.050> white<00:02:51.440> as<00:02:51.680> snow<00:02:51.710> color

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
sort of really white as snow color

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.980 
sort of really white as snow color
because<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.120> got<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.330> brown<00:02:53.450> soft<00:02:53.840> brown

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
because it's got the brown soft brown

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.740 
because it's got the brown soft brown
sugar<00:02:54.020> in<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.560> it's<00:02:54.980> got<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.340> kind<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.910> off-white

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
sugar in it it's got a kind of off-white

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.900 
sugar in it it's got a kind of off-white
creamy<00:02:57.560> color<00:02:57.860> which<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:58.130> very<00:02:58.190> nice<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:58.820> the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
creamy color which is very nice and the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.880 
creamy color which is very nice and the
flavor<00:02:59.510> will<00:02:59.780> be<00:02:59.810> much<00:03:00.170> better<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.800> much

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
flavor will be much better and much

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.350 
flavor will be much better and much
richer<00:03:01.130> than<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.550> would<00:03:01.670> be<00:03:01.790> been<00:03:01.940> used<00:03:02.150> all

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
richer than it would be been used all

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.330 
richer than it would be been used all
castor<00:03:02.750> sugar<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:03.560> could<00:03:03.770> add<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:03.950> little<00:03:04.040> bit

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
castor sugar you could add a little bit

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.920 
castor sugar you could add a little bit
of<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.520> vanilla<00:03:04.730> extract<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:05.480> love<00:03:05.750> so

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
of the vanilla extract that I love so

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.270 
of the vanilla extract that I love so
much<00:03:06.050> into<00:03:06.410> this<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.830> would<00:03:06.980> give<00:03:07.160> them

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
much into this and it would give them

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.250 
much into this and it would give them
rings<00:03:07.520> a<00:03:07.640> little<00:03:07.730> bit<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.060> flavor<00:03:08.270> you<00:03:09.110> can

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
rings a little bit of flavor you can

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.660 
rings a little bit of flavor you can
pipe<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.590> meringues<00:03:10.100> into<00:03:10.460> little<00:03:10.760> nests<00:03:11.530> but

pipe the meringues into little nests but
the<00:03:13.670> consistency<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.540> this<00:03:14.810> is<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.650> bit

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
the consistency of this is a bit

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.680 
the consistency of this is a bit

reisi meringue should be light and

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.520 
reisi meringue should be light and
fluffy<00:04:01.700> and<00:04:01.910> airy<00:04:02.180> well<00:04:02.990> that's<00:04:03.140> kind<00:04:03.440> of

fluffy and airy well that's kind of

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.520 
fluffy and airy well that's kind of
runny<00:04:03.910> so<00:04:04.910> yes<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:05.390> do<00:04:05.450> have<00:04:05.660> kitchen<00:04:06.020> disasters

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
but they're not always disasters because

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.130 
but they're not always disasters because
what<00:04:07.940> could<00:04:08.210> come<00:04:08.510> out<00:04:08.570> of<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.750> oven<00:04:08.870> could<00:04:09.080> be

what could come out of the oven could be

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.900 
what could come out of the oven could be
absolutely<00:04:09.290> delicious<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:10.430> it's<00:04:10.610> just
