00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.259 
are you have a plus and a minus which
I'm<00:02:12.069> guessing<00:02:12.189> is<00:02:12.370> for<00:02:12.579> volume<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.090> then<00:02:13.180> you

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
I'm guessing is for volume and then you

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.690 
I'm guessing is for volume and then you
have<00:02:13.390> an<00:02:13.510> on/off<00:02:13.870> switch<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.530> then<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.519> have

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
have an on/off switch and then you have

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.429 
have an on/off switch and then you have
of<00:02:15.909> course<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.420> USB<00:02:17.409> cable<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:19.659> this

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
of course the USB cable so this this

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.979 
of course the USB cable so this this
looks<00:02:20.590> like<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.799> pretty<00:02:21.129> sick<00:02:21.430> product<00:02:21.909> I<00:02:22.420> will

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
looks like a pretty sick product I will

just check out this giveaway winners and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.509 
just check out this giveaway winners and
I<00:02:58.150> believe<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.540> does<00:02:58.780> move<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.560> yeah<00:03:00.130> it's

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
I believe this does move to yeah it's

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.830 
I believe this does move to yeah it's
called<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.819> pivot<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.299> I<00:03:01.330> kind<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.660> got<00:03:01.810> the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
called the pivot so I kind of got the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.690 
called the pivot so I kind of got the
instinct<00:03:02.769> that<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.010> moved<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.400> see<00:03:03.519> you<00:03:03.580> back

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
instinct that it moved you see you back

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.300 
instinct that it moved you see you back
here<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.000> can<00:03:04.120> actually<00:03:04.239> move<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.599> screen<00:03:05.310> so

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
here you can actually move the screen so

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.400 
here you can actually move the screen so
