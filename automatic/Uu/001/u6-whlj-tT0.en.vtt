00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:26.170
 street art is a branch that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.930
 It will be from graffiti 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.020
 simply that the vocabulary has 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:36.720
 expanded of a spray or a paint 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.720
 as such to different techniques 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.290
 the use of impressions stuck in 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.040
 walls the use of extensive and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.860
 templates and other tools 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.530
 spray brushes love processes 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.500
 industrial paint application 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.230
 indeterminate dried in combination 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.720
 acrylic with oil and more tools 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.720
 to create nuanced textures 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.910
 Clear 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.960
 already had the neighbor 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.939
 graphic and is a platform level 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.759
 juvenile in the sense that very many 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:46.340
 Young people use it as a bridge 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.380
 to communicate to influence 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.720
 participate in your colony your locality your 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.979
 neighborhood your street at any time 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.979
 legal or illegal way 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.400
 I 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.739
 Y 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.790
 architecture at the urban level is a 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.189
 very special platform for graffiti 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.310
 in architecture the same uses can 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:34.010
 go changing the same walls never 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.260
 you know how it ends how it starts 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.230
 someone arrived and also intervened there 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.230
 it's always like an endless gesture 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.100
 and everything was also open apart 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.690
 I would say that there we draw that line 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.150
 already springs are made and the body 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.870
 if the whole city was thought by a 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.909
 architect would also be another talk not 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.260
 there would be more nuances but we are in the 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.920
 Talking city and the city of Mexico 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.420
 where 90% of self-construction is not 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.420
 architectural intention 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.510
 the judge is felt the city already charges its 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.819
 own dimension 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.700
 and so it is that as each city has its 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.349
 dimension has its speculation where 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.349
 paint where not where to affect 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.409
 commented 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.710
 there is a perceptive field very rich in that 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.780
 to really understand 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.780
 a living city system 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.520
 yes 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.500
 the city is there slowly is there 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.500
 and whoever wants it takes it
