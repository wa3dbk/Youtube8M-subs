every<00:02:51.320> time<00:02:51.710> ago<00:02:52.010> or<00:02:52.340> they<00:02:52.520> come<00:02:52.790> from<00:02:53.030> lowered

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
every time ago or they come from lowered

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.750 
every time ago or they come from lowered
down<00:02:54.200> there<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.590> that's<00:02:55.190> time<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.550> may<00:02:55.700> be

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
down there and that's time it may be

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:04.420 
down there and that's time it may be
good<00:02:57.040> 814<00:03:02.500> could<00:03:03.500> be<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:03.830> don't<00:03:04.040> think<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:04.370> a

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
good 814 could be I don't think it's a

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.330 
good 814 could be I don't think it's a
satellite

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.910 

why<00:03:13.340> would<00:03:13.519> they<00:03:13.610> send<00:03:13.849> out<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.530> see<00:03:15.830> how

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
why would they send out but it see how
