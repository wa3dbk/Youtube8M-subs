00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.649 

hi<00:00:01.439> there<00:00:01.650> quick<00:00:02.040> video<00:00:02.340> on<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:02.700> lot<00:00:03.240> wave<00:00:03.419> 10

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
hi there quick video on a lot wave 10

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.530 
hi there quick video on a lot wave 10
vpr<00:00:04.549> so<00:00:05.549> let's<00:00:05.759> look<00:00:05.940> at<00:00:06.060> some<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.359> things

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
vpr so let's look at some of the things

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.580 
vpr so let's look at some of the things
we<00:00:06.720> can<00:00:06.839> do<00:00:06.990> quickly<00:00:07.910> go<00:00:08.910> over<00:00:08.940> into<00:00:09.690> windows

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
we can do quickly go over into windows

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.140 
we can do quickly go over into windows
volumetric<00:00:11.580> some<00:00:11.910> fog<00:00:12.240> we<00:00:13.049> can<00:00:13.200> turn<00:00:13.610> a<00:00:14.610> folder

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
volumetric some fog we can turn a folder

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.140 
volumetric some fog we can turn a folder
on<00:00:15.289> we<00:00:16.289> can<00:00:16.440> see<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.949> fog<00:00:17.609> does<00:00:17.820> indeed<00:00:18.119> work

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
on we can see that fog does indeed work

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.990 
on we can see that fog does indeed work
so<00:00:18.869> we<00:00:19.199> get<00:00:19.410> fog<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.070> viewport<00:00:20.340> that's<00:00:20.820> all

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
so we get fog in the viewport that's all

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.109 
so we get fog in the viewport that's all
great<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.020> groovy<00:00:23.420> also<00:00:24.420> if<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.439> go<00:00:25.740> over<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:26.250> my

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
great and groovy also if I go over to my

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.140 
great and groovy also if I go over to my
surface<00:00:27.660> editor<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.470> select<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.490> character

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
surface editor I select this character

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.479 
surface editor I select this character
here<00:00:30.359> if<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.529> basics<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.279> go

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
here if I going to basics and then go

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.530 
here if I going to basics and then go
into<00:00:32.640> edit<00:00:33.120> nodes<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.950> go<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.420> and<00:00:36.420> it

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
into edit nodes and if I go to and it

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.750 
into edit nodes and if I go to and it
knows<00:00:36.690> which<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.320> you've<00:00:38.250> been<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> bit<00:00:38.670> of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
knows which is here you've been a bit of

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.810 
knows which is here you've been a bit of
do<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.629> see<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.140> connect<00:00:40.820> you

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
do you can see that I can connect you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.459 
do you can see that I can connect you
can't<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.360> what<00:00:42.540> you'll<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:42.840> me<00:00:43.020> connecting

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
can't see what you'll see me connecting

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.610 
can't see what you'll see me connecting
it<00:00:43.620> connected<00:00:44.340> by<00:00:44.840> car<00:00:45.840> paint<00:00:46.079> shader<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
it connected by car paint shader and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.170 
it connected by car paint shader and
that<00:00:47.520> does<00:00:48.390> work<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.640> not<00:00:50.640> sure<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
that does work so not sure if all the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.319 
that does work so not sure if all the
nodes<00:00:51.420> are<00:00:51.629> working<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:53.149> node<00:00:54.149> is

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
nodes are working but a node is

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.650 
nodes are working but a node is
definitely<00:00:54.809> working<00:00:56.030> or<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.180> go<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.480> just

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
definitely working or can go and just

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.779 
definitely working or can go and just
connect<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.320> let's<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.280> over<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.640> out

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
connect that one let's go over here out

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.660 
connect that one let's go over here out
the<00:00:59.910> way<00:01:00.289> disconnect<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.710> go<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the way disconnect that and go and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.070 
the way disconnect that and go and
connect<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:04.280> delta<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:06.240> grab<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.570> nice

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
connect up a delta can grab it nice

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.940 
connect up a delta can grab it nice
there<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.920> go<00:01:08.040> try<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:09.140> yeah<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.770> also

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
there you go try that yeah so that also

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.210 
there you go try that yeah so that also
works<00:01:12.080> all<00:01:13.080> auctions<00:01:13.350> I've<00:01:13.710> got<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> beard<00:01:14.159> now

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
working if I'll go to my surface editor

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.270 
working if I'll go to my surface editor
and<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.570> disabled<00:01:25.470> node<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.979> we're<00:01:26.100> getting

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and I disabled node so we're getting

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.580 
and I disabled node so we're getting
back<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> where<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.790> were<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.909> minute<00:01:27.119> ago<00:01:27.590> okay

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
back to where we were a minute ago okay

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.010 
back to where we were a minute ago okay
go<00:01:28.799> over<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.070> shaders<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.299> go<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> shade<00:01:30.810> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
go over to shaders so go to shade is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.469 
go over to shaders so go to shade is
here<00:01:31.290> find<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:32.040> my<00:01:32.159> legacy<00:01:32.700> cell<00:01:32.970> shader<00:01:33.299> and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
here find get my legacy cell shader and

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.370 
here find get my legacy cell shader and
put<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:35.000> that's<00:01:36.000> okay<00:01:36.390> I've<00:01:37.049> got<00:01:37.200> myself

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
put that on that's okay I've got myself

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.130 
put that on that's okay I've got myself
shading<00:01:38.009> working<00:01:38.369> here<00:01:38.600> yeah<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.659> i'll<00:01:39.810> fix<00:01:40.049> it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
shading working here yeah if i'll fix it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.810 
shading working here yeah if i'll fix it
off<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.560> tell<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> difference<00:01:40.979> did<00:01:41.790> it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
off you can tell the difference did it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.670 
off you can tell the difference did it
without<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.500> with<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.009> okay<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:44.790> i<00:01:44.939> can<00:01:45.090> see

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
without it and with it okay so i can see

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.770 
without it and with it okay so i can see
legacy<00:01:46.680> cell<00:01:46.920> shader<00:01:47.250> working<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.060> vpr<00:01:48.540> that's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
legacy cell shader working in vpr that's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.080 
legacy cell shader working in vpr that's
great<00:01:49.220> if<00:01:50.220> i<00:01:50.790> do<00:01:51.240> choose<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:52.159> shader<00:01:53.159> such<00:01:53.850> as

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
great if i do choose a shader such as

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.819 
great if i do choose a shader such as
bes<00:01:54.960> em<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.950> will<00:01:56.960> kill<00:01:57.960> light<00:01:58.290> wave<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
bes em that will kill light wave that

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.359 
bes em that will kill light wave that
will<00:01:58.920> knock<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.280> over<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:00.990> aware<00:02:01.020> that

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
will knock it over so just be aware that

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.130 
will knock it over so just be aware that
bsm<00:02:02.369> doesn't<00:02:02.729> currently<00:02:02.969> work<00:02:03.149> imagine<00:02:04.079> all

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
bsm doesn't currently work imagine all

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.320 
bsm doesn't currently work imagine all
sort<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.500> out

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
sort that out

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.300 
sort that out
I've<00:02:06.540> got<00:02:06.840> loads<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.200> self<00:02:07.410> show<00:02:07.560> desire<00:02:07.920> heart

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
I've got loads of self show desire heart

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.350 
I've got loads of self show desire heart
something<00:02:09.740> yep<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.979> other<00:02:11.130> thing<00:02:11.370> Lewis

something yep the other thing Lewis

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.570 
something yep the other thing Lewis
pointed<00:02:12.780> out<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:14.370> get<00:02:15.860> opengl<00:02:16.860> wireframe<00:02:17.430> to

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
pointed out to get opengl wireframe to

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.730

wireframe to show up and it has a few
issues<00:02:36.900> currently<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:38.010> looks<00:02:38.040> ok<00:02:38.520> for<00:02:38.670> going

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
issues currently it looks ok for going

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.810 
issues currently it looks ok for going
to<00:02:38.880> select<00:02:38.970> something<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.700> like<00:02:41.790> a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
to select something like so it's like a

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.540 
to select something like so it's like a
box<00:02:42.090> that's<00:02:42.420> fine<00:02:42.810> subdivided<00:02:43.560> box<00:02:43.800> they<00:02:44.400> all

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
box that's fine subdivided box they all

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.280 
box that's fine subdivided box they all
seem<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.790> be<00:02:45.030> drawing<00:02:45.750> out<00:02:45.959> okay<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
seem to be drawing out okay in the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.470 
seem to be drawing out okay in the
viewport<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.070> ground<00:02:47.520> plane<00:02:47.760> seems<00:02:48.030> okay

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
viewport and the ground plane seems okay

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.040 
viewport and the ground plane seems okay
but<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.560> particular<00:02:49.830> character<00:02:50.810> not<00:02:51.810> quite

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
but this particular character not quite

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.449 
but this particular character not quite
working<00:02:52.230> for<00:02:52.560> some<00:02:52.680> reason<00:02:52.709> then<00:02:53.280> what's

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
working for some reason then what's

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.760 
working for some reason then what's
going<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.790> with<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.000> sort<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.600> drawers<00:02:55.200> and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
going on with that sort of drawers and

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.830 
going on with that sort of drawers and
then<00:02:55.920> doesn't<00:02:56.310> draw<00:02:56.580> any<00:02:56.910> polygons<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.690> are

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
then doesn't draw any polygons that are

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.350 
then doesn't draw any polygons that are
actually<00:02:57.959> facing<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:59.030> facing<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.060> camera

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
actually facing you facing the camera

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.900 
actually facing you facing the camera
seems<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.959> be<00:03:01.050> like<00:03:01.200> not<00:03:01.500> happy<00:03:01.740> about<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.310> so

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
seems to be like not happy about that so

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.290 
seems to be like not happy about that so
yeah<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.570> sort<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:03.930> works<00:03:04.140> at<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.380> moment<00:03:05.300> if

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
yeah it sort of works at the moment if

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.440 
yeah it sort of works at the moment if
you<00:03:06.450> go<00:03:06.570> opengl<00:03:07.290> overlay<00:03:07.740> then<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:09.300> actually

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
you go opengl overlay then you actually

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.690 
you go opengl overlay then you actually
get<00:03:09.840> your<00:03:10.020> manipulators<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.130> viewport<00:03:11.340> as

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
get your manipulators in the viewport as

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.420 
get your manipulators in the viewport as
well<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.450> i<00:03:12.510> can<00:03:12.720> rotate<00:03:13.500> boxes<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.400> things

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
well so i can rotate boxes and things

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.610 
well so i can rotate boxes and things
like<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:15.660> let<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.989> update<00:03:16.350> i'll

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
like that and let that update i'll

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.610 
like that and let that update i'll
really<00:03:16.830> not<00:03:17.160> be<00:03:17.340> happy<00:03:17.580> about<00:03:17.610> doing<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.120> and

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
really not be happy about doing that and

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.620 
really not be happy about doing that and
rotate<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.739> over<00:03:20.010> there<00:03:20.180> then<00:03:21.180> i<00:03:21.209> can<00:03:21.390> go<00:03:21.420> and

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
rotate that over there then i can go and

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.880 
rotate that over there then i can go and
move<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:22.050> so<00:03:22.890> yeah<00:03:23.190> basically<00:03:24.590> unlike<00:03:25.590> some<00:03:25.769> of

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
move it so yeah basically unlike some of

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.000 
move it so yeah basically unlike some of
a<00:03:25.920> preview<00:03:26.400> renderers<00:03:26.910> where<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.239> have<00:03:27.360> a

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
a preview renderers where you have a

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.220 
a preview renderers where you have a
separate<00:03:29.010> window<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:30.239> have<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.480> move

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
separate window and you have to move

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.340 
separate window and you have to move
things<00:03:31.530> around<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.640> normal<00:03:33.330> 3d<00:03:33.870> viewport

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
things around in a normal 3d viewport

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.920 
things around in a normal 3d viewport
and<00:03:34.620> then<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.160> see<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.640> update<00:03:36.060> in<00:03:36.360> your

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
and then you see the update in your

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.350 
and then you see the update in your
preview<00:03:37.500> rendered<00:03:38.070> view<00:03:38.340> port<00:03:38.640> which<00:03:39.090> is<00:03:39.239> like

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
preview rendered view port which is like

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.610 
preview rendered view port which is like
a<00:03:39.390> separate<00:03:39.780> window<00:03:39.930> usually<00:03:41.780> well<00:03:42.780> vpr<00:03:43.350> you

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
a separate window usually well vpr you

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.900 
a separate window usually well vpr you
know<00:03:43.709> is<00:03:43.920> your<00:03:44.400> view<00:03:44.610> poor<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:46.670> quite<00:03:47.670> good

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
know is your view poor so quite good

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.030 
know is your view poor so quite good
luck<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.050> there<00:03:49.200> are<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.320> couple<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.620> drawing

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
luck so there are a couple of drawing

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.340 
luck so there are a couple of drawing
issues<00:03:50.340> at<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.489> moment<00:03:50.660> on<00:03:51.660> various<00:03:52.110> things

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
issues at the moment on various things

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.870 
issues at the moment on various things
but<00:03:53.100> no<00:03:53.390> major<00:03:54.470> showstoppers<00:03:55.470> I'd<00:03:55.620> say<00:03:55.890> no<00:03:56.550> big

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
but no major showstoppers I'd say no big

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.229 
but no major showstoppers I'd say no big
deal<00:03:57.560> really<00:03:58.820> because<00:03:59.820> when<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.060> select

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
deal really because when you select

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.509 
deal really because when you select

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
something I mean it's you know it's fine

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
you can see what you're selecting here

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.600 
you can see what you're selecting here
can't<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:04.410> so<00:04:04.920> it's<00:04:05.190> not<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.370> big<00:04:05.549> deal<00:04:06.470> and
