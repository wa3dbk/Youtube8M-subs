00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.310
 Jesus to 1 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.320
 today we have 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.770
 let's take a little look 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.710
 separately while the apothecary pump is just 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.250
 do a little review not cooler you 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.450
 now hands the first thing that rushes in 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.759
 Of course the eye 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.080
 really happy for but by comparison 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:35.820
 will I understand that here we have 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:41.350
 the foot here is this sticks out a lot less 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:46.000
 than hands corr and that is, she sits with us 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.309
 deeper inward and besides 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.690
 really dangles the nest if you can 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:01:01.920
 notice if you can see that she somehow 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.920
 not firmly fixed that dangles 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.570
 we find yes but she dangles her 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.600
 nest well and here these 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:19.240
 a huge number of gaskets from 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:23.150
 plastics that is absolutely incomprehensible with 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.650
 For what purpose is generally applied 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.310
 number of gaskets although it was possible 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.620
 apply let's say from there just of course 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.930
 all this is a little alarming to him 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.930
 see what's inside 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:46.820
 he sorted out spun on 6 bolts that 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.420
 we are inside a cage for that is 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.590
 us one valve here at least not 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.590
 seen here is a snap ring 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:09.619
 I have not yet figured out as possible 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:15.580
 to apply them so that means at the membrane 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.580
 us around double 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:33.770
 given I did here because it makes 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:40.480
 gasket it is spring loaded maybe 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.480
 principle here is just twisted to twist 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.040
 proper boundary nothing 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.610
 needed is also taken as 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:03.580
 baker that is we turn 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:10.730
 we turn and take out which can 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:16.010
 put inside and so now try 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:19.580
 understand here as many as three I thought at first 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.680
 something about the buttons gives the impression 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.680
 that itâ€™s just three combined 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.680
 membrane 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.819
 between them some more ring 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:45.200
 so according to the design inside principle everything 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.530
 the same as picard pump particular 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:56.680
 principle, there is no difference 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:56.680
 just check this pump work 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.300
 on top you can decorate this here mug 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:16.790
 head 10 it is removed inside 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:25.310
 us 4 filter 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:27.770
 located can be taken out and accordingly 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:33.610
 you can probably clean it very much 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.610
 necessities here at the top here at the top 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.270
 there is a second valve 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:49.460
 1 is now 2 but surely 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:55.750
 the design is quite reliable and how 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.750
 in fact she can time
