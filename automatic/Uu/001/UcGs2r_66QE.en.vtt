and your strengths are the warp in
weaving<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.740> know<00:01:53.830> when<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.010> string<00:01:54.369> up<00:01:54.520> your

when<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.400> get<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> commission<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.569> first<00:02:49.840> thing

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
when I get a commission the first thing

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.080 
when I get a commission the first thing
I<00:02:50.110> do<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.290> meditate<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.579> meditate<00:02:52.060> for

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
I do is meditate and I meditate for

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.830 
I do is meditate and I meditate for
ideas<00:02:52.690> on<00:02:52.930> color<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.220> design<00:02:54.579> and<00:02:55.180> symbols

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
ideas on color and design and symbols

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.110 
ideas on color and design and symbols
and<00:02:55.989> textures<00:02:56.470> because<00:02:57.280> most<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.700> my<00:02:57.790> work<00:02:57.970> is

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
and textures because most of my work is

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.729 
and textures because most of my work is
done<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.420> fiber<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:59.170> are<00:02:59.290> going<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.500> be

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
done in fiber that are going to be

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.780 
done in fiber that are going to be
specifically<00:03:00.519> healing<00:03:01.030> for<00:03:01.329> the<00:03:01.420> client<00:03:01.840> and

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
specifically healing for the client and

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.600 
specifically healing for the client and
then<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:04.060> also<00:03:04.329> use<00:03:04.780> meditation<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.799> intuition

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
then I also use meditation and intuition

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.539 
then I also use meditation and intuition
for<00:03:07.090> intuitive<00:03:07.510> shopping<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.620> can<00:03:08.950> find

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
for intuitive shopping so I can find

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.330 
for intuitive shopping so I can find
exactly<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.390> right<00:03:10.840> fabric<00:03:11.140> or<00:03:11.590> right<00:03:12.069> beads

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
exactly the right fabric or right beads

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.640 
exactly the right fabric or right beads
that<00:03:12.489> I<00:03:12.640> need<00:03:12.910> for<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.360> specific<00:03:13.780> piece<00:03:14.319> and

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
that I need for a specific piece and

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.640 
that I need for a specific piece and
also<00:03:15.579> I<00:03:15.819> always<00:03:16.450> try<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.690> use<00:03:16.900> new<00:03:17.140> techniques

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
also I always try to use new techniques

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.530 
also I always try to use new techniques
and<00:03:17.920> new<00:03:18.010> products<00:03:18.579> in<00:03:18.760> my<00:03:18.970> work<00:03:19.120> because<00:03:19.420> it

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
and new products in my work because it

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.050 
and new products in my work because it
keeps<00:03:19.660> me<00:03:19.900> excited<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.560> when<00:03:21.160> I'm<00:03:21.489> excited

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
keeps me excited and when I'm excited

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.150 
keeps me excited and when I'm excited
then<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.420> creative<00:03:22.870> flow<00:03:23.079> is<00:03:23.350> really<00:03:23.980> flowing

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
then the creative flow is really flowing

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.430 
then the creative flow is really flowing

us secondly it helps us to apply
creative<00:04:55.259> problem-solving<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:56.460> know<00:04:56.580> when

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
creative problem-solving you know when

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.870 
creative problem-solving you know when
we<00:04:57.360> get<00:04:57.930> into<00:04:58.110> stuck<00:04:58.500> places<00:04:58.979> and<00:04:59.159> habitual

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
we get into stuck places and habitual

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.330 
we get into stuck places and habitual
thought<00:05:00.030> processes<00:05:00.690> it's<00:05:01.169> more<00:05:01.500> difficult<00:05:01.710> to

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
thought processes it's more difficult to

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.820 
thought processes it's more difficult to
come<00:05:02.940> up<00:05:02.970> with<00:05:03.090> new<00:05:03.240> ideas<00:05:03.659> for<00:05:04.199> old<00:05:04.349> problems

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
come up with new ideas for old problems

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.939 
come up with new ideas for old problems
so<00:05:05.479> creativity<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:06.599> intuition<00:05:07.139> help<00:05:07.620> us<00:05:07.800> move

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
so creativity and intuition help us move

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.980 
so creativity and intuition help us move
into<00:05:08.220> new<00:05:08.370> paradigms<00:05:08.970> of<00:05:09.150> creative<00:05:09.599> problem

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
into new paradigms of creative problem

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.100 
into new paradigms of creative problem
solving<00:05:10.729> thirdly<00:05:11.729> we<00:05:12.330> give<00:05:12.509> up<00:05:12.690> victim

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
solving thirdly we give up victim

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.559 
solving thirdly we give up victim
consciousness<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:14.099> more<00:05:14.430> we<00:05:14.669> begin<00:05:15.090> to

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
feeling of powerlessness unless we use

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.439 
feeling of powerlessness unless we use
creativity<00:05:29.039> and<00:05:29.400> intuition<00:05:29.909> to<00:05:30.000> inspire
