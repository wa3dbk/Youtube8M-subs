00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.330
 the pinhole camera like some 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.510
 you will know is consists of a small 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.090
 hole instead of having a lens it 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.910
 makes a small hole in a sheet 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.830
 some can and by laws of physics comes 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.859
 in the image through this little 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.009
 hole burns the negative and is formed in 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.309
 a backup can be a negative or a 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.309
 paper 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.300
 ah 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.060
 the east is not very simple 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.690
 you can grab 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:04.449
 a can of soda any and 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:07.830
 cut a small piece of the minita 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.210
 and with a pin 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.510
 on some surface in the center of 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.820
 the blade is drilling the hole has 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.820
 that be a very very small ojito 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.710
 that does not pass the pin 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.229
 then they can make a camera 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.350
 pinhole from a box of matches 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.869
 a pot of oatmeal until they want their 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.210
 own room or of a department can 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.549
 be anything that is a box 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.689
 dark you can also ride it in a 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:46.509
 digital camera there are many people who do 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.079
 pinhole through logo with cameras 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.079
 digital also 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.030
 Y 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.450
 Exposure times change 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:03.100
 very much when the east is not close 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.140
 of negative or remote then all 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.160
 those calculations one has to do them 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.929
 to determine your exposure how much 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.370
 time you leave uncovered because when 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.370
 you take a picture you do this 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.700
 once you have a camera 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.660
 pinhole and you get a negative you go 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.230
 to your dark room with your employer 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.690
 and it makes its printing on paper 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.050
 the thing with the negative is that where there 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.890
 light 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.500
 it is transparent and where it is dark 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.930
 negative is dense this does not let the 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.270
 light so that when it is projected onto your 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.570
 paper is made on it 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.860
 the reverse process where it is transparent 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.990
 a lot of light passes and where is this opaque not 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.850
 So much light passes but you have to be a 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.130
 camera thinking about what you're going and what are you going 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.760
 use for negative or for paper if it 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.430
 you use for paper 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.480
 you have to charge your camera to go is the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.700
 dark room 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.209
 there you load it in a dark room salts 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.459
 you make your take to download the camera or 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.579
 you go back to the dark room you have a 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.940
 black bag there put your hands to 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.459
 Download your camera keep your paper or 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.440
 your negative in a box the light test 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.440
 and reload your camera
