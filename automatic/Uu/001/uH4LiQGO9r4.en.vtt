and I think that's the way women played
it<00:05:38.960> but<00:05:39.110> you<00:05:39.290> can<00:05:39.470> also<00:05:39.650> play<00:05:40.070> it<00:05:40.100> down<00:05:40.370> here

00:05:47.650 --> 00:06:05.230 
okay now that Court is just played by
pulling<00:05:48.009> the<00:05:48.129> bellows<00:05:48.490> out<00:05:48.759> this<00:05:49.690> butt

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.080 

so<00:06:06.240> maybe<00:06:06.480> like<00:06:06.720> this<00:06:10.070> so<00:06:11.070> you<00:06:11.130> actually<00:06:11.700> have
