00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.249
 is the year 2007 I have been using the 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.320
 internet but so far I've only seen 

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:09.340
 cartoons that I like or things of the 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.040
 current television 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.169
 instead of discovering new things I think 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.390
 it's time to watch subtitled anime 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.550
 because I like series like 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.650
 dragon ball and run my medium and since the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.040
 Otaku fever is at its best these days 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.390
 maybe I should start watching more anime 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.260
 I'll start with an anime of the season 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.150
 current to see this day that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.020
 fortunately it's on youtube so 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.020
 lets go see it 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.760
 that's why I did not understand it in lesbians 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.210
 a 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.500
 the teacher is a rapist or so yes 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.500
 is happening 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.640
 ok with an opening like that and I can only 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.070
 wait for it to be unanimous full of 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.320
 euphoria with super violence and acts 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.000
 that border on pornography and 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.000
 problematic super turbid 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.250
 and connie mack 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:52.490
 and it had a more interesting style not 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.619
 is what I thought it would be in fact in 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.920
 that sense the series seems to be very 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.560
 harmless the characters just talk and 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.320
 they speak the truth I do not know what that 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.000
 opening so weird and the humor I do not know 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.520
 sometimes just I do not understand 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.890
 joke good but the experience either 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.500
 it was bad let's leave it here and better 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.210
 I'll see Naruto that anime looks like 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.980
 what is great 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:21.110
 it's the year 2010 I resumed the series in 2009 to 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.630
 this step I have already finished the seasons 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.060
 later I've seen a lot of 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.730
 animes and my criteria has changed 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.800
 quite in fact it is not until now that 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.230
 I can appreciate many things for example 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.120
 I had to know a little more about the 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.820
 Japanese culture to understand that the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.760
 characters are Japanese stereotypes 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.860
 negative embodied which now in 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.960
 hindsight I can understand what the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.570
 grace to be these super stereotypes 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.140
 exaggerated and taken to the extreme the 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.550
 series is a kind of discrete harem 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.960
 conformed by the sensei and his students 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.600
 that seem taken from a clinic 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.580
 psychiatric which contrasts quite 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.040
 with most harem comedies that 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.930
 exist where girls without good are 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.910
 stereotypes are stereotypes with 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.670
 flat and boring personalities to 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.470
 be idealized archetypes that 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.060
 and rather seem to function the 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.440
 fulfill a sexual fantasy of 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.330
 spectator who fulfill a function 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.900
 comical sayonara is the antithesis of 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.060
 the girls are not entirely nice from 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.310
 done the sensei does not want nor can 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.530
 correspond to some because it 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.020
 would get into trouble with school and 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.120
 They are also unhealthy girls that 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.670
 tell and make your life crazy 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.620
 would be the equivalent to correspond to 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.020
 a girl with the obsession to fit in 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.360
 forks in the skin or something like that which 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.130
 it's pretty shabby and it gives the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.950
 series the status draw in little 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.080
 conventional second is it true that this 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.820
 it's a kind of pretty archaic humor and 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.740
 that does not capture the sense of humor of 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.360
 many people but the games of 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.160
 words that they do in the series are very 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.870
 ingenious and they are very much in line with the 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.959
 third situation 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.970
 the black humor is in every detail is 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.130
 a series that has enough class to the 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.230
 time to make cruel humor is taken very 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.540
 the lightly themes such as suicide and 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.190
 mental problems but it never seems that 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.440
 the series wants to win a status of 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.620
 rebellion or who wants to make controversy 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.470
 post to attract attention finally 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.870
 it's something that in hindsight I appreciate 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.840
 and one more but still there's no finishing 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.420
 understand the artistic direction the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.490
 designs though simpletons have true 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.650
 charm and an original stroke that 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.270
 docks very well to these techniques with 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.150
 papier-mâché used by the director 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.400
 constantly sincerely I do not know if there 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.890
 a symbolism in those random elements 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.200
 that they put in a 2 by 3 or that comes the 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.480
 super casual drama but they give it 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.220
 a pretty cool environment to the series and 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.830
 do not feel out of place in a 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.100
 series of with black humor my verdict 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.080
 Finally, it is a series that costs 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.420
 little appreciate it and that simply does not 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.450
 everyone will like it because of its essence 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.280
 experimental without mentioning that it is not a 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.140
 series that you can see from corridos without 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.360
 get tired because the humor is so 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.520
 exaggeratedly exaggerated that ends up 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.860
 become heavy follow the marathon 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.110
 mind without mentioning that there is no 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.530
 final goal that the viewer wants 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.580
 reach I would give it an 8.5 out of 10 though 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.460
 for its bright it is subtle 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.400
 and knowledge came into conflict and I do not know 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.650
 although it deserves a 9 closed and and something 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.289
 that I missed adding the soundtrack is 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.199
 bestial is very good and these super 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.379
 installed have to be between my 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.240
 favorites of all times is the year 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:37.280
 2013 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.439
 the manga will have breakfast sets there was absence and 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.090
 ended last year I heard that 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.800
 he no longer intends to continue 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.020
 adapting the series so 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.300
 unfortunately I would only read the 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.310
 manga to know what the ending is though 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.800
 I honestly do not expect much after 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.259
 of all this is just a school comedy 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.930
 and I doubt that it happens that you take me out 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:59.560
 how many laughs or what an occurrence 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.560
 nice 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:13.910
 that was look is that good or 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:18.250
 it certainly was not what I expected is 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:21.910
 saying it was like that sad very sad 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:24.260
 but in turn it had a very comical tone and 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.560
 look honestly I feel very 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.210
 confused about what happened in my head 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.340
 has not finished processing what has 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.030
 happened and the worst of all is that it is a 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.550
 twist of nut like this 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:40.249
 even though he could not see himself coming, he was not 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:43.729
 misplaced in a work with cruel humor 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:46.609
 or in a way it was also something 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.409
 touching but now that I get to 

00:06:46.609 --> 00:06:50.569
 think about this that is not wrong 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:52.969
 placed I think about many 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:56.670
 things about the series in general 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:07:00.880
 a moment the opening 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:04.960
 wait a moment that means that or 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.790
 my god, the opening can not be your 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.420
 may be my homeland all this 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.310
 time men if they make sense and 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.690
 his artistic direction so rare there 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.690
 I was alone because 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:24.980
 this bright I will not believe your numbers 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.960
 but also there are comic turn 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.440
 It's a great love story with your 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:34.040
 twisted and the girls are twisted 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:36.620
 the first twisted is perfect 

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.850
 I was so confused and without Christians 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.990
 how to find the level of who 

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.990
 reality at the story level 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:48.210
 Lord to sex in shame is a comedy 

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:52.069
 unconventional very subtle very well 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.069
 planned and very smart 

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:55.839
 he deserves 9 and abuse
