00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hello, friends, I'm copper fix and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.940
 this video we are going to install a recovery 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.960
 modified in our the g 2 axis in this 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.780
 case is a model of 802 but it is valid 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.289
 for more models than I know the 800 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.539
 also if you have another model, it would be 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.670
 question of proving it or entering in x of a 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.890
 in the link that you left below that is where 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.000
 I've got it and you're looking for information 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.000
 from your terminal 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.250
 specifically I have prepared this package of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.460
 here that I will put the link also in the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.190
 description of the video and what downloads and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.840
 unzip it 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.320
 with the compressor program that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.320
 have 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.320
 and he gives us this folder that has two 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.530
 steps to do this procedure is 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.810
 It is highly recommended that you have root 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.390
 done on the phone for it you can 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.740
 enter the link that I put here to the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.560
 left 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.440
 or in the description of the video includes you 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.840
 also the drivers themselves 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.110
 recognizes the device installs them and is 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.170
 an executable and will already recognize it in the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.720
 second step 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.960
 is a bat-type executable for 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.060
 windows what we have to do is 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.369
 connect the phone in a special mode 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.420
 it's called debug usb for it 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:28.530
 let's go to the terminal we're going to adjustments 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.050
 about of the phone 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.790
 software information and where it puts 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.450
 compilation number we press 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.789
 many times 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.440
 until he says that we are now a 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.070
 developer 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.480
 we go back again backwards and 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.480
 we go into advanced options 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.720
 and here where it puts debug usb 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.360
 we mark the stick 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.960
 and with that we already have the debug usb 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.210
 activated now we introduce the usb and we 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.300
 will recognize the device this is a 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.400
 process that may take more or less 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.920
 depending on our windows if we 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.760
 wonder how we want to connect 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.470
 We can tell you software lg or just 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.740
 load or whatever we want is a bit 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.110
 indifferent now on the computer 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.110
 we double click on recovery map 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.590
 and that screen appears we press a 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.590
 key to continue 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.760
 and this will appear on the device 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.290
 we put the stick in always allow 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.930
 from this computer and we give to 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.659
 to accept 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.650
 now he asks us what model of 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:50.980
 determine we have option 1 is att and 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.780
 the 2 is international because in my case 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.780
 it would be the 2 pulse intro 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.930
 and as you see it does its operations and 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.660
 question that if we want to start in the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.030
 recovery is now over and I'm 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.420
 my case for example I say that if 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.650
 I write one and one e and pulse intro and the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.180
 terminal will restart in recovery mode 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.820
 enter into recovery mode in this terminal 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.540
 it's a little different from the rest of 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.980
 terminals you can enter to access it 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.410
 using the following video 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.160
 that I put to the left 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.460
 or with some program of type quick but 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.320
 we run manager or some kind of program 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.600
 root that allows access in mode 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.110
 recovery and good here we have it this is 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.600
 the team win recovery project version 6.3 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.810
 point 4 many people ask what is 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.790
 better the team win recovery project or the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.040
 club by mod 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.700
 in my case I like the team wing more 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.410
 recovery project because in white 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.950
 is the option to make a white but 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.380
 without erasing the internal memory thing that 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.210
 I have not managed to find in clockwork mod 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.170
 if anyone knows how to do it please 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:13.590
 let me say it and set aside when we make a 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:16.160
 backup of the entire complete system what 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.330
 does within the memory sd 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.359
 accessible from a computer when 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.570
 we connect the usb in clockwork mode it 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.220
 saves inside system folders and 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.380
 Well I hope you find it useful 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.400
 we see ourselves actually before a point is 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.400
 a greeting friends
