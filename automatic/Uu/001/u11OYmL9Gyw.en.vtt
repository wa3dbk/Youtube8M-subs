00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.070
 two languages ​​in Spanish and English for 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.080
 that they can enjoy today 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.810
 It is preparing a delicious bread 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.609
 proteins here in front of me I have everything 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.990
 more or less what is necessary on the day of 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.599
 today to prepare this mixture 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.020
 we will need not go to the little 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.780
 we're going to need cinnamon 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.750
 we are going to need a package 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.770
 is full is lukewarm of the substitute of 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 favorite sugar of yours 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.520
 a quarter cup of milk 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.190
 preferably one skim 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.660
 fats or almond milk actually 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.430
 we use this time is for the mixture 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.900
 it's a little softer 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.260
 it does not have to be much quantity can 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.100
 be like that less or do not want 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.100
 good 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.960
 we are going to need three eggs of these 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.940
 let's use all the whites and the other 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.640
 eggs and we will use the yolk in addition 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.720
 of the clear in hiring and knowing 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.720
 this mind while these 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:47.969
 they're going to add cinnamon we're going to add the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.969
 that I love your own taste 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.490
 add the banana 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.340
 the juice option that is again the one 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.550
 We carry on explaining to the houses well 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.170
 delgaditas I like that you have the park 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.250
 and have a bit of text 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.720
 instead of doing so they could also 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.610
 mash the banana like a mash 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.470
 and use it I like that bread 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.550
 that has textures and that's why I like it 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.550
 apply the practices 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.200
 like this 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.320
 from the dust 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.220
 this town that I am using from 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.770
 protein has 25 grams 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.270
 on top of your 25 grams that having what 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.770
 we are adding the protein that has 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.020
 the game we have it actually as 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.430
 about 37 grams of protein in total in 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.700
 this ranking 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.090
 We'll see it from 30 to 35 for the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.090
 banana 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.909
 this is the taste of vanilla 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.040
 I prefer vanilla because more or less 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.680
 berna is left with a lot more for 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.700
 can add the things that are in 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.280
 this case the good 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.989
 if you did not want to use from there you can 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.440
 use because many people use 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.910
 this chocolate in the flavor to but this 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.590
 option your preference 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.590
 this does not generate that I always use 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.230
 the church that depending on the plan that 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.120
 finds me at this moment in this 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.060
 I do not add the Havana 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.060
 I only do it with nothing 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.550
 It does not matter if you leave a bit of shape 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.350
 it is not going to be completely diluted 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.350
 only when we do 5 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.770
 to use our oil co 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.240
 let's put a little nightmare on 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.890
 the pan first let's put a 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.380
 heat is the time this is 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.910
 oil heats up really fast we go and 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.500
 we heat the pan and with it is well 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.780
 hot we take the teaspoon of 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.640
 six o'clock and we put the candle down 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.640
 supposed to the medium term 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.900
 ready to cook our because not 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:53.469
 I have butter on high right now 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.219
 I'm going to lower it like this for the lowest 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:59.349
 let's take the teaspoon very small and 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.030
 let's add the timely poster that 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.270
 it's coconut oil but I had 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.270
 spoken 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.400
 Now let's add the same 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.600
 ready to enjoy our 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.969
 nothing more than those of the banana and the 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.509
 cinnamon 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:50.049
 you do not even need to give it a 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.049
 home 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.160
 we have our bread that there is determined 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.770
 several options if you want to put 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.560
 over other dates can I do 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.020
 normally as you already have the word 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.509
 sweet but like that but there are people 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.060
 that is pouring a little syrup 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:09.490
 which is sugar without sugar that also 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.650
 we give you another type of software 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.970
 I usually use this when I do not 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.970
 using bananas inside 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:36.419
 the services that make these the next 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.940

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.639
 to see how delicious they are 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.990
 this serves as a breakfast even for 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.819
 when will we go to exercise 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.639
