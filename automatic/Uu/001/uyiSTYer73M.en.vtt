up White's pawns he takes the lead in
development<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.640> he<00:02:30.150> gives<00:02:30.629> priority<00:02:31.019> to

as quickly as possible and this is

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.720 
as quickly as possible and this is
exactly<00:02:36.959> what<00:02:37.260> Lafleur<00:02:37.860> does<00:02:38.129> in<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.430> game

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
exactly what Lafleur does in this game

now<00:02:39.120> whatever<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.510> objective<00:02:39.629> merits<00:02:40.319> of

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390

over<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.349> board<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.860> think<00:02:44.069> this<00:02:44.670> will<00:02:44.970> be<00:02:45.180> a

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
over the board I think this will be a

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.420 
over the board I think this will be a
very<00:02:45.690> effective<00:02:46.110> method<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.860> think<00:02:47.010> your

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
very effective method I think your

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.100 
very effective method I think your
opponent<00:02:47.640> really<00:02:48.239> won't<00:02:48.450> feel<00:02:48.750> at<00:02:48.930> ease

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
handling this type of position because

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.940 
handling this type of position because
black<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.180> striving<00:02:51.900> for<00:02:52.440> me<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:52.890> the

look<00:02:54.750> out<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.260> game<00:02:55.410> should<00:02:55.560> develop<00:02:55.920> from

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
look out the game should develop from

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.460 
look out the game should develop from
this<00:02:56.220> position<00:02:56.400> oreos<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.120> hence<00:02:57.329> took<00:02:57.629> on<00:02:57.810> d5

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
this position oreos and hence took on d5

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
and black took back with a queen so

already black is raised here in
development<00:03:03.000> why<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.329> got<00:03:03.569> doubled<00:03:04.109> pawns

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290

there on C 3 and C 2 it's just a
