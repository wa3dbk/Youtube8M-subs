00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.150
 well yes yes on ice we're going 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.540
 with the promised marica leaks but is 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.280
 on the ice that passes Don Americo and 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.790
 sea â€‹â€‹and here I am where to the side 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.589
 right here there is very good and oh dear 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.930
 with the breads energy 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.580
 they are not to be able to skate that together 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.840
 with the guys that is also the 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.580
 second alternative ok 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.800
 we saw the inflatables without wanting 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.949
 know him however I know it's something 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.980
 more adventure can go and see if 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.200
 we are not the fun part 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.200
 but in the sporting part and it's the 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:44.850
 ice skating what there is 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:47.670
 and there the girls that so complicated 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.040
 it can be get to be passed like this and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.130
 good the girls who are skating in 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.640
 this moment are girls from the classes of 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.010
 skating of that there is a teacher 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.739
 argentino sergio what he gives of a 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.239
 part sorry the skating lessons and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.239
 the ladies come by foot 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.830
 to achieve it for example to get to 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.590
 make this harmony between the steps that 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.770
 so much time is delayed for example a 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.680
 couple of months so that the girls can 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.360
 get to do a choreography saying 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.170
 made a presentation the girls in 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.630
 the skating class and it went very well 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.430
 they came this is the person who had 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.890
 less time in class and had to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.050
 two months the first class did not arrive mari 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.030
 in a class sole let's say at the beginning what 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.830
 things you can do that you could us in 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.500
 Any case of showing you what you have seen 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.270
 learned maybe you can show me 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.160
 some of the girls for example the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.770
 basic steps when one has no idea 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.150
 how is it skating on the ice that 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.040
 I do not know how to start for example 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.720
 they commented that the first step if it is that 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.930
 it helps me to change a little bit is to have 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.700
 the feet instead of one to not fall has 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.090
 that start like this true 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.940
 Exactly one has to put on the skates 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.920
 instead and be a little inclined towards 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.190
 forward and flexing the knees and 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.240
 You can move forward with small steps to go 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.800
 taking hold with the balance 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.800
 it's a matter of practice when one already 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.750
 try and this little step is now a 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.340
 more time on this track 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.570
 Exactly one can this with practice and 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.250
 they came constantly to skate one 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:33.210
 gets to have a level this average 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.640
 skating exactly if all four of the 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.970
 ladies are already a year already in the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.100
 classes and they can already be very 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.930
 well between tracks to straighten this 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.690
 skating rink what are the costs 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.510
 and it is also open to the public if 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.959
 you know a skating rink is a clue 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.959
 permanent 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.280
 The costs are 25 soles for half 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.930
 hour and 40 soles for one hour now but 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.850
 with the skates they also rent us here 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.340
 that's a separate cost, I'm not 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.010
 included in depression and helmet 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.750
 also the helmet too and there's also 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.790
 guys who are also sheltering 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.920
 all this place for taking out smoothing a 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.780
 emergency is open to be able 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.030
 act instantly you will see that yes there 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.670
 monitors that before entering tracks 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.020
 they give you a prior instruction and inside 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.410
 of the track also a monitoring 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.670
 we also have generator monitor 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.670
 all ok 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.380
 A) Yes 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.430
 manipulated by the marine debts of 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:47.549
 spring that the moths 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.980
 the steps on ice to see who comes 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.790
 yes mahoma does not go to the mountain that the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.790
 mountain goes to mahoma 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.980
 so much because I fall it happens to me that 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.840
 I always really start like it's a 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.580
 little bit however it is a practice 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.280
 there will be as we were told and the stripes 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.280
 the gems that it's amazing to be in 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.730
 Midsummer with the super sun and here to a 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.549
 The artist's world is not cool here 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.289
 doing sports without sun that right now 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.750
 it's pretty strong 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.260
 today there is a fall let's say the knees 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.650
 they suffer a lot with falls not 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.919
 it is necessarily how to do skating in 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.919
 line 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.669
 on ice 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.790
 very different 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.940
 rigidity 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:48.070
 but no, it does not happen that the people who 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:51.090
 suffer a fall in the hull as already 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.090
 no problem 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.820
 I had a great time and I do not know how but 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.530
 I ended up dancing in the middle of the track 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.750
 I know how I let go, I think there are people 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.130
 which is let's say you have more skill like 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.740
 suddenly in another side a few months by 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:18.040
 what someone but there are people who 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.320
 when they come and they have never skated 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.780
 they develop well on track 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.230
 on purpose and assuming we go to the mini 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.230
 world 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.170
 next gram and working if one pays 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.480
 his five soles for the inflators and 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.860
 besides this is an additional cost one 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:41.080
 different activity if within the premises 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.240
 we have nine thousand square meters 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.230
 and you are lampard that the track of 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:50.020
 ice skating that is permanent 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.250
 on the track is all year and now 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.710
 we are counting on the games 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.570
 inflatable then that I was the 30 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.310
 suns the inflatable games that includes 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:01.150
 that can go here or pay later 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.640
 25 do not have to pay 25 but they're going 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.130
 to give this discount coupons so that 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.580
 can access with the lowest price for 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.580
 Pizza 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.390
 Exactly be playing and here but sports 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.180
 but look how it is also in most 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.610
 of guys who are here mainly 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.880
 by the inflatable pores however 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.670
 first class and it 's better than me what 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.560
 I see what I see, the boys are very clear 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.060
 we saw further encouraged by one 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.040
 how yellow were the knees 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.200
 wet shows that it fell not 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.500
 it raises pressure so life is towards 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.910
 to fall back to comment 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.620
 Matteo is called getting commented is going to be 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.740
 the first time I was skating and 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.990
 without fear he throws himself tries and is already 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.050
 I looked at that young woman as if for tender 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:51.550
 I did record marjah 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.320
 and we will return with you in any 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.600
 moment and so I want to see you for a little while 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.860
 to us at 12 with 44 we are going to 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.860
 a pause but in seconds
