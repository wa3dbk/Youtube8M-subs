00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:09.618
It is an ordinary Sunday in Eregli
district of Konya, the central
Anatolian city of Turkey.

00:00:09.622 --> 00:00:15.586
As the sun rises up into the
sky, the holiday spirit is
reflected in the streets.

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:19.874
But there is something extraordinary
going on in this cafe.

00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:30.958
In the Down Cafe located in
Eregli district of Konya,

00:00:30.993 --> 00:00:34.766
it is the students with down
syndrome and mental disabilities

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:38.570
who set the tables, prepare breakfast
and serve tea to the customers;

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:42.459
since they are the hosts of the cafe.

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:57.920
- Yes, that's true, I am
the headwaiter of Down Cafe.

00:00:58.029 --> 00:01:08.292
Down Cafe is both
my family and my manager.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:13.989
Students studying at Kazım Demirel
Special Training School in Eregli

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:19.343
receive applied training on a rotation
basis in this cafe, which was
established via a change making project.

00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:22.516
- We decided to open a cafe
where we would train the kids

00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:27.948
and facilitate their
participation to the society.

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:32.720
Therefore we prepared our project
and applied to the Social
Development Grant Program.

00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:38.140
Our project became live via the Grant
Program and the cafe was opened.

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:48.569
- After I started to work
here, I have made friends.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:59.961
I used to have difficulty in talking
before, now I can talk to people
and I have lots of friends.

00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:16.192
- Within the internship program,
24 students work in the cafe
from 9:00 to 17:00 every day

00:02:16.227 --> 00:02:21.067
and at the end of the month they
get paid for the hours they have
worked during that month.

00:02:21.102 --> 00:02:24.671
- This cafe also serves
as a training workshop.

00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:29.211
The children periodically continue
their applied trainings here.

00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:38.263
8 of our students have gained the
necessary skills to serve in restaurants

00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:44.508
and as of last week they started to
work in 2 restaurants in our district.

00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:46.311
- He is very happy. He feels
great when he works here.

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:52.227
During the summer holiday he used
to say "I am bored, find me a job."

00:02:54.323 --> 00:02:56.573
Down Cafe, former a police
station, now a cafe;

00:02:56.608 --> 00:03:00.222
was restored by Kazım
Demirel Youth Association.

00:03:00.257 --> 00:03:04.905
It  not only provides an environment
where young people with disabilities

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.474
can use their knowledge and
skills but also gives an opportunity

00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:10.201
to other people to know them better.

00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:16.016
- The children joined the society
and socialized with other people.

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:27.344
The attitude of the society
towards us also changed.

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:31.568
Everybody learnt that people with
disabilities can also take roles

00:03:31.603 --> 00:03:38.053
in the society, have occupations and
do their jobs the best way they can.

00:03:41.194 --> 00:03:43.777
Students with down syndrome
and mental disabilities

00:03:43.782 --> 00:03:47.061
defied the limited roles
determined by the society.

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:50.869
They made a significant
change by proving that

00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:53.014
if given the opportunity,
they can the cleanest,

00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:59.997
the most hardworking and
the most skillful of all.
