00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:13.080
 Well , regarding the Nativity of Christ 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:19.920
 carry the question well, completely different 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.410
 a different order to say so than 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.189
 different church memories 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:31.130

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.320
 worldly usually remember some sort 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.660
 the event that took place which 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.750
 maybe here we are changing let's say 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.960
 still it is wisdom or genius 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.020
 or the work of this or that person 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.890
 or talk about this church 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.770
 festivals 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.559

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.660

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:04.439
 appointment is not just to remember a 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.439
 remember and learn what 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.740
 in the life around us we cannot learn 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.880
 Here is an example of Christmas 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.880
 Christ's 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.180
 well born jesus christ before the great 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.799
 the events of the greatest in history are unique and 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.340
 not the greatest unique and only 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.040
 in the history of the event of course 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.880
 the more we know what was born for 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:35.100
 christ what it brought this christmas 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.400
 him but here we are here we are trying 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.369
 for not trying to teach our holy fathers 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.560
 teach us at night 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.970
 the fact that we have to try with it 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.170
 comprehend on what 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.409
 tune in we have to at this time and they 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.310
 here lead very pay attention to 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.969
 such things where Christ was born royal 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.250
 Ward 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:11.390
 like a king's son in a manure dung in 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.390
 dungard you think it by chance 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:22.129
 christ that came to make a clean crib 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:25.459
 our soul it reminds us 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:29.989
 the condition of our souls and each individual 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.540
 man and humanity as a whole here's what 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.209
 we are in the spiritual 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.299
 respect really filled with all 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.390
 passions without exception than on juice 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:44.180
 the world is filled with the whole story 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.660
 poured with blood and the farther away 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.349
 more blood violence and 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.099
 injustice and really dirt 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.879
 Odessa manure 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:58.220
 that's where christ came but important here 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.540
 thinking not just that in the global whole 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:06.260
 the world and this holiday makes us 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.470
 look at yourself a little 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.730
 our soul the least we think 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.950
 the state of his soul is an indisputable fact 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.769
 all our thoughts all our intentions all 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.299
 our desires they all fly only 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:26.840
 around our body here would say 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:30.859
 of this life and everything is all to its soul 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.879
 direct attention this is all this 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:37.819
 a rather rare phenomenon 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:42.530
 The Nativity of Christ compels us directly 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:45.290
 Christians born in a stable in a stable 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.669
 you want your soul to be Christ 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.340
 born or not for this we must first 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:56.290
 understand and what is my 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:00.079
 soul and look in there to look honest 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.329
 they are so simple then sometimes just about everything is there 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.989
 it is necessary to look it is necessary it is necessary to sins 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.730
 repentance how bored you are what despair 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.010
 well right darling yes if you 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.959
 God knows what's going on at home 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.090
 bulk dirt and coat the horse why 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.669
 look and what are you going to do not 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.870
 will you live like this before or on the address is 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:23.450
 look and start cleaning up 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.120
 Christmas calls for 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.570
 to this 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.400
 to see how infected we are 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.040
 vanity and greed and envy and 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.320
 hypocrisy began 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.320
 started at least a little to fight it 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.330
 repent of it forcing yourself to fight 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.800
 with all this filth 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.330
 this is what christmas teaches us 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.940
 christ 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.930
 Christ is born that's why rejoice 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.810
 because he is to us by this very fact already 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.680
 compels us to look at our souls with 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:02.060
 order to start sweeping it 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.930
 and from this dirty piled room 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.710
 make beautiful 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:11.370
 clean gorgeous upper room covered 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.699
 light and purity 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.419
 First of all, our Christmas holiday 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.490
 Christ's 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.840
 take not just a memory there was 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.620
 stop no no what are you 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.080
 remembered remembered and what's next and what 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.440
 further worldly holidays it is 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.160
 remembered and what next they eat miracle 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.270
 spilled a bite 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.410
 and here you are to what is Christmas 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.970
 prompts great cause 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:45.289
 look at the most important that it 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:49.590
 more of the human soul and there is nothing 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:54.660
 by the way on this greatest value for 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:59.930
 man for me the least I draw 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:04.860
 attention christ is born look and 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:07.740
 open yourself this at least a little 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.949
 chink to the joy of the birth of christ 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:14.940
 could enter you if you accept 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:17.789
 the decision to live accordingly here 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.880
 so it seems to me this is one of the parties and well 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:23.960
 first of all what can be said with regard to 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.960
 Christmas holiday
