00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
it it's pretty cool it doesn't have a

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.840 
it it's pretty cool it doesn't have a
whole<00:01:40.650> lot<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.830> functionality<00:01:41.310> right<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:41.820> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
whole lot of functionality right now I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.760 
whole lot of functionality right now I
can<00:01:42.090> actually<00:01:42.180> spawn<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> traffic<00:01:43.410> cones<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
can actually spawn a traffic cones and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.890 
can actually spawn a traffic cones and
whatnot<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.190> I'm<00:01:44.310> not<00:01:44.550> going<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.760> do<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:44.910> for

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
whatnot but I'm not going to do that for

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.390 
whatnot but I'm not going to do that for
the<00:01:45.990> sake<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> sometimes<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> crashes<00:01:47.250> your

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
the sake of sometimes it crashes your

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.760 
the sake of sometimes it crashes your
game<00:01:47.580> and<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:49.020> feel<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.350> crashing

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
game and I don't feel like crashing

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.860 
game and I don't feel like crashing
while<00:01:49.890> I'm<00:01:50.010> recording<00:01:50.310> that's<00:01:50.640> never<00:01:50.820> good<00:01:51.180> so

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
while I'm recording that's never good so

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.480 
while I'm recording that's never good so
yeah<00:01:52.290> that's<00:01:52.410> pretty<00:01:52.530> cool<00:01:52.800> mod<00:01:53.070> I'm<00:01:53.310> gonna<00:01:53.430> be

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
yeah that's pretty cool mod I'm gonna be

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.260 
yeah that's pretty cool mod I'm gonna be
playing<00:01:53.700> around<00:01:53.790> with<00:01:53.940> it<00:01:54.030> I'm<00:01:54.150> probably

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
playing around with it I'm probably

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
playing around with it I'm probably
gonna<00:01:54.480> keep<00:01:54.720> installed<00:01:55.230> because<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.160> don't

go<00:03:38.710> look<00:03:38.980> at<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.190> ground<00:03:39.340> let's<00:03:39.580> try<00:03:39.730> that

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
go look at the ground let's try that

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.020 
go look at the ground let's try that
let's<00:03:40.090> try<00:03:40.210> to<00:03:40.270> look<00:03:40.360> at<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.540> ground<00:03:41.790> ya<00:03:42.790> ain't

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
let's try to look at the ground ya ain't

let's try to look at the ground ya ain't
working<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.740> have<00:03:44.740> a<00:03:44.800> simple<00:03:45.010> solution<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.610> that

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
working I have a simple solution to that

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.640 
working I have a simple solution to that
though<00:03:46.000> we<00:03:46.360> can<00:03:46.540> just<00:03:47.190> walk<00:03:48.190> on<00:03:48.460> over<00:03:48.490> and<00:03:49.650> pop

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
though we can just walk on over and pop

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.190 
though we can just walk on over and pop
it<00:03:50.680> with<00:03:50.860> our<00:03:51.040> heads<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.850> falls<00:03:52.200> yes

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
it with our heads and it falls yes

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.640 
it with our heads and it falls yes
obviously<00:03:53.590> this<00:03:53.860> is<00:03:54.040> nowhere<00:03:54.220> near<00:03:54.520> finished

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
obviously this is nowhere near finished

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.010 
obviously this is nowhere near finished
but<00:03:56.650> it's<00:03:56.800> still<00:03:57.070> pretty<00:03:57.130> cool<00:03:57.910> guys<00:03:58.210> I<00:03:58.510> want
