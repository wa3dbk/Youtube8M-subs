just<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.689> hold<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.939> wait<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
just have to hold out and wait for the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.010 
just have to hold out and wait for the
escape<00:02:01.439> then<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.920> hopefully<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:03.630> don't<00:02:03.840> have

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
escape then and hopefully you don't have

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.940 
escape then and hopefully you don't have
to<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.259> an<00:02:04.380> escape<00:02:04.740> after<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:06.469> and<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.770> do

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
to do an escape after this and if you do

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.800 
to do an escape after this and if you do
well<00:02:08.280> that's<00:02:08.580> unfortunate<00:02:09.270> but

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
well that's unfortunate but

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.110 
well that's unfortunate but
not<00:02:09.989> much<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.530> about<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
not much you can do about it so the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.300 
not much you can do about it so the
escape<00:02:12.480> venom<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.050> stores<00:02:13.380> has<00:02:13.590> two<00:02:13.830> spots<00:02:14.069> of

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
escape venom for stores has two spots of

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.010 
escape venom for stores has two spots of
spawning<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.849> can<00:02:15.000> spawn<00:02:15.239> by<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.480> door<00:02:15.840> I'm

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
spawning it can spawn by this door I'm

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.110 
spawning it can spawn by this door I'm
standing<00:02:16.470> at<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:17.220> back<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.580> map<00:02:17.760> or<00:02:17.970> it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
standing at the back of the map or it

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.870 
standing at the back of the map or it
can<00:02:18.209> spawn<00:02:18.510> on<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.780> opposite<00:02:19.260> alleyway<00:02:19.880> if

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
can spawn on the opposite alleyway if

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.880 
can spawn on the opposite alleyway if
you're<00:02:21.120> playing<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:21.480> overkill<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.319> chances

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
you're playing on overkill the chances

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.220 
you're playing on overkill the chances
of<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.099> spawning<00:02:23.430> here<00:02:23.790> I'm<00:02:24.060> just<00:02:24.690> gonna<00:02:24.840> guess

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
of it spawning here I'm just gonna guess

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.839 
of it spawning here I'm just gonna guess
I'm<00:02:25.500> significantly<00:02:26.280> lower

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
I'm significantly lower

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.589 
I'm significantly lower
but<00:02:28.220> absolutely<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.340> possibility<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.330> it

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
but absolutely a possibility of it

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.690 
but absolutely a possibility of it
spawning<00:02:30.900> here<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.500> always<00:02:31.830> pick<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.220> door

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
spawning here so always pick this door

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.759 
spawning here so always pick this door
picking<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.660> door<00:02:33.810> makes<00:02:34.019> no<00:02:34.440> difference

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
picking the door makes no difference

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.670 
picking the door makes no difference
whatsoever<00:02:35.190> on<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.730> spawn<00:02:36.060> rate<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.530> if<00:02:37.590> you

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
whatsoever on the spawn rate so if you

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.710 
whatsoever on the spawn rate so if you
have<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:37.950> door<00:02:38.190> open<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:39.030> yeah<00:02:39.480> make

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
have this door open and then yeah make

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.030 
have this door open and then yeah make
sure<00:02:39.750> you've<00:02:39.989> got<00:02:40.019> your<00:02:40.140> body<00:02:40.410> armor<00:02:40.739> in<00:02:40.860> case

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
sure you've got your body armor in case

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.530 
sure you've got your body armor in case
you<00:02:41.220> have<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.430> go<00:02:41.519> across<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.910> street<00:02:41.940> then

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
you have to go across the street then

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.449 
you have to go across the street then

you should be good and now the driver

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.330 
you should be good and now the driver
will<00:02:44.700> take<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.970> minute<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:46.130> hopefully<00:02:47.130> we<00:02:47.220> don't

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
will take a minute to hopefully we don't

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.050 
will take a minute to hopefully we don't
have<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.610> do<00:02:47.790> an<00:02:47.880> escape<00:02:48.239> but<00:02:49.250> if<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.430> if<00:02:50.700> we<00:02:50.910> do

this twice for my brother last night he
went<00:03:26.780> from<00:03:26.840> level<00:03:27.019> 1<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.500> level<00:03:27.530> 21<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:29.540> yeah

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
went from level 1 to level 21 so yeah

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.320 
went from level 1 to level 21 so yeah
you<00:03:29.750> get<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:29.989> lot<00:03:30.140> of<00:03:30.230> XP<00:03:30.560> from<00:03:30.709> this<00:03:30.950> as<00:03:31.099> well

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
you get a lot of XP from this as well

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.460 
you get a lot of XP from this as well
won't<00:03:32.330> help<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.629> too<00:03:32.810> much<00:03:32.959> when<00:03:33.200> you<00:03:33.260> get<00:03:33.349> to

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
won't help you too much when you get to

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.830 
won't help you too much when you get to
about<00:03:33.620> level<00:03:33.769> 60<00:03:34.340> because<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.760> really<00:03:35.599> doesn't

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
about level 60 because it really doesn't

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.309 
about level 60 because it really doesn't
work<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.440> just<00:03:36.470> barely<00:03:37.459> moves<00:03:37.849> your<00:03:38.030> XP<00:03:38.360> up<00:03:38.480> I'm

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
work it just barely moves your XP up I'm

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.640 
work it just barely moves your XP up I'm
level<00:03:40.209> 61<00:03:41.209> I<00:03:41.569> think<00:03:41.930> at<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.170> moment<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:45.500> yeah

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
level 61 I think at the moment so yeah

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.650 
level 61 I think at the moment so yeah
it<00:03:46.310> should<00:03:46.549> come<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:46.790> this<00:03:46.910> alleyway<00:03:47.480> or

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
it should come to this alleyway or

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.539 
it should come to this alleyway or
across<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.140> street<00:03:48.530> depending<00:03:48.950> on<00:03:49.190> if<00:03:49.280> we<00:03:49.400> get

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
across the street depending on if we get

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.850 
across the street depending on if we get
lucky<00:03:49.790> if<00:03:50.569> you<00:03:50.780> shoot<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.110> cops<00:03:51.349> I<00:03:51.530> think<00:03:51.709> your

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
lucky if you shoot the cops I think your

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.309 
lucky if you shoot the cops I think your
chances<00:03:51.890> of<00:03:52.400> getting<00:03:52.519> an<00:03:52.790> escape<00:03:53.319> increased

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
chances of getting an escape increased

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.339 
chances of getting an escape increased
so<00:03:54.940> it's<00:03:55.940> best<00:03:56.180> to<00:03:56.299> just<00:03:56.420> sort<00:03:56.780> of<00:03:56.840> avoid<00:03:57.170> the

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
so it's best to just sort of avoid the

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.170 
so it's best to just sort of avoid the
cops<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.920> hang<00:03:58.099> back<00:03:58.340> back<00:03:58.610> here<00:04:01.000> by<00:04:02.000> all
