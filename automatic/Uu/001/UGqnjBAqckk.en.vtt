00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.530
 welcome to the new card delivery 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.970
 we are cooking several today 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.350
 cut techniques 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.119
 am now cutting one 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.939
 rose of the tomato I leave you 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.020
 bags see a little further in his work 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.029
 is going 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.610
 then we are going to learn and an onion 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.710
 cut zucchini and pepper 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.970
 cut in a special way 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.970
 so those are the ingredients of today 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.620
 you are supposed to be with it 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.320
 cutting a rose from the tomato 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.239
 very carefully with that knife and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.430
 go again 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.890
 you actually have to peel the newspaper 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.699
 we can read we say it is so 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.760
 service cut the tomato 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.989
 stick where you have now stopped 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.850
 and then you start that last bit 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.210
 cut from the other side 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.210
 the month 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.680
 is there 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.100
 so that release here is the intention that we 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.100
 him go we start rolling in 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.110
 piece where I started cutting 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.110
 and so you hear the skin 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.830
 in the last part you make it like this 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.070
 cover that is closed and then turn 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.070
 you put it on 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.550
 and do you have someone nice for it 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.480
 garnish with an appetizer 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.010
 now go beat and chop onion 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.600
 so i'll show you how to get on one 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.740
 easy way and can cut out 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.740
 without you tearing 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.580
 The intention is that you have a very small one 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.250
 cut off a bit of the ass and a little 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.310
 more from the other side 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.180
 so because this way turn him around 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.350
 then cut the other side so now you make 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.490
 a tunnel of your hand 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.729
 so that's called this shape and you cut the onion 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.890
 you immediately get the 2nd half in the middle 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.200
 shelf so that the moisture does not come out 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.489
 can come 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:22.110
 then we take the first skirt off the aft 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:25.080
 this way the ai ate is much cleaner 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.120
 if you are going to cut we are now going into the onion 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.010
 and then you use the tip of 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.570
 your knife so we cut it in 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.680
 not through so that he cannot separate 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.630
 fall 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.820
 howie your fingers with your other hand 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.800
 all crooked and the tip of your knife 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.970
 start with the right side of the requirements 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.000
 are on the right 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.610
 and then I cut whole things racks 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.890
 that the knife is sharp it is 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.690
 actually very easy 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.030
 at the last bit 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.790
 pushing the onion shut making tunnel again 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.120
 of your hand and then 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.580
 last two three times then turn the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.440
 onions a quarter turn and we use this 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.040
 part of the knife to cut 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.260
 this part is that for you he in it 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.400
 crooked fingers 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.990
 go cutting shredding knife led 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.990
 actually by the onion 1 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.790
 we are now going to cut the pepper 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.450
 the peppers from their pepper's trip 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.370
 bleiswijk we go this one in a small 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.810
 cutting strips we start with you again 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.670
 hold hands or your fingers 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.850
 crooked garden 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.989
 cut a piece off the top 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.989
 piece from the bottom 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:46.959
 so and then cut with the tip of your knife 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.959
 in the notch and at the other notch 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.000
 one more if you have done that you can 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.250
 actually very easy 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.070
 disassemble bell pepper so that it 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.080
 core but all the seeds and is in 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.900
 can easily throw away without it 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.400
 the seeds remain in the paprika 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.400
 though cut off the seed lists 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.070
 the white part 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.600
 this way too 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.310
 we are now going to cut the bell pepper into strips 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.480
 use the middle part of your knife 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.090
 to cut 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.479
 front part you are in front of your product 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.120
 for the bell pepper and we make small ones 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:36.750
 movement and then forward 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.430
 this is how we make thin strips of the bell pepper 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.830
 keep your fingers chrome so that you are there 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.440
 cannot cut 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.979
 and cut the pepper this way 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.979
 nice strips 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.990
 also a nice group is the zucchini and 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.990
 I'm going to cut in a special way 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.280
 cut the most 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.400
 we use punishment in two 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.400
 not 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.630
 then I cut it lengthwise 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.380
 in addition, they appear to be lengthwise again 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.139
 with as one pieces 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.280
 then we get the seed lists from the 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.780
 zucchini 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.780
 just put it down like that 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.930
 who has it all 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.360
 this is namely the moist part of the 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.790
 zucchini if â€‹â€‹you go this bakery 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.850
 then this should be done too quickly then 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.560
 your product will become slightly moist 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.870
 we would explain they would no more and then again 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.750
 with curved fingers in this part of knife 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:47.080
 we cut the zucchini 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:49.410
 shines through get a nice product 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.410
 end result
