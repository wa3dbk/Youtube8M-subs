right today we're going to show you how

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.950 
right today we're going to show you how
to<00:00:18.529> make<00:00:18.770> a<00:00:18.980> IR<00:00:19.520> blaster<00:00:20.119> out<00:00:20.360> of<00:00:20.689> just<00:00:20.869> a

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
to make a IR blaster out of just a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.310 
to make a IR blaster out of just a
regular<00:00:22.210> lamp<00:00:23.210> that<00:00:23.570> has<00:00:23.810> 14<00:00:24.619> LEDs<00:00:25.750> and<00:00:26.750> this

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
regular lamp that has 14 LEDs and this

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.050 
regular lamp that has 14 LEDs and this
is<00:00:27.440> just<00:00:27.650> regular<00:00:27.800> lights<00:00:28.340> in<00:00:28.580> this<00:00:28.730> one<00:00:28.880> right

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
is just regular lights in this one right

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.420 
is just regular lights in this one right
now<00:00:29.270> but<00:00:30.080> what<00:00:30.260> we're<00:00:30.410> going<00:00:30.440> to<00:00:30.560> do<00:00:30.770> is<00:00:31.160> take

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
now but what we're going to do is take

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.110 
now but what we're going to do is take
it<00:00:31.580> apart<00:00:31.880> and<00:00:32.119> put<00:00:33.040> infrared<00:00:34.040> LEDs<00:00:34.519> in<00:00:34.850> place

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
it apart and put infrared LEDs in place

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.210 
it apart and put infrared LEDs in place
of<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.720> regular<00:00:36.050> LEDs<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:36.710> make<00:00:36.860> this<00:00:37.040> an

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
of the the regular LEDs to make this an

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.549 
of the the regular LEDs to make this an
IR<00:00:37.520> blaster<00:00:37.750> what<00:00:38.750> you'll<00:00:38.899> need<00:00:39.079> is<00:00:39.230> a<00:00:39.260> pair<00:00:39.350> of

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
IR blaster what you'll need is a pair of

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.790 
IR blaster what you'll need is a pair of
pliers<00:00:40.030> a<00:00:41.030> pair<00:00:41.270> of<00:00:41.540> wire<00:00:41.780> snips<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.410> a

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
pliers a pair of wire snips and a

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.389 
pliers a pair of wire snips and a
soldering<00:00:43.010> iron<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:44.680> we'll<00:00:45.680> go<00:00:45.829> over<00:00:46.100> how<00:00:46.370> to

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
soldering iron and we'll go over how to

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.270 
soldering iron and we'll go over how to
take<00:00:46.579> this<00:00:46.820> apart<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:47.500> basically<00:00:48.500> start<00:00:48.890> the

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
take this apart and basically start the

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.220 
take this apart and basically start the
process<00:00:49.790> of<00:00:49.969> putting<00:00:50.540> it<00:00:50.629> together

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.780 

first<00:00:57.230> there's<00:00:57.500> four<00:00:57.950> screws<00:00:58.310> that<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:58.640> would

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
first there's four screws that you would

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.610 
first there's four screws that you would
have<00:00:58.880> to<00:00:58.970> take<00:00:59.120> off<00:00:59.300> of<00:00:59.330> this<00:00:59.630> model<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.320> this

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
have to take off of this model and this

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.660 
have to take off of this model and this
is<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.970> twenty<00:01:01.970> dollar<00:01:02.120> model<00:01:02.360> that<00:01:02.630> I<00:01:02.660> got<00:01:02.840> it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
is a twenty dollar model that I got it

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.170 
is a twenty dollar model that I got it
Walmart<00:01:04.670> that's<00:01:05.660> me<00:01:05.810> about<00:01:05.960> Black<00:01:06.200> &amp;<00:01:06.380> Decker

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
Walmart that's me about Black &amp; Decker

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.140 
Walmart that's me about Black &amp; Decker
you<00:01:08.180> can<00:01:08.300> use<00:01:08.480> any<00:01:08.660> other<00:01:08.840> type<00:01:08.930> that<00:01:09.350> you<00:01:09.470> want

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
you can use any other type that you want

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.000 
you can use any other type that you want
but<00:01:11.150> I<00:01:11.210> found<00:01:11.690> this<00:01:11.870> to<00:01:12.080> probably<00:01:12.530> be<00:01:12.680> more

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
but I found this to probably be more

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.910 
but I found this to probably be more
efficient<00:01:13.730> as<00:01:13.850> far<00:01:14.060> as<00:01:14.650> spreading<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.740> light

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
efficient as far as spreading the light

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.430 
efficient as far as spreading the light
out<00:01:16.130> better<00:01:17.680> just<00:01:18.680> remove<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.220> screws<00:01:19.820> and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
out better just remove the screws and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.830 
out better just remove the screws and
the<00:01:21.440> plastic<00:01:21.950> sleeve<00:01:22.220> should<00:01:22.520> just<00:01:22.700> lift<00:01:22.880> off

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.810 

inside<00:01:26.840> you'll<00:01:27.080> see<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.560> reflector<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.280> the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
inside you'll see the reflector and the

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.469 
inside you'll see the reflector and the
four<00:01:29.030> LEDs<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.720> on<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.900> back<00:01:31.330> you'll<00:01:32.330> have

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
four LEDs and on the back you'll have

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.510 
four LEDs and on the back you'll have
the<00:01:32.600> circuit<00:01:32.960> board<00:01:33.170> there<00:01:33.950> are<00:01:34.040> two<00:01:34.220> screws

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
the circuit board there are two screws

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.300 
the circuit board there are two screws
there<00:01:34.850> just<00:01:35.540> remove<00:01:35.840> those<00:01:36.050> and<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:37.009> circuit

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
there just remove those and the circuit

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.050 
there just remove those and the circuit
board<00:01:37.550> should<00:01:37.729> come<00:01:37.880> out

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.789 

okay

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.679 

once<00:01:47.430> you've<00:01:47.579> exposed<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.479> LEDs<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:50.689> comes

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
once you've exposed the LEDs then comes

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.230 
once you've exposed the LEDs then comes
trying<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.200> them<00:01:52.290> off<00:01:52.439> okay<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:54.149> we're

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
trying to get them off okay what we're

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.639 
trying to get them off okay what we're
going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.720> show<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.930> how<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> take<00:01:55.470> one

I'm<00:02:08.519> going<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.819> pull<00:02:09.030> down<00:02:09.269> while<00:02:10.050> he<00:02:11.750> heats

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
I'm going to pull down while he heats

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.260 
I'm going to pull down while he heats
them<00:02:12.930> up

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.010 

there<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.320> go<00:02:21.710> pulled<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.220> right<00:02:22.250> out<00:02:23.020> after

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
there you go pulled it right out after

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.780 
there you go pulled it right out after
you've<00:02:24.170> done<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.560> then<00:02:25.220> we'll<00:02:25.370> show<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.580> how

we've removed all but we have put in one

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.270 
we've removed all but we have put in one
on<00:02:31.220> already<00:02:31.640> what<00:02:32.420> these<00:02:32.600> are<00:02:32.840> spacers<00:02:33.590> and

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
on already what these are spacers and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.970 
on already what these are spacers and
you<00:02:34.370> want<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.640> keep<00:02:34.760> put<00:02:35.180> these<00:02:35.330> back<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.980> in

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
you want to keep put these back on in

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.380 
you want to keep put these back on in
the<00:02:37.160> same<00:02:37.340> way<00:02:37.490> they<00:02:37.640> came<00:02:37.790> up<00:02:38.000> now<00:02:38.210> if<00:02:38.300> you

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
the same way they came up now if you

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.930 
the same way they came up now if you
look<00:02:38.570> on<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.840> pattern<00:02:39.500> here<00:02:39.800> you'll<00:02:40.430> see<00:02:40.700> that

couple tries and actually would be good
if<00:05:12.110> you<00:05:12.140> put<00:05:12.350> it<00:05:12.440> on<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:12.650> right<00:05:12.800> way<00:05:16.210> let's<00:05:17.210> put

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.520 
the IR light that's on this camera
itself<00:06:15.450> so<00:06:16.450> basically<00:06:16.750> it's<00:06:17.080> just<00:06:17.140> going<00:06:17.440> to

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
itself so basically it's just going to

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.130
