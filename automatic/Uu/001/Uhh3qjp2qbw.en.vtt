00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
looking back at the recent performances

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.209 
looking back at the recent performances
there<00:01:01.079> yeah<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> four<00:01:01.949> against

Dominica<00:01:03.210> which<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.809> know<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.799> good<00:01:05.010> but

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
Dominica which is you know it's good but

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.240 
Dominica which is you know it's good but
we<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:05.780> 170<00:01:06.780> fourth<00:01:07.020> ranked<00:01:07.320> team<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
we are 170 fourth ranked team in the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.649 
we are 170 fourth ranked team in the
world<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.670> football<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.479> like

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
world of football so it's not like

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.170 
world of football so it's not like
they're<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.320> super<00:01:11.310> popular<00:01:11.520> football<00:01:11.880> or

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
they're a super popular football or

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.789 
they're a super popular football or
anything<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.659> they've<00:01:13.110> obviously<00:01:13.229> got<00:01:13.470> goals

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
anything but they've obviously got goals

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.490 
anything but they've obviously got goals
in<00:01:14.010> them<00:01:14.250> Canada<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.930> think<00:01:16.170> gives<00:01:16.409> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
in them Canada and I think gives you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.289 
in them Canada and I think gives you
make<00:01:16.650> her<00:01:16.799> playing<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.430> maybe<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> slightly<00:01:18.000> more

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
make her playing a maybe a slightly more

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.539 
make her playing a maybe a slightly more
open<00:01:18.439> brand<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.590> football<00:01:19.799> they've<00:01:20.250> gone<00:01:20.400> from

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
open brand of football they've gone from

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.640 
open brand of football they've gone from
not<00:01:20.759> conceding<00:01:21.330> too<00:01:21.540> many<00:01:21.720> goals<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.170> really

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
not conceding too many goals to really

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.100 
not conceding too many goals to really
good<00:01:22.799> teams<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.700> conceding<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.450> against<00:01:24.750> Costa

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
good teams to conceding to against Costa

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.840 
good teams to conceding to against Costa
Rica<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.590> maybe<00:01:26.070> they've<00:01:26.250> decided<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.670> be<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
Rica so maybe they've decided to be a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
Rica so maybe they've decided to be a
bit<00:01:27.000> more<00:01:27.150> open<00:01:27.570> bit<00:01:28.020> more<00:01:28.200> expressing<00:01:28.829> in

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
Rica and I think but you know my

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.890 
Rica and I think but you know my
question<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.729> why<00:01:39.329> didn't<00:01:39.720> kind

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
question is is you know why didn't kind

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.690 
question is is you know why didn't kind
of<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.049> score<00:01:40.290> against<00:01:40.650> our<00:01:40.770> Salvador<00:01:41.460> were<00:01:41.579> you

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
of a score against our Salvador were you

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.940 
of a score against our Salvador were you
surprised<00:01:42.090> by<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.950> yeah<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.130> suppose<00:01:44.250> so

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
surprised by that yeah I suppose so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.899 
surprised by that yeah I suppose so
pointed<00:01:46.950> not<00:01:47.100> you've<00:01:47.280> got<00:01:47.310> something<00:01:47.759> out<00:01:47.880> of

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
pointed not you've got something out of

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.060 
pointed not you've got something out of
that<00:01:48.060> game<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.390> know<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> win<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.860> giving

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
that game you know a win and giving

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.289 
that game you know a win and giving
themselves<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.460> real<00:01:50.579> good<00:01:50.790> chance<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.149> getting

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
themselves a real good chance of getting

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.460 
themselves a real good chance of getting
through<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.750> puts<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.960> lot<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.110> pressure<00:01:52.229> on

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
through it puts a lot of pressure on

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.350 
through it puts a lot of pressure on
them<00:01:52.649> now<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.100> game<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.970> course<00:01:54.210> in

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
them now in this game and of course in

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600 
them now in this game and of course in
the<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> next<00:01:55.290> game<00:01:55.560> that's<00:01:56.159> arguably

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the in the next game that's arguably

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.550 
the in the next game that's arguably
their<00:01:57.149> easiest<00:01:57.630> game<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.990> group<00:01:58.110> isn't<00:01:58.500> it

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
their easiest game of the group isn't it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.959 
their easiest game of the group isn't it
so<00:01:58.770> they<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.399> would<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.579> been<00:01:59.670> looking

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
so they really would have been looking

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.850 
so they really would have been looking
for<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.240> win<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.570> again<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.229> think<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:01.680> in

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
for a win and again I think you know in

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.709 
for a win and again I think you know in
tournament<00:02:02.340> football<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:03.210> don't<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.600> that

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
tournament football you don't get that

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.569 
tournament football you don't get that
first<00:02:03.990> result<00:02:04.380> but<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.619> need<00:02:04.890> then<00:02:05.399> you

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
first result but you need then you

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.219 
first result but you need then you
really<00:02:05.820> need<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.060> be<00:02:06.149> looking<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.689> know<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
really need to be looking you know the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.960 
really need to be looking you know the
next<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.770> win<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.160> mean<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> way<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.819> is

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
next one to win I mean the way this is

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.119 
next one to win I mean the way this is
all<00:02:09.149> poised<00:02:09.690> now<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.229> group<00:02:10.470> everyone's<00:02:10.950> got

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
all poised now this group everyone's got

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.630 
all poised now this group everyone's got
a<00:02:11.160> point

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
a point

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.550 
a point
so<00:02:12.120> everyone's<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.599> same<00:02:12.780> position<00:02:13.260> so

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
so everyone's in the same position so

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.809 
so everyone's in the same position so
still<00:02:13.860> not<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.160> case<00:02:14.370> where<00:02:14.640> you're<00:02:14.730> gonna

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
still not the case where you're gonna

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.900 
still not the case where you're gonna
see<00:02:15.090> Canada<00:02:15.989> or<00:02:16.230> Jamaica<00:02:16.739> or<00:02:17.099> Costa<00:02:17.550> Rica<00:02:17.700> El

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
see Canada or Jamaica or Costa Rica El

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.150 
see Canada or Jamaica or Costa Rica El
Salvador<00:02:18.420> go<00:02:18.870> help<00:02:19.140> with<00:02:19.349> other<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.770> win

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
Salvador go help with other for the win

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.670 
Salvador go help with other for the win
I<00:02:20.190> still<00:02:20.819> think<00:02:21.030> it'd<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.270> quite<00:02:21.480> cautious<00:02:21.810> so

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
I still think it'd be quite cautious so

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.960 
I still think it'd be quite cautious so
that's<00:02:22.860> that's<00:02:23.040> one<00:02:23.310> thing<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.640> bear<00:02:23.819> in<00:02:23.849> mind

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
that's that's one thing to bear in mind

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.210 
that's that's one thing to bear in mind
in<00:02:24.239> this<00:02:24.330> game<00:02:24.599> but<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.170> do<00:02:25.290> think<00:02:25.739> as<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.040> game

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
in this game but I do think as the game

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.850 
in this game but I do think as the game
wears<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.670> teams<00:02:27.510> will<00:02:27.840> look<00:02:28.110> for<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> win

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
wears on the teams will look for a win

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.589 
wears on the teams will look for a win
so<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.250> think<00:02:29.370> these<00:02:29.819> games<00:02:30.000> will<00:02:30.209> end<00:02:30.330> up<00:02:30.450> being

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
so I think these games will end up being

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.890 
so I think these games will end up being
more<00:02:30.870> open<00:02:31.319> yeah<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:31.980> then<00:02:32.819> they<00:02:33.360> start<00:02:33.690> off

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
more open yeah and then they start off

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.140 
more open yeah and then they start off
being<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.410> might<00:02:34.530> be<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> cagey<00:02:35.250> first<00:02:35.610> off<00:02:35.849> and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
being it might be a cagey first off and

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.360 
being it might be a cagey first off and
then<00:02:36.450> open<00:02:36.750> up<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:36.989> second<00:02:37.319> half<00:02:37.349> but<00:02:37.769> yeah

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
then open up in the second half but yeah

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.460 
then open up in the second half but yeah
I<00:02:38.880> think<00:02:39.030> kinda<00:02:39.569> we'll<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.989> score<00:02:40.200> here

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
I think kinda we'll have to score here

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.640 
I think kinda we'll have to score here
yeah<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:42.330> can't<00:02:42.569> go<00:02:42.690> through<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:42.900> not<00:02:43.319> story

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
yeah it can't go through this not story

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.780 
yeah it can't go through this not story
or<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.950> want<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.190> get<00:02:44.310> through<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.670> next

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
or to want to get through to the next

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.080 
or to want to get through to the next
stage

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
stage

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.850 
stage
mm-hmm<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> agree<00:02:46.260> with<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.470> now<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.590> tell<00:02:46.769> you

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
mm-hmm I agree with you now I tell you

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.229 
mm-hmm I agree with you now I tell you
what<00:02:47.010> though<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.310> definitely<00:02:47.730> gives<00:02:47.910> us<00:02:48.060> value

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
what though is definitely gives us value

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.970 
what though is definitely gives us value
there<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.930> go<00:02:49.080> because<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.350> are<00:02:49.500> going<00:02:49.769> against

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
there to go because we are going against

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.479 
there to go because we are going against
the<00:02:50.100> bookies<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:51.600> over<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.260> priced<00:02:52.560> 2.88<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
the bookies the over is priced 2.88 the

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.150 
the bookies the over is priced 2.88 the
under<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.239> priced<00:02:54.690> one<00:02:55.049> point<00:02:55.350> for<00:02:55.650> force<00:02:55.980> a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
under is priced one point for force a

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.009 
under is priced one point for force a
great<00:02:56.340> value<00:02:56.640> there<00:02:56.790> for<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.060> over<00:02:57.360> both

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
great value there for the over both

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.009 
great value there for the over both
teams<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.650> score<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:59.220> two<00:02:59.580> point<00:02:59.880> two<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.569> then

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
teams to score is two point two and then

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.440 
teams to score is two point two and then
no<00:03:01.319> is<00:03:01.650> one<00:03:01.830> point<00:03:02.069> six<00:03:02.310> seven<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:02.849> great<00:03:03.150> odds

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
no is one point six seven so great odds

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.080 
no is one point six seven so great odds
go<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.170> combine<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.010> think<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.700> think

Dominica<00:04:02.130> as<00:04:02.250> well<00:04:02.430> when<00:04:02.519> they<00:04:02.609> score<00:04:02.819> two

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
Dominica as well when they score two

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.199 
Dominica as well when they score two
away<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:03.810> for<00:04:04.350> nil<00:04:04.620> at<00:04:04.709> home<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:06.060> yeah

Jamaica can just out strong I think

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.050 
Jamaica can just out strong I think
they're<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.200> bit<00:04:10.350> better<00:04:10.500> than<00:04:11.190> Canada<00:04:11.609> so
