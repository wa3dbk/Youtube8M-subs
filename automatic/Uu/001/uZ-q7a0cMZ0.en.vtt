00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.569 
really long time and just I didn't even
know<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.329> don't<00:01:54.540> call<00:01:55.079> me<00:01:55.259> naive<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:55.680> don't

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
know like I don't call me naive or don't

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.910 
know like I don't call me naive or don't
even<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.930> don't<00:01:58.079> even<00:01:58.140> know<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.770> you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
even but I don't even know that you

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.050 
even but I don't even know that you
could<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> photographer<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.420> live<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.930> like

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
could be a photographer for live it like

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.480 
could be a photographer for live it like
seriously<00:02:03.060> right<00:02:03.710> even<00:02:04.710> as<00:02:04.860> an<00:02:04.979> adult<00:02:05.100> just

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
seriously right even as an adult just

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310 
seriously right even as an adult just
didn't<00:02:05.759> know<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:06.960> something<00:02:07.140> you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
didn't know I just that's something you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.190 
didn't know I just that's something you
just<00:02:07.439> don't<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:08.129> about<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.729> can

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
just don't think about like I can

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.520 
just don't think about like I can
make<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> living<00:02:09.979> doing<00:02:10.220> this<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:12.170> think<00:02:12.230> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
make a living doing this and I think the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.240 
make a living doing this and I think the
reason<00:02:12.560> for<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:13.519> was<00:02:13.730> because<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.989> know

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
reason for that was because you know

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.970 
reason for that was because you know
we're<00:02:16.250> trained<00:02:16.610> even<00:02:17.150> from<00:02:17.660> school<00:02:18.140> age<00:02:18.410> you
