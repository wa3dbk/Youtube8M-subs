okay cutlery flaws in there anyway the
main<00:01:32.640> thing<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.240> remember<00:01:34.080> about<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.010> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
main thing to remember about this is the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.420 
main thing to remember about this is the
muting<00:01:36.390> which<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.900> very<00:01:37.110> important<00:01:37.740> must

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
muting which is very important must

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.280 
muting which is very important must
remember<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.540> was<00:01:39.600> assembled

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
remember that when this was assembled

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.130 
remember that when this was assembled
this<00:01:40.530> track<00:01:40.920> each<00:01:41.850> time<00:01:42.180> Bowie<00:01:42.420> played<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
this track each time Bowie played a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.400 
this track each time Bowie played a
cycle<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.010> riff<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.910> was<00:01:45.690> from<00:01:45.870> a<00:01:45.960> standing

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
cycle of the riff it was from a standing

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.440 
cycle of the riff it was from a standing
start<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.070> he<00:01:47.160> didn't<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.520> need<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.210> worry

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
start so he didn't really need to worry

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.550 
start so he didn't really need to worry
about<00:01:48.540> what<00:01:49.020> notes<00:01:49.350> were<00:01:49.560> hanging<00:01:50.690> so<00:01:51.690> so<00:01:52.440> he

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
about what notes were hanging so so he

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.590 
about what notes were hanging so so he
you<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:53.010> he<00:01:53.190> was<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.430> playing<00:01:57.950> each<00:01:58.950> time

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
you know he was just playing each time

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.200 
you know he was just playing each time
and<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.710> way<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.430> riff<00:02:03.000> then

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and it's the way that the riff then

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.670 
and it's the way that the riff then
circles<00:02:03.690> onto<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.020> next<00:02:04.260> one<00:02:04.380> which<00:02:04.650> is

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
circles onto the next one which is

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.650 
circles onto the next one which is
problematic<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:05.490> some<00:02:05.820> people<00:02:06.120> because<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
problematic for some people because it

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.850 
problematic for some people because it
leaves<00:02:06.840> Sun<00:02:07.170> nose<00:02:07.350> hanging<00:02:07.890> which<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:09.030> be

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
leaves Sun nose hanging which have to be

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.200 
leaves Sun nose hanging which have to be
muted<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.070> order<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.900> make<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:14.210> subsequent

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
muted in order to make the subsequent

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.260 
muted in order to make the subsequent
cycle<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> riff<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.380> bit<00:02:16.620> clearer<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.280> less

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
cycle of the riff a bit clearer and less

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.550 
cycle of the riff a bit clearer and less
messy<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.980> that's<00:02:20.910> where<00:02:21.150> some<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.600> David

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
messy and that's where some of David

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.020 
messy and that's where some of David
Bowie's<00:02:22.860> live<00:02:23.070> guitarists<00:02:23.640> have<00:02:23.730> actually

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
Bowie's live guitarists have actually

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.010 
Bowie's live guitarists have actually
fallen<00:02:24.240> down<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.500> past<00:02:26.690> anyway<00:02:27.690> let's<00:02:27.870> go

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
fallen down in the past anyway let's go

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.780 
fallen down in the past anyway let's go
through<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.840> riff<00:02:31.320> bit<00:02:31.530> by<00:02:31.709> bit<00:02:31.740> so<00:02:32.610> if<00:02:32.700> we

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
through the the riff bit by bit so if we

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.960 
through the the riff bit by bit so if we
start<00:02:33.090> off<00:02:33.209> we've<00:02:33.540> got<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.720> D<00:02:34.020> segment<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:35.459> d9

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
start off we've got the D segment of d9

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.070 
start off we've got the D segment of d9
thing

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.490 

yeah

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.720 

c-sharp<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.730> then<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:46.770> e<00:02:46.800> card<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.490> now<00:02:47.610> these

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
c-sharp and then to e card so now these

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
c-sharp and then to e card so now these
eCourse<00:02:48.330> have<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.720> be<00:02:48.840> muted<00:02:50.300> which<00:02:51.300> I'm<00:02:51.480> I'm

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
eCourse have to be muted which I'm I'm

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.140 
eCourse have to be muted which I'm I'm
doing<00:02:52.020> with<00:02:52.140> my<00:02:52.280> ring<00:02:53.280> finger<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.790> fourth

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
doing with my ring finger and fourth

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:03.970 
doing with my ring finger and fourth
finger<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.560> we've<00:02:58.710> got<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:02.250> then

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
finger here and so we've got and then

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.070 
finger here and so we've got and then
what's<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> record<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:08.480> okay<00:03:09.510> that's<00:03:09.930> what

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
what's on the record is okay that's what

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.890 
what's on the record is okay that's what
sounds<00:03:10.470> like<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.250> record<00:03:11.580> what<00:03:12.360> Errol<00:03:12.600> slick

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
sounds like the record what Errol slick

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.540 
sounds like the record what Errol slick
was<00:03:13.110> playing<00:03:13.410> when<00:03:13.590> he<00:03:13.620> first<00:03:14.070> went<00:03:14.220> out<00:03:14.370> with

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
was playing when he first went out with

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.570 
was playing when he first went out with
David<00:03:14.989> Bowie<00:03:15.989> on<00:03:16.290> David<00:03:17.100> live<00:03:17.340> was<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:20.459> it's

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
David Bowie on David live was and it's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.090 
David Bowie on David live was and it's
not<00:03:20.730> quite<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.090> scene<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:22.050> you've<00:03:22.200> got<00:03:26.900> yeah

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
not quite the scene so you've got yeah

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.490 
not quite the scene so you've got yeah
yes<00:03:29.100> you've<00:03:29.340> got<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.550> pull<00:03:29.760> off<00:03:29.910> there

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
yes you've got the pull off there

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.680 
yes you've got the pull off there
I<00:03:32.000> think<00:03:33.000> that's<00:03:33.150> fairly<00:03:33.570> straightforward

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
I think that's fairly straightforward

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.710 
I think that's fairly straightforward
that<00:03:34.350> on<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.620> E<00:03:34.710> chord<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.820> C<00:03:35.850> sharp<00:03:36.240> pull<00:03:36.570> off

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
that on the E chord the C sharp pull off

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:46.510 
that on the E chord the C sharp pull off
on<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.200> open<00:03:37.410> B<00:03:37.560> string<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:41.010> then<00:03:41.490> you<00:03:41.640> go

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.640 

now<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.580> problem<00:03:48.030> comes<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.900> prior<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.200> that

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
now the problem comes just prior to that

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.040 
now the problem comes just prior to that
open<00:03:49.980> D<00:03:50.160> string<00:03:50.240> because<00:03:51.240> you're<00:03:51.630> liable<00:03:51.900> to

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
open D string because you're liable to

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.880 
open D string because you're liable to
have<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.940> G<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.090> B<00:03:54.120> strings<00:03:54.270> ringing<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.380> if

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
have the G and B strings ringing and if

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.250 
have the G and B strings ringing and if
you<00:03:56.430> have<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:59.090> there<00:04:00.090> then<00:04:00.630> that<00:04:00.930> kind<00:04:01.200> of

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
you have that there then that kind of

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.050 
you have that there then that kind of
makes<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.470> G<00:04:01.680> chord<00:04:01.710> in<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.250> classes<00:04:02.700> of<00:04:02.820> what's

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
makes a G chord in the classes of what's

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.870 
makes a G chord in the classes of what's
going<00:04:03.240> on<00:04:03.420> so<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:04.200> need<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.530> mute<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:05.490> G<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:05.850> B

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
going on so you need to mute the G and B

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
going on so you need to mute the G and B
strings<00:04:06.080> as<00:04:07.080> you<00:04:07.350> play<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:08.360> open<00:04:09.360> D<00:04:09.600> and

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
strings as you play the open D and

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.480 
strings as you play the open D and
that's<00:04:10.290> what<00:04:10.560> we<00:04:10.740> call<00:04:10.890> mix<00:04:11.220> all<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
that's what we call mix all the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.420 
that's what we call mix all the
difference<00:04:11.850> makes<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.300> cleaner

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
difference makes it cleaner

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.710 
difference makes it cleaner
that's<00:04:14.430> what<00:04:14.610> Barry<00:04:14.820> didn't<00:04:15.180> need<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.390> do

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
that's what Barry didn't need to do

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.740 
that's what Barry didn't need to do
because<00:04:15.990> he<00:04:16.380> was<00:04:16.500> playing<00:04:16.739> each<00:04:17.540> cycle<00:04:18.540> of<00:04:18.630> the

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
because he was playing each cycle of the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.780 
because he was playing each cycle of the
riff<00:04:18.959> from<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.320> standing<00:04:19.770> start<00:04:19.830> at<00:04:20.610> least

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
riff from a standing start at least

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.210 
riff from a standing start at least
that's<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.870> way<00:04:21.900> we<00:04:22.110> understand<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.800> now<00:04:22.950> I

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
that's the way we understand it now I

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.510 
that's the way we understand it now I
think<00:04:23.670> it's<00:04:23.940> very<00:04:24.060> likely

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.779 

so<00:04:31.300> at<00:04:31.419> that<00:04:31.479> point<00:04:31.630> I'm<00:04:32.560> meeting<00:04:33.160> with<00:04:33.610> my

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
so at that point I'm meeting with my

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:55.839 
so at that point I'm meeting with my
middle<00:04:33.940> finger<00:04:34.389> there<00:04:34.569> these<00:04:34.840> two<00:04:34.900> strings

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.209 

okay<00:04:57.050> so<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.349> think<00:04:58.620> that's<00:04:58.979> fairly

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
okay so I think that's fairly

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:02.089 
okay so I think that's fairly
straightforward<00:05:00.439> let's<00:05:01.439> keep<00:05:01.590> it<00:05:01.740> short<00:05:01.770> a

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
straightforward let's keep it short a

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:18.570 
straightforward let's keep it short a
street<00:05:02.340> shall<00:05:02.610> we

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.639 

you
