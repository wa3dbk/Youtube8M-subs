00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
first let's look at the reasoning why do

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.610 
first let's look at the reasoning why do
we<00:00:48.000> tend<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> reason<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.780> should<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.230> doing<00:00:49.500> it

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
we tend the reason we should be doing it

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
we tend the reason we should be doing it
is<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.890> encourage<00:00:50.309> good<00:00:50.730> service<00:00:51.329> from<00:00:51.539> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it is not optional the reason you have

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.719 
it is not optional the reason you have
to<00:01:04.140> tip<00:01:04.290> though<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.280> tip<00:01:05.519> is

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
to tip though is because your tip is

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.580 
to tip though is because your tip is
factored<00:01:06.210> into<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.600> server's<00:01:06.960> wages<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.530> if

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
factored into the server's wages and if

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.870 
factored into the server's wages and if
they're<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.860> living<00:01:08.280> off<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.700> or

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
they're like living off of this or

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.490 
they're like living off of this or
something<00:01:09.240> then<00:01:09.420> you're<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.900> giving<00:01:10.200> them

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
something then you're not giving them

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.899 
something then you're not giving them
the<00:01:10.680> money<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.369> earning<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the money that they are earning and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.550 
the money that they are earning and
that's<00:01:12.180> not<00:01:12.390> fair<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.080> don't<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.380> that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
that's not fair and I don't like that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.499 
that's not fair and I don't like that
because<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.189> should<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> common<00:01:15.240> courtesy

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
because what should be a common courtesy

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.499 
because what should be a common courtesy
has<00:01:16.110> become<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.740> mandatory<00:01:17.159> courtesy<00:01:18.090> second

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
has become a mandatory courtesy second

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.690 
has become a mandatory courtesy second
is<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> process<00:01:19.290> been<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.560> determining<00:01:20.460> how

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
is the process been like determining how

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.280 
is the process been like determining how
much<00:01:21.030> you're<00:01:21.299> gonna<00:01:21.450> tip<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> sake<00:01:22.259> of

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
much you're gonna tip for the sake of

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.630

this video let's just say that the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.700 
this video let's just say that the
standard<00:01:23.909> tip<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.570> 15<00:01:25.049> percent<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> cost

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
standard tip is 15 percent of the cost

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.530 
don't have like a 50 or 60 dollar gap
between<00:02:49.890> any<00:02:50.250> two<00:02:50.489> menu<00:02:50.849> items<00:02:50.879> so<00:02:51.390> maybe

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
between any two menu items so maybe

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.150 
between any two menu items so maybe
there<00:02:51.720> should<00:02:51.870> be<00:02:51.900> ranges<00:02:52.349> of<00:02:52.470> dollar<00:02:52.650> amounts

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
there should be ranges of dollar amounts

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.759 
there should be ranges of dollar amounts
per<00:02:53.400> cost<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.180> meal<00:02:54.390> like<00:02:54.629> 0<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.109> 20<00:02:55.440> equals

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
per cost of the meal like 0 to 20 equals

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.920 
per cost of the meal like 0 to 20 equals
this<00:02:55.890> dollar<00:02:56.129> amount<00:02:56.540> 2250<00:02:57.540> equals<00:02:57.840> this

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
this dollar amount 2250 equals this

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.210 
this dollar amount 2250 equals this
dollar<00:02:58.170> amount<00:02:58.319> but<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.769> don't<00:02:58.950> know<00:02:59.010> it's

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
dollar amount but I don't know it's

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.680 
dollar amount but I don't know it's
still<00:02:59.400> basing<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.730> on<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.879> price<00:03:00.150> maybe<00:03:00.540> it

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
still basing it on the price maybe it

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.910 
still basing it on the price maybe it
should<00:03:00.780> be<00:03:00.870> based<00:03:00.989> on<00:03:01.170> how<00:03:01.349> long<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.890> are

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
should be based on how long you are

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.680 
should be based on how long you are
actually<00:03:02.220> at<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.879> restaurant<00:03:03.329> I<00:03:03.420> mean<00:03:03.569> if

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
actually at the restaurant I mean if

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.970 
actually at the restaurant I mean if
you're<00:03:03.810> there<00:03:03.959> for<00:03:04.109> two<00:03:04.290> hours<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.799> all<00:03:04.859> you

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
you're there for two hours and all you

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.649 
you're there for two hours and all you
order<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.370> an<00:03:05.459> appetizer<00:03:05.879> and<00:03:06.180> some<00:03:06.299> drinks

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
order is an appetizer and some drinks

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:07.970 
order is an appetizer and some drinks
then<00:03:06.810> you're<00:03:06.959> really<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:07.470> taking<00:03:07.620> up<00:03:07.920> a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
then you're really just taking up a

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.530 
then you're really just taking up a
table<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.459> could<00:03:08.640> be<00:03:08.849> giving<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.299> server

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
table that could be giving that server

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.819 
table that could be giving that server
more<00:03:09.840> money<00:03:10.049> maybe<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.379> should<00:03:10.500> be<00:03:10.560> based<00:03:10.680> on

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
more money maybe it should be based on

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.140 
more money maybe it should be based on
the<00:03:10.890> quality<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.459> restaurant<00:03:11.909> it<00:03:12.000> should

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
together I don't know probably not that

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.659 
together I don't know probably not that
easy<00:03:42.599> but<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.410> know<00:03:43.560> it's<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:43.919> thought<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.519> Ben

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
easy but you know it's a thought so Ben

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:45.680 
easy but you know it's a thought so Ben
my<00:03:44.790> question<00:03:45.090> for<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.269> when<00:03:45.359> everyone<00:03:45.540> else

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
my question for you when everyone else

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.349 
my question for you when everyone else
is<00:03:45.930> how<00:03:46.319> much<00:03:46.620> do<00:03:46.829> you<00:03:46.980> tip<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.549> how<00:03:48.030> do<00:03:48.090> you

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
is how much do you tip and how do you

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
think it should be determined leave it
