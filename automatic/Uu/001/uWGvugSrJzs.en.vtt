00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
straight and it's just because I was

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.859 
straight and it's just because I was
fiddling<00:01:54.609> on<00:01:54.759> this<00:01:54.999> plane<00:01:55.270> around<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.719> it

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
fiddling on this plane around and it

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.450 
fiddling on this plane around and it
happened<00:01:56.229> I<00:01:56.319> wasn't<00:01:56.530> meant<00:01:56.829> to<00:01:56.920> do<00:01:57.159> that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
happened I wasn't meant to do that

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.980 
happened I wasn't meant to do that
so<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:58.149> combed<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.810> out<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.469> me<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:01.539> results

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
so I combed it out and me the results

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.529 
so I combed it out and me the results
isn't<00:02:02.229> exactly<00:02:02.649> why<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:02.950> wanted<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.520> I've<00:02:04.149> tried

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
isn't exactly why I wanted it I've tried

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.020 
isn't exactly why I wanted it I've tried
to<00:02:04.749> kind<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.289> spray<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.740> with<00:02:06.369> water<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:06.819> I<00:02:06.999> can

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
to kind of spray it with water so I can

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.840 
to kind of spray it with water so I can
go<00:02:07.240> back<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.420> his<00:02:07.600> car

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
go back to his car

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.880 
go back to his car
that's<00:02:08.030> ironic<00:02:08.440> eventually<00:02:09.440> it's<00:02:09.560> getting

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
that's ironic eventually it's getting

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.980 
that's ironic eventually it's getting
there<00:02:10.039> so<00:02:10.250> I'll<00:02:10.369> keep<00:02:10.550> on<00:02:10.729> doing<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.030> right

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
there so I'll keep on doing that right

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.980 
there so I'll keep on doing that right
now<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.770> hair<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.190> actually<00:02:13.430> not<00:02:13.910> as<00:02:14.120> poufy<00:02:14.690> as

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
now the hair is actually not as poufy as

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.180 
now the hair is actually not as poufy as
it<00:02:15.890> perhaps<00:02:16.700> he<00:02:17.060> could<00:02:17.420> be<00:02:17.690> I've<00:02:18.200> cut<00:02:18.709> off<00:02:18.980> a

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.559 
it perhaps he could be I've cut off a
lot<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.970> mean<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.989> lot<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.670> hair<00:02:22.880> like

then I layered it this is what I

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.220 
then I layered it this is what I
achieved<00:02:31.489> when<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.300> did<00:02:32.600> wash<00:02:32.810> her<00:02:33.050> hair

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230

the hair is so soft and beautiful when I

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.509 
the hair is so soft and beautiful when I
first<00:02:44.330> opened<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.989> especially<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:46.130> was<00:02:46.280> so

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
first opened it especially it was so

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.280

soft and beautiful around my fingers

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.020 
soft and beautiful around my fingers
through<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.370> was<00:02:49.489> just<00:02:49.640> really<00:02:49.819> nice

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
through it and it was just really nice

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.090 
through it and it was just really nice
to<00:02:50.269> kind<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:50.510> go<00:02:50.720> through<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.380> then<00:02:51.620> after

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
to kind of go through and then after

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.750 
to kind of go through and then after
even<00:02:52.400> coercion<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.330> went<00:02:53.630> even<00:02:53.840> more<00:02:54.500> soft<00:02:55.400> and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
even coercion it went even more soft and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.540 
even coercion it went even more soft and
a<00:02:56.269> hair<00:02:56.540> that's<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.380> hair<00:02:57.620> obviously<00:02:57.890> even

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
a hair that's the hair obviously even

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.370 
a hair that's the hair obviously even
defined<00:02:58.970> even<00:02:59.420> more<00:02:59.569> the<00:02:59.720> curls<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.170> fight

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
defined even more the curls to fight

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.470 
defined even more the curls to fight
even<00:03:00.739> more<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.790> became<00:03:02.000> more<00:03:02.239> beautiful

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
even more so it became more beautiful

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.420 
even more so it became more beautiful
and<00:03:03.319> that<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.799> why<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.010> think<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:04.400> really

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
and that is why I think it's really

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.039
