either the vista or seven what i used to

networked<00:00:17.609> environment<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.859> access<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
networked environment and access to the

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.870 
networked environment and access to the
system<00:00:21.930> path<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.590> I've<00:00:23.070> always<00:00:23.250> set<00:00:23.519> up<00:00:23.640> batch

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
system path is I've always set up batch

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.130 
system path is I've always set up batch
files<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.980> batch<00:00:26.189> file<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:27.210> allows<00:00:27.930> me

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
files so this batch file just allows me

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.240 
files so this batch file just allows me
to<00:00:28.400> run<00:00:29.400> command<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.779> as<00:00:30.929> command<00:00:31.320> by<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
to run command it just as command by the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.010 
to run command it just as command by the
way<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.759> much<00:00:33.000> better<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.360> run<00:00:33.540> command<00:00:33.930> from

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
way it's much better to run command from

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.810 
way it's much better to run command from
the<00:00:34.200> start<00:00:34.440> menu<00:00:34.590> because<00:00:34.860> bottle<00:00:35.309> fill<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the start menu because bottle fill and

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.880 
the start menu because bottle fill and
autofill<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.600> much<00:00:36.780> more<00:00:36.930> useful<00:00:37.440> than

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
autofill is so much more useful than

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.500 
autofill is so much more useful than
this<00:00:38.250> one<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.090> good<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.390> quick

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
this one but it's good for quick

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.560 
this one but it's good for quick
checking<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:41.250> next<00:00:41.610> 1<00:00:41.790> i've<00:00:41.940> got<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
checking the next 1 i've got is the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.680 
checking the next 1 i've got is the
create<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.280> so<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.640> i<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.940> i<00:00:45.239> set<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
create one so what i do is i set the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.410 
create one so what i do is i set the
path<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.430> this<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.730> got<00:00:47.879> around<00:00:48.149> by

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
path and this can be got around by

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.709 
path and this can be got around by

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
app click run and it goes so let's have

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.649 
app click run and it goes so let's have
a<00:01:42.509> quick<00:01:42.750> look<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.659> we're

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
a quick look at this here we go we're

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.920 
a quick look at this here we go we're
going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> create<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.530> app<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.840> there's<00:01:48.840> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
going to create that app and there's a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.050 
going to create that app and there's a
throw<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.790> there's<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:51.060> made<00:01:52.820> took<00:01:53.820> forever

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
throw and there's not made took forever

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.090 
throw and there's not made took forever
to<00:01:54.509> get<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.899> going<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.770> are<00:01:55.829> lots<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
to get that going and there are lots of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.350 
to get that going and there are lots of
different<00:01:56.399> ways<00:01:56.579> your<00:01:57.240> path<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.899> be<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.350> node

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
different ways your path can be a node

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.929 
different ways your path can be a node
active<00:02:00.360> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> phonegap<00:02:01.670> j/s<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
active going to the phonegap j/s and

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.030 
active going to the phonegap j/s and
that<00:02:03.060> still<00:02:03.329> works<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:03.860> basically<00:02:04.860> that's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
that still works but basically that's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.980 
that still works but basically that's
working<00:02:05.579> now<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.969> next<00:02:06.119> thing<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.600> need<00:02:06.780> is

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
working now the next thing you need is

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.380 
working now the next thing you need is
to<00:02:07.049> build<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.920> thing<00:02:08.810> let's<00:02:10.760> put<00:02:11.760> these<00:02:12.060> two

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
to build the thing let's put these two

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.670 
to build the thing let's put these two
files

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680

entry point phonegap stuff so here's the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.670 
entry point phonegap stuff so here's the
the<00:02:23.670> build<00:02:24.150> one<00:02:24.510> let's<00:02:24.989> go<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.379> look<00:02:25.409> at

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
the build one let's go have a look at

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.289 
the build one let's go have a look at
build<00:02:26.209> build<00:02:27.209> looks<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.379> this<00:02:28.879> I<00:02:29.879> said<00:02:30.269> a

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
build build looks like this I said a

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.899 
build build looks like this I said a
Java<00:02:30.629> home<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.200> Android<00:02:31.590> home<00:02:31.950> there<00:02:32.459> in<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
Java home and Android home there in the

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.729 
Java home and Android home there in the
directory<00:02:33.389> it's<00:02:33.750> reasonably<00:02:34.139> obvious<00:02:34.500> there

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
directory it's reasonably obvious there

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.780 
directory it's reasonably obvious there
I<00:02:34.889> don't<00:02:35.489> know<00:02:35.609> this<00:02:35.790> SDK<00:02:36.510> home<00:02:37.129> is<00:02:38.129> important

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
I don't know this SDK home is important

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.089 
I don't know this SDK home is important
but<00:02:39.120> I've<00:02:39.420> got<00:02:39.689> it<00:02:39.810> there<00:02:39.930> any<00:02:40.109> way<00:02:40.230> things

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
but I've got it there any way things

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.170 
but I've got it there any way things
were<00:02:42.799> you<00:02:43.799> can<00:02:43.980> see<00:02:44.129> my<00:02:44.280> path<00:02:44.519> against<00:02:44.939> the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
were you can see my path against the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.280 
were you can see my path against the
windows<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.689> the<00:02:45.780> windows<00:02:45.810> 32<00:02:46.519> as<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:48.290> could

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
windows in the windows 32 as I could

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.390 
windows in the windows 32 as I could
have<00:02:49.409> done<00:02:49.560> percent<00:02:50.189> home<00:02:51.230> get<00:02:52.230> home<00:02:52.500> %<00:02:53.189> but

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
have done percent home get home % but

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.710 
have done percent home get home % but
I'm<00:02:53.519> just<00:02:53.760> writing<00:02:53.939> it<00:02:54.150> out<00:02:54.269> because<00:02:54.480> it's

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
I'm just writing it out because it's

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.550 
I'm just writing it out because it's
easier<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.169> copy<00:02:55.349> from<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:56.669> actual<00:02:56.790> file

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
easier to copy from the actual file

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.229 
easier to copy from the actual file
directory<00:02:58.560> i'll<00:02:58.650> show<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.829> what<00:02:58.919> i<00:02:58.980> mean<00:02:59.090> if<00:03:00.090> i

was going to the node one if I just copy

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.589 
was going to the node one if I just copy
that<00:03:03.120> control<00:03:03.510> C<00:03:04.049> then<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.609> go<00:03:05.760> back<00:03:06.150> to

with<00:03:14.370> Android<00:03:14.849> you<00:03:15.629> need<00:03:15.870> tools<00:03:16.729> right<00:03:17.729> there

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
with Android you need tools right there

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.729 
with Android you need tools right there
and<00:03:19.340> platform<00:03:20.340> tools<00:03:21.169> let's<00:03:22.169> see<00:03:22.319> what<00:03:22.409> else<00:03:22.470> I

almost<00:03:26.010> all<00:03:26.159> of<00:03:26.310> these<00:03:26.430> end<00:03:26.669> up<00:03:26.819> with<00:03:27.000> bin<00:03:27.239> and

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
almost all of these end up with bin and

into the batch files this one you never
have<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.209> change<00:04:03.769> so<00:04:04.769> it's<00:04:04.889> compiling<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.609> it

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939

have to change so it's compiling it it
will<00:04:06.239> eventually<00:04:06.680> put<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.799> into<00:04:08.189> the<00:04:08.310> platform

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
will eventually put it into the platform

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.229 
will eventually put it into the platform

which<00:04:15.629> in<00:04:15.870> some<00:04:16.079> ways<00:04:16.139> makes<00:04:16.530> things<00:04:16.769> better

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
which in some ways makes things better

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.159 
which in some ways makes things better
because<00:04:17.880> i<00:04:17.970> can<00:04:18.120> put<00:04:18.329> almost<00:04:18.570> all<00:04:18.780> this<00:04:18.959> stuff

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
because i can put almost all this stuff

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
well then we set up an home Android all

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.800 
well then we set up an home Android all
those<00:06:26.199> things<00:06:26.500> with<00:06:26.860> the<00:06:27.009> drive<00:06:27.219> letter<00:06:27.460> P
