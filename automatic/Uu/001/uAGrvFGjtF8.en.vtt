 he's really cool he passed me 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.670
 the gameplay without thinking 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.020
 finally I asked him if I could 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.090
 take a gameplay on his channel me 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.739

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.250
 chain he's really top this guy 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.899
 here we are not going to lose 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.760
 time if you are there is that the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.339
 miniature to the miniature and under 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.350
 Video that interested you thus

 way click on it and it's really 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.380
 out of the ordinary in quotation marks on my 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.090
 Youtube channel 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.130
 because here I am going to talk about a youtube 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.890
 hours today at youtube hours of 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.180
 scissor world it has 78 subscribers and the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.880
 principle of his youtube channel which 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.259
 works excellently well and that it 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.000
 makes him win a lot of subscribers what 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.619
 help guinea and all you need and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.990
 comments finally it's really 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.759
 youtuber has managed more like the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.790
 american dream on youtube what if you 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.920
 want for the French so I think 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.840
 that a lot of people here here will be 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.610
 agree with me but I wanted to react 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.439
 simply because I noticed 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.360
 that a lot of haters 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.000
 right now let loose on scissors 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.250
 in quotation marks and given the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.530
 great community that it has amazed me 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.690
 that there was no video 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.700
 support videos in quotation marks 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.290
 videos support the two videos they make 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.240
 all the opposite of the losses to say my 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.710
 scissors son he throws flowers etc etc 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.600
 it's a bit like a video that I 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.369
 going to do and knowing at the commune 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.530
 youtube's mother community 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.149
 I'm not in sucker I want to say 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.709
 from the beginning of the video as from 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.959
 apologize to pick me up mans go the 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.720
 price of like it is like this month on a 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.980
 video is because the subject 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.209
 I'm interested and the giant I want to 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.980
 studying down the balls of me 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.420
 pick up from dislike or like 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.650
 frankly I'm doing it for fun 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.239
 these implementations 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.970
 and when there is a subject that interests me 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.290
 I want to talk about people 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.450
 speak and then it's everyone 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.430
 can we do anything so here it was 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.620
 the little parenthesis I'm not in 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.700
 Swiss time so as I told you 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.670
 at the beginning of the video 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.950
 so if you are a youtuber pond who 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.300
 So very very successful since it 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.250
 a concept on his youtube channel 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.400
 he tells stories that they are 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.400
 arrived during his life so history 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.890
 true according to me seen the end the influx of the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.190
 fluidity with which he tells them 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.690
 however many people 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.030
 how to say a lot of people 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.070
 say it's not the truth etc and 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.810
 caetera and it annoys me a lot because 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.880
 that it shows that it is still visible 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.680
 that they are actors because 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.590
 someone who tells the story with 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.959
 with so much fluidity and everything finally 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.760
 so many stories it's almost 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.340
 impossible that they lie especially to his 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.600
 subscribers with its large community and 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.070
 people still have fun saying 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.010
 that these stories are wrong and that's 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.989
 to go down just because 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.720
 that these are actors as I wanted 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.130
 di Cillo very well managed so that says 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.920
 success says 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.650
 and eater and 10 pissed off how do you say 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.930
 will never be quiet 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.110
 so I just wanted to do this little 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.060
 video to defend scissors and say that 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.490
 finally I think everyone is 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.920
 with but in any case me the first because 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.870
 a lot of people a lot of people 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.890
 must break him listening a lot a lot 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:56.850
 of people frankly face to face what 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.710
 how to say scissors succeeded on 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.780
 youtube as I said from the beginning 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.880
 video 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.740
 a concept that works like this on 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.500
 youtube for me is not a lot of 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.480
 way of how to say to have market 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.430
 it does not work for us 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.260
 to have a revolutionary concept 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.970
 nowadays that's how it is 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.600
 so many people who create themselves 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.430
 youtube channels 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.310
 now there is no more origin 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.140
 originality it's just you put a 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.300
 gameplay adds pitchouns comments 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.290
 that there is tel there is so much more 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.930
 the originality that were forced 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.240
 to have a food of originality for 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.220
 to make you a name on youtube and 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.590
 scissors found this originality while 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.270
 only one who tells stories of 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.240
 stories that happened to him on 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.300
 youtube e shop click on anecdotes 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.190
 who arrived pierrel and and 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.419
 and so and I wanted to say everything 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.599
 just anyway if at worst 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.550
 in a few of celio he embroidered two 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.139
 three things that's normal late for 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.720
 grant what in quotation marks for 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.659
 connect but the main is 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.789
 that for example someone who goes on his 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.270
 pc light but he spent a dirty 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.310
 day 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.930
 he goes on the new iguana chain 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.379
 video posted a day ago dies there 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.729
 at 16 o'clock he looks at her 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:14.740
 look at both the first two 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.289
 minutes trying the introduction of the 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.990
 subject it already gives you want you give yourself 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.580
 already want to continue watching the 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.650
 video and it puts you in a good mood between 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.270
 quote finally that's what it's like to me 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.680
 done for me you can tell me in 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.539
 comments if it makes you a thing 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.240
 like that it really makes a very, very 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.610
 good effect of watching the look 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.750
 chisel in quotation marks it's really 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.879
 really really top 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.669
 in passing the gameplay will surely be a 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:41.469
 little bit accelerated just because the 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.169
 how tariff will not be as long as 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.969
 the gameplay but in any case I hope 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.710
 I honestly hope if he looks at this 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.180
 video I hope it will not hurt 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.740
 it makes me talk about him but 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.409
 frankly if you continue like that 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.539
 I encourage you gg time concept 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.909
 therefore continued until 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.820
 up to 5 million subscribers said that 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.010
 is 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:08.180
 but on this people I hope this 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:08.180
 video will have you lease to all these themes 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.450
 tha 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160
 k 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:02.569
 time 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.759
 g 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.490
 their names 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.080
 all 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.210
 but 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.650
 /
