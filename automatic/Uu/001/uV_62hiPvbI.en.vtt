00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:09.719
 falling on the lawn 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.000
 the unit ii and girls 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.030
 today I will use this palette of sephora that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.949
 has many wonderful colors anarchy 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.810
 she likes so much copper colors or 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.760
 coppery and I will make a tuxedo air 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.910
 black then to cover 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.529
 so something about the same as this 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:33.090
 we send here a little product 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:35.660
 in heaven and begins to apply in this part 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.660
 of the eyelid 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.289
 done that put all the bronze here in the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.870
 Eyelid can pick up another tone 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.320
 that is clearer and gives only one 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.020
 so lit up in the middle is there in that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.579
 prominent co 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.570
 so now I want to choose one 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.780
 little then I'm going to get a brown with 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.000
 brown and I'll try to make a 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.950
 because they do not 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.740
 have this outline right 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.270
 So we'll spend a little bit and take the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.610
 excess and will look spreading throughout 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.600
 the product of a darker color but 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.740
 still follow reed right 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.540
 Until more or less, you do not need to 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.540
 to get here not only here 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.380
 so I pick up a little more kitchen 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.189
 clear here a little bit 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.479
 and I'm going to put it here 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.610
 In this corner you know only to give a 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.679
 illuminated but not much because the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.170
 should already have the eye more 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.750
 separated from the nose so if you 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.630
 this area will highlight 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.280
 more this space between the eyes understood 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.350
 nothing is not what we want 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.770
 to make only the same light and 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.369
 carry here on the sides son 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:11.410
 're simulating a contour 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:12.549
 Look how it's already giving a way to 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.340
 People can even do this here too. 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.440
 to spain to stay one thing but 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:24.760
 uniform and to finish to give more 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:29.200
 a dark touch analysis she likes to 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.239
 rock who I am so you get one more 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.340
 little bronze and give another little play 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.989
 that since I gave a darkened nÃ© 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.790
 It's good to come back a little bronze 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.340
 to give the color detail that people 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.530
 want to highlight even this bronze is this 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.489
 Bronze trim here is there as it stands. 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.440
 pretty 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:52.420
 hence I get there asking for a black pencil to 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.549
 black light black years and I go without fear of 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.319
 no problem, no problem, the 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.959
 dark makeup even we can 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.410
 make a wider contour and and a 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.910
 stronger eyeliner 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.099
 Then you can ask my god more. 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.139
 Asian woman already has a small eye but 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.880
 Do you know how to make a right tuxedo? 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.060
 You will enlarge the eye you can. 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.799
 to thicken one in the eyeliner are the people 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.700
 after we apply a pencil of 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.560
 eye 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.870
 after the process of mixing 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.380
 of the shadows and I will apply I will apply 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.510
 a gel eyeliner and ciac da l'oreÃ©al 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.310
 and we take the excess will make a 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.750
 the finer feature is that we can not 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.959
 also make a very thick stroke that 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.830
 already made ooo thicker eyeliner 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.600
 so that's the line 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.240
 nick of eyeliner is just for branding 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:44.700
 Even what we already did side understood 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.950
 so we go here sun 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.060
 seeking to give some more cury is dinho but 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:55.080
 without is to exceed the line the line made 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.190
 by Latin and the done that now only give 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.340
 an illuminated one we always choose a color 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.350
 or more gold not so white because 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.510
 white catches more attention and with 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.350
 Girls, I'm really happy to show. 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.810
 for you 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.940
 the end result of our makeup 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.100
 Asian eyes on her like you 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.180
 can you see I did the anarchy makeup 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:22.380
 with a little copper and light brown and is 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.880
 and wonderful esata was perfect and 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.820
 to give a finishing touch I put the 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.180
 lipstick is mac chevettes reminds of that 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.130
 light tanks but not so red right 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.710
