00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.369 
there now it's on it has an 80 ounce
water<00:02:38.340> tank<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:39.060> tank<00:02:39.390> actually<00:02:39.750> will<00:02:40.110> allow

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
water tank this tank actually will allow

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
and this actually telescopes so for

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.130 
and this actually telescopes so for
