00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.059
 during the creation of the fallout new vegas we wanted 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.570
 add a diverse group 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.859
 people to interact with them 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.070
 so fraction is an important element of the game 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.970
 we didnâ€™t want all groups to be 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.390
 created by the principle of arshak good with against 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.329
 schalke bad here protest more 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.009
 sophisticated cocktail from different heroes and 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.609
 different factions tomorrow will be given full 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:29.829
 control over your own 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.880
 actions on open spaces its owner 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.190
 okay you can influence the situation 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.470
 things count but in the whole region but for 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.329
 of this you have to decide what action 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.809
 sanctions unite to find the perfect 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.530
 point of impact 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.680
 in all matters and not as always would be 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.180
 it is comfortable to live in Permian 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.410
 one and the other 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.490
 we wanted the players to experience 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.510
 real estate every time I ask myself 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.490
 what will they mean with these 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.540
 guys do i do that right 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.770
 support if you are on your own like this 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.550
 will affect other residents of the new 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.480
 departments 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.130
 secret three main factions one of them 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.329
 new california republic 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:09.149
 this is a major political 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.149
 a structure with great influence 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.590
 the region itself is so large that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.029
 can't even keep track of your 

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:17.079
 territories and faster legislation and 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.700
 of course can not protect their 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.470
 citizens 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.010
 and the creation of the border of our region is slowly 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.990
 but surely another important one 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.260
 gaming practice along with the national 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.610
 academic religious center 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.740
 if system work 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.100
 the Grand Canyon 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.970
 Father nasheed these already with anyone who 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.540
 will stand in their way mercilessly suppresses 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.130
 any arising resistance from his 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.180
 color two factions to face 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.049
 the face of norayr belluian colorado river given 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.740
 measure is important well how should 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.350
 precisely for the right of possession and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.360
 happening today which energy 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.950
 process to support your 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.390
 region and is the main reason 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.770
 the desire to capture it constantly keep 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.030
 these things are iniesta xavi with which they 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.179
 smile wins and nkr which is equivalent 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.520
 seize the whole meeting decree Yanukovych 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.500
 we have three more pillars of rubles 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.780
 main factions from ministers canvas edge 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.720
 the only thing is that there are other groups 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.200
 who are quiet insurance gang with 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.750
 royal consideration of colleagues 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.530
 coalition that every resident of the region 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.470
 Sergey Darkin may try to replace 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.319
 will break 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.920
 Let the players completely hospital in 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.650
 this world can know who is in charge 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.010
 of these factions and what ideology are they 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.329
 confess so when to decide with whom 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.590
 want to cooperate your decision will not 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.560
 based only on first impressions 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.819
 groupings if you side with 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.530
 Caesar suffered a few years 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.040
 support either tikhonov or kings exodus 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.040
 will always be spread 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:45.689
 you can also just disappeared a 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.749
 you don't know any of you i'm not 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:49.729
 I consider past builders to be worthy builders 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:51.039
 independently deal with each 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:53.749
 of you so can you become real 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.749
 the hero of the new department or loosely 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:57.609
 monarchist weight must produce 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:58.009
