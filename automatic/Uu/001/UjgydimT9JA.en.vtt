00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 watch this video being like him 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.690
 do you like this video and do you 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.910
 ten fingers 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.860
 then click on the green thumb thank you 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.240
 yo guests from a whole day to day 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.620
 good day all here and today 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.939
 I want a new facts video for you 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.500
 it's for Tuesday 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.150
 this time I have another in the background 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.400
 gameplay then normally no call 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.020
 of duty but this time titanfall gameplay 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.700
 who takes care of milan 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.740
 thank you milan for the tightvac 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.240
 gameplay and this time as I said 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.340
 again some new facts and this time get it 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.180
 I repeat them from another version of 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.190
 the quest 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.900
 just like the past few weeks and the first 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.269
 The answer is to the following question 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.309
 also albino plants yes there are 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:41.570
 know for sure and alder people albinos 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.760
 can also be sure 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.870
 albino plants and how are you doing 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.129
 exactly in his work well that is 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.600
 actually very simple 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.219
 because the green color of a plant that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.930
 is caused by leafy green granules 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.860
 and if the grains pass through a genetic 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.930
 defect 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.399
 I cannot be present in the plant 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.680
 so don't get a green color and then 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.300
 so you just stay nice and white but that 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.949
 plants are in addition to being white too 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.710
 usually smaller than the original 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.059
 plant that is completely green and me 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.369
 do not know why that is perhaps so 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.229
 the nice genetic effect that it 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.759
 Fucked or something 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.950
 but at least plants can also 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.750
 albino the next answer is on 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.459
 GPs get sick more often 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.080
 because they deal with sick people a lot 

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:20.929
 no that is not the case 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.250
 doctors are not sick more often than people 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:25.310
 with another test or so it is not 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.380
 demonstrated that this is the case and where 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.750
 if there were then that would be that 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.700
 because doctors are better at now or so 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.789
 because they treat sick patients more 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.800
 that they have such an immune system 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.729
 building that just super good is that 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.619
 you could say 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.569
 but it is also the case that is just 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.890
 very hygienic are everytime 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.200
 she's a sick patient 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.330
 have treated wash their hands care 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.190
 again that they are fresh when we are clean 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.750
 the next patient and therefore go 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.000
 they just have very little chance of it 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.770
 to be infected or to eliminate bacteria 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.599
 get their body and so and that is 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.009
 unlike other people with 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:00.459
 other professions where they are in frequent contact 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.209
 come with other people say long 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.099
 train conductors 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.649
 or for example a bus driver or 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:08.539
 for example a cashier or something 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.679
 You know those people who come to the t 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.510
 day in contact with people 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.489
 and that wasn't their hands or maybe 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.080
 unless they are very, very clean 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.060
 most people are themselves just like that 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.890
 do not do that because they are very much into it 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.330
 contact with people can do that 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.500
 therefore also be sick sooner 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.150
 again that is not all demonstrated 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.590
 not shown that doctors are less likely 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.970
 get sick it has not been shown that 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.220
 people with a different profession such as 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.900
 conductor or cashier 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.820
 get sick more often in whichever case 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.930
 therefore not demonstrated 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.880
 and then the answer to the next 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.290
 ask where does the idea come from 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.280
 that you have feelings in your heart 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.540
 would put 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.220
 that is because your feelings 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.650
 change also changes you 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.000
 heartbeat so if you are pan or angry then 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.680
 your heart will beat faster and like you 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.300
 are relaxed then goes natural 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.730
 slow beating and that is actually 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.160
 a very simple reasoning an old one 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.900
 Egyptians who thought that too 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.880
 and they thought that all the mental 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.030
 life came from the heart and not 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.950
 just the feelings but also thinking and 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.570
 really everything you did and everything you do 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.770
 and so that day really that that 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.000
 all came from your heart 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.010
 nowadays it is of course 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.120
 proven that it also comes from your brain 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.040
 way a big part of you 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.959
 feeling just goes through the heart 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.670
 Of course you can also feel through you 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.170
 brains are going to have something from them 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.820
 is that i bastard 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.380
 but if you have someone actually one 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.480
 bastard finds a state at that time 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.160
 for those it is angry for those 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.900
 then your heart will beat faster so you 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.360
 The heart certainly also has to do with it 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.860
 anyway that was yo again 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.299
 and then the next question we ask 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.250
 actually may have been so devised 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.989
 but actually very logical 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.459
 is explainable but true to some people 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.989
 just really totally not think about it but 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.940
 that is why one wears 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.500
 bus driver no belt and I have it 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.870
 about the studs bus driver so hey 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.220
 imagine just outside Amsterdam 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.380
 it takes you from just outside Amsterdam 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.519
 to the Amsterdam center of course 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.780
 with city bus 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.400
 And I'm not talking about the driver that 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.600
 hour of vacation to Dutch Spain 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.700
 for example, I am really talking about it 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.190
 the studs bus drivers just the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.750
 drivers who only drive short journeys 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.030
 why don't he wear that belt 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.950
 are not required by law to 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.660
 wear a belt and why is that 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.400
 well so that among other things to the customers 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.049
 protect people who have a 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.920
 meijerije to protect it 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.750
 namely as an example 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.150
 so a fight if someone becomes unwell 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.070
 can respond to that very quickly 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.079
 but at the same time you also give one 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.700
 piece of his own safety 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.709
 because of course if you get a collision and 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.060
 that bus driver who has no seat belt 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.460
 Well then of course I can open the window 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.200
 he can fly around and so on 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.820
 It is also with the people who are on the bus 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.950
 are of course because in the city bus 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.910
 you also have no seat belts people buses 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.590
 what I'm going with 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.300
 there are no belts in it so you can 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.190
 also not secure hold you do have 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.260
 you already know those posts in the bus 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.790
 well the and handrails of course but here 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.650
 I'm not really sure if that bus 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.750
 somehow struck up card against you 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.280
 just fly around the well and 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.170
 at the same time that is also for the 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.160
 bus driver thus raises actually 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.590
 kind of put his safety on too 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.360
 actually they are customers are the people 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.100
 those who ride with it for that faster 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.380
 to be able to stand that if they become unwell 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.820
 or as there is a fight then you can 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.830
 who help them faster but it is too 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.240
 because I can respond better to that 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.890
 unexpected situations when there 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.660
 for example someone enters that 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.250
 refuses to pay or who the 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.050
 bus driver is attacking or going 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.580
 he can quickly fall on that 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.260
 respond because once he got stuck 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.210
 sitting in his belt becomes that first 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.530
 go completely loose and that takes 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.700
 course for a while especially if you 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.870
 the jug is being attacked 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.270
 don't do it all so quickly and then you can 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.560
 those minutes people respond quickly 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.210
 but good guys this was again before 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.610
 so this week this week I had one 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.900
 number of facts from the quest and this 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.310
 once I also had titanfall 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.230
 gameplay then tumbly for gameplay 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.460
 but good guys this was man again late 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.720
 a little thumbs up behind like 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.030
 you enjoyed it say guys 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.330
 brought a look until next time 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.330
 and now is
