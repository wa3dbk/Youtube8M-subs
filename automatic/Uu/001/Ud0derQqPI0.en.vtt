details<00:01:20.119> in<00:01:20.509> there<00:01:20.719> obviously<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.859> main<00:01:22.039> part

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
details in there obviously the main part

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.459 
details in there obviously the main part
of<00:01:22.460> any<00:01:22.640> lone<00:01:22.909> druid<00:01:23.149> set<00:01:23.420> is<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.869> alternate

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
of any lone druid set is the alternate

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
form and then the bear so it's hard to

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.599 
form and then the bear so it's hard to
really<00:01:26.899> evaluate<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.409> set<00:01:27.619> based<00:01:27.920> just<00:01:28.280> on

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
from the base model but still it's

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.350 
from the base model but still it's
exciting<00:02:53.900> because<00:02:54.470> it's<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.100> only<00:02:55.190> one<00:02:55.370> all
