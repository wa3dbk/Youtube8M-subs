where the heavier threads I like to go

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.350 
where the heavier threads I like to go
through<00:00:17.090> one<00:00:17.650> hole<00:00:18.650> on<00:00:19.099> the<00:00:19.250> spool<00:00:19.520> up<00:00:19.910> on<00:00:20.119> top

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
through one hole on the spool up on top

through one hole on the spool up on top
if<00:00:21.020> you<00:00:21.170> have<00:00:21.200> a<00:00:21.320> lighter<00:00:21.560> weight<00:00:21.800> thread

if you have a lighter weight thread

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.310 
if you have a lighter weight thread
sometimes<00:00:22.520> it's<00:00:22.730> works<00:00:23.720> out<00:00:23.899> better<00:00:24.079> if<00:00:24.230> you

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
sometimes it's works out better if you

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.929 
sometimes it's works out better if you
do<00:00:24.470> go<00:00:24.619> through<00:00:24.829> to<00:00:25.340> keep<00:00:25.489> a<00:00:25.579> little<00:00:25.790> bit<00:00:25.880> of

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
do go through to keep a little bit of

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.870 
do go through to keep a little bit of
back<00:00:26.090> pressure<00:00:26.329> on<00:00:26.540> the<00:00:26.660> thread<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:28.550> it<00:00:28.700> will

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
back pressure on the thread and it will

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:41.730 
back pressure on the thread and it will
go<00:00:29.029> from<00:00:29.300> back<00:00:30.169> to<00:00:30.200> front<00:00:36.580> close<00:00:37.580> from<00:00:37.850> here

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.020 

I'll<00:00:42.740> go<00:00:42.890> from<00:00:43.070> back<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.310> front<00:00:44.740> and<00:00:45.760> all<00:00:46.760> three

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
I'll go from back to front and all three

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:55.000 
I'll go from back to front and all three
holes

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.520 

then<00:00:55.550> we<00:00:55.700> will<00:00:55.880> take<00:00:56.059> an<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:56.840> figure<00:00:57.110> thread

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
then we will take an and figure thread

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.190 
then we will take an and figure thread
and<00:00:57.649> goes<00:00:57.739> between<00:00:57.950> the<00:00:58.250> two<00:00:58.640> silver<00:00:59.630> disks

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
and goes between the two silver disks

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.930 
and goes between the two silver disks
we're<00:01:00.770> going<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:00.980> come<00:01:01.130> around<00:01:01.280> or<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:01.820> make

we're going to come around or you make

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.799 
we're going to come around or you make
like<00:01:02.090> a<00:01:02.120> mess

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
I'm going to come back through a check

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.200 
I'm going to come back through a check
spring<00:01:08.150> assembly<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.500> if<00:01:09.800> you<00:01:09.920> look<00:01:10.100> over<00:01:10.310> we

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
spring assembly and if you look over we

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.310 
spring assembly and if you look over we
can<00:01:11.750> move<00:01:12.140> it<00:01:15.460> okay<00:01:16.460> soon<00:01:16.990> you'll<00:01:17.990> see<00:01:18.140> there's

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
can move it okay soon you'll see there's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.460 
can move it okay soon you'll see there's
a<00:01:18.380> little<00:01:18.560> window<00:01:22.750> you're<00:01:23.750> tearing<00:01:24.259> there's<00:01:24.440> a
