00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.460 
we really gonna have an idea who's
playing<00:01:57.150> well<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.690> had<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.900> chance<00:01:57.930> I

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
playing well and we had the chance I

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.070 
playing well and we had the chance I
guess<00:01:59.100> when<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.520> kind<00:02:00.300> of<00:02:00.479> head<00:02:00.840> into<00:02:01.050> the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
guess when you kind of head into the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.080 
guess when you kind of head into the
playoffs<00:02:01.440> you<00:02:02.010> look<00:02:02.160> at<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.400> as<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.610> possible

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
playoffs you look at this as a possible

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.340 
playoffs you look at this as a possible
finals<00:02:03.479> preview<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.979> I'll<00:02:05.160> unnecessarily<00:02:05.760> I

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
finals preview and I'll unnecessarily I

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.389 
finals preview and I'll unnecessarily I
mean<00:02:07.350> he's<00:02:07.500> bigger<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.950> when<00:02:08.070> you<00:02:08.130> go<00:02:08.220> team

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
mean he's bigger so when you go team

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.190 
mean he's bigger so when you go team
together<00:02:08.550> Orlando<00:02:09.360> our<00:02:09.570> aim<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.840> pretty<00:02:10.020> well

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
together Orlando our aim is pretty well

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.770 
together Orlando our aim is pretty well
