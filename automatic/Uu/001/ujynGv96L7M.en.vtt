00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.910
 I just arrived from a fair 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.949
 students who had this morning in são 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.480

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.450
 to lose for 11 days tax I think the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.340
 last poster was from the chic 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.900

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 I even want to thank everyone for their support. 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.400
 You're joining in, commenting that it was 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.690

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.630
 worth I think you have enjoyed the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.730
 work, but I did not want to leave the 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.590
 car a little empty so I want to warn you 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.870
 kleber that tomorrow the team that in my 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.090
 Finally, another channel with the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.040
 kleber is a business that I 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.930
 I was very upset I do not know what 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.540
 happened when I went in to record the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.189
 next video is the kleber had no 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.619
 saved my things 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.600
 I do not know what happened, did not save it, or 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.579
 I do not know if I'm leaving or 2003 of a 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.189
 I do not know what happened 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.960
 so the one to start the series I had with 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.740
 five episodes already recorded 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.640
 I think this part with a little middle 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.619
 hard to understand 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.439
 was the following I went to record the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.950
 next episode then would blame 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.569
 who stepped on record the next episode 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.789
 I do not know if I'm in the sixth episode of 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:39.659
 cleber unucet or I do not know but I record the 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:42.780
 next episode a new né and already had 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.299
 five episodes recorded right I had 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.689
 five episodes recorded then count 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.799
 six already had until the 11th episode 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.159
 recorded 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.259
 So I went to record the 12th 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.840
 So I did not save so I'll have to 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.450
 take the five who had already made up 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.420
 exclude here from my ego from the outside 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.130
 so I have to start the series is not 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.840
 start serving all over again 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.700
 these episodes five episodes that I 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.720
 I lost then it will normally start to 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.480
 from the seventh 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:19.820
 It's just going to explain and a little less. 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:23.000
 It is not again that they are trying to give 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.430
 For you, some people do not 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.680
 They talk about me making a calendar, right? 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.310
 do not impress the titan's autonomy 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.110
 The more the person who heads, the more he is 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.030
 Thank you for giving me this idea. 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.410
 that's not local I was with a 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.730
 frequency of videos so far well 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.950
 interesting to put in the capital 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.760
 It worked, right? Some video? 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.470
 Random Gaming Could 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.230
 be five and three powers and videos of 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.750
 blue caps 2 fifa is leigo star wars sei 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.430
 there once but we bet all 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.470
 second in some guest some other 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.750
 game on Wednesday had the video of 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.340
 kleber who is from my series friday 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.950
 was passing something from the sims 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.520
 3 also some news and such or even 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.800
 even a new cleber episode is more 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.510
 this was a locality, right? 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.370
 from now on i do not know how it is 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.900
 It will be because I'm here with two series 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.850
 It's not to conclude 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.070
 I have with the idc of the book history that 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.380
 will not extend very much because when 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.640
 just show everyone there the novelty 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.799
 no, because I 'm going to continue 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.630
 showing the videos to you if you 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.580
 I wish I could continue I do not know 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.430
 still but I have the output of kleber 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.350
 also novelty 2003 and I have to use 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.299
 my capture card then it has to be 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.340
 make videos of the games I want to do 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.769
 videos from other games also brings this 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.700
 face is known in other games that the 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.440
 I do not play 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.780
 but I do not know yet I'm going to ride this 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.900
 calendar up to one just wanted to warn 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.690
 Thank you so much, there you are. 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.150
 accepting suggestions of days and is also 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.519
 I want and want to do a live 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.860
 one light a month so if you like 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.370
 of this idea of a strike a month 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.380
 so comment there it is in the comments 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.079
 Obvious and then I'll take a look there 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.540
 Do you want to do it again or not? 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.079
 fast is also going to happen the 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.820
 The sims 3 event is university life and 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.320
 the sin city event will be the same 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.110
 event here is going to be a 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.660
 then release is not yet 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.840
 physical media of these games to stores 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.639
 the official release that would be right? 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.889
 for Brazil it would be May 5 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.680
 had a delay is going to extend until the day 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.509
 March 24, I can assure you that 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.370
 This is the final day there is no way to them. 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.629
 more delay because whenever they 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.819
 mark the event 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:36.139
 they launch the game because it already has in 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:39.050
 hands then you do not have because he was 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.749
 fucking right unless it is costly in 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.300
 20 Something else to not is not 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:47.180
 put the game to sell but I will come back 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.529
 in the event will be in the bookstore is hail 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.199
 of the mall to become our 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:56.360
 The internet is young and I've been there until 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.830
 win the post here the sims 3 ps has 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.169
 other three generations 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.110
 I also think these events are cool 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.819
 are growing a lot thus the number of 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.979
 people were at the event they started 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.990
 to stop divulging and ending the events 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.969
 from the sims 3 it was the team now 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.919
 are starting to come back again until 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:15.379
 I think that Max's return made them 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.849
 then do this we will have a 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.789
 event of this mysterious university student 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.889
 If you live in São Paulo, you have to take 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.199
 picture with me is something like that 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.529
 only there as well to play but it 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:29.120
 do something else is go there if 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:30.860
 you see me not ashamed to speak 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.439
 I also do not know how people are 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.620
 But I can get to talk and hit a 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:39.409
 current photo is what I want too 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.270
 play 2003 there as well and see what they 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.810
 have good to show us in this event 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.669
 huh 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.169
 Let's see, there are lots of cool things to do. 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.689
 for the promotions that we can 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.810
 to earn until 2003 is another university 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:53.060
 kind of game there, so it's cool, you guys. 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.789
 go there and even buy it on time 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.050
 even 63 university life and the 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.060
 incite beauty 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.529
 so I guess that's what I really had 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.180
 Something to tell you today were only 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:04.550
 these three subjects to which he would have 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.930
 those of today are just doing one type of dengue 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.839
 here on the channel 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.870
 I 'm out of note is coming to almost 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:13.969

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.240
 You liked it and civilians do not forget to 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:20.270
 I liked everything and sign up if the channel is 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.189
 and there's nothing left to talk about then it's 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.419
 That's right a hug even more so 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:27.159
 obliged to provide always accompany the 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:27.159
 I went to work
