00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 In this video I show you as you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.560
 your samsung device where android on it 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.120
 runs surfaces and routes can as 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.920
 first needed the right firmware 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.620
 So the point is pretty young of one 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.269
 get the space you want to do this 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.010
 no finds on the internet writes on 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.810
 best responds in the comments and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.490
 let me know you wanted to link 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.400
 and I'll see you and write you 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.250
 then back if you have them then 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.359
 through them best at the desktop and 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.099
 reporter the downloadlink I do 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.590
 also individual description of the gives it 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.960
 on chip free download of the state 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.210
 Click with right click and as 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.120
 administrator 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.760
 Now we do not put them on pda 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.260
 by on in the form nearly so far her 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.090
 the tib must pack the clothes 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.129
 And now her motto is the point 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.539
 md5 file or sometimes zero 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.030
 points will be seen here so that yes 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.230
 is loaded 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.239
 now you have to go your device i 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.489
 go now my galaxy tab so here 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.400
 he pushes for a longer time like thousands before 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.240
 On switch and the laizer button 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.890
 hold down on the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.350
 tray or your mobile ingo stands 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:19.140
 Thus, the apartment now you have to 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.670
 on though the thumb as quiet click 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.009
 so that your next time on the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.650
 Next you see, you see if I am above 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.439
 so good has customer download and 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.790
 good or bad 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:35.400
 and here is the original again 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:39.869
 samsung for we are that's true then 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.490
 let's connect s.pc and pcs 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.670
 is here ends in the program and giggles 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.670
 begin 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.850
 that can take him a while now 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.310
 yes writes the whole system files 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.290
 on it and maybe the system by the way 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.420
 Also, what is important is you need space 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.960
 not a good team not about this 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.950
 Variation you do not need a good one 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.270
 you can do the same way 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.920
 you just have to get the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.019
 suitable route part before looking for mobile phone 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.150
 or tablet and who integrate there 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:17.180
 By the way, it is only in app for 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.739
 android the costs I believe four euro 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.090
 with that you can also on the android 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.319
 equipment with meat minutes 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.000
 but I think it's better too 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.660
 pc is matas stable and which also 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.819
 important is 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.650
 if you have an unofficial version 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.310
 on it so that's maybe 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.150
 not from samsung software this year 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.900
 update therefore it can happen 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.220
 that a guarantee is always there 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.530
 a trick how to repeat yourself 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.799
 but I do not rely on it 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.820
 that she really gets back then 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.950
 So do it only if you are with yours 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.900
 device dissatisfied since with me it is so 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.120
 that the lightning is not high because of me 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.180
 then the custom on it so now 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.290
 finished that battery level new now 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.420
 I'll see you again 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.760
 a system written on it and something 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.049
 Everything had worked out in everything now 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.370
 reset or mince stand up and ok 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.380
 a tray should now be wise 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.739
 equal to the standard animation come from 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.739
 samsung 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.840
 if he does after ten minutes 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.010
 still not boot is must 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.640
 you do what I do to you now 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.520
 I can say sometimes now 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.840
 goes up too but in many cases it does 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.690
 At least my money is three 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.850
 almost always before it is not high so 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.470
 animation not all the work 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.470
 then the cadastre and the 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.560
 allowed button pressed until 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.660
 again a menu should come this one 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.590
 menu here at least no clack 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.030
 have on it in the clothes have on it 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.310
 would have to look similar so the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:12.150
 the same dates already that you her 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.150
 can see better 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:28.290
 click here now on data factory reset 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:32.420
 just be careful with it all yours 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.420
 Data tablet on the phone are deleted 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.530
 best to you also before the sd 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.830
 card does not release that data and data 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.830
 to be deleted 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.570
 and is still locked 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:58.970
 now he could encourage women or 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:00.380
 tablet it would now be stupid or handy 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.880
 normal start on the film was the 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.500
 I have hope that you deleted 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.400
 failed and helped and hope for 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.400
 next video again
