00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.910
 welcome guys back in this episode of 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.309
 computer passion canales la boys 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.860
 i'm christian is overweight today 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.540
 we're going to compare 17 windows 8 in a 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.140
 very particular way to asd et 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.760
 in fact, we will compare systems 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.820
 operational during the installation of 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.800
 they are in everyday use 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.590
 looking at how much memory usage e 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.090
 of resources use both 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.489
 immediately begin, however, the heart felt 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.489
 bring it the performance package 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.420
 we immediately see the time differences 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.750
 behind operating systems during 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.750
 installation 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.600
 for the have a little video we will notice 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.460
 immediately that windows 8 as we could 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.940
 imagine taking less time to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.230
 installation about 30 seconds less 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.280
 I must stress that the two systems 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.920
 operational have been installed 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.170
 d'appennino but sb much faster 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.150
 then a CD player just 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.590
 installed let's immediately compare 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.360
 8 of information 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.100
 whereas windows 7 then suits 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.870
 sat smith of the size of a 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.120
 the two operating systems are 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.680
 almost similar therefore require 20gb 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.790
 of space 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.280
 a bit different for what 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.320
 regards the ram windows 7 indeed occupies 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.229
 300 mega less than windows 8 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.910
 for now let's proceed with the first one 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.390
 start to see which one is more 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.160
 fast 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.060
 whereas they are not installed in the 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.060
 drivers in updates 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.910
 returned to their respective windows 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.740
 we install the various updates 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.440
 requests that will have dimensions 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.940
 different for the two operating systems 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.010
 together with them we also install driders 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.240
 which are the same for both before 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.890
 proceed a new arrival 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.110
 let's see how much space it occupies or i 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.550
 adjustments to drivers they have a 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.910
 considerable impact on the hard disk 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.920
 as they occupy about 14 gb of space 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.630
 we must however remember that the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.900
 size to enter to do like 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.730
 of hardware that mount windows 7 accuses 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.440
 installed updates using 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.480
 about three seconds more than the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.480
 first reboot windows 8 does not make a turn 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.260
 now we verify and explain a myth that 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.840
 runs on the net and knew that windows 8 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.250
 bloated benchmark scores by looking at the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.380
 our results made happy i 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.540
 matrimia 13 and the method benchmark a 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.640
 slight we can say that windows 8 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.530
 is optimized for amd or processors 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.780
 however with multi core technology 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.730
 different speech regarding 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.590
 windows seven that for optimized 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.470
 just download and install two 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.970
 daily present in the network using that 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.310
 the network is increasingly frequent 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.690
 presence of laptops with 4gb of ram e 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.430
 windows 8 installed 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.050
 we wanted to verify ourselves 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.230
 how many differences there were between the two 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.980
 operating systems with four yes has it 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.770
 removed a bank of ram 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.330
 we proceeded to turn on the pc from 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.610
 time taken we can note that 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.740
 windows 8 takes longer to start up 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.020
 when about 4 available e 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.410
 windows 7 in this time that does not make one 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.660
 fold 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.280
 using the same start time either 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.060
 having some copper site having it 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.780
 8 with 46 ram and 2 occupy from 700 to 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.670
 800 meters of likes services you liked 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.110
 leave a nice like and write in 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.060
 comments almost operating system for 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:27.260
 happy and leave a comment not on 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:28.490
 faces of the dough of diano if the video 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.330
 you liked it and leave a nice like it 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.860
 and write to you and after a while stevens and if the 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.690
 video you liked leave me a nice one 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.090
 like and write in the comments almost 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.440
 we are creative a favorite joke a 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.440
 see you all at the video spot
