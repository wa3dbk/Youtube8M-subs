00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.070
 I entered a completely different landscape the daylight had trouble the dense Waldachim (?!) 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.820
 to penetrate this forest I discovered an old ruin here 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.500
 undoubtedly one of MÃ¶bius' time-current spaces, 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.220
 but sealed since time immemorial and left to the all-consuming swamp 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.440
 At this point, I still could not break this seal 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.980
 but I was sure that one day I would succeed 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.700
 and so was my lurking observer unmasking the essence vanished when it realized that 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.199
 it had been discovered but I caught a glimpse 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.700
 and his features were striking enough it was the vampire Vorador 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.940
 the horrible murderer whose picture was seen in the fortress 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.600
 strangely a creature unabashed enough around the circle altogether 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.920
 attacking alone did not dare to oppose me 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.530
 Well, if Vorador did not want to come to me, then 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.780
 I would just go to him but first there were ways and means 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.960
 find to reach this terrace 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.880
 there seemed to be a passage that led north into the mountains 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.609
 however, the access was blocked and was in unreachable height for me 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.029
 Maybe later on I would find a way to get around these obstacles 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.959
 my creeping friend was nowhere to be seen 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.939
 but I found these ruins anyway much more interesting these mysterious symbols I already had 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.390
 Seen in the room below the pillars and I realized that this sanctuary 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.439
 was sealed and only the carrier of the Reaver (= robber) 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.279
 it could open
