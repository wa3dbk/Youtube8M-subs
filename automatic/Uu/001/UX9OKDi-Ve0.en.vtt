00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.529
 last year after 60 difficult minutes the Coupe de France is the 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.529
 champagne found the direction of the hÃ©rault among the romans for iraq 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.529
 but for us the four-lane roads players and staff members 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:25.480
 technical 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.609
 it will remain forever images 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.609
 superb head of this epic 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.550
 if the sporting side did not meet all expectations the human adventure 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.550
 taller 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.170
 at a time when the cinema awarded the cane palms to coubertin 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.890
 Dunkirk supporters swept up every half 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.510
 the last skeptics become convinced the best public of France 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.510
 is well established at the port of the North Sea 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.390
 a few seconds after the victory against paris saint germain en 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.020
 semifinal the public get organized 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.580
 three days after ten goals and many private cars 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.260
 take the direction of paris 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.030
 to send to the sound of fifes and drums the room pierre de coubertin 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.500
 an hour and a half before the meeting the dacquois take place and while 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.160
 the sixty Montpellier fans recover from this massive displacement 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.520
 the voices are warming up 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.090
 when arriving on the floor 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.090
 even the Dunkerque players are surprised 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.149
 the oldest dunkerquois 32 9 can hardly hide his emotion 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.769
 at the warm-up of the players the musicians and the chorus of the supporters 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.189
 who are already in their match 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.209
 so on the floor said he can not choose his side 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.569
 in the bleachers the domination was dead 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.060
 at the presentation coubertin teams ignites the flags or 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.589
 maritime brings a breath of encouragement 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:33.789
 but the carnival 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:35.559
 we are at his umpteenth check 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.680
 the Maritimes are struggling to get into the game the blame the opposing goalkeeper 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:39.699
 High-de-seine 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.699
 he opposes all the novel attempts the first five minutes 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.449
 national supremacy and what is 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.459
 since montpellier leads the ball but the maritime can be at the 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.709
 height of their defeatist public at the break the gap is two goals it is 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.329
 support takes the opportunity to blow a little 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.299
 second period the Maritimes come back in the part that 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.179
 manage to equalize to 12 12 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.349
 but he can not take the reins montpellier accelerates and a 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.699
 new gap is widening 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:09.189
 almost definitive gap despite a last baroud d'honneur populi sign 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.019
 his second consecutive double 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.019
 and the players of such a program 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.809
 the audience was impeccable and consoles through his songs the 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:19.029
 players of such a project 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:23.289
 after being ecstatic about the game produced aubertin is ecstatic in front of the nine 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:26.539
 final sung by more than 600 keur baka 3 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.539
 the thrills invade the room 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.689
 so what 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.689
 here 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:07.179
 but valls 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:29.950
 defeated on the ground 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.289
 the dunkerquois challenged the hearts of valuable people by his son 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:34.919
 each had seven children 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.919
 had shown his love for the club 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.669
 the return to dakar was therefore without trophy 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.180
 but with huge national recognition
