00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
definitely do its job amazingly well you

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.800 
definitely do its job amazingly well you
have<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.250> most<00:01:17.640> close<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> penalty

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
have to be at most close to the penalty

box line around the line outside or
inside<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.110> box<00:01:22.320> as<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.100> shows<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.640> screen<00:01:23.850> now

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
inside the box as it shows on screen now

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.649 
inside the box as it shows on screen now
because<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> low<00:01:26.070> power<00:01:26.340> cross<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.090> it

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
because this is a low power cross and it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.560 
because this is a low power cross and it
works<00:01:28.020> from<00:01:28.710> short<00:01:29.100> distance<00:01:29.700> only<00:01:30.090> once

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
works from short distance only once

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
works from short distance only once
again<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.560> tap<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> lap<00:01:32.189> path

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
again you have to tap the lap path

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.210 
again you have to tap the lap path
