a<00:01:31.180> green<00:01:31.450> pokeball<00:01:32.050> could<00:01:32.380> possibly<00:01:32.950> be<00:01:33.220> and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
a green pokeball could possibly be and

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.249 
a green pokeball could possibly be and
another<00:01:33.790> big<00:01:34.119> reason<00:01:34.330> why<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.810> green

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.850 
from the Safari Zone linking the green
ball<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.610> a<00:02:00.820> Safari<00:02:01.360> ball<00:02:01.659> so<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.409> mystery<00:02:02.740> is

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
ball to a Safari ball so the mystery is

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.710 
ball to a Safari ball so the mystery is
all<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.310> we<00:02:03.400> finally<00:02:03.850> have<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.299> definitive

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
all and we finally have a definitive

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.630 
all and we finally have a definitive
answer<00:02:05.110> there's<00:02:05.560> just<00:02:05.830> one<00:02:06.040> problem

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
answer there's just one problem

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.570 
answer there's just one problem
Onix<00:02:07.330> was<00:02:07.840> in<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.320> random<00:02:08.799> trainers<00:02:09.250> green

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
Onix was in the random trainers green

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.580 
Onix was in the random trainers green
ball<00:02:09.820> and<00:02:10.090> Onix<00:02:10.540> cannot<00:02:10.929> be<00:02:11.110> caught<00:02:11.320> in<00:02:11.470> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
ball and Onix cannot be caught in the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.740 
ball and Onix cannot be caught in the
Safari<00:02:11.950> Zone<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.370> Gen<00:02:12.549> 1<00:02:12.730> so<00:02:13.090> this<00:02:13.269> leaves<00:02:13.480> me

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
Safari Zone in Gen 1 so this leaves me

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.420 
Safari Zone in Gen 1 so this leaves me
wondering<00:02:14.080> since<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.769> animators

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
wondering since the animators

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.400 
wondering since the animators
deliberately<00:02:15.970> knew<00:02:16.540> what<00:02:16.989> they<00:02:17.170> were<00:02:17.230> doing

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
deliberately knew what they were doing

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.070 
deliberately knew what they were doing
could<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.340> possibly<00:02:18.610> be<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.660> Safari

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
could it possibly be that the Safari

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.560 
could it possibly be that the Safari
Zone<00:02:20.350> was<00:02:20.620> going<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.070> be<00:02:21.190> something<00:02:21.640> more

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
Zone was going to be something more

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.569 
Zone was going to be something more
maybe<00:02:22.840> caves<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.590> mountains<00:02:24.010> do<00:02:24.250> it's

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
maybe caves and mountains do it's

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.220 
maybe caves and mountains do it's
interesting<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.420> think<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> Safari

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
interesting to think that the Safari

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.229 
interesting to think that the Safari
Zone<00:02:26.470> could<00:02:26.739> have<00:02:26.860> been<00:02:27.040> more<00:02:27.579> than<00:02:27.910> what<00:02:28.120> it

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
Zone could have been more than what it

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.150 
Zone could have been more than what it
was<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.690> honestly<00:02:29.320> would<00:02:29.709> have<00:02:29.829> appreciated

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
was I honestly would have appreciated

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.699 
was I honestly would have appreciated
more<00:02:30.850> obscure<00:02:31.239> Pokemon<00:02:31.780> there<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.380> later

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
more obscure Pokemon there and in later

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.920 
more obscure Pokemon there and in later
entries<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.400> Safari<00:02:33.790> Zone<00:02:34.060> did<00:02:34.480> become<00:02:34.900> a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
entries the Safari Zone did become a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.080 
entries the Safari Zone did become a
place<00:02:35.290> with<00:02:35.500> multiple<00:02:35.950> location<00:02:36.430> types<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:36.910> it

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
place with multiple location types in it

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.850 
place with multiple location types in it
so<00:02:37.239> it's<00:02:37.390> not<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:37.810> far-fetched<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.470> think<00:02:38.500> that

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
so it's not so far-fetched to think that

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.370 
so it's not so far-fetched to think that
that<00:02:39.040> wasn't<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.940> original<00:02:40.120> concept<00:02:41.019> let<00:02:41.260> me

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
that wasn't the original concept let me

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.660 
that wasn't the original concept let me

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
short episode I still feel that it was

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.180 
short episode I still feel that it was
