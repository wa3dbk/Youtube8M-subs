00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.899 

in<00:00:00.210> the<00:00:01.079> previous<00:00:01.530> video<00:00:01.860> we<00:00:02.220> took<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.550> look<00:00:02.760> at

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
in the previous video we took a look at

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.880 
in the previous video we took a look at
how<00:00:03.179> you<00:00:03.240> can<00:00:03.629> use<00:00:03.810> pikes<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.319> second<00:00:04.740> line

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
how you can use pikes a second line

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.030 
how you can use pikes a second line
infantry<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:06.029> rush<00:00:06.270> them<00:00:06.540> in<00:00:06.720> against<00:00:07.560> enemy

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
infantry to rush them in against enemy

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.070 
infantry to rush them in against enemy
melee<00:00:08.220> troops<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:09.090> problem<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.750> against

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
melee troops the problem is that against

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.870 
melee troops the problem is that against
mid<00:00:10.290> tier<00:00:10.500> infantry<00:00:10.980> it's<00:00:11.190> not<00:00:11.519> really

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
mid tier infantry it's not really

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.959 
mid tier infantry it's not really
cost-effective<00:00:12.630> because<00:00:12.750> you're<00:00:13.080> using

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
cost-effective because you're using

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.460 
cost-effective because you're using
units<00:00:14.969> worth<00:00:15.210> far<00:00:15.599> more<00:00:15.630> than<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.139> unit

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
units worth far more than the unit

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.710 
units worth far more than the unit
you're<00:00:16.590> defeating<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.970> order<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.420> defeat<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
you're defeating in order to defeat the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.140 
you're defeating in order to defeat the
units<00:00:19.160> still<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.490> make<00:00:20.760> do

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
units still you have to make do

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.609 
units still you have to make do
something<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:21.900> learning<00:00:22.260> faction

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
something with that learning faction

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.560 
something with that learning faction
against<00:00:22.949> very<00:00:23.189> strong<00:00:23.460> barbarian<00:00:23.939> swords<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
against very strong barbarian swords and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.870 
against very strong barbarian swords and
no<00:00:25.080> unit<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.590> stronger<00:00:26.070> than<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.460> earth<00:00:26.580> sword

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
no unit is stronger than the earth sword

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.580 
no unit is stronger than the earth sword
so<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.570> we're<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.960> do<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.349> we're

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
so what we're going to do here so we're

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.290 
so what we're going to do here so we're
going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.800> try<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> use<00:00:29.340> pikes<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.000> thorax

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
going to try to use pikes and thorax

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.630 
going to try to use pikes and thorax
swords<00:00:30.630> together<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:32.640> defeat<00:00:33.000> Osan<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.640> now

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
swords together to defeat Osan and now

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.880 
swords together to defeat Osan and now
this<00:00:35.969> engagement<00:00:36.390> starts<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.260> become<00:00:37.410> cost

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
this engagement starts to become cost

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.310 
this engagement starts to become cost
effective<00:00:38.430> because<00:00:39.090> these<00:00:39.450> units<00:00:39.870> combined

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
effective because these units combined

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.709 
effective because these units combined
cost<00:00:40.680> less<00:00:41.129> than<00:00:41.610> they<00:00:41.790> lead<00:00:41.969> sword<00:00:42.270> unit<00:00:42.570> this

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
cost less than they lead sword unit this

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.840 
cost less than they lead sword unit this
will<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.290> limited<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.770> elites<00:00:44.280> or<00:00:44.430> units

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.639 

because<00:00:47.850> well<00:00:48.600> against<00:00:48.960> me<00:00:49.079> tears<00:00:49.320> them

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
because well against me tears them

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.160 
because well against me tears them
you're<00:00:50.039> using<00:00:50.449> more<00:00:51.449> than<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> unit's<00:00:52.050> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you're using more than the unit's is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.110 
you're using more than the unit's is
worth<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.710> kill<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> unit<00:00:53.280> you're<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
worth to kill the unit you're going to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.369 
worth to kill the unit you're going to
be<00:00:54.210> able<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.390> kill<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> units<00:00:54.960> convincingly

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
be able to kill the units convincingly

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.760 
be able to kill the units convincingly
but<00:00:55.489> it's<00:00:56.489> still<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.420> great<00:00:57.780> engagement

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
but it's still not a great engagement

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.510 
but it's still not a great engagement
this<00:00:59.280> however<00:00:59.489> starts<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:01.309> cost<00:01:02.309> effective

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
this however starts to be cost effective

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.070 
this however starts to be cost effective
because<00:01:02.910> these<00:01:03.030> units<00:01:03.270> cost<00:01:03.600> less<00:01:03.840> than<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
because these units cost less than the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.380 
because these units cost less than the
other<00:01:04.589> units<00:01:04.949> combined<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.850> what<00:01:06.270> you're

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
other units combined so what you're

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.399 
other units combined so what you're
going<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.900> you're<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.229> give

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
going to do is you're going to give

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.380 
going to do is you're going to give
attack<00:01:07.680> orders<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> pikes<00:01:08.700> outside<00:01:09.270> of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
attack orders with the pikes outside of

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.450 
attack orders with the pikes outside of
phalanx<00:01:09.750> you're<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> hit<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> phalanx

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
phalanx you're going to hit the phalanx

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.929 
phalanx you're going to hit the phalanx
once<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.119> engaged<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.580> that's<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.850> to

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
once you are engaged and that's going to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.020 
once you are engaged and that's going to
allow<00:01:15.210> two<00:01:16.170> things<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.560> happen<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.460> Pikes<00:01:17.759> are

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
allow two things to happen the Pikes are

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.300 
allow two things to happen the Pikes are
going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.390> start<00:01:18.689> pushing<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> old<00:01:19.650> zone<00:01:19.950> away

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
going to start pushing the old zone away

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.690 
going to start pushing the old zone away
from<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.759> thorax<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:22.259> thorax<00:01:22.650> will<00:01:23.250> protect

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
from the thorax the thorax will protect

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.870 
from the thorax the thorax will protect
the<00:01:23.880> Pikes<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.420> getting<00:01:24.720> attacked<00:01:25.880> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the Pikes from getting attacked the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.789 
the Pikes from getting attacked the
thorax<00:01:27.360> are<00:01:27.540> much<00:01:27.720> tankier<00:01:28.259> than<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.619> pike

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
thorax are much tankier than the pike

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.850 
thorax are much tankier than the pike
units<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.780> Pikes<00:01:31.020> are<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.590> start

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
units and the Pikes are going to start

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.090 
units and the Pikes are going to start
getting<00:01:32.220> kills<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.090> old<00:01:33.509> zone<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.710> this

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
getting kills on the old zone so this

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.710 
getting kills on the old zone so this
combination<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.729> units<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.360> effective

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
combination of units can be effective

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.960 
combination of units can be effective
against<00:01:36.960> elites<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.979> elites<00:01:38.220> were<00:01:38.700> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
against elites if the elites were to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.819 
against elites if the elites were to
pull<00:01:39.210> back<00:01:39.420> now<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.259> activate<00:01:40.590> shield

pull back now you can activate shield

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.260 
pull back now you can activate shield

thorax swords but a fairly convincing

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.460
