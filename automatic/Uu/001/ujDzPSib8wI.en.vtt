00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
not it perhaps some of us feel this need

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.740

or drive more than others but love and
romantic<00:04:28.020> love<00:04:28.350> is<00:04:28.790> fundamental<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.940> who<00:04:30.090> we

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
romantic love is fundamental to who we

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.660 
romantic love is fundamental to who we
are<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:30.750> yeah<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:31.740> think<00:04:31.830> it's<00:04:32.040> a<00:04:32.130> huge<00:04:32.370> part<00:04:32.550> of

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
are so yeah I think it's a huge part of

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.060 
are so yeah I think it's a huge part of
story<00:04:32.880> this<00:04:33.480> felt<00:04:34.020> like<00:04:34.170> an<00:04:34.290> experiment<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.980> me

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
story this felt like an experiment to me

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.040 
story this felt like an experiment to me
because<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.370> already<00:04:35.580> had<00:04:36.030> another<00:04:36.480> book<00:04:36.720> idea

because I already had another book idea
plotted<00:04:37.650> an<00:04:37.860> adult<00:04:38.370> book<00:04:38.550> and<00:04:39.030> my<00:04:39.240> agent

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
plotted an adult book and my agent

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.640 
plotted an adult book and my agent
really<00:04:39.750> really<00:04:40.020> wanted<00:04:40.230> me<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.320> write<00:04:40.470> that

like books are the greatest gift I had
because<00:05:24.479> they<00:05:24.630> were<00:05:24.660> so<00:05:24.930> inexpensive

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
because they were so inexpensive

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.390 
because they were so inexpensive
practically<00:05:26.130> free<00:05:26.930> and<00:05:28.070> you<00:05:29.070> know<00:05:29.160> I<00:05:29.220> could

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
getting lost in a book which I think is

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.310 
getting lost in a book which I think is
maybe<00:05:33.060> makes<00:05:33.360> me<00:05:33.510> a<00:05:33.540> good<00:05:33.690> writer<00:05:33.870> because<00:05:34.080> it

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
maybe makes me a good writer because it

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.380 
maybe makes me a good writer because it
I<00:05:34.500> can<00:05:34.740> just<00:05:34.919> disappear<00:05:35.160> those<00:05:35.970> years<00:05:36.210> were

I can just disappear those years were

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.360 
I can just disappear those years were
about<00:05:36.419> disappearing<00:05:37.140> and<00:05:37.560> going<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.280> a<00:05:38.340> place

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
about disappearing and going to a place

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.420 
about disappearing and going to a place
where<00:05:38.790> I<00:05:38.820> could<00:05:39.030> just<00:05:39.800> be<00:05:40.800> myself<00:05:40.979> and<00:05:41.280> no<00:05:41.400> one

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
those are the first writers who I had

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.130 
those are the first writers who I had
read<00:06:01.740> who<00:06:02.729> approached<00:06:03.090> language<00:06:03.570> as<00:06:03.750> kind<00:06:04.110> of

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
read who approached language as kind of

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.420 
read who approached language as kind of
a<00:06:04.229> game<00:06:04.440> so<00:06:05.250> if<00:06:05.550> you<00:06:05.700> read<00:06:07.130> Tom<00:06:08.130> Robbins

a game so if you read Tom Robbins

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.520 
a game so if you read Tom Robbins
especially<00:06:09.030> I'm<00:06:09.780> always<00:06:09.960> afraid<00:06:10.200> that<00:06:10.320> what

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
especially I'm always afraid that what

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.140 
especially I'm always afraid that what
I'm<00:06:10.620> saying<00:06:10.770> and<00:06:10.919> I'm<00:06:11.010> saying<00:06:11.220> Tim<00:06:11.820> Robbins

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
I'm saying and I'm saying Tim Robbins

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.480 
I'm saying and I'm saying Tim Robbins
and<00:06:12.330> then<00:06:12.960> I<00:06:13.050> then<00:06:13.410> I<00:06:13.560> lose<00:06:13.770> which<00:06:14.099> one<00:06:14.340> is

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
and then I then I lose which one is

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.720 
and then I then I lose which one is
right<00:06:14.700> better<00:06:15.000> that<00:06:15.180> than<00:06:15.270> Harold

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
right better that than Harold

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.820 
right better that than Harold
yeah<00:06:16.210> probably<00:06:16.780> off<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.260> deep<00:06:17.410> end<00:06:17.530> and<00:06:17.740> I'm

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
yeah probably off the deep end and I'm

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.080 
yeah probably off the deep end and I'm
telling<00:06:18.130> you<00:06:18.160> one<00:06:18.280> of<00:06:18.370> my<00:06:18.430> favorite<00:06:18.700> office<00:06:18.940> as

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.700 
telling you one of my favorite office as
an<00:06:19.180> author<00:06:19.300> who's<00:06:19.570> not<00:06:19.750> even<00:06:19.990> like<00:06:20.140> that's<00:06:20.410> not

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
an author who's not even like that's not

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.190 
an author who's not even like that's not
even<00:06:20.890> his<00:06:20.980> name<00:06:21.070> but<00:06:21.490> he<00:06:22.390> plays<00:06:22.720> with<00:06:22.960> words

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
even his name but he plays with words

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.140 
even his name but he plays with words
and<00:06:23.410> with<00:06:23.500> metaphors<00:06:23.920> in<00:06:24.100> a<00:06:24.160> way<00:06:24.250> that<00:06:24.430> he's

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
and with metaphors in a way that he's

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.720 
and with metaphors in a way that he's
very<00:06:25.360> into<00:06:25.570> self-indulgent<00:06:26.250> in<00:06:27.250> a<00:06:27.370> way<00:06:27.520> that

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
very into self-indulgent in a way that

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.930 
very into self-indulgent in a way that
really<00:06:28.030> I<00:06:28.510> fell<00:06:29.170> in<00:06:29.320> love<00:06:29.590> with<00:06:29.740> and<00:06:30.010> also<00:06:30.910> I

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
really I fell in love with and also I

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.840 
really I fell in love with and also I
read<00:06:31.420> Lewis<00:06:31.870> Carroll<00:06:32.260> like<00:06:32.530> an<00:06:33.340> excessive

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
read Lewis Carroll like an excessive

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.250 
read Lewis Carroll like an excessive
amount<00:06:33.910> of<00:06:34.090> Lewis<00:06:34.270> Carroll<00:06:34.510> so<00:06:34.930> those<00:06:35.080> were

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
amount of Lewis Carroll so those were

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.690 
amount of Lewis Carroll so those were
the<00:06:35.350> years<00:06:35.380> right<00:06:35.680> I<00:06:35.890> think<00:06:35.950> I<00:06:36.160> found<00:06:36.370> out<00:06:36.580> like

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
the years right I think I found out like

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.960 
the years right I think I found out like
Oh<00:06:36.960> writing<00:06:37.960> isn't<00:06:38.230> just<00:06:38.380> storytelling<00:06:39.100> but

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
Oh writing isn't just storytelling but

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.750 
Oh writing isn't just storytelling but
there's<00:06:40.300> also<00:06:40.570> writing<00:06:41.140> as<00:06:41.350> play<00:06:41.890> and<00:06:42.250> as<00:06:42.370> art

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
there's also writing as play and as art

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.690 
there's also writing as play and as art
and<00:06:43.270> as<00:06:43.420> like<00:06:43.720> words<00:06:44.440> and<00:06:44.770> sounds<00:06:45.400> I<00:06:45.490> really

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
and as like words and sounds I really

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.460 
and as like words and sounds I really
got<00:06:45.820> into<00:06:46.090> nonsense<00:06:46.690> writing<00:06:47.080> which<00:06:47.200> Lewis

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
got into nonsense writing which Lewis

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.230 
got into nonsense writing which Lewis
Carroll<00:06:47.740> does<00:06:47.980> and<00:06:48.160> the<00:06:48.220> idea<00:06:48.460> that<00:06:48.670> you<00:06:49.060> can

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
Carroll does and the idea that you can

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.440 
Carroll does and the idea that you can
convey<00:06:49.540> meaning<00:06:49.930> just<00:06:50.560> with<00:06:50.710> sounds<00:06:51.450> and

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:52.450 
convey meaning just with sounds and

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.950 
convey meaning just with sounds and
context<00:06:53.080> so<00:06:53.710> that<00:06:54.450> was<00:06:55.450> really<00:06:55.840> really

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
context so that was really really

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.420 
context so that was really really
important<00:06:56.410> to<00:06:56.470> me<00:06:56.560> because<00:06:56.590> I<00:06:56.890> that's<00:06:57.190> when<00:06:57.400> I

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
important to me because I that's when I

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.130 
important to me because I that's when I
kind<00:06:57.940> of<00:06:57.970> became<00:06:58.120> a<00:06:58.390> writer<00:06:58.660> because<00:06:58.870> it

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.140 
kind of became a writer because it

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.870 
kind of became a writer because it
seemed<00:06:59.560> like<00:06:59.620> it<00:06:59.800> wasn't<00:06:59.950> just<00:07:00.220> about<00:07:00.370> getting

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
seemed like it wasn't just about getting

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.480 
seemed like it wasn't just about getting
to<00:07:00.970> the<00:07:01.000> point<00:07:01.270> but<00:07:02.050> about<00:07:02.230> having<00:07:03.130> fun<00:07:03.310> with

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
to the point but about having fun with

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.910 
to the point but about having fun with
the<00:07:03.610> language
