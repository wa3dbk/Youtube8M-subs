think there was a gun store here or

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.100 
think there was a gun store here or
maybe<00:01:11.159> there<00:01:11.369> was<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.450> don't<00:01:12.900> remember

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930

no that's a bookstore in the middle it's
a<00:01:21.659> bit<00:01:21.810> different

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
a bit different

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.859 
a bit different
before<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.890> had<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.580> skyscrapers<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
before we had little skyscrapers and a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.230 
before we had little skyscrapers and a
construction<00:01:25.619> area<00:01:25.950> down<00:01:26.280> there<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.670> now<00:01:27.180> we

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
construction area down there and now we

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.149 
construction area down there and now we
still<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.840> construction<00:01:28.380> area<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.950> just

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
still have a construction area it's just

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.830 
still have a construction area it's just
toned<00:01:29.430> down<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.180> three<00:01:30.540> little

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
toned down and we have three little

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.990 
toned down and we have three little
residential<00:01:31.500> buildings<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.400> actually

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
residential buildings in here I actually

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.690 
residential buildings in here I actually
think<00:01:33.360> toning<00:01:33.810> down<00:01:33.990> Stratford<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> pretty

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
think toning down Stratford is a pretty

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.490 
think toning down Stratford is a pretty
good<00:01:35.939> thing<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.290> military

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
good thing because we have the military

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.670 
good thing because we have the military
base<00:01:38.180> just<00:01:39.180> over<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.600> hill<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
base just over this hill and so the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.210 
base just over this hill and so the
military<00:01:40.829> base<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.579> hot<00:01:42.060> spot<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.659> PvP<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:44.040> in

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
military base is a hot spot in PvP or in

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.649 
military base is a hot spot in PvP or in
any<00:01:44.369> sort<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.700> unturned<00:01:45.060> server<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.630> that

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
any sort of unturned server for that

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.139 
any sort of unturned server for that
matter<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.920> also<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.430> major<00:01:47.790> city

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
matter and to have also a major city

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.450 
matter and to have also a major city
right<00:01:48.600> next<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.380> military<00:01:49.770> base<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.159> just

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
right next to the military base it just

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.690 
right next to the military base it just
makes<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.909> whole<00:01:51.180> north<00:01:51.570> area<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.259> PA<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:53.280> lot

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
makes this whole north area of PA a lot

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.660 
makes this whole north area of PA a lot
more<00:01:54.119> dense<00:01:54.869> with<00:01:55.439> players<00:01:55.770> than<00:01:56.250> down<00:01:56.640> here

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
more dense with players than down here

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.810 
more dense with players than down here
so<00:01:57.420> by<00:01:57.540> making<00:01:57.719> Stratford<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:59.250> as<00:01:59.490> big

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
so by making Stratford just not as big

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.459 
so by making Stratford just not as big
of<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.030> city<00:02:00.240> or<00:02:00.420> as<00:02:00.540> major<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.049> city

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.770 
of a city or as major of a city

it helps redistribute people across the

it helps redistribute people across the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
much everything is the same here it's

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.760

is<00:02:42.190> scorpion<00:02:42.760> seven<00:02:43.150> with<00:02:43.300> no<00:02:43.480> road<00:02:43.750> leading

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
is scorpion seven with no road leading

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.800 
is scorpion seven with no road leading
to<00:02:44.349> it<00:02:44.500> it's<00:02:44.890> just<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.430> super-secret<00:02:46.269> facility

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
to it it's just a super-secret facility

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.630 
to it it's just a super-secret facility
the<00:02:47.170> only<00:02:47.380> real<00:02:47.560> difference<00:02:47.739> here<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.370> it

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
the only real difference here is that it

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.460 
the only real difference here is that it
no<00:02:48.760> longer<00:02:48.790> has<00:02:49.300> an<00:02:49.450> entrance<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.410> mean

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
no longer has an entrance to it I mean

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.160 
no longer has an entrance to it I mean
well<00:02:51.130> maybe<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.489> does<00:02:51.670> but<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:52.750> doesn't<00:02:52.989> have<00:02:53.140> a

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
well maybe it does but it doesn't have a

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.410 
well maybe it does but it doesn't have a
proper<00:02:53.530> Road<00:02:53.920> entrance<00:02:54.400> with<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.670> sign<00:02:54.970> saying

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
proper Road entrance with a sign saying

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.930 
proper Road entrance with a sign saying
scorpion<00:02:55.930> 7<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.380> all<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.620> stuff<00:02:56.920> yeah<00:02:57.850> it

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
scorpion 7 and all that stuff yeah it

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.210 
scorpion 7 and all that stuff yeah it
looks<00:02:58.090> like<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.360> only<00:02:58.510> way<00:02:58.750> inside<00:02:59.290> the

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
looks like the only way inside the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.520 
looks like the only way inside the
scorpion<00:03:00.670> 7<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.180> through<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:01.630> break<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.440> the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
scorpion 7 is through this break in the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.070 
scorpion 7 is through this break in the
fence<00:03:02.739> there<00:03:03.730> is<00:03:03.850> no<00:03:04.030> official<00:03:04.540> way<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.720> get

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
fence there is no official way to get

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.720 
fence there is no official way to get
inside<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.739> personally<00:03:06.459> think<00:03:06.549> it'd<00:03:06.700> be

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
inside I personally think it'd be

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.280 
inside I personally think it'd be
actually<00:03:07.090> kind<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.269> cool<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.660> just<00:03:07.840> completely

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
actually kind of cool to just completely

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.020 
actually kind of cool to just completely
enclose<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.980> place<00:03:09.190> in<00:03:09.430> that<00:03:09.580> way<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.910> only

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
enclose the place in that way the only

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.820 
enclose the place in that way the only
way<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.269> you<00:03:10.480> can<00:03:10.630> get<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:10.959> here<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.590> by

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
way that you can get in here is by

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.009 
way that you can get in here is by
building<00:03:12.340> your<00:03:12.370> way<00:03:12.670> over<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.269> fence<00:03:13.540> now

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
building your way over the fence now

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.449 
building your way over the fence now

Kensington I'm not entirely sure if I

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.800 
Kensington I'm not entirely sure if I
like<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:41.650> move<00:03:41.980> because<00:03:42.850> in<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.570> first

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
like that move because in the first

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.380 
like that move because in the first
place<00:03:44.140> this<00:03:44.620> place<00:03:44.920> never<00:03:45.609> really<00:03:45.970> was<00:03:46.150> that

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
place this place never really was that

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.410 
place this place never really was that
busy<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:46.900> mean<00:03:47.230> at<00:03:47.890> least<00:03:47.950> in<00:03:48.370> my<00:03:48.880> experience<00:03:49.299> is

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
busy I mean at least in my experience is

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.750 
busy I mean at least in my experience is
playing<00:03:49.660> with<00:03:49.810> PvP<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.500> never<00:03:51.310> really<00:03:51.549> found

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
playing with PvP I never really found

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.319 
playing with PvP I never really found
that<00:03:52.239> many<00:03:53.049> people<00:03:53.140> here<00:03:54.070> compared<00:03:54.700> to<00:03:54.940> like

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
that many people here compared to like

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.080 
that many people here compared to like
up<00:03:55.600> here<00:03:55.630> like<00:03:56.140> there<00:03:56.380> are<00:03:56.470> snipers

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
up here like there are snipers

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.160 
up here like there are snipers
consistently<00:03:58.090> looking<00:03:58.480> over<00:03:58.690> Summerside

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
consistently looking over Summerside

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.050 
consistently looking over Summerside
military<00:03:59.590> base<00:03:59.799> and<00:04:00.069> that<00:04:00.519> makes<00:04:00.700> sense<00:04:00.880> I

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
military base and that makes sense I

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.809 
military base and that makes sense I
mean<00:04:01.209> it<00:04:01.299> has<00:04:01.480> military<00:04:01.840> gear<00:04:02.380> their<00:04:02.819> snipers

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
mean it has military gear their snipers

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.910 
mean it has military gear their snipers
go<00:04:04.030> there<00:04:04.239> because<00:04:04.510> players<00:04:04.810> go<00:04:05.140> there<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:05.829> I

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
go there because players go there and I

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.740 
go there because players go there and I
think<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.220> reason<00:04:06.489> why<00:04:06.609> scorpions<00:04:07.120> 7<00:04:07.480> is<00:04:07.600> all

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
think the reason why scorpions 7 is all

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.360 
think the reason why scorpions 7 is all
the<00:04:07.870> way<00:04:07.959> on<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.200> others<00:04:08.440> other<00:04:08.829> corner<00:04:09.220> is

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
the way on the others other corner is

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.629 
the way on the others other corner is
because<00:04:09.730> good<00:04:10.030> gear<00:04:10.269> spawns<00:04:10.600> there<00:04:10.959> as<00:04:11.170> well

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
because good gear spawns there as well

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.860 
because good gear spawns there as well
but<00:04:12.639> for<00:04:12.790> some<00:04:13.000> reason<00:04:13.329> not<00:04:13.540> very<00:04:13.750> many

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
but for some reason not very many

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.720 
but for some reason not very many
snipers<00:04:14.170> hang<00:04:14.560> out<00:04:14.709> here<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:15.519> could<00:04:15.670> be

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
snipers hang out here it could be

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.009 
snipers hang out here it could be
because<00:04:15.970> it's<00:04:16.239> so<00:04:16.359> tucked<00:04:16.630> away<00:04:16.750> in<00:04:16.930> the

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
because it's so tucked away in the

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.569 
because it's so tucked away in the
corner<00:04:17.229> could<00:04:17.799> be<00:04:17.979> because<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.370> shadow

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
corner could be because the shadow

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.090 
corner could be because the shadow
stalker<00:04:18.910> is<00:04:19.150> just<00:04:19.389> hard<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.660> find<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.590> that

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
stalker is just hard to find and that

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.649 
stalker is just hard to find and that
really<00:04:21.340> is<00:04:21.459> kind<00:04:21.700> of<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.909> only<00:04:22.180> good<00:04:22.360> gear

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
really is kind of the only good gear

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.210 
really is kind of the only good gear
there<00:04:22.960> and<00:04:23.530> now<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:23.830> actually<00:04:23.979> think

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
there and now that I actually think

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.560 
there and now that I actually think
about<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:24.610> think<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.820> main<00:04:25.060> reason<00:04:25.090> why

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
about it I think the main reason why

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.180 
about it I think the main reason why
nobody<00:04:25.900> really<00:04:26.409> goes<00:04:26.560> down<00:04:26.890> he

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
nobody really goes down he

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.490 
nobody really goes down he
snipers<00:04:27.790> at<00:04:28.030> least<00:04:28.240> because<00:04:29.170> there<00:04:29.290> aren't

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
snipers at least because there aren't

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.620 
snipers at least because there aren't
very<00:04:29.620> many<00:04:30.040> hills<00:04:30.550> surrounding<00:04:30.880> this<00:04:31.420> so<00:04:31.570> I

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
very many hills surrounding this so I

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.170 
very many hills surrounding this so I
think<00:04:31.690> if<00:04:32.050> you<00:04:32.290> kind<00:04:32.590> of<00:04:32.740> made<00:04:33.400> this<00:04:33.610> even<00:04:33.970> more

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
think if you kind of made this even more

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.030 
think if you kind of made this even more
tucked<00:04:34.570> away<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:34.930> put<00:04:35.260> hills<00:04:35.590> around<00:04:35.800> here

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
tucked away you put hills around here

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.190 
tucked away you put hills around here
and<00:04:36.310> places<00:04:36.730> for<00:04:36.910> snipers<00:04:37.330> to<00:04:37.510> hide<00:04:37.720> it<00:04:38.080> would

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
and places for snipers to hide it would

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.710 
and places for snipers to hide it would
make<00:04:38.380> this<00:04:38.680> place<00:04:39.100> a<00:04:39.490> lot<00:04:39.790> more<00:04:40.060> of<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.210> hot<00:04:40.420> spot

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
make this place a lot more of a hot spot

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.500 
make this place a lot more of a hot spot
but<00:04:41.230> also<00:04:41.500> at<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.040> same<00:04:42.190> time<00:04:42.270> there<00:04:43.270> isn't

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
but also at the same time there isn't

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.030 
but also at the same time there isn't
much<00:04:43.630> down<00:04:43.900> here<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.350> first<00:04:44.500> place<00:04:44.740> you

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
much down here in the first place you

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.740 
much down here in the first place you
have<00:04:45.070> a<00:04:45.550> castle<00:04:46.060> that<00:04:46.210> doesn't<00:04:46.480> have<00:04:46.600> any

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
have a castle that doesn't have any

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.600 
have a castle that doesn't have any
items<00:04:46.900> spawns<00:04:47.350> a<00:04:47.560> kensington<00:04:48.070> campground

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
items spawns a kensington campground

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.550 
items spawns a kensington campground
which<00:04:48.790> is<00:04:48.940> nice<00:04:49.150> I<00:04:49.420> mean<00:04:49.540> you<00:04:49.630> can<00:04:49.750> find<00:04:50.020> like

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
which is nice I mean you can find like

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.230 
which is nice I mean you can find like
canteens<00:04:51.070> flashlights<00:04:51.700> all<00:04:51.850> that<00:04:52.000> stuff

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
canteens flashlights all that stuff

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.300 
canteens flashlights all that stuff
there<00:04:52.480> but<00:04:52.810> I<00:04:52.840> think<00:04:53.110> having<00:04:53.320> like<00:04:53.650> a<00:04:53.680> major

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
there but I think having like a major

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.510 
there but I think having like a major
city<00:04:54.850> right<00:04:55.510> there<00:04:55.870> will<00:04:56.530> help<00:04:56.740> even<00:04:57.040> it<00:04:57.370> out

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
city right there will help even it out

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.760 
city right there will help even it out
because<00:04:58.120> then<00:04:58.660> you'll<00:04:58.840> have<00:04:58.990> a<00:04:59.050> hotspot<00:04:59.530> down

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
because then you'll have a hotspot down

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.920 
because then you'll have a hotspot down
here<00:05:00.100> at<00:05:00.250> this<00:05:00.400> major<00:05:00.700> city<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.300> you'll<00:05:01.750> also

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
here at this major city and you'll also

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.810 
here at this major city and you'll also
have<00:05:02.080> a<00:05:02.260> hotspot<00:05:02.650> in<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:02.980> other<00:05:03.190> corner<00:05:03.790> of

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
have a hotspot in the other corner of

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.090 
have a hotspot in the other corner of
the<00:05:03.940> map<00:05:04.180> where<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.020> military<00:05:05.350> bases<00:05:05.830> and

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
the map where the military bases and

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.710 
the map where the military bases and
that<00:05:06.160> way<00:05:06.310> it<00:05:06.430> really<00:05:06.670> evens<00:05:07.180> everything<00:05:07.300> out

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
that way it really evens everything out

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.200 
that way it really evens everything out
as<00:05:08.380> of<00:05:08.530> right<00:05:08.650> now<00:05:08.830> we<00:05:08.890> have<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.190> campground<00:05:09.820> and

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
as of right now we have a campground and

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.050 
as of right now we have a campground and
a<00:05:10.390> castle<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.260> a<00:05:11.650> scorpion<00:05:11.920> 7<00:05:12.340> facility<00:05:12.880> on<00:05:13.030> a

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
a castle and a scorpion 7 facility on a

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.880 
a castle and a scorpion 7 facility on a
relatively<00:05:13.540> flat<00:05:13.870> island<00:05:14.470> where<00:05:14.650> there<00:05:14.770> isn't

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
relatively flat island where there isn't

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.890 
relatively flat island where there isn't
much<00:05:15.100> elevation<00:05:15.400> change<00:05:15.970> so<00:05:16.420> it<00:05:16.510> really<00:05:16.690> makes

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
much elevation change so it really makes

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.170 
much elevation change so it really makes
this<00:05:17.110> whole<00:05:17.380> lower<00:05:17.680> corner<00:05:18.250> not<00:05:18.640> really<00:05:19.000> that

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
this whole lower corner not really that

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.510 
this whole lower corner not really that
active<00:05:19.720> but<00:05:20.380> when<00:05:20.530> it<00:05:20.650> came<00:05:20.770> to<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:21.070> change<00:05:21.310> to

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
active but when it came to the change to

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.550 
active but when it came to the change to
Stratford<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.120> like<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.510> a<00:05:22.540> lot<00:05:22.750> and<00:05:23.020> overall

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
Stratford I like that a lot and overall

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.990 
Stratford I like that a lot and overall
I<00:05:23.590> mean<00:05:23.770> these<00:05:24.010> are<00:05:24.220> some<00:05:24.250> pretty<00:05:24.670> minor

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
I mean these are some pretty minor

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.850 
I mean these are some pretty minor
changes<00:05:25.660> so<00:05:25.960> it's<00:05:26.110> not<00:05:26.260> like<00:05:26.530> we're<00:05:26.740> having

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
changes so it's not like we're having

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.160 
changes so it's not like we're having
massive<00:05:27.520> changes<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.150> the<00:05:28.270> flow<00:05:28.450> of<00:05:28.480> PII<00:05:28.840> so<00:05:29.140> I

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
massive changes to the flow of PII so I

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.050 
massive changes to the flow of PII so I
don't<00:05:29.470> really<00:05:29.530> care<00:05:29.680> that<00:05:30.070> much<00:05:30.250> but<00:05:30.310> it<00:05:30.820> is<00:05:31.030> a

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
don't really care that much but it is a

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.540 
don't really care that much but it is a
suggestion<00:05:31.620> also<00:05:32.620> there<00:05:32.890> were<00:05:33.010> three<00:05:33.340> new

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
suggestion also there were three new

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.430 
suggestion also there were three new
achievements<00:05:34.270> added<00:05:34.540> in<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.780> game<00:05:34.990> we<00:05:35.200> have

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
achievements added in the game we have

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.830 
achievements added in the game we have
behind<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.980> wheel<00:05:36.330> accident-prone<00:05:37.330> and

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
behind the wheel accident-prone and

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.050 
behind the wheel accident-prone and
berries<00:05:38.320> now<00:05:38.650> in<00:05:39.280> order<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.550> get<00:05:39.669> behind<00:05:39.820> the

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
berries now in order to get behind the

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.430 
berries now in order to get behind the
wheel<00:05:40.180> I<00:05:40.240> think<00:05:40.540> you<00:05:40.600> just<00:05:40.750> have<00:05:40.900> to<00:05:41.020> get<00:05:41.230> in<00:05:41.350> a

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
wheel I think you just have to get in a

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.380 
wheel I think you just have to get in a
vehicle<00:05:41.620> in<00:05:42.070> order<00:05:42.490> to<00:05:42.669> get<00:05:42.790> accident-prone

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
vehicle in order to get accident-prone

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.750 
vehicle in order to get accident-prone
you<00:05:43.810> have<00:05:43.990> to<00:05:44.110> die<00:05:44.350> ten<00:05:44.680> times<00:05:45.010> I<00:05:45.280> also<00:05:45.430> found

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
you have to die ten times I also found

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.490 
you have to die ten times I also found
out<00:05:45.880> that<00:05:45.940> suiciding<00:05:46.750> does<00:05:46.990> not<00:05:47.230> work<00:05:47.470> you

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
out that suiciding does not work you

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.230 
out that suiciding does not work you
actually<00:05:48.010> have<00:05:48.100> to<00:05:48.190> die<00:05:48.370> from<00:05:48.730> zombies

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
actually have to die from zombies

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.420 
actually have to die from zombies
players<00:05:49.750> all<00:05:49.960> that<00:05:50.110> stuff<00:05:50.410> and<00:05:50.680> once<00:05:51.220> you<00:05:51.310> do

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
players all that stuff and once you do

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.530 
players all that stuff and once you do
that<00:05:51.550> ten<00:05:51.760> times<00:05:51.790> you'll<00:05:52.240> get<00:05:52.360> that

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
that ten times you'll get that

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.630 
that ten times you'll get that
achievement<00:05:52.900> and<00:05:53.200> then<00:05:53.530> berries<00:05:53.950> has<00:05:54.610> a

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
achievement and then berries has a

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.580 
achievement and then berries has a
question<00:05:55.090> mark<00:05:55.240> on<00:05:55.419> it<00:05:55.480> I'm<00:05:55.960> assuming<00:05:56.440> you

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
question mark on it I'm assuming you

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.770 
question mark on it I'm assuming you
just<00:05:56.770> have<00:05:56.919> to<00:05:57.070> eat<00:05:57.310> hallucinogenic<00:05:58.270> berries

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
just have to eat hallucinogenic berries

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.230 
just have to eat hallucinogenic berries
and<00:05:58.990> that's<00:05:59.110> why<00:05:59.290> I<00:05:59.320> have<00:05:59.910> Vermillion<00:06:00.910> berries

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
and that's why I have Vermillion berries

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.670 
and that's why I have Vermillion berries
on<00:06:01.450> me<00:06:01.660> right<00:06:01.810> here<00:06:02.050> so<00:06:02.200> but<00:06:02.290> I<00:06:02.350> guess<00:06:02.500> we're

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
on me right here so but I guess we're

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.440 
on me right here so but I guess we're
gonna<00:06:02.800> try<00:06:03.040> that<00:06:03.250> out<00:06:03.280> real<00:06:03.610> quick<00:06:05.940> yep<00:06:06.940> and<00:06:07.120> we

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
gonna try that out real quick yep and we

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.880 
gonna try that out real quick yep and we
got<00:06:07.600> the<00:06:07.750> berries<00:06:08.080> achievement<00:06:08.500> so<00:06:08.620> in<00:06:08.770> order

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
got the berries achievement so in order

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.430 
got the berries achievement so in order
to<00:06:09.010> get<00:06:09.160> that<00:06:09.340> you<00:06:09.880> just<00:06:10.090> have<00:06:10.330> to<00:06:10.540> eat<00:06:11.140> some

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
to get that you just have to eat some

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.230 
to get that you just have to eat some
hallucinogenic<00:06:12.370> berries<00:06:12.700> although<00:06:13.000> that

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
hallucinogenic berries although that

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.960 
hallucinogenic berries although that
didn't<00:06:13.570> make<00:06:13.870> me<00:06:14.340> loosen<00:06:15.340> eight<00:06:15.460> what's<00:06:15.790> going

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
didn't make me loosen eight what's going

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:16.409 
didn't make me loosen eight what's going
on<00:06:16.090> here

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
on here

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.420 
on here
those<00:06:16.960> were<00:06:17.169> vermilion<00:06:17.710> berries<00:06:18.010> they<00:06:18.190> didn't

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
those were vermilion berries they didn't

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.860 
those were vermilion berries they didn't
make<00:06:18.580> me<00:06:18.630> loosen<00:06:19.630> eight<00:06:21.060> interesting<00:06:22.090> were

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
make me loosen eight interesting were

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.560 
make me loosen eight interesting were
they<00:06:23.020> valium<00:06:23.500> berries<00:06:23.710> I'm<00:06:23.890> pretty<00:06:24.130> sure

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
they valium berries I'm pretty sure

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.820 
they valium berries I'm pretty sure
anyway<00:06:25.600> I<00:06:25.780> ate<00:06:25.990> the<00:06:26.110> berries<00:06:26.260> got<00:06:26.680> the

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
anyway I ate the berries got the

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.710 
anyway I ate the berries got the
achievement<00:06:27.310> end<00:06:27.430> of<00:06:27.669> story<00:06:28.000> and<00:06:28.180> I'm

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
assuming if you just get in a vehicle

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.159 
assuming if you just get in a vehicle
you'll<00:06:31.300> get<00:06:31.419> that<00:06:31.600> behind<00:06:31.780> the<00:06:32.020> wheel

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
you'll get that behind the wheel

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.430 
you'll get that behind the wheel
achievement<00:06:32.680> and<00:06:32.860> if<00:06:33.520> you<00:06:33.640> die<00:06:34.030> go<00:06:34.930> find<00:06:35.350> a

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
achievement and if you die go find a

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.920 
achievement and if you die go find a
zombie<00:06:35.830> have<00:06:35.979> him<00:06:36.100> kill<00:06:36.310> me<00:06:36.460> real<00:06:36.640> quick<00:06:36.930> come

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:55.629 
ah there we go three when I jumped to

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:57.779 
ah there we go three when I jumped to
three<00:06:55.840> for<00:06:56.080> some<00:06:56.229> reason<00:06:56.530> but<00:06:56.860> as<00:06:57.280> you<00:06:57.430> can<00:06:57.580> see

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:57.789 
three for some reason but as you can see

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:02.010 
three for some reason but as you can see
if<00:06:58.000> I<00:06:58.120> suicide<00:06:58.569> several<00:06:58.870> times<00:07:00.479> and<00:07:01.479> then<00:07:01.990> I

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
if I suicide several times and then I

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.510 
if I suicide several times and then I
head<00:07:02.199> on<00:07:02.319> back<00:07:03.780> it's<00:07:04.780> still<00:07:04.930> at<00:07:05.199> three<00:07:05.500> so<00:07:06.460> you

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
head on back it's still at three so you

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.249 
head on back it's still at three so you
actually<00:07:06.699> have<00:07:06.939> to<00:07:07.060> like<00:07:07.270> legitimately<00:07:07.990> die
