but<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> thing<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.640> you're<00:01:32.850> going<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.090> wait<00:01:33.420> for

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
but a thing is you're going to wait for

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.899 
but a thing is you're going to wait for
another<00:01:33.659> market<00:01:34.409> crash<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.920> not<00:01:35.189> sure<00:01:35.610> that

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
another market crash and not sure that

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.490 
another market crash and not sure that
it's<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.390> another<00:01:36.689> market<00:01:37.110> crashing

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it's going to be another market crashing

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.499 
it's going to be another market crashing
not<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.400> probably<00:01:38.729> wants<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> wait<00:01:39.299> for

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
not so this probably wants to wait for

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.899 
not so this probably wants to wait for
FIFA<00:01:39.810> 16<00:01:39.930> another<00:01:40.890> t<00:01:41.100> which<00:01:41.310> I've<00:01:41.430> tried<00:01:41.700> was

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
FIFA 16 another t which I've tried was

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.999 
FIFA 16 another t which I've tried was
buying<00:01:42.210> Munich<00:01:42.689> there<00:01:43.140> bears<00:01:43.560> are<00:01:43.770> pretty

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
buying Munich there bears are pretty

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.920 
buying Munich there bears are pretty
relatively<00:01:44.700> expensive<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.390> well<00:01:45.570> so

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
relatively expensive as well so

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.929 
relatively expensive as well so
basically<00:01:46.680> see<00:01:46.860> here<00:01:47.100> I'm<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.250> listing<00:01:47.820> of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
basically see here I'm just listing of

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.179 
basically see here I'm just listing of
all<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.119> cards<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> was<00:01:49.350> aiming<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:50.009> is

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
all the cards what I was aiming for is

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.100 
all the cards what I was aiming for is
not<00:01:50.310> necessarily<00:01:50.939> profit<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.899> want<00:01:52.049> to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
not necessarily profit I just want to

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.289 
not necessarily profit I just want to
get<00:01:52.229> them<00:01:52.409> sold<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:53.070> my<00:01:53.340> transfer<00:01:53.820> power<00:01:54.030> as

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
get them sold out my transfer power as

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.300 
get them sold out my transfer power as
soon<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.930> possible<00:01:55.380> still<00:01:55.619> making<00:01:55.979> some<00:01:56.159> sort

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
soon as possible still making some sort

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
soon as possible still making some sort
of<00:01:56.399> profit<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.299> example<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.930> list

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
of profit but like for example I list

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.080 
of profit but like for example I list
the<00:01:58.530> boss<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:59.009> once<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.369> knowledge<00:01:59.729> corners

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the boss at once for knowledge corners

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.459 
the boss at once for knowledge corners
when<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> couldn't<00:02:00.570> list<00:02:00.719> them<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.110> all<00:02:01.259> up

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
when I couldn't list them but all up

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.370 
when I couldn't list them but all up
about<00:02:01.710> 1.3<00:02:02.460> k<00:02:02.670> 1<00:02:02.909> put<00:02:03.060> 4k<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.689> they<00:02:04.170> probably

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
about 1.3 k 1 put 4k and they probably

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.679 
about 1.3 k 1 put 4k and they probably
were<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.680> solve<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.219> much<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:06.090> obviously

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
were to solve for that much so obviously

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.300 
were to solve for that much so obviously
it<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:06.960> depends<00:02:07.409> if<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.649> want<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.920> wait<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
it just depends if you want to wait a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.859 
it just depends if you want to wait a
little<00:02:08.580> bit<00:02:08.729> longer<00:02:08.940> because<00:02:09.300> all<00:02:09.690> these

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
little bit longer because all these

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.530 
little bit longer because all these
cards<00:02:10.410> actually<00:02:10.739> sold<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.580> within<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.120> first

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
cards actually sold on within the first

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.970 
cards actually sold on within the first

if<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.790> can<00:02:14.909> see<00:02:15.150> here<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:15.900> are

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
if so you can see here that there are

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.979 
if so you can see here that there are
they<00:02:16.349> are<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.650> demand<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.330> badges<00:02:18.330> people<00:02:18.810> do

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
still on badges in the game just quite

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.220 
still on badges in the game just quite
surprising<00:02:21.420> because<00:02:21.510> obviously<00:02:21.720> isn't<00:02:22.019> it

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
surprising because obviously isn't it

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.509

sold on all the badges which is really
good<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.860> see<00:02:46.920> how<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:47.849> made<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> decent<00:02:48.599> I

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
good to see how just made a decent I

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.949 
good to see how just made a decent I
profile<00:02:49.349> think<00:02:49.560> about<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.890> think<00:02:50.400> about<00:02:50.930> 10k<00:02:51.930> or

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
profile think about I think about 10k or

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.630 
profile think about I think about 10k or
so<00:02:52.319> which<00:02:52.829> obviously<00:02:52.980> if<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.310> bought<00:02:53.489> more

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
so which obviously if I bought more

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.819 
so which obviously if I bought more
badges<00:02:53.879> I<00:02:54.359> could<00:02:55.019> have<00:02:55.109> made<00:02:55.200> more<00:02:55.260> profit<00:02:55.769> but

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
badges I could have made more profit but

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.800 
badges I could have made more profit but
the<00:02:55.950> majority<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.519> my<00:02:56.579> coins<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.209> investing

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the majority of my coins in investing

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.449 
the majority of my coins in investing
when<00:02:58.049> swards<00:02:58.410> informs<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.010> sort<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.400> thing

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
when swards informs that sort of thing

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.849 
when swards informs that sort of thing
just<00:02:59.730> was<00:02:59.910> kind<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.359> side<00:03:00.690> thing<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.379> just

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
just was kind like a side thing I just

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.470 
just was kind like a side thing I just
did<00:03:02.040> with<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.549> few<00:03:02.819> coins<00:03:03.000> which<00:03:03.269> I<00:03:03.329> had

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
did with like a few coins which I had
