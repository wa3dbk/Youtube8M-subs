00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.830 
make a nice flat origami dish nice thing
about<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.230> model<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:08.010> can<00:00:08.130> also<00:00:08.220> be<00:00:08.519> done

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
about this model is it can also be done

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.890 
about this model is it can also be done
out<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.139> 1/2<00:00:10.860> by<00:00:11.099> 11<00:00:11.130> or<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.880> 4<00:00:12.300> piece<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.690> paper

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
out of a 1/2 by 11 or a 4 piece of paper

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.160 
out of a 1/2 by 11 or a 4 piece of paper
as<00:00:13.139> well<00:00:13.679> as<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> standard<00:00:14.340> origami<00:00:15.030> square<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
as well as a standard origami square the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.779 
as well as a standard origami square the
other<00:00:16.289> nice<00:00:16.560> thing<00:00:16.830> about<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.279> model<00:00:17.550> is

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
other nice thing about this model is

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.870 
other nice thing about this model is
that<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.570> shows<00:00:19.230> only<00:00:19.560> one<00:00:20.070> side<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> paper

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that it shows only one side of the paper

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.230 
that it shows only one side of the paper
so<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.080> if<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.650> paper<00:00:22.920> with<00:00:23.250> without<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
so that if you have paper with without a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.529 
so that if you have paper with without a
design<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.930> one<00:00:25.230> side<00:00:25.680> that's<00:00:26.430> okay<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.330> paper

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
design on one side that's okay the paper

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.669 
design on one side that's okay the paper
only<00:00:27.810> displays<00:00:28.380> one<00:00:29.310> side<00:00:30.380> when<00:00:31.380> it's<00:00:31.529> folded

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
only displays one side when it's folded

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.880 
only displays one side when it's folded
into<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> model<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:33.540> let's<00:00:34.320> get<00:00:34.500> started

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
into the model so let's get started

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.440 
into the model so let's get started
let's<00:00:35.210> take<00:00:36.210> our<00:00:36.540> square<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.920> origami<00:00:38.790> paper

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
let's take our square of origami paper

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.020 
let's take our square of origami paper
that<00:00:39.930> we'll<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.170> using<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.680> we'll<00:00:41.520> take<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
that we'll be using and we'll take the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.900 
that we'll be using and we'll take the
side<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.660> want<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.230> showing<00:00:43.910> facing

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
side that we want to be showing facing

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.410 
side that we want to be showing facing
up<00:00:46.010> go<00:00:47.010> ahead<00:00:47.070> we're<00:00:47.309> gonna<00:00:47.370> fold<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.059> in

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
up go ahead we're gonna fold this in

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.930 
up go ahead we're gonna fold this in
half<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:54.170> then<00:00:55.170> we're<00:00:55.500> gonna<00:00:55.590> open<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.550> up<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
half and then we're gonna open it up and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:10.620 
half and then we're gonna open it up and
fold<00:00:57.690> these<00:00:58.050> edges<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:59.660> the<00:01:00.660> center<00:01:00.930> line

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.780 

and<00:01:11.630> then<00:01:11.750> we're<00:01:11.840> gonna<00:01:11.930> take<00:01:12.290> this<00:01:13.010> edge<00:01:13.400> and

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
and then we're gonna take this edge and

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.960 
and then we're gonna take this edge and
we're<00:01:14.360> going<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:14.540> fold<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:14.960> back<00:01:15.170> up<00:01:15.980> to<00:01:16.820> this

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
we're going to fold it back up to this

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:26.110 
we're going to fold it back up to this
folded<00:01:17.360> edge<00:01:23.440> like<00:01:24.440> that<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.670> same<00:01:25.880> thing

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
folded edge like that and the same thing

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.560 
folded edge like that and the same thing
on<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.330> other<00:01:26.360> side<00:01:31.180> then<00:01:32.180> we're<00:01:32.300> gonna<00:01:32.390> go

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
on the other side then we're gonna go

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.830 
on the other side then we're gonna go
ahead<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.020> open<00:01:33.590> these<00:01:34.550> flaps<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.540> we<00:01:35.600> just

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
ahead and open these flaps that we just

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.330 
ahead and open these flaps that we just
created<00:01:36.170> back<00:01:37.040> up<00:01:37.660> so<00:01:38.660> we're<00:01:38.840> here<00:01:39.190> know<00:01:40.190> what

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
created back up so we're here know what

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.290 
created back up so we're here know what
we're<00:01:40.430> gonna<00:01:40.490> do<00:01:40.730> is<00:01:40.850> we're<00:01:40.970> going<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.120> take

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
we're gonna do is we're going to take

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.300 
we're gonna do is we're going to take
each<00:01:41.570> of<00:01:42.080> these<00:01:43.180> corners<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:45.190> we're<00:01:46.190> gonna

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
each of these corners and we're gonna

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.940 
each of these corners and we're gonna
fold<00:01:47.110> like<00:01:48.110> we<00:01:48.290> were<00:01:48.380> doing<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.890> paper<00:01:49.700> airplane

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
fold like we were doing a paper airplane

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.980 
fold like we were doing a paper airplane
to<00:01:51.950> this<00:01:52.070> Center<00:01:52.730> crease<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.780> we<00:01:53.960> just

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
to this Center crease that we just

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.040 
to this Center crease that we just
created<00:01:54.940> we'll<00:01:55.940> do<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.180> same<00:01:56.390> thing<00:01:56.450> with

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
created we'll do the same thing with

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.510 
created we'll do the same thing with
this<00:01:57.170> other<00:01:57.380> side<00:01:58.750> like<00:01:59.750> this<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.620> so<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.250> is

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
this other side like this and so this is

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.610 
this other side like this and so this is
what<00:02:02.270> we're<00:02:02.420> working<00:02:02.450> with<00:02:02.810> right<00:02:03.110> now<00:02:03.140> we

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
what we're working with right now we

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.670 
what we're working with right now we
just<00:02:03.830> hold<00:02:04.400> this<00:02:04.550> in<00:02:04.820> hold<00:02:05.330> this<00:02:05.570> in<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.260> we're

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
just hold this in hold this in and we're

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.230 
just hold this in hold this in and we're
gonna<00:02:06.800> do<00:02:06.980> that<00:02:07.160> again<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.940> make<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.770> more

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
gonna do that again to make it a more

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.110 
gonna do that again to make it a more
sleek<00:02:11.240> point<00:02:11.950> so<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.040> fold<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.670> into<00:02:14.000> the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
sleek point so the fold that into the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.790 
sleek point so the fold that into the
center<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:15.340> on<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.610> other<00:02:16.760> side<00:02:17.590> fold<00:02:18.590> that

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
center and on the other side fold that

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.750 
center and on the other side fold that
into<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.400> center<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:25.130> what<00:02:25.400> we<00:02:25.550> have

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
into the center so that is what we have

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.430 
into the center so that is what we have
we<00:02:26.030> started<00:02:26.480> with<00:02:27.160> this<00:02:28.810> we<00:02:29.810> fold<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.350> the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
we started with this we fold to the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.270 
we started with this we fold to the
center<00:02:30.790> fold<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.180> center<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.950> then<00:02:33.950> we<00:02:34.130> go

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
center fold to the center and then we go

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.380 
center fold to the center and then we go
ahead<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.910> we<00:02:35.570> fold<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.350> center<00:02:36.500> again

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
ahead and we fold to the center again

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.810 
ahead and we fold to the center again
fold<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.720> center<00:02:38.980> again<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.190> we're<00:02:40.700> going

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
fold to the center again and we're going

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:50.230 
fold to the center again and we're going
to<00:02:40.880> do<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.239> with<00:02:41.780> each<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:43.160> corners

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.330 

okay<00:02:51.240> now<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.780> we<00:02:51.930> have<00:02:52.200> each<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
okay now that we have each of the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.740 
okay now that we have each of the
corners<00:02:53.700> folded<00:02:54.450> two<00:02:54.950> points<00:02:55.950> like<00:02:56.070> this

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
corners folded two points like this

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
go ahead and give this a little bit of a

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.800 
go ahead and give this a little bit of a
fold<00:03:28.790> open<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.060> give<00:03:30.180> this<00:03:30.300> a<00:03:30.360> little<00:03:30.570> bit<00:03:30.720> of

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
fold and now we have a nice flat origami

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.290 
fold and now we have a nice flat origami
dish<00:03:37.220> now<00:03:38.220> as<00:03:38.460> I<00:03:38.580> said<00:03:38.640> at<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.880> beginning<00:03:38.970> you

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
dish now as I said at the beginning you

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.580 
dish now as I said at the beginning you
can<00:03:39.480> also<00:03:39.780> make<00:03:40.080> this<00:03:40.260> out<00:03:40.530> of

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
can also make this out of

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.160 
can also make this out of
eight-and-a-half<00:03:41.190> by<00:03:41.400> 11<00:03:41.760> piece<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:41.970> paper

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
eight-and-a-half by 11 piece of paper

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.020 
eight-and-a-half by 11 piece of paper
really<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.440> only<00:03:43.560> difference<00:03:43.770> is<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.700> that

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
really the only difference is is that

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.990 
really the only difference is is that
you<00:03:45.210> would<00:03:45.360> start<00:03:45.660> with<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:46.380> 11<00:03:46.800> inch<00:03:47.370> side<00:03:47.760> at

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
you would start with the 11 inch side at

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.060 
you would start with the 11 inch side at
the<00:03:48.180> top<00:03:48.390> but<00:03:49.020> other<00:03:49.200> than<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.800> follow

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
the top but other than that you follow

00:03:50.070 --> 00:04:06.339 
the top but other than that you follow
the<00:03:50.250> instructions<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:50.940> exact<00:03:51.270> same<00:03:51.480> way

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.520 

and<00:04:07.910> there<00:04:08.910> we<00:04:09.030> have<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.239> origami<00:04:09.930> flat<00:04:10.290> dish

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
and there we have the origami flat dish

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.720 
and there we have the origami flat dish
folded<00:04:11.250> out<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.520> piece<00:04:11.700> of

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
folded out of a piece of

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.050 
folded out of a piece of
eight-and-a-half<00:04:12.480> by<00:04:12.630> eleven<00:04:12.930> paper
