00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.660
 kim nam solutions developed by high and 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.809
 tract is an action stop where 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.519
 will impersonate the evergreen agent 47 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.980
 everything starts as always with a 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.900
 contract sent to kill diana for 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.400
 one of her close collaborators 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.650
 within the agency for which 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.410
 work our man will find himself with 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.970
 a very special young girl dependent and 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 he must therefore be able to protect it 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.289
 from the same agency immediately the game yes 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.390
 presents much deeper than his 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.190
 predecessors and maybe a good one despite 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.210
 the purists of the saga could have 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.250
 something against it 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.960
 in this game the story is driving 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.610
 all the character's actions though 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.370
 in our opinion it seems to be a bit 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.079
 too linear don't worry though 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.789
 you'll still have plenty of ways to 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.230
 kill your targets and you will be 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.030
 encouraged to replay more levels 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.530
 times as there are myriad 10 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.780
 foment unlock for each type of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.489
 killing between changes more 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.620
 relevant we can note the new one 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.390
 disguise system that will result 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.770
 one of the best ways to shoot for i 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.670
 levels chasing for clues there 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.439
 could be useful 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 in the elimination of our target 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.760
 in particular we can point out that it is 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.250
 much easier my findings also 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.110
 when we are disguised another 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.000
 very important change is that the nip 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.680
 pan absolution we will not be able to choose i 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.330
 our log out before the mission 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.100
 on the contrary we will have available 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.320
 only what we will find 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.759
 within the levels themselves and that there 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.470
 will lead to using a series of 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.000
 very interesting taiz exchanges that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.229
 keep the passion alive and give the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.119
 possibility for players to live 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.159
 always a different experience each time 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.750
 playing a level 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.659
 let's talk about multiplayer mode now 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.250
 called and menchov geox with which 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.259
 we will be able to create contracts to do 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.810
 play other players with parameters 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.370
 weapons and disguise targets chosen by 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.110
 we 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.150
 very interesting thing about this 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.950
 mode is that to create a contract 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.690
 we will have to complete it first 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.490
 themselves going around the level 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.620
 without being noticed we should mark 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.630
 kill and fly use us for 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.760
 make the contract valid if we do so 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.350
 without the others being identified 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.100
 players will have to do it exactly like 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.050
 we did it 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.820
 an interesting way to show off 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.290
 our skills and see our friends 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.910
 launch the controller out of the 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.010
 window as they wonder how we got it 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.930
 made to make that contract 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.000
 in conclusion and menez solution in the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.410
 our title is a minimum 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.570
 of graphic glitches but nothing of 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.730
 awesome them too annoying the 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.590
 extremely fun gameplay 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.940
 very interesting places though 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.380
 in the first hours of play tend to 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.150
 repeating too much and it is 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.140
 also difficult enough 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.270
 normal difficulty 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.980
 the second of the five available to give 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.090
 hard wire even the most avid fans 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.430
 of the series 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.120
 a purchase recommended to everyone for those 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.890
 love the votes 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.890
 ours is 8.5
