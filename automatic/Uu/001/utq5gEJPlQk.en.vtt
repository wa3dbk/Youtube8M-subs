00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.260 
next week um I think the biggest thing
is<00:01:22.009> just<00:01:22.040> a<00:01:22.340> comfort<00:01:22.729> level<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:23.180> know

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
Michaels just two guys feeling like this

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.630 
Michaels just two guys feeling like this
is<00:01:25.940> our<00:01:26.270> routine<00:01:26.960> this<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.440> what<00:01:27.649> we<00:01:27.860> do<00:01:28.130> this

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
is our routine this is what we do this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
is our routine this is what we do this
is<00:01:28.820> how<00:01:28.970> we<00:01:29.030> do<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:31.060> they're<00:01:32.060> still<00:01:32.360> going<00:01:32.570> to

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
is how we do it they're still going to

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.249 
is how we do it they're still going to
be<00:01:32.810> moments<00:01:33.320> of<00:01:33.470> what<00:01:34.430> time<00:01:34.640> here<00:01:35.630> what<00:01:36.020> time

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
be moments of what time here what time

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.650 
be moments of what time here what time
there<00:01:36.740> but<00:01:36.770> all<00:01:37.430> in<00:01:37.700> all<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:37.880> be<00:01:38.210> able<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.450> have

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
there but all in all to be able to have

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.660 
there but all in all to be able to have
the<00:01:38.869> routine<00:01:39.350> i<00:01:39.380> think<00:01:39.860> is<00:01:39.979> important<00:01:40.520> for

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
the routine i think is important for

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.290 
the routine i think is important for
everybody<00:01:40.910> a<00:01:41.350> lot<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:43.000> purposefully<00:01:44.000> missed

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
everybody a lot of purposefully missed

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.180 
everybody a lot of purposefully missed
mixing<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:44.869> matching<00:01:45.020> pairs<00:01:45.440> or<00:01:45.560> groups<00:01:45.710> that

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
mixing and matching pairs or groups that

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.649 
mixing and matching pairs or groups that
offers<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.670> while

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
offers a while

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.599 
offers a while
when<00:01:48.320> do<00:01:48.469> you<00:01:48.499> get<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:49.039> point<00:01:49.249> where<00:01:49.490> you

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
when do you get to the point where you

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.459 
when do you get to the point where you
say<00:01:49.819> this<00:01:50.359> is<00:01:50.569> kind<00:01:50.869> of<00:01:50.960> how<00:01:51.109> we're<00:01:51.319> going

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
say this is kind of how we're going

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.590 
say this is kind of how we're going
exactly<00:01:51.859> do<00:01:52.219> it<00:01:52.369> in<00:01:52.490> games<00:01:52.729> in<00:01:53.119> terms<00:01:53.329> of<00:01:53.450> it

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
exactly do it in games in terms of it
