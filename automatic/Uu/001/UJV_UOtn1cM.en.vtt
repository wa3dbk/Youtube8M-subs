00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.070

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.610
 I have to do 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.790
 nobody will impose a schedule on me 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.730
 work from my bed but on the way 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.410
 I was playing with some challenges that I 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.770
 helped to understand which is the best 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 way to work from my house and I have 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.320
 to get ahead of you that has nothing 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.259
 see with working in piyamas I want to 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.000
 share with you these 5 tips 

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:10.290
 indispensable to work from your 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.420
 house number 1 family support my 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.240
 office is on the second floor of the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.030
 home but when I'm working nobody 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.520
 interrupts me because they know I'm 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.410
 working when you work from home 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.880
 It is very important that your family 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.630
 understand that although you are 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.119
 what you do is work for tasks are 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.759
 three things I can not ask you to take out is 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.759
 the garbage cleans the car or they dance the 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.969
 dogs in your work schedule because 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.100
 this will definitely fall behind 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.530
 so that your family understands that 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.560
 they can interrupt you is that you have a 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.710
 established schedule and that's the advice 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.829
 number two sets your schedule for 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.450
 Work works from home is not 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.610
 synonymous with being attached to the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.340
 computer all the time you're 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.189
 I wake up because I'm sure this 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.590
 it can saturate you for such reason is 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.590
 important that you set your schedule for 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.380
 work of eating to rest and 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.209
 share with the family sets your 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.329
 schedule and carry it out 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.489
 you start on time and finish on time 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.260
 important schedule to avoid you 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.750
 You're stuck working until the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.180
 early morning or you lose time on things 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.640
 that do not benefit your business by 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.890
 example being connected all the time to 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.920
 facebook of course not 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.140
 need for your schedule to be 8 to 5 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.959
 you can choose the schedule that is more 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.209
 comfortable and effective for you when 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.370
 I started my business with my schedule more 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.890
 comfortable was up at 11 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.230
 tomorrow because I worked in a store 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.410
 and I had to get up early but today 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.060
 in day and to start at 9 what he wants 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.580
 say you can start with a schedule 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.720
 and then you can change it depending on 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.810
 your needs 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.780
 number 3 sets the time for the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.000
 meetings when you work from home 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.280
 many times you have to go out to 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.530
 meetings with clients 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.380
 in my case there comes a passing moment 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.739
 more time in meetings than working and 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.470
 this has drawn me a lot of portal already 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.290
 are was established a few days and schedules 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.810
 specific to the meetings and for 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.040
 to serve my clients that was taught to me 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.500
 my boyfriend I for example I go to meetings 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.220
 from Monday to Wednesday before 4 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.110
 the afternoon 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.540
 If a client wants to see me, he has to 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.610
 do it in those days and at that time if 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.160
 I do not have space this week has 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.830
 to wait for the next I thought that 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.290
 limit meetings to days and times 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.050
 specific I could lower the conversion 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.750
 in the clients but the reality is that 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.270
 not like that I still work very well with the 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.890
 clients and on Thursdays and Fridays 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.860
 I always focus on being at work in 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.580
 the projects on the internet and I confess that 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.400
 some Saturdays also number 4 defines 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.220
 your priorities you know what you have to 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.800
 Doing is indispensable to be able to achieve 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.250
 your goals working from home 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.380
 define your priorities for each day is 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.480
 sure the list of things you have 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.549
 what to do in the week you will not be able to 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.250
 finish in a single day that's why it's 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.010
 important to be clear about what you want 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.220
 work every day to keep moving forward 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.410
 I make a list of between 4 to 8 things 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.470
 to do for a day and I focus on 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.720
 achieve them 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.510
 sometimes the neuro with time and then 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.850
 I 'm going to eat or go to the movies because the 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.250
 reason to work from home is 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.040
 to be able to share more with my family and 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.920
 friends number 5 prepare your area of 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.170
 work you must work from a place 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.110
 where you feel comfortable and the 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:54.050
 creativity works from the bed many 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.540
 Sometimes it's not a good idea to remember that it was 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.080
 created for us to rest and our 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.870
 brain automatically thinks about that 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.600
 prepare your space with your tools 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.570

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.700

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.890

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.230

 productive work from home not 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.210
 It is necessarily good for everyone 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.520
 world the reality is that the challenge more 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.950
 great is to focus and avoid 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.810
 distractions but as entrepreneurs 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.330
 We are responsible for our 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.880
 work is finished and for that reason 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.689
 we must be strict with us 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.489
