00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.719
 well, first of all, welcome to the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.140
 code 2 to know the actual speed of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.689
 our internet connection is useful and it is 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.640
 simple to do in this tutorial 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.369
 we will explain how you can get 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.439
 this without the need to install any 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.410
 additional program simply with the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.800
 functions that the same windows 7 us 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.800
 offers 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.030
 Well, the first step is to 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.070
 place the mouse cursor over the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.730
 taskbar and then do 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.610
 Right click on it 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.470
 a contextual menu will open let's search 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.480
 the item that says start the 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.860
 task manager 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.860
 we click on him 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.290
 the administrator window opens 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.880
 tasks look for the tab named 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.880
 network functions 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.960
 then look for the button 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.630
 menu with name see 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.090
 we click on him 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.610
 and in the menu that appears we look for the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.610
 item that says select columns 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.330
 in the window to select columns 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.140
 we enable the check boxes 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:45.310
 vice sent by interval 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.259
 and vice received by interval 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.259
 then we click on accept 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.070
 in the task manager window 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.470
 two new indicators appear this 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.210
 here bytes sent by intervals that 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.490
 they reflect the amount of information 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.590
 reflected in bytes that your computer 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.170
 is sending through your connection to 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.570
 internet but the most important value is 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.880
 this here bytes in received by 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.580
 interval this is the amount of 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.560
 information that is your computer is 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.690
 receiving through your connection to 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.810
 Internet 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.060
 the figure shown here is reflected 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.830
 I say again in bytes which 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.590
 means that if you want to get the 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.410
 amount in each byte should divide the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.510
 x 1024 if you do not want to get so complicated 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.420
 I simply recommend that you 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.870
 divide between 1000 so that if here 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.900
 you see a value for example of 200 thousand 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.570
 let's say that would mean that the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.460
 actual download speed data 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.200
 data download would be approximately 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.450
 200 megabytes per second 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.290
 and with this you get an information 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.480
 real and accurate at all times and without 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.230
 need to download any program 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.230
 additional
