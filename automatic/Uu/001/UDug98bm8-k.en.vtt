00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.220
 family to your friends to your friends not 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.080
 There was your girlfriend to the person that you 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.060
 you want the truth is that it is a breakfast 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.400
 it's easy to make it simple 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.400
 It takes a long time and if I could do it 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.489
 We're going to need strawberries, not fabric, 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.290
 flour for hot cakes whatever your 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.700
 preference I 'm just going to make one 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.320
 cup on this occasion and all 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.399
 ingredients that he asks me in the part of 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.710
 behind 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.350
 we are going to need a frying pan too 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.410
 more planito that you find 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.350
 fork spoon everything else the dishes 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.300
 we're going to start making flour 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.699
 for hot cakes this time I 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.219
 I'm just going to make a cup there 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.469
 come back from the bag or from the box 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.799
 the measures on this occasion I only 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.210
 I'm going to make the cup to not do so much 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.100
 I forgot to tell you that we are going to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.530
 a bag and we're going to start it as 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.080
 as long as we can, we're going to put him in a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.979
 part of the support I have already made here 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.509
 my dough for for hockey and we will 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.640
 learn our pan for an egg 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.770
 okay, well, short and let's put 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.869
 butter or margarine or what you 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.429
 you need in this with lady I put 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.140
 butter so it will not stick 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:33.240
 let's start by adding flour 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.340
 pan once you get fed up you are already 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.590
 hot milestone and fire well low and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.799
 let's start to spread the flour what 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.369
 more possible that we can so that we do not 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.539
 it is so thick and we have more 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.869
 flexibility when doubling the 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.869
 roll 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.390
 Once you begin to see that the dough 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.360
 they start telling you a lot of 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.280
 little bubbles as you see it what 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.470
 let's start trying to flip no 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.710
 it matters if you break the banks like 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.660
 2015 own almost all the hot cakes 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.910
 of the banks move problems what 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.710
 we can only fix that if already 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.960
 we have to turn around just when 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.960
 everything almost everything all full of little balls 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.870
 m 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.020
 once it is on both sides 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.260
 well the son that I have done we are going to 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.270
 move to a plate where we're going to 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.270
 remember in rectangular shape 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.480
 since we have the rectangle well done 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.950
 let's take the nutella or any 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.250
 fill that you want to put and what 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.400
 let's start putting in a part of the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.050
 We are going to stretch it well 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.660
 well and then put the fruit that you 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.090
 want me this time I chose strawberry 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.670
 because I love the forces but 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.190
 you can do it with banana with kiwi 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.110
 what you fancy you are also going to 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.600
 put a little bit on the end of the 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.860
 another side to serve as glue to 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.860
 the time to close the roll 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.620
 we take the poles and we're going to put 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.450
 the way you like it in 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.670
 sliced ​​squares I decided to put them 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.770
 in slices so that it does not fall apart so 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.190
 fat roll and be easier to 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.190
 speak it 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.900
 once we put all the stuffing 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.690
 inside the roll let's start 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.510
 roll it together with the bag we are going to 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.640
 tighten enough but not too much 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.889
 like so hockey is broken 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.540
 it breaks no problem what is important is 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.340
 I reached the other end and paste it 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.500
 along with the nutella that we already put 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.870
 once we have made them we are going 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.490
 to put in the refrigerator as by average 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.889
 hour an hour to take more 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.500
 consistency once they are ready 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.570
 let's start decorating the plate in the 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.150
 that we are going to serve them only 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.180
 use the dairy basics I had there 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.600
 and I put the rolls on top of you 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.669
 add trinkets balls hearts but 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.530
 this time I only had this 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.680
 because you can produce a little 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.680
 plus 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.910
 and that easy and simple is how 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.610
 they make these rolls so delicious it 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.979
 note the compress for that person so 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.690
 special someone you have to give them and 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.240
 really that accompanied with a glass 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.270
 of milk very cold in the morning 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.190
 from break to suck fingers I wait 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.870
 that my idea has liked you not 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.690

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.669

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.669
