00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 nothing under pressure very clearly they 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.830
 were dominated by the Belgians during 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.049
 the first day 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:14.400

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.410
 co2 south korea team who showed 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.630
 a lot of quality against Russia 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.420
 Algeria and the Algerian coach 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.070
 vahid halilhodzic who is going who will do 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.190
 a lot of changes in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.680
 expects five minimum changes the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.559
 two backs from the defense so and two 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.559
 back we will find today mesbah 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.750

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.750

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.809

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.570
 today and at the attack wealth that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.109
 will also record his first match 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.690
 here in brazil a lot of pressure 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.980
 wanted to work said florian a lot 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.409
 pressure from the press 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.869
 Algerian a lot of pressure from the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.189
 on the part of the supporters and especially the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.010
 from the president of the federation 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.920
 from Algeria to mohamed rawrawa who was not 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.409
 not at all satisfied with the performance and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.930
 face of fennecs against belgium 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.360
 today he wants to our face he 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.810
 wants a first victory of Algeria 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.229
 in the world since 86 and above all especially 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.049
 the first step to realize this dream 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.240
 Algerian to qualify for the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.780
 second turn is a big dream well 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.490
 sure but it's still feasible 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.680
 thank you very much mohamed the ohada life to a 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.509
 word and nothing that algeria is going to 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.950
 wake up just now against the korea 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.329
 from the south or in any case will take three 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.009
 points to keep this dream from 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.380
 knockout I'm not I 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.990
 make a guess I'm not but I have 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.310
 I dare to actually imagine that they 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.290
 are going to make the match that everyone 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.790
 waits 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.090
 he could have done the feat on the 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.470
 first match but it's not going that they are 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.300
 gone by now now it takes power 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.160
 concretize over the duration of the 90 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.660
 minutes and leave this big match there was 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.970
 to make changes there will be some 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.440
 freshness and have to put some rhythm 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.940
 in this match to try to overflow 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.390
 these koreans who have a lot of activities 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.400
 who are difficult to play I believe that 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.040
 not all throw of what we saw in 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.110
 the first match of Algeria 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.810
 I think they had done a very 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.519
 good start led 1 0 for the Belgians 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.040
 are a little bit up a notch they 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.750
 have managed to come back from goal but I 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.040
 think we can also expect 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.870
 Korean awakening because the Koreans 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.079
 also delivered a very dull part 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.250
 against against the Russians and when we 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.689
 know this Korean team we know 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.310
 that she is capable of much better he 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.319
 are still interesting players 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.269
 in this team and I think it's going to be 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.810
 a good match because both ways 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.959
 obliged to win to continue and I 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.459
 think that 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.659
 on both sides we will see something else 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.000
 everything we saw in the first match 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.129
 this is group h of this cup of 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.750
 world and it will be at 9pm the match of 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.760
 algeria against south korea in 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.560
 a big half hour now the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.870
 first game of the day it's 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.959
 also in this group belgium russia 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.220
 it is the mythical maracana with aubin da 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.420
 fonseca he benjamin da silva 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.420
 action warm-up
