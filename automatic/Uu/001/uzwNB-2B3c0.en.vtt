you can see the 240 gigabytes and you

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.800 
you can see the 240 gigabytes and you

can see a running low in space however I

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.039 
can see a running low in space however I
feel<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.260> performance<00:03:31.910> is<00:03:32.910> worth<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.540> if<00:03:33.780> you

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
feel that performance is worth it if you

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.710 
feel that performance is worth it if you
have<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.530> compromise<00:03:34.920> speed<00:03:35.370> because<00:03:35.820> space

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
have to compromise speed because space

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.750 
have to compromise speed because space
because<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.200> can<00:03:37.440> buy<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.920> external<00:03:38.730> hard

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
because you can buy a external hard

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.610 
because you can buy a external hard
drive<00:03:39.180> but<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.840> can't<00:03:40.079> buy<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:41.690> bigger<00:03:42.690> hard

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
around Fay 5 seconds or more even as you

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.240 
around Fay 5 seconds or more even as you
don't<00:04:38.659> want<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:39.050> spend<00:04:39.289> fully<00:04:39.560> 2<00:04:39.800> seconds

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
don't want to spend fully 2 seconds

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.860 
don't want to spend fully 2 seconds
waiting<00:04:40.400> for<00:04:40.610> your<00:04:40.759> Mac<00:04:40.909> to<00:04:41.210> move<00:04:41.389> up

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
waiting for your Mac to move up

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.140 
waiting for your Mac to move up
so<00:04:42.409> overall<00:04:42.979> should<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:43.430> get<00:04:43.550> your<00:04:43.729> MacBook

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
so overall should you get your MacBook

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.600 
so overall should you get your MacBook
Pro<00:04:44.419> I<00:04:44.629> think<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:45.020> should<00:04:45.229> as<00:04:45.439> it<00:04:45.860> sports<00:04:46.400> more

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
Pro I think you should as it sports more

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.959 
Pro I think you should as it sports more
power<00:04:47.000> than<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.419> MacBook<00:04:47.599> Air<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:48.789> it's<00:04:49.789> just

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:49.969 
power than the MacBook Air and it's just

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:51.790 
power than the MacBook Air and it's just
a<00:04:50.090> compromise<00:04:50.569> really<00:04:50.990> if<00:04:51.169> you<00:04:51.590> want

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
a compromise really if you want

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.640 
a compromise really if you want
something<00:04:52.129> bit<00:04:52.370> thicker<00:04:52.699> and<00:04:53.469> upgradable<00:04:54.469> and

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
something bit thicker and upgradable and

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.490 
something bit thicker and upgradable and
just<00:04:55.280> much<00:04:55.729> more<00:04:56.060> powerful<00:04:56.599> then<00:04:57.169> you<00:04:57.319> should

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
just much more powerful then you should

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.680 
just much more powerful then you should
get<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.770> MacBook<00:04:58.159> Pro<00:04:58.460> other<00:04:59.180> whereas<00:04:59.449> if<00:04:59.569> you

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
get the MacBook Pro other whereas if you

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.020 
get the MacBook Pro other whereas if you
want<00:04:59.870> portability<00:05:00.560> I<00:05:00.770> mean<00:05:01.129> this<00:05:01.280> is<00:05:01.490> portable

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
want portability I mean this is portable

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.459 
want portability I mean this is portable
but<00:05:02.180> it's<00:05:02.300> not<00:05:02.449> a<00:05:02.479> sport<00:05:02.840> where's<00:05:03.050> map<00:05:03.229> over

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
but it's not a sport where's map over

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.249 
but it's not a sport where's map over
here<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:04.430> if<00:05:04.639> you<00:05:04.759> want<00:05:04.940> proper<00:05:05.629> portability

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
here so if you want proper portability

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:07.869 
here so if you want proper portability
where<00:05:06.500> something<00:05:06.830> is<00:05:06.919> very<00:05:07.190> light<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:07.789> I

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
where something is very light and I

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:09.279
