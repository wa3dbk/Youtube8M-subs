00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.280
 each adds his pair of things and so 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.710

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.560
 When you have passion and your vocation 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.270
 everything can not be afraid of 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.520
 vocations and what inside 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.950
 we feel because the future is insured 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.310
 with hard in the things with desire I do not know 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.310
