00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.430
 hello to all today we will see 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.200
 how to silence these cupcakes 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.000
 Gourmaud these are small squares 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.740
 marble and chocolate with the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.150
 peanuts 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.490
 you will see it's a real treat and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.259
 his request no cooking 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.449
 so we will start by filing the 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.410
 notebooks from the oven rack for one and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.330
 grill 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.240
 but beware we do not want to give them 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.099
 when it starts to brown we will add 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.470
 sesame seeds 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.480
 as they are small creams so we 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.830
 can not put them at the same time as the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.620
 cac 40 cements often burned so we go 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.559
 let cool a little and then we go 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.350
 switch to the mixer to grind but 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.360
 without reducing them completely against 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.150
 they will have to be left slightly 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.710
 crunchy instead of peanuts one can 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.909
 make other dried fruit mixes 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.250
 like fines screening or hazelnut 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.290
 free to you to make the mixtures that 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.680
 you want according to your tastes and your 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.809
 cravings 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.580
 so once mixer you put everything 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.580
 in a large container and you add 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.350
 the rest ingredients honey we go 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.930
 put a part now a part 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.820
 as water is mixed 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.650
 of orange blossom to perfume 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.240
 cathos and i will add also in to the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.370
 cinnamon powder that's it 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.680
 optional if you do not like cinnamon 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.380
 you can do without 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.660
 we will mix by adding honey 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.060
 until we have a compact mix 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.210
 and who can hold the form that I am 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210
 given 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.770
 dress up a rectangular dish or squares 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.439
 parchment paper arrange your 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.259
 mix on and went especially the 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.189
 flat trying to equalize the surface 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.189
 and the thickness 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.450
 you can use the bottom of a glass 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.050
 to properly tamped the mixture and equalize 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.050
 the surface 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.709
 I melt 100 g of dark chocolate 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.370
 and I'm going to spread it all over 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.370
 of the gafi 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.400
 I have cold blood on it 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.800
 ambient until the chocolate 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.460
 begins to harden 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.960
 and then using a large tray and a 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.320
 powerful paper I'm going to put the 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.750
 cookie upside down so as to have the 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.460
 chocolate party downstairs have to do it 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.850
 gently so as not to break the 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.850
 biscuit 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.290
 I melted black chocolates 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.900
 and whites separately I prepare my 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.100
 silicone pen that I will fill 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.700
 with white chocolate for the 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.890
 decoration 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.270
 you can also use a small corner 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.360
 baking paper 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.569
 so I want peace our hunger it's 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.730
 cake with a layer of dark chocolate 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.790
 then I have just drawn lines in 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.840
 white chocolate and make marble age to 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.090
 using a knife 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.100
 all this will have to be done quickly enough 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.370
 before the chocolate starts to 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.370
 harden 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.690
 once you have finished 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.370
 decorating your cake leave you 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.739
 cool to room temperature 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.780
 do not put in the fridge otherwise the chocolate 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.040
 is going to be too hard and he has this case it's 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.420
 at the moment you cut out so we go 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.370
 cut small squares or 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.940
 tits do not hesitate use a 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.709
 rule to measure and have small 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.830
 cakes that they will have about the same 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.830
 cut 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.029
 once you have cuts and 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.620
 cakes 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.180
 you can put them in the fridge for 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.949
 harden and then we put them in a 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.169
 hermetic box to keep them for 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.939
 still several weeks 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.439
