bias lighting we kind of saw a little

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.620 
bias lighting we kind of saw a little
bit<00:00:16.900> of<00:00:16.960> this<00:00:17.230> at<00:00:17.440> CES<00:00:18.130> and<00:00:18.520> now<00:00:19.180> they<00:00:19.450> have<00:00:19.480> the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
product available for purchase but what

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.839 
product available for purchase but what
it<00:00:22.660> is<00:00:22.689> is<00:00:22.840> basically<00:00:23.619> a<00:00:23.650> backlight<00:00:24.400> for<00:00:24.730> your

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
it is is basically a backlight for your

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.749 
it is is basically a backlight for your
monitor<00:00:25.330> and<00:00:25.480> what<00:00:26.439> this<00:00:26.650> does<00:00:26.710> is<00:00:27.279> if<00:00:27.550> your

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
monitor and what this does is if your

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.820 
monitor and what this does is if your
monitor<00:00:28.150> is<00:00:28.179> close<00:00:28.480> to<00:00:28.689> a<00:00:28.779> wall<00:00:29.140> source<00:00:29.500> or

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
monitor is close to a wall source or

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.529 
monitor is close to a wall source or
anything<00:00:30.220> it'll<00:00:30.369> put<00:00:30.699> a<00:00:30.730> nice<00:00:30.970> little<00:00:31.210> light

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
anything it'll put a nice little light

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.680 
anything it'll put a nice little light
perimeter<00:00:32.140> around<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.619> rear<00:00:32.920> where<00:00:33.690> it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
perimeter around the rear where it

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.440 
perimeter around the rear where it
basically<00:00:34.900> creates<00:00:35.830> a<00:00:36.160> light<00:00:36.370> contrast<00:00:37.090> so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
basically creates a light contrast so

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.040 
basically creates a light contrast so
this<00:00:38.440> will<00:00:38.620> help<00:00:38.770> reduce<00:00:38.980> eye<00:00:39.430> fatigue

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
this will help reduce eye fatigue

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.870 
this will help reduce eye fatigue
enhanced<00:00:41.050> color<00:00:41.260> definition<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.310> then

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
enhanced color definition and then

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.690 
enhanced color definition and then
increase<00:00:43.450> hours<00:00:44.380> you<00:00:44.650> can<00:00:44.860> view<00:00:45.160> because<00:00:45.430> you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
increase hours you can view because you

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.720 
increase hours you can view because you
don't<00:00:45.850> have<00:00:45.970> as<00:00:46.240> much<00:00:46.420> strain<00:00:46.930> on<00:00:46.960> your<00:00:47.290> eyes

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
don't have as much strain on your eyes

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.030 
don't have as much strain on your eyes
