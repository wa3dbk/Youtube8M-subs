00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.630
 Hello and welcome today 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.969
 sometimes a video about his africa 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.950
 and so it should look like when finished 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:18.250
 is 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:25.390
 is pasted stomp fontana one with 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:30.040
 cut one last turn for the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.439
 Radlauf something like a blade that the 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.070
 really difficult not to deal with 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.280
 scissors they will partly corner for 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.880
 two with detergent the body of 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.860
 make them dust-free in fat and with 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.470
 also dust off a duster 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.500
 because otherwise you have to paint 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.920
 problems i will now the body 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.020
 Convenient that would be step 3 everything 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.239
 will not be blocked thus 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:03.550
 the window handle the holes of 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.700
 outside with a tape to do that 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.960
 the paint will be everything you want 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.590
 just did not want to paint first 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.590
 submit 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.930
 so that was already taped three 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.360
 everything and always clean when we die 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.520
 and so everything works fine 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.409
 not properly taped is later 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:32.460
 painted is trying now at the 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.100
 paint a slight effect 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:42.340
 green purple as the main color but should 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.899
 stay blue and always 30 to 40 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.209
 centimeters away from the body 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:53.170
 mark and then thin layers and 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:55.149
 always blow dry with a hair dryer 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.069
 usual movie and never the woman's 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.979
 because there is stress because of it 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.020
 recycle sucked air 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.240
 if there is still ongoing operation sees 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.079
 maybe you are pursuing pursuit 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.019
 that just means stress with a woman's mother 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.599
 girlfriend etc so i will go now 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.079
 paint and then I'll show you that 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.079
 Result 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.159
 so the first wax layer around it 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.480
 maybe you can tell it's it 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:31.700
 a little song shimmers 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.269
 Lackschicht is quite expensive only 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.400
 a little bit worse 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.400
 Now I start with the basic color 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.010
 again a little break for you me 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.010
 I'll be right back 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.540
 so here I am again our blue 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.989
 finished in many thin layers and 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.150
 I'm always terrified 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:09.000
 thin layer worries fill the next one 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:14.250
 layer and work carefully so that 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.870
 blue now too average 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.260
 Shimmer is there you can still complete 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:25.739
 see through either of me 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:30.870
 were either white with the 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:33.000
 normal price or with black depending on 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.069
 you will have the color look brighter 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.030
 or dark at hella course white and 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.030
 if you want it dark 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.220
 black how about it then white 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.260
 I make my color a bit 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.590
 light trade and then I get in touch 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.590
 again 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.510
 Now we know the first layer 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:01.850
 you look very thin 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:10.880
 then , for example, we grab a blackboard 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:10.880
 not for that but both have 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.139
 the white lacquer coating is now too 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.430
 finished from the outside of course now 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.780
 a little bit before up with a bit 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.690
 You can not change the floor so 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.040
 Of course you can still slice 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.810
 once with either a black paint 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.220
 that was what it looked like 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:36.520
 completely light and casual you can 0 1 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.830
 look or take a sip 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.449
 hit the ps 31 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.150
 biting quite so dark looks at everyone 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:56.010
 that looks realistic is what it is 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:59.350
 pretty much to do the sparkle 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.240
 rear window simply the sticker theme 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.039
 previously applied has just come down 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.550
 Be careful with one 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:09.970
 cutter knife careful intro 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.880
 window row the sticker easily 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.039
 inscribe 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.639
 always nice compassion not that one 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.639
 cuts 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:32.560
 turn down this sticker rather like that 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:35.040
 from so I now want from the outside 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.040
 cut away 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:05.740
 now quite simply because we with the ps 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.740
 31 or go over it as usual black 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:14.000
 so we have done our shying too 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.780
 if you do not go against it you will see 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.919
 that you are still female 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.840
 see through can thus learn with the 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.020
 paint finish now we remove 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.100
 all the films from the windows this 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:32.660
 these are the taillights because 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:36.650
 everything where we have taped off after that is 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:40.550
 outside a forum for early fog 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:43.220
 they we see just down and 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.350
 so our car would be finished painted 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.700
 the next step is because of that 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:51.560
 enclosed sticker set 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.729
 But you do that in a clean place and 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.729
 with much peace and patience 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:01.550
 so we are done with ours 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:04.510
 We can remove paint before you can 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:09.039
 the picture thinks the result looks like 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.039
 now only this sticker 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:18.840
 either by own measure or loud 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:22.500
 manufacturer program with this manual 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:25.349
 apply and still consume with 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.050
 spoiler or the like all he did 

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:29.370
 has and therefore we would be finished and 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.620
 paint and I thank you 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.860
 for watching and I wish you much 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:37.009
 fun while painting 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.009
 See you
