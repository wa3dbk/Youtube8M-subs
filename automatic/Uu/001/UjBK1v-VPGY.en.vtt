we've<00:00:14.610> simulated<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.480> little<00:00:15.929> model<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.500> what

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
we've simulated a little model of what

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.019 
we've simulated a little model of what
you<00:00:16.980> would<00:00:17.070> find<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.460> typical<00:00:17.820> wall

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
you would find in typical wall

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.599 
you would find in typical wall
construction<00:00:18.680> I'm<00:00:19.680> going<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> use<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> square

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
construction I'm going to use a square

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.109 
construction I'm going to use a square
to<00:00:21.060> find<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> center<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.769> stud<00:00:23.039> which<00:00:23.820> in

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
to find the center of the stud which in

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.540 
to find the center of the stud which in
my<00:00:24.449> model<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:25.109> clearly<00:00:25.380> see<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:26.130> however

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
my model I can clearly see here however

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.089 
my model I can clearly see here however
in<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.359> new<00:00:27.510> installation<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.590> would<00:00:28.710> mark<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
in a new installation you would mark the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.120 
in a new installation you would mark the
Centers<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.640> studs<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.560> then<00:00:31.560> use<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
Centers of the studs and then use a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.220 
Centers of the studs and then use a
square<00:00:32.460> accordingly<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.510> typically<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.020> want

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
square accordingly so typically you want

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.780 
square accordingly so typically you want
to<00:00:34.320> install<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.829> screws<00:00:35.100> six<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.670> eight

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
to install the screws six to eight

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.240 
to install the screws six to eight
inches<00:00:36.120> apart<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.050> stud<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.219> to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
inches apart on the stud so I'm going to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.030 
inches apart on the stud so I'm going to
keep<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> screw<00:00:38.820> centered<00:00:39.530> I'm<00:00:40.530> using<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
keep the screw centered I'm using a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.330 
keep the screw centered I'm using a
screw<00:00:41.280> gun<00:00:41.719> to<00:00:42.719> apply<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.020> screw<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.710> this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
screw gun to apply the screw and this

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.810 
screw gun to apply the screw and this
particular<00:00:44.789> bit<00:00:45.629> has<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> stop<00:00:46.860> built<00:00:47.340> into<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
particular bit has a stop built into it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.630 
particular bit has a stop built into it
but<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.629> screw<00:00:49.020> head<00:00:49.410> doesn't<00:00:50.190> flow

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
but so that the screw head doesn't flow

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.630 
but so that the screw head doesn't flow
entirely<00:00:51.449> through<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.170> sheetrock<00:00:52.520> again<00:00:53.520> I'm

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
entirely through the sheetrock again I'm

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.430 
entirely through the sheetrock again I'm
going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.850> keep<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.149> centered<00:00:57.320> driving<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
going to keep it centered driving the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.529 
going to keep it centered driving the
screw<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:59.160> until<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.760> reaches<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.210> paper

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
screw just until it reaches the paper

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.380 
screw just until it reaches the paper
not<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.410> through<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> drywall<00:01:01.949> paper<00:01:02.489> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
not going through the drywall paper you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.880 
not going through the drywall paper you
also<00:01:03.570> want<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.840> apply<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> screws<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
also want to apply the screws in the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.640 
also want to apply the screws in the
same<00:01:05.100> fashion<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.729> any<00:01:05.909> drywall<00:01:06.210> plates<00:01:06.810> or

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
same fashion to any drywall plates or

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.950 
same fashion to any drywall plates or
window<00:01:08.159> surrounds<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.330> another<00:01:09.570> circumstance

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
window surrounds so another circumstance

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.250 
window surrounds so another circumstance
is<00:01:11.030> when<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.360> two<00:01:12.600> sheets<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.020> drywall

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
is when you have two sheets of drywall

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.070 
is when you have two sheets of drywall
that<00:01:13.650> meet<00:01:13.950> center<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.939> stud<00:01:15.210> or<00:01:15.479> form<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that meet center of a stud or form a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.230 
that meet center of a stud or form a
butt<00:01:16.290> joint<00:01:16.490> you're<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> need<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.909> screw

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
butt joint you're going to need to screw

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.719 
butt joint you're going to need to screw
the<00:01:18.390> joints<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.439> typically<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.040> main<00:01:20.189> concern

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the joints so typically the main concern

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
the joints so typically the main concern
is<00:01:21.030> driving<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.750> screw<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.290> without

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
is driving the screw in without

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.380 
is driving the screw in without
affecting<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> edge<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> drywall<00:01:26.390> so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
affecting the edge of the drywall so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.590 
affecting the edge of the drywall so
rather<00:01:28.080> than<00:01:28.409> holding<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> screw<00:01:29.759> straight

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
rather than holding the screw straight

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.660 
rather than holding the screw straight
into<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> stud<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.770> normal<00:01:32.490> application

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
into the stud in the normal application

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.760 
into the stud in the normal application
when<00:01:33.659> you're<00:01:33.810> doing<00:01:34.049> buck<00:01:34.259> joints<00:01:34.650> you're

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
when you're doing buck joints you're

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.030 
when you're doing buck joints you're
kind<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.040> trying<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.310> want<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.700> go<00:01:36.799> towards<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
kind of trying to want to go towards the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.719 
kind of trying to want to go towards the
stud<00:01:38.340> from<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> outside<00:01:40.130> if<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.310> come<00:01:41.520> too

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
stud from the outside if you come too

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.940 
stud from the outside if you come too
close<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> edge<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> drywall<00:01:43.290> what

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
close to the edge of the drywall what

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.069 
close to the edge of the drywall what
you'll<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> ripple<00:01:44.939> effect<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
you'll get is a ripple effect in the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.469 
you'll get is a ripple effect in the
