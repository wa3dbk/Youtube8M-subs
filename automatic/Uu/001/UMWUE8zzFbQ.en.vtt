00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.810
 ladies still won a bronze medal to start an investigation now so high up 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.660
 the banner 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.189
 and for me personally don't win anything today 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:12.899
 I have to work myself out of the water 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.939
 but luckily a but out with a bit therefore gets moments and 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:18.509
 goes up 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:19.909
 really quiet 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:22.600
 I have 10 lessons with my own age and 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.140
 the last training 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.509
 so teachers must save 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.509
 holla sonja 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.189
 2 he says that they went and 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.890
 and to be and always with three gymnasts in a team 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.880
 the team counts three gymnasts and ultimately two best scores count 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.140
 so I can afford a mistake 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.020
 and 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.400
 see in the case of lisa keg after well collected and 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.750
 and not and therefore not leave much out of it anyway 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.660
 partly attention to me the stock markets down rico 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.090
 yes about yes since yes yes i made it yesterday if it was outside 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.960
 brought and then it became exciting and harry of the three and we really lay 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.870
 very close together in terms of level 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.800
 and who then yes I am running really fast luck that afternoon 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.350
 well finished with a 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.690
 what just returned from a competition 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.020
 yes that is very happy 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.530
 and we will see three times now where they are not all back 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.119
 yes i still have exciting final goes saturday and i see that 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:22.980
 review 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.810
 what a lot of smoke 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.650
 I am not going to align everything chance close together 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.760
 this is for sure i'm just going to try the maximum and otherwise don't see much 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.700
 the jury number ten years ago 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.940
 and back in the final 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.500
 what do you expect from it 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.020
 my finals and final and in the final a fact always everything open 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.680
 and entering fourth is a bit of a means 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.470
 they will see 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.130
 Finally the door curve is a good option 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.240
 I know him beam and floor final 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.500
 emmen 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.730
 Yes Yes 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.500
 I have no idea where we had dike chances with its name actually 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.009
 I just keep busy 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.500
 doing the good exercise for myself and 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.660
 we'll see what it's worth 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.120
 see this afternoon somewhat arriving today about a college over 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.719
 say 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:11.559
 then of course we entered fourth today 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:14.989
 and at least it can only succeed to finish it 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.500
 in general and we did it is i am very proud of these lines 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.069
 nijmegen nec count it is crazy it is unfair that you have to go on for so long 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.599
 wait we are actually better only your own performance 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.709
 and then it is a very long wait 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.829
 In the last matches I know for sure that they do not eat enough and 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.949
 it is a number of good countries and is the first we leave behind 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.039
 it was very exciting in May 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.049
 yes finally agree 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.159
 it always better be able to start this tournament or miss the nicest thing there is 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.049
 we do work the best there is and we all have a great price 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.769
 this maher medal around the neck to neck 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.620

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.920
 there is falling before the end is well there can there 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.039
 of course very proud of its end 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:02.279

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.449
