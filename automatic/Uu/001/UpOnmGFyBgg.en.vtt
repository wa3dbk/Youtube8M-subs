 But the brand oil is such 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.400
 they were zealous we say the amount of power 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.519
 530 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.230
 fully synthetic oil it here 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.439
 such is such a gray canister 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.730
 sold premium on course for 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.039
 passenger cars 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:32.969
 so this then throw out provides 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.320
 maximum effect and sverdlin and 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.559
 oil change interval 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:45.440
 Well, that's all and fruit sticks 530 will 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.440
 by numbering target api 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.910
 increases his enhanced protection 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.649
 then this route is premium when 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.890
 running in extreme conditions well then 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.120
 there is 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.059
 our Russian there at -30 degrees 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.130
 suitable for drilling intervals 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:10.530
 oil change well here it is access thousands 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.490
 mileage recommended this mass and here 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.049
 after 100,000 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.200
 max live vol malin 540 also completely 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:22.080
 synthetic oil behaved as if 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.979
 whom to not flush red at run more 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:30.290
 a hundred thousand kilometers too for 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.750
 troubled engine life 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.460
 semi-synthetic engine oil but 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.790
 premium specifically for move 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.560
 high mileage 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.509
 I think that as a manufacturer to say 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.509
 claims can reduce fuel consumption 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.680
 complies with the ford specification 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.950
 I also want to say that with the right 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.990
 replacement is necessary that when 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.250
 How will you change the word mom 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.479
 leaf drain your old butter more precisely 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.940

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.649
 fill it opens easily 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.649
 20 minutes of idle engine work 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:22.200
 poured the old oil poured valine snow 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:27.420
 inexpensive range let's say how we take 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:33.950
