00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.850
 watch beds today I find you 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.589
 for the Wednesday video game sorry 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.300
 last week because in 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.700
 did I have not too many ideas for the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.590
 theme and in addition to that I have not at all 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 the time to film suddenly and I 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.550
 asked for a feeling and they are not 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.039
 the theme is to tell you what to do 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.439
 when and so the question of the week 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.300
 it's nasco favorite books of the moment 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.220
 must know that I am a girl who 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.680
 not like at all related finally for example 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.929
 the books I have at school etc 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.120
 I read them out of obligation but I do not like 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.309
 not the art of time even today I have 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.380
 decided to present you a novel that 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.129
 I read for school a lot of years ago 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.899
 but it's a novel that I loved and I 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.430
 think it'll make me want to 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.280
 new places in fact it's history 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.350
 of angry helena from lorena to hickok she 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.649
 is 6 years old and start of the book she 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.120
 is blind deaf and dumb is actually 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.000
 she is going to bring in a person who is going 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.910
 help him is anne who will live at zen 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 finally at home I have the family what and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.170
 in fact she will have things 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.670
 extraordinary 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.320
 it's really a very, very, very 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.840
 touching and not me who does not like at all 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.930
 to read bah he really touched me that's 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.700
 come from the junior pocket and when you 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.890
 look at the pages his writings we lose 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.770
 big but good I tell you I do not like 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.330
 really wirtgen you will excuse me must 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.280
 know that I really like the activities 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.330
 manual and so when I'm bored 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.720
 often play I try to do this kind 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.900
 of things that I love to create 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.250
 things and that's so I hit 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.650
 I was little box you can create 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.240
 jewelry and well I love doing that or 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.430
 even 20 to redesign and it was 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.700
 after if you like to write well I think 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.119
 that it can be in remedy against 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.450
 boredom 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.770
 here is write your day write 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.170
 things that would want by the head and 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.759
 it's a passion like any other 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.950
 I know that writing is not my big 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.590
 dada but what I like a lot is 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.810
 made 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.549
 east you are a proof for once 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.159
 him too but I really like doing 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.210
 lists lists a little for all well 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.609
 sure if you are passionate about 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.200
 photography so yes very well take 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.569
 photos of anything and everything 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.459
 even to go outside to stroll 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.690
 to wander for this case a little 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.010
 electronic 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.450
 of course you can very well and 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.819
 maybe the music you can very 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.849
 well also phoned friends for 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.670
 to have spoken and so on and of course 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.720
 watch TV anyway 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.590
 not very interesting things 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.380
 sometimes it's a cure for boredom 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.720
 after not everyone on TV we are 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.030
 okay but if our dishes on 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.530
 the computer I think if you 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.790
 watch this video is that you have 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.730
 surely a computer from a phone 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.250
 notebook or tablet and so on and 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.569
 can you use it for precisely 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.069
 surf the internet 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.540
 most often I watch videos 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.069
 youtube but if I have nothing more to 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.420
 watch 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.390
 I will hang out on websites of 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.959
 makeup clothes etc and I'm going 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.970
 just look full full 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.920
 full of envy I really like to make 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.500
 8 lists is like lists actually 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.150
 for me and so suddenly I'm you 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.069

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.430
 that's what I find super interesting 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.290
 as well 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.920
 on the internet you have a lot of 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.410
 forums to help people and that's 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.269
 really hyper important I find 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.280
 and that's it if you have nothing to do you 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.630
 really want to help people do not hesitate 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.639
 do not go on the internet watch 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.180
 forums I will put the link of a forum in 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.849
 info bar 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.049
 in fact it's a site where you put 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.209
 your class etc 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.880
 and if you have difficulties to 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.019
 post your exercise where your course and 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.389
 people explain to you 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.700
 finally I think it's really great 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.870
 friendly and I signed up there 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.700
 on because I have problems in 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.609
 physical and here I would like 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.919

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.720
 but here I will put you the link in 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.709
 info bar 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.170
 if you have time do not hesitate 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.940
 no I do not know me m for the 6th 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.370
 things like that and explain to 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.720
 sixth of things you know after 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.030
 it depends on the passions but you can 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.400
 very well cook it or even sort it 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.020
 tidy up clean your room your 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.290
 house or your apartment 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.959
 if we could take care of you 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.980
 scrubs masks 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.930

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.669
 also after I already wanted said that's it 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.459

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.970
 to walk in the forest at the edge of the 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.650
 beach or even on the street while 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.410
 just go to the movies 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.550
 things like that here I think we 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.970
 still lucky to live 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:36.290
 during in countries that are not bad 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:39.220
 easy and and I think that here we have a 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.320
 life that a lot of kids will dream about and 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.540
