00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.799
 development and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.990
 conclusion what should I use in paragraph 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.859
 of each item to instigate my 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.849
 reader 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.490
 the interest in reading until the end now 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.520
 this is not a newspaper article from 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.500
 magazine the journalist we talk like this 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.240
 looks at the best argument goes 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.730
 passing through what is weak for what to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.859
 hold the reader your reader it goes 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.660
 have him he he he has what he is 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.340
 being paid for it 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.890
 now it is clear that if he is reading 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.059
 countless relationships if you can get a 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.950
 differential with is bad, even though 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.469
 in the contest you do not earn points you 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.300
 loses more or less so if your test 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.579
 Ten of you are ten. 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.950
 to the extent that you miss them 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.780
 this point is being withdrawn 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.640
 if you have a clear proof and without you 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.620
 You have 100 as far as you are. 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.010
 points are being withdrawn 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.350
 now between the introduction paragraphs 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.930
 development, for example you can 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.850
 use connectives the first factor 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.530
 relevant to be analyzed 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.710
 there is another argument that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.720
 second factor another factor furthermore 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.070
 You'll make a conclusion, can you? 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.619
 putting the collective as before is 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.689
 therefore it is understood that now what 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.970
 sometimes I mentor my students and 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.700
 so you are now mine. 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.960
 students at this time to do is the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.310
 next, the person suddenly goes 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.740
 finish with so but everyone 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.079
 ends with people everywhere 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.740
 ends up like that instead of the person saying 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.170
 like this 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.759
 therefore understands that the work of a 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.680
 police officer is relevant 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.250
 the person thus says the work of a 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.240
 are therefore relevant by placing 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.189
 this non-direct collective in the beginning as 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.110
 was put there in question the question 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.509
 said look what I should use in paragraph 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.230
 of each item as if I had 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.840
 have a word right there 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.610
 this but putting it in 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.350
 rather than saying that the first factor to 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.140
 being considered is a salary issue 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.610
 I speak the salary issue is the first 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.440
 factor to be considered 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.230
 that is you can move a little 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.720
 these collectives and this attracts reader yes 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:14.150
 but more than attracting locates the reader 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.530
 that I like this kind of conjunction is 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.200
 that the person reading is already having 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.990
 a sense of what it is going to 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.610
 find and then it works as 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.520
 same kind of script 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.050
 connectives make life easier, yes more 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.050
 should not be used
