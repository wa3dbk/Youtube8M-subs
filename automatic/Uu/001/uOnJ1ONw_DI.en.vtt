as<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:11.490> can<00:00:11.670> probably<00:00:11.910> tell<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.480> first<00:00:12.660> level

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
as you can probably tell the first level

as you can probably tell the first level
as<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> quarry<00:00:13.380> as<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.650> wanted<00:00:13.950> an<00:00:14.070> industrial

thing<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.789> also<00:00:23.789> hope<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.330> add<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.720> some<00:00:24.869> color

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
thing I also hope to add in some color

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.900 
thing I also hope to add in some color
to<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> level<00:00:25.830> through<00:00:26.070> these<00:00:26.250> elements<00:00:26.760> we

to the level through these elements we

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.640 
to the level through these elements we
set<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.269> moment<00:00:27.660> from<00:00:27.930> looking<00:00:28.170> around<00:00:28.320> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
set the moment from looking around you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.710 
set the moment from looking around you
can<00:00:28.769> probably<00:00:28.980> tell<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.730> too<00:00:30.179> brown<00:00:30.449> it's

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
can probably tell it's too brown it's

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720 
can probably tell it's too brown it's
too<00:00:30.900> gray<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.710> colors<00:00:32.099> are<00:00:32.219> generally<00:00:32.579> just

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
too gray the colors are generally just

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
too gray the colors are generally just
quite<00:00:33.000> drab<00:00:34.489> when<00:00:35.489> designing<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.239> level<00:00:36.570> I

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
quite drab when designing the level I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.450 
quite drab when designing the level I
took<00:00:37.079> into<00:00:37.350> account<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.920> people<00:00:38.070> would<00:00:38.430> want

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
took into account that people would want

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.299 
took into account that people would want
to<00:00:38.700> tackle<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.329> differently<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> chose<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
to tackle it differently so I chose to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.549 
to tackle it differently so I chose to
include<00:00:41.640> ways<00:00:41.969> where<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.809> could<00:00:43.230> quite

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
include ways where you could quite

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.970 
include ways where you could quite
simply<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.250> attack<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.789> enemy<00:00:45.059> head-on<00:00:45.300> or

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
simply just attack the enemy head-on or

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.340 
simply just attack the enemy head-on or
so<00:00:46.980> perhaps<00:00:47.579> find<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.969> vantage<00:00:48.210> point<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.989> snipe

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
so perhaps find a vantage point to snipe

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.100 
so perhaps find a vantage point to snipe
them<00:00:49.590> before<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.399> or<00:00:50.850> even<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:51.960> those

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
them before going in or even for those

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.720 
them before going in or even for those
who<00:00:52.289> prefer<00:00:52.469> stealth<00:00:53.129> there<00:00:53.460> would<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
who prefer stealth there would be a

used<00:01:51.600> animations<00:01:52.290> didn't<00:01:52.740> work<00:01:52.979> with

happened with 2.61

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.350 
happened with 2.61
so<00:01:58.860> much<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> work<00:01:59.700> over<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> past<00:02:00.180> couple

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
so much of the work over the past couple

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.450 
so much of the work over the past couple
of<00:02:00.600> months<00:02:00.840> gameplay<00:02:01.649> wise<00:02:01.860> has<00:02:02.130> been<00:02:02.340> on

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
of months gameplay wise has been on

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.340 
of months gameplay wise has been on
trying<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.939> get<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.299> work<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.869> used<00:02:04.049> to

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
trying to get it to work like it used to

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.130 
trying to get it to work like it used to
the<00:02:06.340> system<00:02:06.760> for<00:02:06.940> multiple<00:02:07.330> animations<00:02:07.690> has

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
the system for multiple animations has

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.260 
the system for multiple animations has
been<00:02:08.380> in<00:02:08.470> place<00:02:08.619> for<00:02:08.710> quite<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.130> while<00:02:09.429> but<00:02:10.179> I

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
been in place for quite a while but I

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.880 
been in place for quite a while but I
finally<00:02:10.450> actually<00:02:10.780> got<00:02:11.110> back<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.440> making<00:02:11.650> a

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
finally actually got back to making a

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.470 
finally actually got back to making a
couple<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.550> different<00:02:12.880> animations<00:02:13.330> for

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
couple of the different animations for

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.460 
couple of the different animations for
the<00:02:13.600> different<00:02:13.930> weapons<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.690> far<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.110> weapons

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
the different weapons so far the weapons

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.440 
the different weapons so far the weapons
which<00:02:17.650> have<00:02:17.860> animations<00:02:18.490> are<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> pistol<00:02:19.240> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
which have animations are the pistol the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.860 
which have animations are the pistol the
SMG<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.590> main<00:02:20.770> rifle<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:22.510> rocket

SMG and the main rifle and the rocket
has<00:02:23.050> idle<00:02:23.470> animations<00:02:24.100> but<00:02:24.550> none<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:24.910> the

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
has idle animations but none of the

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.710 
has idle animations but none of the
reloading<00:02:25.720> or<00:02:26.140> firing<00:02:26.530> ones<00:02:26.980> yet<00:02:27.390> all<00:02:28.390> the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
other weapons so far are using the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.610 
other weapons so far are using the
rifles<00:02:31.180> animations<00:02:31.750> just<00:02:31.870> as<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> placeholder

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
rifles animations just as a placeholder

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.990 
rifles animations just as a placeholder
for<00:02:33.130> now<00:02:34.470> I've<00:02:35.470> now<00:02:35.920> included<00:02:36.430> grenades<00:02:36.790> in

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
for now I've now included grenades in

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.870 
for now I've now included grenades in
the<00:02:37.120> game<00:02:37.680> model<00:02:38.680> sound<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.280> explosion

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
the game model sound and explosion

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.479 
the game model sound and explosion
effector<00:02:40.300> just<00:02:40.510> placeholders<00:02:41.370> however<00:02:42.370> I

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
effector just placeholders however I

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.940 
effector just placeholders however I
felt<00:02:42.850> grenades<00:02:43.300> are<00:02:43.600> another<00:02:44.320> punch<00:02:44.709> that

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
felt grenades are another punch that

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.880 
felt grenades are another punch that
they<00:02:45.100> really<00:02:45.370> needed<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.670> be<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:45.910> there

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
they really needed to be in there

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.170 
they really needed to be in there
currently<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.070> only<00:02:48.220> problem<00:02:48.700> with<00:02:48.820> grenades

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
currently the only problem with grenades

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.060 
currently the only problem with grenades
is<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.540> there's<00:02:49.750> different<00:02:50.080> animations<00:02:50.680> on

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
is that there's different animations on

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.970 
is that there's different animations on
each<00:02:51.220> gun<00:02:51.550> for<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.270> controls<00:02:52.930> which<00:02:53.680> makes

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
each gun for the controls which makes

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.560 
each gun for the controls which makes
the<00:02:54.130> actual<00:02:54.340> behavior<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.239> grenades

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
the actual behavior of the grenades

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.840 
the actual behavior of the grenades
different<00:02:56.050> for<00:02:56.440> example<00:02:56.890> with<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.130> SMG<00:02:57.670> you

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
different for example with the SMG you

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.740 
different for example with the SMG you
can't<00:02:58.090> quite<00:02:59.190> be<00:03:00.190> life--all<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.690> don't

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
can't quite be life--all and I don't

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.960 
can't quite be life--all and I don't
want<00:03:02.080> that<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.530> game<00:03:02.739> because<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.730> don't

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
want that in the game because you don't

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.460 
want that in the game because you don't
want<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.420> have<00:03:04.630> grenades<00:03:05.019> and<00:03:05.200> have<00:03:05.320> them

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
want to have grenades and have them

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.250 
want to have grenades and have them
behavior<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:07.120> behave<00:03:07.690> in<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.870> way<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.080> don't

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
behavior and behave in a way you don't

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.890 
behavior and behave in a way you don't
expect<00:03:08.860> them<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:09.489> then<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.510> be<00:03:10.630> killed

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
expect them to and then to be killed

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.970 
expect them to and then to be killed
because<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:13.350> there's<00:03:14.350> now<00:03:14.500> an<00:03:14.650> effect

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
because of it there's now an effect

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.070 
because of it there's now an effect
applied<00:03:15.370> upon<00:03:15.640> death<00:03:15.940> instead<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.510> just<00:03:16.840> four

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
applied upon death instead of just four

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.170 
applied upon death instead of just four
bits<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.830> screen<00:03:18.190> has<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.400> couple<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.820> filters

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
bits the screen has a couple of filters

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.270 
bits the screen has a couple of filters
which<00:03:19.360> come<00:03:19.630> up<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:19.959> this<00:03:20.380> also<00:03:20.590> happens<00:03:20.920> when

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
which come up and this also happens when

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.449 
which come up and this also happens when
taking<00:03:22.060> damage<00:03:22.590> right<00:03:23.590> now<00:03:23.650> health<00:03:24.130> slowly

taking damage right now health slowly
regenerates<00:03:25.120> over<00:03:25.390> time<00:03:25.630> however<00:03:25.900> I<00:03:26.170> change

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.190 
regenerates over time however I change
it<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.220> regenerate<00:03:27.700> quite<00:03:27.940> quickly<00:03:28.269> this<00:03:28.989> will

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
it to regenerate quite quickly this will

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.050 
it to regenerate quite quickly this will
hopefully<00:03:29.410> prevent<00:03:30.040> people<00:03:30.280> having<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.820> sit

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
hopefully prevent people having to sit

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.550 
hopefully prevent people having to sit
behind<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.540> rock<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.780> waiting<00:03:32.260> for<00:03:32.290> their

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
to run out and really get into the meat

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.340 
to run out and really get into the meat

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
of the game minor updates that haven't

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.650 
of the game minor updates that haven't
actually<00:03:41.590> been<00:03:41.920> a<00:03:41.950> huge<00:03:42.280> amount<00:03:42.660> shootings

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660
