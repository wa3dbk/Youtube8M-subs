00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
open okay so there's a nice little

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.190 
open okay so there's a nice little
package

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
package

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.699 
package
include<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.759> we<00:02:08.209> get<00:02:08.660> lots<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.349> something

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
but it's it's not very thick considering

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.830 
but it's it's not very thick considering
the<00:02:19.430> amount<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.790> strength<00:02:20.390> fleece<00:02:20.629> things
