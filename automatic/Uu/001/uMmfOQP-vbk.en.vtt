00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.910
 Elbow 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.990
 mousse 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.220
 Then it is mark x 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.220
 Not a car of a positive representative of the upper middle sedan called 4-door sedan fr layout 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.800
 I think 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.029
 The original feeling handling balance of this car is compatible with the ride 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.239
 At a high level 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:41.570
 The first impression is that it is not 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:45.310
 The quietness is also very high, and the power from the road also has a rounded input . 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:50.500
 And it combines this kind of comfort or else 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:52.990
 Such mark x is flat ride as setting of 9 stages 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:59.260
 Feeling and quality 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:05.890
 I concentrated on improving the ring balance while maintaining this firmly 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:13.330
 Result You a spring rate, but the front is 120% against genuine original 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:19.280
 The rear has been both volume up 110% ne and social settings both before and after 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.860
 -What does it feel like to actually drive that in 14 mm ? 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.810
 Ne 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.020
 For steering operation 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.229
 There is a very solid sense of response 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.340
 What kind of situation is the road surface now? 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:37.690
 Under what circumstances do the tires grip 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:43.990
 It is easy to understand these things as you get them 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.760
 Thanks to the dampers and springs that give a flexible and steady stroke 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.040
 That tire always 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:55.140
 To follow the Romei you know well that they say Tei 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:58.890
 Well, that's a result. Such places are very connected to a sense of security for the driver. 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:04.230
 I think that is the behavior when cornering 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.400
 Give us always a sense of security also was said something about a joint Ah so at the time of the buff average 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:13.880
 It has become a firm behavior 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:19.910
 Of course, it is also a comfortable ride, so it's disgusting to put out the rear seat, so it's disgusting 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:23.380
 There is no such thing as a very hard ride, so that point is secure 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.380
 I think if you can
