and I used to use earplugs those foamy
ones<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.089> you<00:00:54.210> buy<00:00:54.239> from<00:00:54.629> your<00:00:54.780> hardware

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
ones that you buy from your hardware

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
ones that you buy from your hardware

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.280 
store the builders and all that sort of
where<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:59.210> and<00:01:00.210> they<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.659> a<00:01:00.780> fantastic<00:01:00.870> job

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
where and and they do a fantastic job

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.500 
where and and they do a fantastic job
they<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.440> brilliant<00:01:04.680> job<00:01:04.980> I<00:01:05.730> was<00:01:06.030> very<00:01:06.240> happy

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510

they do a brilliant job I was very happy
with<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.660> but<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:06.990> happens<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> eat

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
with it but what happens is with the eat

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.850 
with it but what happens is with the eat
with<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> earplugs<00:01:09.410> after<00:01:10.410> a<00:01:10.440> while<00:01:10.620> what<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
with the earplugs after a while what I

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.500 
with the earplugs after a while what I
noticed<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.430> can't<00:01:11.730> push<00:01:11.940> it<00:01:11.970> too<00:01:12.210> deep<00:01:12.420> because

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
noticed I can't push it too deep because

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.540 
noticed I can't push it too deep because
if<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> push<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.140> too<00:01:13.290> deep<00:01:13.530> they<00:01:14.130> start<00:01:14.430> to

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
if you push it too deep they start to

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.200 
if you push it too deep they start to
hurt<00:01:14.730> a<00:01:14.760> lot

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
hurt a lot

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
hurt a lot
you<00:01:15.900> don't<00:01:16.020> want<00:01:16.140> obviously<00:01:16.230> push<00:01:16.620> it<00:01:16.740> too

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
you don't want obviously push it too

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.200 
you don't want obviously push it too
deep<00:01:17.190> to<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> point<00:01:17.640> where<00:01:17.730> you<00:01:17.790> gonna<00:01:17.910> damage

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
deep to the point where you gonna damage

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.140 
deep to the point where you gonna damage
something<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:19.010> I<00:01:20.010> don't<00:01:20.940> know<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
something down there I don't know if you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.430 
something down there I don't know if you
can<00:01:21.270> damage<00:01:21.570> your<00:01:21.660> eardrums<00:01:22.050> I<00:01:22.170> don't<00:01:22.320> know<00:01:22.380> if

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
can damage your eardrums I don't know if

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.100 
can damage your eardrums I don't know if
you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.620> go<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.340> far<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:23.930> once<00:01:24.930> I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
you can go that that far but once I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.930 
you can go that that far but once I
pushed<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.560> bit<00:01:25.710> too<00:01:25.890> much<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.400> really

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
pushed it a bit too much and it really

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.250 
pushed it a bit too much and it really
gave<00:01:27.060> me<00:01:27.120> a<00:01:27.240> bit<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.510> sharp<00:01:27.750> pain<00:01:27.960> so

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
gave me a bit of a sharp pain so

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.399 
gave me a bit of a sharp pain so
probably<00:01:29.250> does

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.429 

so<00:01:33.100> yeah<00:01:33.850> that's<00:01:34.390> one<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.750> disadvantages

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
so yeah that's one of the disadvantages

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.499 
so yeah that's one of the disadvantages
of<00:01:35.500> having<00:01:35.619> metal<00:01:36.070> because<00:01:36.610> it<00:01:36.759> sort<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.270> puffs

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
of having metal because it sort of puffs

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.010 
of having metal because it sort of puffs
up<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:38.289> opens<00:01:38.649> up<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.860> bit<00:01:39.039> as<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:40.390> as<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.840> leave

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
up it opens up a bit as you as you leave

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.410 
up it opens up a bit as you as you leave
it<00:01:41.140> in<00:01:41.259> there<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.759> puts<00:01:43.149> a<00:01:43.240> lot<00:01:43.390> of

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
it in there and that puts a lot of

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.710 
it in there and that puts a lot of
pressure<00:01:43.600> around<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.590> canal<00:01:45.570> because<00:01:46.570> when

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
pressure around the canal because when

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.200 
pressure around the canal because when
you<00:01:46.810> screen<00:01:47.409> when<00:01:47.679> you<00:01:47.799> squeeze<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.189> it<00:01:48.970> goes

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
you screen when you squeeze it it goes

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.010 
you screen when you squeeze it it goes
very<00:01:49.479> thin<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:49.899> just<00:01:50.079> slips<00:01:50.289> right<00:01:50.380> in<00:01:50.819> but<00:01:51.819> um

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
very thin it just slips right in but um

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.120 
very thin it just slips right in but um
obviously<00:01:53.020> once<00:01:53.200> it's<00:01:53.350> in<00:01:53.500> there<00:01:53.679> it's<00:01:53.890> like<00:01:54.100> a

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
obviously once it's in there it's like a

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.069 
obviously once it's in there it's like a
memory<00:01:54.549> foam<00:01:54.579> it<00:01:54.970> just<00:01:55.179> opens<00:01:55.539> up<00:01:55.720> and<00:01:55.869> it<00:01:55.960> just

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
memory foam it just opens up and it just

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.370 
memory foam it just opens up and it just
sits<00:01:56.289> there<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:58.659> it<00:01:58.750> blocks<00:01:58.960> up<00:01:59.079> a<00:01:59.140> lot<00:01:59.289> of

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
sits there but it blocks up a lot of

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.340 
sits there but it blocks up a lot of
noise<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.759> almost<00:02:00.759> all<00:02:00.939> of<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.299> wind<00:02:01.479> with

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
noise and almost all of the wind with

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.389 
noise and almost all of the wind with
noise<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.710> comes<00:02:02.920> through<00:02:03.039> which<00:02:03.250> is

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
noise that comes through which is

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.270 
noise that comes through which is
gratefully<00:02:03.819> obviously<00:02:04.539> it's<00:02:04.630> protecting<00:02:05.140> you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
gratefully obviously it's protecting you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.639 
gratefully obviously it's protecting you
the<00:02:06.280> other<00:02:06.670> thing<00:02:06.819> is<00:02:06.970> they're<00:02:07.149> very<00:02:07.330> cheap<00:02:07.649> so

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
the other thing is they're very cheap so

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.960 
the other thing is they're very cheap so
it<00:02:08.769> does<00:02:08.920> matter<00:02:09.039> if<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.250> drop<00:02:09.489> it<00:02:09.519> you<00:02:09.759> lose

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
it does matter if you drop it you lose

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.970 
it does matter if you drop it you lose
it<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.209> just<00:02:10.330> get<00:02:10.569> well<00:02:11.140> I've<00:02:11.530> got<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.709> pack<00:02:11.950> of

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
it you just get well I've got a pack of

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.270 
it you just get well I've got a pack of
200<00:02:12.940> pairs<00:02:13.180> for<00:02:13.959> nineteen<00:02:14.799> Australian

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
200 pairs for nineteen Australian

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.870 
200 pairs for nineteen Australian
dollars<00:02:16.080> worth<00:02:17.160> peanuts<00:02:18.160> really<00:02:18.400> it's<00:02:18.730> worth

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
dollars worth peanuts really it's worth

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.729 
dollars worth peanuts really it's worth
noting<00:02:19.269> each<00:02:19.450> if<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:19.750> calculate<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:20.500> do<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
noting each if you calculate it do the

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.810 
noting each if you calculate it do the
maths<00:02:20.950> yourself

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.750 

yeah<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.710> other<00:02:28.740> disadvantage<00:02:29.610> of

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
yeah and the other disadvantage of

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.440 
yeah and the other disadvantage of
having<00:02:30.740> earplugs<00:02:31.740> was<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.270> you<00:02:33.270> know<00:02:33.390> you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
having earplugs was that you know you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.680 
having earplugs was that you know you
drop<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.990> lot<00:02:34.170> or<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.500> lose<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:35.510> there<00:02:36.510> very

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
drop it a lot or you lose it there very

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.060 
drop it a lot or you lose it there very
little<00:02:36.870> or<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.200> get<00:02:37.410> fiddly<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:37.920> know<00:02:38.010> you

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
little or you get fiddly you know you
