00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.600 
what I want them to do with the story
I'm<00:00:13.320> really<00:00:13.590> starting<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:13.950> get<00:00:14.099> into<00:00:14.309> halo

I'm really starting to get into halo
halo<00:00:14.790> was<00:00:15.120> never<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.360> game<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.960> got<00:00:16.139> in

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
halo was never a game that I got in

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.420 
halo was never a game that I got in
through<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.590> story<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.949> always<00:00:17.220> played

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
through for the story I always played

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.429 
through for the story I always played
the<00:00:17.580> multiplayer<00:00:17.880> back<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.630> day<00:00:18.779> halo<00:00:19.230> 2<00:00:19.289> I

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
the multiplayer back in the day halo 2 I

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.759 
the multiplayer back in the day halo 2 I
played<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> show<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.400> game<00:00:20.609> um<00:00:21.470> but<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.500> never

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
played the show that game um but I never

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.189 
played the show that game um but I never
really<00:00:23.010> got<00:00:23.160> into<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.430> story<00:00:23.730> until<00:00:24.090> halo<00:00:24.630> 4

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
really got into the story until halo 4

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.400 
really got into the story until halo 4
and<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.890> think<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.490> because<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:27.410> they

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
and I think it's just because that they

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.710 
and I think it's just because that they
started<00:00:28.890> humanizing<00:00:29.550> Master<00:00:29.939> Chief<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.390> i'm

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
started humanizing Master Chief and i'm

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.440 
started humanizing Master Chief and i'm
really<00:00:31.019> liking<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.949> direction<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.610> 343<00:00:33.120> is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
really liking the direction at 343 is

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.900 
really liking the direction at 343 is
going<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.710> halo<00:00:35.010> franchise<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.820> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
probably what in his late 30s but still

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.580 
probably what in his late 30s but still
he's<00:01:37.979> getting<00:01:38.189> old<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:39.450> can't<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.960> mean<00:01:40.140> he

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
he's getting old and you can't I mean he

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
he's getting old and you can't I mean he
can't<00:01:40.799> live<00:01:41.009> forever<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.750> I'm<00:01:42.750> really

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
excited for halo 5 and 6 because I think

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.080 
excited for halo 5 and 6 because I think
that<00:01:45.689> they're<00:01:46.380> gonna<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> more<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.430> more

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that they're gonna have a more a more

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.620 
that they're gonna have a more a more
humanized<00:01:48.810> version<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.560> Master<00:01:49.920> Chief<00:01:50.159> where

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
humanized version of Master Chief where

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.609 
humanized version of Master Chief where
this<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:51.869> I'm<00:01:51.960> hoping<00:01:52.110> they<00:01:52.290> do<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
this is what I'm hoping they do with the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.969 
this is what I'm hoping they do with the
series<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> hope<00:01:53.159> master<00:01:53.369> chief<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.030> halo<00:01:54.390> 5

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
since Cortana is gone I think it should

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.780 
since Cortana is gone I think it should
be<00:02:25.069> like<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.219> should<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.400> pretty<00:02:26.670> interesting

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
be like it should be pretty interesting

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.899 
be like it should be pretty interesting
to<00:02:27.269> see<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.659> know<00:02:27.719> I<00:02:27.840> i<00:02:28.829> think<00:02:29.549> at<00:02:29.640> halo<00:02:29.879> five

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
to see you know I i think at halo five

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.080 
to see you know I i think at halo five
if<00:02:30.389> they<00:02:30.540> make<00:02:30.719> him<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.400> know<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.489> think<00:02:32.760> if<00:02:32.849> halo

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
if they make him I know I think if halo

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.750 
if they make him I know I think if halo
5<00:02:33.359> is<00:02:33.569> kind<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.959> just<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.139> a<00:02:34.319> sum<00:02:34.620> or<00:02:34.950> sad<00:02:35.340> kind

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
5 is kind of just like a sum or sad kind

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.420 
5 is kind of just like a sum or sad kind
of<00:02:36.379> battle<00:02:37.379> because<00:02:37.769> from<00:02:37.950> what<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.219> looks

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
of battle because from what it looks

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.240 
of battle because from what it looks
like<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.530> enemy<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.680> they're<00:02:40.859> gonna<00:02:41.069> be

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
like the enemy that they're gonna be

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.830 
like the enemy that they're gonna be
fighting<00:02:41.670> in<00:02:41.790> these<00:02:41.909> next<00:02:42.150> halo<00:02:42.450> games<00:02:42.689> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
fighting in these next halo games the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.020 
fighting in these next halo games the
forerunners<00:02:43.379> seems<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.430> be<00:02:44.519> almost<00:02:44.670> this

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
forerunners seems to be almost this

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.250 
forerunners seems to be almost this
uncon<00:02:45.480> corbel<00:02:45.930> force<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:47.010> i<00:02:47.959> don't<00:02:48.959> know<00:02:48.989> i

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
uncon corbel force and i don't know i

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.379 
uncon corbel force and i don't know i
think<00:02:49.709> it's<00:02:50.250> i<00:02:50.489> think<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.909> should<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.239> pretty

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
think it's i think it should be pretty

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.289 
think it's i think it should be pretty
cool<00:02:51.629> i<00:02:51.689> hope<00:02:51.930> they<00:02:52.109> do<00:02:52.169> have<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> more

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
cool i hope they do have a more

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.000 
cool i hope they do have a more
realistic<00:02:54.299> approach<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.590> i<00:02:55.650> think<00:02:55.859> they

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
realistic approach to and i think they

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.099 
realistic approach to and i think they
will<00:02:56.250> especially<00:02:56.909> with<00:02:57.060> with<00:02:57.359> halo<00:02:57.540> 4<00:02:57.870> how

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
will especially with with halo 4 how

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.860 
will especially with with halo 4 how
it's<00:02:58.290> sort<00:02:58.769> of<00:02:58.859> hit<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> low<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.579> i<00:03:00.419> think<00:03:00.599> halo

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
it's sort of hit a low and i think halo

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.470 
it's sort of hit a low and i think halo
5<00:03:01.139> will<00:03:01.980> probably<00:03:02.370> be<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.519> low<00:03:02.730> point<00:03:03.000> for

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
5 will probably be a low point for

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.390 
5 will probably be a low point for
master<00:03:04.139> chief<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:04.620> then<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.859> humans<00:03:05.219> and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
master chief and then the humans and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.330 
master chief and then the humans and
shit<00:03:05.639> and<00:03:05.790> then<00:03:06.389> I<00:03:06.419> think<00:03:06.719> halo<00:03:07.019> 6<00:03:07.409> will<00:03:07.829> be<00:03:08.010> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
shit and then I think halo 6 will be the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.709 
shit and then I think halo 6 will be the
high<00:03:08.489> point<00:03:08.519> where<00:03:09.060> they<00:03:09.180> win<00:03:09.419> they

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
high point where they win they

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.979 
high point where they win they
decisively<00:03:10.290> win<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:11.389> Master<00:03:12.389> Chief<00:03:12.599> either

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
decisively win and Master Chief either

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.309 
decisively win and Master Chief either
dies<00:03:13.769> or<00:03:13.799> retires<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.879> I<00:03:14.969> think<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.480> think<00:03:16.230> they

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
dies or retires and I think I think they

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.500 
dies or retires and I think I think they
might<00:03:16.530> kill<00:03:16.709> master<00:03:16.889> chief<00:03:17.250> III<00:03:17.790> think<00:03:18.120> they

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
might kill master chief III think they

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.300 
might kill master chief III think they
might<00:03:18.810> kill<00:03:19.109> master<00:03:19.379> chief<00:03:19.769> because<00:03:20.069> they

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
might kill master chief because they

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.849 
might kill master chief because they
killed<00:03:20.549> Cortana<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:22.139> think<00:03:22.379> Master<00:03:22.680> Chief

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
killed Cortana and I think Master Chief
