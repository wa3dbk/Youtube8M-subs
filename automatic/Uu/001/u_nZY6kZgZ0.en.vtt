00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.429
 hello to all and welcome this episode 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.230
 15 of the billion destination series 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.500
 today we find ourselves for a small 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.830
 point on the migration so that I had 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.640
 launched in the last episode 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.750
 I make you a little point that 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.210
 just because I reached a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.160
 sum which completely reimbursed me 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.510
 even a little bit beyond that is at 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.309
 to say that a migration costs about 6 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.440
 million in the green and I had spent 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.020
 100 million before leaving and I'm 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.770
 raised to 118 million on the mule so 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.730
 I'm paying back I have a lot left 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.000
 stuff to sell so in terms of street 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.539
 a blunder and agapes and m I still 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.660
 not bad 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.379
 I have a merchant mode I also have 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.840
 in mount yes that I still have not 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.420
 evil the powerful by unemployment he me 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.190
 rest two hundred to sell for them 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.470
 destination billion then the rest 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.700
 it's the panda I have some runes in. 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.090
 I have a lot of luck bumpers 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.560
 on the other hand more than 150 but it sells 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:18.509
 not bad it feels really good elsewhere 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.830
 I I'll show you a little bit this 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:28.579
 I had been asked for a military 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.869
 asked a bit to show what I had 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.100
 what I had sold and that's because 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.509
 it was a bit abstract so I 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.750
 screen and a few times where I 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.050
 connect that I had sold things 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:45.090
 she would have deceived their value we're going on 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:55.350
 on what is it not that youtube is a 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:57.119
 billion his fingers clip 15 here you are 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.390
 so here's the powerful by thomas j 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:05.880
 it was selling pretty powerful by shaw 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.610
 of luck the streets of gap and gap is 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.670
 brown merchant mode not written as 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.160
 I managed to sell a lot of 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.700
 success is sold it's when I get 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.100
 get up in the morning 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.170
 yes device a boeing for a pretty 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.770
 little screen still there again and 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.630
 there this morning 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.370
 this morning it was sold very well 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.220
 so I do not have any screen and it's 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.890
 to show you how much his share and to 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.560
 how fast his share is on Tuesday 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.780
 you have everything stacked a week when 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.890
 a week i get paid back i 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.810
 does a little puppy of profits he 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.420
 remains for sale I think I'm going 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.830
 stay about three weeks 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.790
 and then we go back I'll take the streets 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.630
 do I will be the reverse profitability this is 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.340
 to say that I will take what is not 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.769
 expensive on this server to bring them back on 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.390
 my original server and still do some 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.040
 benefit I will also bring things back 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.690
 for me for my own benefit 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.250
 including sky ruins are not 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.239
 dear now I'm no longer gone on 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.549
 a server where the ruins are expensive 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.230
 because I wanted to sell it so the 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.090
 doing the reverse journey will only be 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.579
 not necessarily very profitable in purchase 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.000
 street resale once I find another 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.350
 very profitable thing I will find well 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.910
 so that was a pretty video 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.670
 short it was just to show you 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.400
 a little bit to what I was in 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.170
 big the fia 120 million here I still 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.180
 around 80 million on the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.489
 sleep 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.110
 / aero head so in big check of 100 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.769
 million I still have things to sell 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.540
 I continue to do some of 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.940
 breeding on my myo who earns me 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.410
 also blows game it goes up it goes up 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.080
 it goes up it climbs we are now at 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.769
 200 million and I hope that from the 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.910
 next episode 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:51.340
 we will be even more young and in 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.900
 the period I'm trying to 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.400
 turn the video I'm not finished yet 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.980
 the what what I started to do 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.640
 so in fact I turn episode 15 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.390
 before you show episode 13 but 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:08.220
 I think in episode 16 I will do 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.260
 an account of my total migration and 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.470
 I will give an account of what 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.660
 I would have done through what what in terms 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.650
 two years 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.079
 how I would have done with cammas 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.400
 cocoyes because there I have 125 left to 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.710
 to do but well that normally 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.970
 episode 13 you think I defined 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.070
 it mixes a little bit like I 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.300
 turn the episodes before posting them 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.740
 so that's it so I wanted it was just 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.600
 to make a small assessment for you 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.490
 show a little how to boast so 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.110
 here I am repaying my migration 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.950
 now all I'm doing is 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.970
 benefit so I hope to get it 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.160
 even bigger sums 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.039
 I think I can make 200 million 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.350
 to have doubled about there the bet of 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.560
 starting knowing that it's something that 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.490
 I sold this time to buy them 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.919
 typically somewhere way even though 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.470
 I bought some 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:05.050
 this is it so I wanted to I you 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.470
 wish all good afternoon little 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.700
 evening and see you soon for the next 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.700
 dubai video everyone
