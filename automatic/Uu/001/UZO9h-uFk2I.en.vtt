00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.980
 it's the world it's all ip well 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.980
 today for a brand new 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.340
 tutorial to start dissolved iron in 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.280
 suspiciously new tutorial kama 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.850
 stick breaking of timahdit the myth 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.260
 so if it interested on it are the 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.320
 neutral resistors and so is that gives 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.699
 a lot of resistance in general and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.130
 after it's going no more than twenty years 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.109
 of such a so the recipe is very simple 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.400
 in fact for kraft and without it will you 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.960
 cost around 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.350
 it depends on the waiters me it cost me 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.620
 60 thousand so the ash wood that is at 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.120
 about 2300 kama leaving so you 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.469
 do say that said 23000 you the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.379
 good wood saw that they were 8000 kia 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.940
 malisse actually that's good the barks 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.850
 or not even counting 7,900 cases hand 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.960
 and the chestnut wood cost me I 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.309
 know more because I saw that I am 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.710
 lumberjack it cost me almost nothing 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.329
 surprised that I did not buy the wood 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.940
 maple dot he was at the cross angels of 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.680
 6000 kamal and without so that makes you to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.780
 about 45 to 60 miles 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.879
 cam so now we're going to break them and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.810
 I made sense of it probably 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.400
 the longest step of this tutorial 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:15.299
 so you break all the sticks next 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.270
 we will open them outside and then we 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.560
 will put the roughs on sale so on 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.630
 tutorial tell you simple you can the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.150
 to do several times a day knowing 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.979
 that wood ba like that there will be 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.049
 always in hdv the only problem is 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.850
 to find in boat sculptor and 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.110
 I offer thank you really cravo 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.869
 search for mac in doha this video 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.189
 but he's a huge patience knowing 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.460
 that I do not have a lot of buddies for 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.689
 me for the patience he has one who has me 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.720
 granted given that I go every time 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.090
 going back to the bank helped me and that's 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.759
 so really big thank you to him certainly 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.119
 and as a month 6 15 minutes of time 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.080
 lost 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.510
 if we can say so you break all that 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.770
 hop hop hop if you're really interested 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.850
 these are the streets the raid the dash 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.160
 why not the loaves 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.560
 I think that's how it is so here 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.690
 now in my hd in my 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.399
 inventory I have nothing here so we 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.320
 open everything everything everything everything you 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.130
 can see that it fills a lot 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.790
 pod level there we go out and now 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.470
 ivo ruegg i got 473 street do not know 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.150
 not if you realize it's 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.190
 really madness it's almost 500 and 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.350
 now just look at the price in hd 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.900
 but frankly that's it abused me 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.730
 have not even got so much before 159000 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.920
 who hurts and without you do x 4 that 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.660
 you are 600 thousand and a few have 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.670
 after 500 so if you feel like it 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.580
 it makes you x 6 that you do 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.209
 enormously you happen almost 1,800 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.570
 thousand channel + rayter streets that are 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.620
 really piss off because almost nothing 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.930
 but it's still that and 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.459
 you still have a few streets a breakdown 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.459

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.600
 in fact it's still 25 million 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.930
 compared a wrong step that was worth or pages 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.750

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.550
