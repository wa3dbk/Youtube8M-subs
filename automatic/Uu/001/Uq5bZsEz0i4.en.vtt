Italian design coming into this
particular<00:00:15.120> regulator<00:00:15.599> also<00:00:16.529> nice<00:00:16.680> curves

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
particular regulator also nice curves

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.300 
particular regulator also nice curves
and<00:00:17.310> style<00:00:17.900> in<00:00:18.900> both<00:00:19.109> first<00:00:19.439> stage<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
and style in both first stage and the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.550 
and style in both first stage and the
second<00:00:20.609> stage<00:00:20.840> well<00:00:21.840> look<00:00:22.080> at<00:00:22.199> some<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
second stage well look at some of the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.620 
second stage well look at some of the
features<00:00:22.880> where<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:23.939> start<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> first

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
features where you start on the first

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.920 
features where you start on the first
stage<00:00:25.250> it's<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.310> balanced<00:00:26.730> diaphragm<00:00:27.660> first

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
stage it's a balanced diaphragm first

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.810 
stage it's a balanced diaphragm first
stage<00:00:29.210> got<00:00:30.320> to<00:00:31.320> low<00:00:31.500> pressure<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.610> high

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
stage got to low pressure on a high

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.170 
stage got to low pressure on a high
pressure<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.510> both<00:00:34.050> sides<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.760> handed

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
pressure and both sides as it's handed

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.240 
pressure and both sides as it's handed
this<00:00:36.300> first<00:00:36.570> stage<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> low<00:00:37.559> pressure<00:00:37.770> on

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
this first stage so the low pressure on

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.590 
this first stage so the low pressure on
the<00:00:38.520> right<00:00:38.700> hand<00:00:38.910> side<00:00:39.000> which<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.420> normal

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the right hand side which is a normal

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.729 
the right hand side which is a normal
regulator<00:00:40.160> sides<00:00:41.160> are<00:00:41.820> direct<00:00:42.719> flow<00:00:43.050> ports<00:00:43.559> so

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
regulator sides are direct flow ports so

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.900 
regulator sides are direct flow ports so
they<00:00:43.860> would<00:00:43.980> give<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.219> much<00:00:44.370> better<00:00:44.550> flow

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
they would give you a much better flow

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.060 
they would give you a much better flow
compared<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.079> side<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.739> was<00:00:46.829> just

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
compared to this side which I was just

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.279 
compared to this side which I was just
feeding<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.879> BCD<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.539> dry<00:00:48.870> sleep<00:00:51.110> say<00:00:52.110> he

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
feeding the BCD and dry sleep say he

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.770 
feeding the BCD and dry sleep say he
could<00:00:52.469> very<00:00:53.129> nice<00:00:53.309> design<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:54.690> this

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
could very nice design on this

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.270 
could very nice design on this

see here it was also available 232 bar a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.030 
see here it was also available 232 bar a
clamp<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.290> well<00:01:18.020> top<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
clamp as well top here you can see the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.890 
clamp as well top here you can see the
main<00:01:20.280> spring<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.880> diaphragm<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
main spring for the diaphragm it's a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.010 
main spring for the diaphragm it's a
nice<00:01:22.080> little<00:01:22.380> look<00:01:22.650> inside<00:01:23.009> there<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.930> if<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
nice little look inside there so if you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.740 
nice little look inside there so if you
just<00:01:28.170> move<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> second<00:01:29.009> stage<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:30.570> is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
just move on to the second stage this is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.410 
just move on to the second stage this is
fitted<00:01:31.079> with<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.259> braided<00:01:32.070> hose<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.329> they're

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
fitted with a braided hose so they're

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.690 
fitted with a braided hose so they're
much<00:01:33.540> more<00:01:33.780> high<00:01:34.110> burst<00:01:34.890> resistance<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.579> these

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
much more high burst resistance on these

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.840 
much more high burst resistance on these
particular<00:01:35.909> hoses<00:01:36.560> also<00:01:37.560> means<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:37.920> tie

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
particular hoses also means you can tie

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.490 
particular hoses also means you can tie
them<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.270> quite<00:01:39.509> some<00:01:39.689> quite<00:01:39.930> tight<00:01:40.200> knots

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
them up in quite some quite tight knots

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.170 
them up in quite some quite tight knots
and<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.009> won't<00:01:41.189> affect<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.759> flow<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and it won't affect the flow of the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.330 
and it won't affect the flow of the
regulator<00:01:45.140> second<00:01:46.140> stage<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.860> normal

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340

it's<00:01:51.270> great<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.780> cold<00:01:51.960> water<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:52.890> it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
it's great for cold water because it

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.719 
it's great for cold water because it
absorbs<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:54.000> lot<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.509> warmth<00:01:54.869> from<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.049> ambient

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729

on<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.729> front<00:02:03.119> again<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> metal<00:02:04.500> ring<00:02:04.710> around

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
on the front again a metal ring around

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.100 
on the front again a metal ring around
the<00:02:05.520> outside<00:02:05.549> against<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.479> helping<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the outside against is helping to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.170 
the outside against is helping to

so<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.250> jet<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.209> air<00:02:15.680> flows<00:02:16.680> comes<00:02:17.459> up<00:02:17.640> this

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
so a jet of air flows comes up this

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.550 
so a jet of air flows comes up this
little<00:02:18.000> tube<00:02:18.180> direct<00:02:19.049> into<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.409> mouthpiece

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
