stunts and punch coming straight from
the<00:00:32.970> shoulder<00:00:34.250> then<00:00:35.250> I'm<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.550> start<00:00:35.790> to

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the shoulder then I'm going to start to

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.340 
the shoulder then I'm going to start to
speed<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.390> up<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.200> little

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
speed it up so I can just that little

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.799 
speed it up so I can just that little
bit<00:00:40.500> faster<00:00:42.350> so<00:00:43.350> into<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> double<00:00:44.040> time<00:00:44.309> pace<00:00:47.809> so

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
bit faster so into a double time pace so

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.119 
bit faster so into a double time pace so
I<00:00:48.840> would<00:00:49.079> recommend<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.739> start<00:00:50.010> off

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
I would recommend that you start off

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
I would recommend that you start off
with<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.340> slower<00:00:50.730> pace<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.360> around<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:51.780> 30

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
with the slower pace to around about 30

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.889 
with the slower pace to around about 30
seconds<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.670> gradually<00:00:54.239> pick<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.719> that

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
seconds and then gradually pick up that

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.340 
seconds and then gradually pick up that
speed<00:00:56.090> so<00:00:57.090> you're<00:00:57.210> working<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.899> double

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
speed so you're working to that double

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.119 
speed so you're working to that double
time<00:00:58.590> put<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> full<00:00:59.520> body<00:00:59.820> behind<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:01.129> for

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
time put the full body behind it for

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.400 
time put the full body behind it for
about<00:01:02.219> 1<00:01:02.640> minute<00:01:02.840> so<00:01:03.840> 30<00:01:04.199> seconds<00:01:04.830> normal<00:01:05.520> pace

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
about 1 minute so 30 seconds normal pace

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.450 
about 1 minute so 30 seconds normal pace
one<00:01:07.410> minute<00:01:07.710> pushing<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:10.010> then<00:01:11.010> after<00:01:11.340> that

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
one minute pushing out then after that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.429 
one minute pushing out then after that
we'll<00:01:11.700> go<00:01:11.760> into<00:01:12.090> what<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> call<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> double<00:01:13.170> punch
