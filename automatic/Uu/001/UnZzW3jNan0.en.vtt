00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.510
 and I consider my work somewhat worked but 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.510
 simple 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.940
 has a reference are romantic hydric 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.060
 dishes lamps clothes or any object 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.730
 that allows me to investigate my work 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.300
 starts in 2012 I do both painting and 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.939
 sculpture as recovery of pieces of 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.310
 ceramic for decoration and then the 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.110
 latest proposal is a shirt design 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.990
 hand painted 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.070
 what I like is to investigate different 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:42.860
 stands think to the canvas table the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.050
 ceramic the textile I always have as the 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.390
 restlessness that of not stopping in a single 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.150
 point and be a painter of a painting 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.489
 paint on a canvas and that you can 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.710
 take to the street to be something useful as 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.470
 for example a series of baskets of 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.530
 wicker that you can use them so much 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.530
 for the purchase like to go to the beach 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.840
 when I speak of recovered pieces I 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.329
 I mean pieces that have stopped having 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.939
 use and what I want is to give them a 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.640
 second life change the vision that does not 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.670
 be a mere dish or an antique sink 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.920
 but to give it the object seat point 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.840
 artistic and decontextualize it by 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.810
 example with a series of messages 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.329
 romantics that intertwine with each other 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.920
 love me - pere give me more time at the end 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.140
 they are like things that you have always 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.000
 wanted to say and said maybe you have not 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.610
 said but that shaping those there is like 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.170
 already loose you do not stay inside 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.170
 of you but you liberate them 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.240
 my style apart from worked can be 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.450
 see that it is very simple is a kind 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.000
 dream of romanticism also has 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.640
 a poetic roll 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.250
 we could say the fact of transmitting 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.530
 messages comes very from the organic thing of 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.810
 the earth the series that I have worked 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.700
 lately once nesting they are 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.140
 swallows' nests and swallows that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.450
 they go inside the messages too 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.190
 then this other series that is dormant is 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.470
 that are anatomical hearts that are 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.480
 they also connect with each other what is 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.970
 the series of shoots that has a lot that 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.370
 see with the issue of nests is like the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.280
 resurface that there is something latent there and 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.860
 that is born and then there is the mamis series 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.079
 which is like the most introspective series 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.269
 that are like mammals with 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.170
 embryos that come together is the most 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.540
 introspective of those of the 4 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.890
 At the end all the pieces are unique 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.650
 only because they are painted by hand 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.959
 but because they are recovered pieces that 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.150
 I get traces of street markets 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.330
 people who bring them to me from different 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.920
 points 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.350
 the pieces are all hand painted by 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.239
 what they are only as decoration 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.830
 then there are the shirts that are 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.709
 painted by hand but good is a 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.780
 textile acrylic that allows washing the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.910
 washing always with delicacy 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.100
 good shirts are designed by me 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.500
 from the beginning I do the drawing 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.569
 then I get the fabric depending on 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.120
 what I want to transmit I look for a fabric 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.069
 or other also the buttons your pattern and 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.540
 then I work with a dressmaker that you give me 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.459
 make after being 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.020
 made is when I paint them 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:24.480
 Also the prices depending on the 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.420
 You can find them between a 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.440
 medium dish let's say it's between 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.920
 40 and 45 euros until for example the 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.860
 lamps that have a value between 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.830
 200 and 250 depending on the piece 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.330
 I am self-taught I am from Rioja 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.480
 town that is called TobÃ­a river baths 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.769
 I grew up and I think that having the 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.560
 contact that direct with nature 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.380
 is what can now be seen in me in my 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.819
 work had a goat farm is the 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.310
 farm 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.499
 of the family in which I worked 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.109
 but the point where I decided 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:03.889
 dedicate myself fully and exclusively to 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.889
 this 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.349
 I was working two months in china in 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.890
 someone in a very tiny town and what 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.780
 What I did was investigate about the fabrics 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.639
 Chinese and I found a wonderful 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.139
 translucent cotton with a weft 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.830
 spectacular in which I was working 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:28.100
 a series called memory and it was 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.100
 my last large format work 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.250
 my works can be found in my 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.590
 website where you can see the points 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.560
 of sale and then if you want a space 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.540
