00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.510 
bit of a factor but getting something of
equal<00:02:04.360> quality<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:05.140> like<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.439> Viper<00:02:05.680> would<00:02:06.340> be

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
equal quality to like a Viper would be

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.690 
equal quality to like a Viper would be
look<00:02:07.240> at<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.420> Encore<00:02:07.899> line<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:09.340> something

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
look at the Encore line it's something

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.759 
look at the Encore line it's something
we<00:02:09.880> recently<00:02:10.209> started<00:02:10.810> sharing<00:02:11.019> probably

Android<00:02:28.900> or<00:02:29.940> over<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:31.420> don't<00:02:31.510> that's<00:02:32.350> why<00:02:32.560> I

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
Android or over I don't that's why I

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.340 
Android or over I don't that's why I
probably<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:33.730> want<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.420> think<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.750> don't<00:02:35.200> think

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
probably I want to think I don't think

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.930 
probably I want to think I don't think
anybody<00:02:35.650> makes<00:02:35.860> anything<00:02:36.100> for<00:02:36.489> as<00:02:36.760> long<00:02:36.880> as

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
anybody makes anything for as long as

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.610 
anybody makes anything for as long as
your<00:02:37.120> phone<00:02:37.360> can<00:02:37.510> download<00:02:37.690> an<00:02:38.019> app<00:02:38.230> I'm

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
your phone can download an app I'm

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.500 
your phone can download an app I'm
pretty<00:02:38.890> sure<00:02:39.130> except<00:02:39.910> Windows<00:02:40.239> folks

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
pretty sure except Windows folks

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.229 
pretty sure except Windows folks
probably<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.959> regular<00:02:41.530> little<00:02:42.000> it's<00:02:43.000> not<00:02:43.120> on

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
probably a regular little it's not on

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.059 
probably a regular little it's not on
your<00:02:43.330> cable<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:43.810> Android<00:02:44.380> or<00:02:44.530> Apple<00:02:44.650> yeah

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
your cable is just Android or Apple yeah

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.309 
your cable is just Android or Apple yeah
that's<00:02:45.489> also<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:46.060> think<00:02:46.510> either<00:02:46.810> one<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.170> those

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
that's also I think either one of those

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.680 
that's also I think either one of those
two<00:02:47.620> are<00:02:47.950> definitely<00:02:48.340> worth<00:02:48.880> looking<00:02:49.299> into

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
two are definitely worth looking into

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.620 
two are definitely worth looking into
of<00:02:49.959> course<00:02:50.260> like<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.530> said<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:52.180> probably<00:02:52.299> know

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
of course like I said you probably know

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.970 
of course like I said you probably know
what<00:02:52.780> features<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.140> looking<00:02:53.530> for<00:02:53.709> better

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
what features you looking for better

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.720 
what features you looking for better
than<00:02:54.190> we<00:02:54.310> do

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
than we do

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.339 
than we do
so<00:02:54.970> they<00:02:55.120> both<00:02:55.540> companies<00:02:55.870> have<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.110> lot<00:02:56.200> of

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
so they both companies have a lot of

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.310 
so they both companies have a lot of
different<00:02:56.709> models<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:58.600> think<00:02:59.019> that's<00:02:59.170> it

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
different models and I think that's it

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.979 
different models and I think that's it
yeah<00:02:59.950> like<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.060> said<00:03:01.299> I'll<00:03:01.450> definitely

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
yeah like you said I'll definitely

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.420 
yeah like you said I'll definitely
second<00:03:02.290> down<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.590> home<00:03:02.739> court<00:03:02.980> products
