00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.900
 Hello dear beach figure community 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.330
 Welcome to a brand new 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.610
 Doctor beach figure video I have again 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.250
 a few facebook questions from you 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.150
 picked out and that the first question 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.609
 comes from karim is it was that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.500
 Full body workout better for fat loss 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.699
 is as a split training 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.510
 that always depends on it 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.790
 karim and first of all how many times you pro 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.590
 week trained and in what way and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.780
 wise how to put together a workout 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.120
 If you are now for example only 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.310
 Full body workout with split training 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.220
 comparatively so the rows individual 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.100
 then I would say yes 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.190
 Full body training is more effective for 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.950
 the fat loss but only during the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.450
 training because you should know 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.420
 meanwhile I have often enough 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.510
 already mentioned in the 5000 videos 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.400
 yes the muscles have a huge influence 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.790
 fat loss on fat burning 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.620
 that is to say the state of rest is at work 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.170
 actually not fat loss 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.030
 only during training and that's why 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.560
 there is then split training on everyone 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.480
 case just as well because you 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.610
 wonderful to build muscle 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.350
 during the training you usually have 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.260
 Whole body workout in any case 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.030
 more consumed than in training 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
 otherwise, of course, always depends 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.360
 from how to do it right now 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.820
 Full body workout defined and split 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.110
 training in my opinion 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.710
 Do you have if you move for example 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.690
 split do with cross-lifting and others 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.010
 back exercises like finding and have there 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.250
 you end up almost synonymous 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.680
 whole-body training because he does that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.479
 also raise the biceps and the 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.630
 We continue to train and not only 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.800
 now a special muscle but me 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.300
 hope so I have the question so 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.979
 bit answered if you only now 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.320
 the two concepts against different poses 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.920
 then whole-body training is better for 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.130
 the cat dismantling ok next question from 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.260
 sascha on facebook and hello me 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.120
 have a month now my weight of 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.560
 99 7 to 92 9 kilo 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.299
 reduces about six kilos approximately 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.790
 Thank you for your tips first 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.500
 but stagnated for about a week 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.450
 my weight and it is no longer possible 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.519
 down though I eat alike and 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.799
 sport maybe you have a bike 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.540
 Thank you in advance for that, I want to 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.670
 again just below the 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.610
 read a comment from georg in the 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.290
 principle the question already answered 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.980
 i also have my weight within 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.079
 Six months from 106 to 87 kilo down 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.879
 and was also up after two months 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.400
 94 stuck 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.470
 That has lasted for about four weeks 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.450
 but still have one thing for all 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.129
 food intake is not further reduced 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.290
 and then from the fifth week it went 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.540
 started again by itself and had on 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.540
 reduced and that is an extreme 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.030
 critical point dear community for the 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.799
 Most people are starting now and it 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.359
 a good success happens 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.269
 they will be if they are 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:11.659
 stagnation phase begins the perfect 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.459
 normal when losing weight give up again 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.230
 and say that brings nothing and nothing 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.329
 This is extremely important to you 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.849
 Always keep this short plateaus 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.530
 my you have the entire four weeks 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.109
 and what are four weeks already on one 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.669
 whole life would have georg now 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.959
 for example, everything had stopped 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.700
 Damn then he would have nothing at all 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.709
 but has just continued 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.810
 and then he has five kilos again 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.120
 continue to write down so give 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.280
 calm your body just as much as you do 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.470
 When building muscle, there are always certain plateaus 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.169
 reached where suddenly the body again 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.699
 must adapt to new and then it can 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.470
 go on the same again it is the same 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.940
 weight reduction so just keep going 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.639
 eat healthy and then you can too 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.319
 continue to dismount well the last question from 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.389
 andi bright 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.530
 I have a question about the topic 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:59.780
 longer failure of training so how to 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.010
 for example, one and a half years, how long 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.590
 So head asked question so 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.099
 how long this so-called memory 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.260
 Effect stops because you should be fast 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:16.019
 build up if you ever muscles 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:18.449
 had or with memory effect means the 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.070
 That's when you start to 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.900
 train and then stop again 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.570
 that you then train the second time 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.039
 if you should start again much 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.780
 has faster successes and that is 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.979
 indeed so proven and it 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.449
 that's how it really works 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.940
 everyone who has ever trained 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.680
 to confirm 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.560
 So you should have something like that 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.080
 Fist rule and that one the number 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.139
 the years you did not train 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.550
 first slowly in months again 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.530
 trained you now have a half 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.590
 not trained that means mach 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.810
 first one and a half months very easy 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.210
 conditioning training 20 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.600
 Repeats loose weights and after 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.949
 and after boost and then after the 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.350
 one and a half months you can again 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.090
 slowly really go right up and 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.680
 start right back full throttle 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.389
 that's my recommendation that one 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.039
 always if you are now one and a half years 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.050
 did not do anything then one and a half 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.430
 months and depending on how you have three 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.169
 years did not do anything until three 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.300
 start again months and so on and 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.669
 then slowly gradually increase that 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.830
 is just such a rule of thumb that I for 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.900
 my clients are always on walls and that 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.880
 It was also the service in short all 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.410
 answered questions we'll see you then 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.940
 next friday again at the 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.970
 next few hours I will this time 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.070
 but answer all questions from youtube 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.919
 not from facebook so everyone is asking 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.590
 today and in the next seven or so 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.560
 six days he under this video 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.360
 I will be hired 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.990
 Of course, not everyone answers but 34 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.270
 ask 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.340
 so that does not take that long 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.530
 That 's it, and now I'm going further 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.780
 to drink my powers to a fresh one 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.560
 smelling flowers and afterwards we will 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.539
 mobilize four beautiful garish and one 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.240
 grilling some delicious dishes 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:02.340
 the main thing is you 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.630
 nice meat what we see each other 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.630
 Next time, your blog
