room<00:01:19.850> it's<00:01:20.299> also<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.630> really<00:01:20.930> stealthy<00:01:21.440> cast

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710

when<00:01:22.070> executed<00:01:22.580> well<00:01:22.790> and<00:01:23.180> it's<00:01:23.330> also

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
when executed well and it's also

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.240 
when executed well and it's also
probably<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.170> most<00:01:24.320> efficient<00:01:24.830> way<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:24.950> get<00:01:25.220> a

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
probably the most efficient way to get a

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.860 
probably the most efficient way to get a
fly<00:01:25.520> up<00:01:25.760> and<00:01:25.940> back<00:01:26.240> into<00:01:26.480> the<00:01:26.570> water<00:01:26.720> and

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
fly up and back into the water and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.320 
fly up and back into the water and
fishing<00:01:27.320> again<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:28.220> roll<00:01:28.430> cast<00:01:28.670> reduces

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
fishing again the roll cast reduces

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.300 
fishing again the roll cast reduces
unnecessary<00:01:29.540> false<00:01:30.320> casting<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.040> the

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
unnecessary false casting and the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.430 
unnecessary false casting and the
likelihood<00:01:31.700> of<00:01:31.880> tangles<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.540> injury<00:01:32.990> it's

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
likelihood of tangles and injury it's

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.470 
likelihood of tangles and injury it's
also<00:01:33.650> a<00:01:33.860> really<00:01:34.370> great<00:01:34.490> cast<00:01:34.820> for<00:01:35.120> lifting<00:01:35.360> up

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
also a really great cast for lifting up

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.170 
also a really great cast for lifting up
heavy<00:01:35.780> sink<00:01:36.080> tips<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.530> shooting<00:01:36.860> heads<00:01:37.180> with

heavy sink tips and shooting heads with
practice<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:38.810> roll<00:01:38.990> cast<00:01:39.230> can<00:01:39.530> also<00:01:39.680> be

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
practice the roll cast can also be

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.770 
practice the roll cast can also be
really<00:01:40.220> accurate<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:41.000> if<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:41.210> want<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.510> cast

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
really accurate and if you want a cast

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.390 
really accurate and if you want a cast
that's<00:01:41.960> going<00:01:42.260> to<00:01:42.350> open<00:01:42.590> up<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.830> much<00:01:43.100> broader

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
that's going to open up a much broader

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.190 
that's going to open up a much broader
range<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.910> fishing<00:01:44.240> opportunities<00:01:44.810> for<00:01:45.050> you

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
range of fishing opportunities for you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.550 
range of fishing opportunities for you
then<00:01:45.530> this<00:01:45.800> is<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:46.160> like<00:01:47.030> all<00:01:47.300> Spade<00:01:47.750> casts<00:01:48.380> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.760 

now<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.360> practice<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.200> grass<00:02:10.440> or

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
now you can practice this on grass or

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.300 
now you can practice this on grass or
water

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
water

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.040 
water
I<00:02:11.340> find<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.880> grass<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.330> actually<00:02:12.720> better<00:02:12.930> for

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
I find that grass is actually better for

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.750 
I find that grass is actually better for
teaching<00:02:13.530> as<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.860> lack<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.040> surface<00:02:14.580> tension

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
teaching as the lack of surface tension

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.180 
teaching as the lack of surface tension

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
and your D loop affects how much line

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:33.970 
you can lift the bigger the D loop the
