00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 to the 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.430
 who think 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.549
 Bolt is broadcast on the rostrum with the 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:17.260
 people from Munich will come the shot of 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:21.490
 corner but think of 39 more 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.260
 or was waving on the rostrum for 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.760
 who does not understand what has been in 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.230
 general the municipal campaign what today 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.779
 day 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.220
 but it could be concretized fighting that the 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.800
 last date in tournaments we are going to 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.740
 talk with a and bamboo we are going to 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.620
 to converse 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.020
 taliban how are you with the succession that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.860
 it's tournament I think we made a good 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.540
 championship 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.330
 we were right in the end a little 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.220
 of pity not but but happy for 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.470
 what the team did not have pay 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.030
 we finished up at the end it was 4 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.160
 against 4 with the alliance defense we 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.840
 a little more precision and we could 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.400
 have won the match also but 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.410
 we were made a lot of game we ran 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:07.560
 much and good happy in general 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.350
 quiet but we did not like 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.540
 the comrades are here erick 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.340
 thin the municipal people 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.350
 with this result also it was without 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.900
 eric chances with what feeling you're going 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 then what has been the presentation 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.850
 of municipal since good with pity 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.030
 because all these people have come to 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.010
 support us and really nothing that we 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.869
 we wanted to continue battling 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.160
 I think the penalties that we do not 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.410
 they charged today that they also charged us 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.060
 they have done us they did not diminish us because in 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.040
 cusco I think we could have won it and 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.450
 we had another option but they are good 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.480
 things that happen in football I think the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.840
 iron on fire 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.400
 it's normal and good I think today the draw 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.700
 It does not serve us neither I 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.710
 I think that we could have 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.870
 had better luck to finish it 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.220
 adjusts the tie to what they both did 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.320
 on the court or do you think moody's and 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.430
 could have given something else I do not think 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.650
 that fits also because we continue 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.300
 It would be disgust because they too 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.850
 they had the ball above all we knew 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.500
 that is a team that puts a lot of rhythm 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.350
 but good but I think today it was shown 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.850
 that what I told you a long time ago 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.869
 that the one standing in front was not going to 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.610
 know that you are going to have to run a 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.940
 he's going to have to fight and poke 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.320
 Sounds like few I think that the closing 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.090
 we're going to keep playing and I think today 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.040
 I'm calm because the boys are 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.600
 they believed it communist to repeat this 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.050
 in the good closing we are going to treat it 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.670
 about all 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.710
 we tell all those people there 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.360
 Sometimes I see that he thinks and does not know anything about 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.010
 football because there are times it's good to think 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.890
 I believe that everything has ended in 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.210
 some time a past with some equipment 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.310
 great and so you know what the champion is 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.510
 there you have to be less less light 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.530
 to talk to us mostly because what 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.750
 listened to what was heard and that the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.000
 hierarchy heard are nonsense me 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.140
 I finished championship fight always and today in 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.790
 fight a championship for the last date 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.460
 bad luck that was not achieved not seen 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.990
 thanks but thin michael we are with 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.700
 Adrián Zela sneaks day feeling today 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.620
 that he could win that was a 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.959
 fair result with which they are sanctioned 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.750
 I believe that beyond the result we 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.390
 we have to stay with the campaign be 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.620
 talking about the game today indeed 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.870
 we come with a proposal we came to 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.849
 try to get the three points led 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.459
 the victory to continue fighting is not 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.720
 could have been sad about that but the way 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.790
 as I had companions left in life 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.250
 on the court the truth to get out of 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.159
 overcome what happens the exhibition nothing 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.290
 simply an altercation with each other 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.640
 obviously I have to go to 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.200
 protect my player I get ahead and 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.450
 only by preventing the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.829
 other powers to attack him I'm standing 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.290
 with the arm forward and 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.510
 seemingly online by the graph 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.700
 because he saw the aggression of albarracín 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.379
 to wash his hands he said that the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.099
 courses What is your perception of what 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.709
 you have done in the tournament 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:44.099
 individually I think it has been a 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.650
 positive tournament this happily I have 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.790
 could play all the matches and we have 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.200
 done a good campaign in the collective 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.540
 that always ends up being the most 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.579
 important so I'm going quiet I 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.130
 I would obviously have liked power for 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.990
 out champion of the opening but good 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.570
 here just two weeks we have a 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.790
 rematch to continue to follow with hope 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:08.209
 of power with colleagues 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.890
 perfect let's see the best of this 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.959
 match that had no goals but that was 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.030
 emotional especially in the end so 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.090
 that were played eduardo malásquez josé 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.720
 Velázquez finished 0-0 if you said so 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.240
 at the end with more emotionality with more 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.610
 nervousness more eager than football 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.710
 both wanted to talk about the 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.250
 marker and finish taking the three 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.020
 points 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.120
 the issue is that from the point of view 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.699
 football during the whole game is 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.110
 they blocked cell phone or they did not generate that 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.539
 that we had hoped for throughout 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.669
 meeting but nevertheless by the 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.229
 Nervousness itself was not surprised to see 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.680
 the people of alliance lynch them to tan 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.539
 passive I think that that needed the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.370
 participation of the fan to try to 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.590
 transmit to the players in the 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.690
 good playing field but that's something 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.550
 that is no longer given is not something that did not happen 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.250
 this afternoon the subject happens fundamentally 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.259
 because there were situations of goal 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.120
 sporadic one of them the criminal and that 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.699
 however it did not become then a 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.970
 good cut of thin had her alliance 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.920
 always spell or thin and those he had 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.570
 municipal out there appeared another 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.370
 effectively practically 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.430
 neutralized what they could do harm 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.550
 the case of mimic in the case of same 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.040
 coast in the case of the same precious no 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.420
 that is always there in the city here 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.810
 we see 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.700
 an auction that practically buitron the 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.850
 off with nails 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.090
 because the hand to the angel here again 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.130
 another very good huitron reaction for 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.050
 that's what Joseph said because of that he said the few 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.760
 chances and only during the 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.640
 with jury or the thin spell 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.590
 very little or I spell other two 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.500
 equipment and a lot of depth and here it is 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:52.280
 generates for me there is no lack 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.620
 for me there is no lack of good in the end what 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.260
 Poor dear he hits too much down 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.970
 the ball goes to the dessert and ends therefore 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.280
 there is practically sealing 0 to 0 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.010
 because the other was already more more for want 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.400
 that deep position a pity really 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.230
 there was a lot of regret that really 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.120
 has achieved the triumph at the start 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.120
 but good is that 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.770
 nothing 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.030
 d 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.110
 everyone
