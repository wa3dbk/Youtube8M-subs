00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.180
 the dairy situation is coming 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.400
 difficult for the beginning of 2015 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.550
 but not all signals are for 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.610
 as negative the international demand 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.220
 indeed remains globally supported 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.019
 on the other hand in europe where the production 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.989
 thirds was a little too abundant 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.629
 for a few months a number 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.659
 of countries including France but also 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.390
 Germany and the Netherlands begins to 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.080
 slow the pace of progression of 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.900
 their productions 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.030
 the expected difficulties on the beginning 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.210
 of the year 2015 for the price of milk to 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.519
 the farm are linked to the sharp drop in 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.589
 price of dairy products on 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.700
 European and global markets 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:08.730
 this decline started in the spring of 2014 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.670
 been accentuated this summer by the embargo 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.310
 decreed by Russia against the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.890
 dairy products from multiple countries 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.490
 australia united states and the union 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.460
 European 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.950
 so today the situation and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.990
 especially worrying for the powders of 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.310
 milk whose price levels are 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.070
 below the minimum reached in 2012 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.850
 however the situation is less 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.890
 critical for the butter indeed the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.890
 price decline seems for now 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.020
 stopped and we even note a slight 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.970
 bullish inflection for some 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.290
 weeks the price drop of the products 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.600
 dairy 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.580
 and the dynamism of the production of 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.120
 thirds in most countries of the world 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.200
 for almost two years there has not been 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.320
 major climatic accidents that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.810
 could have mitigated this development of 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.960
 milk production and in the course of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.360
 Last 12 months production has 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.490
 increased very steadily within 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.700
 of the two main suppliers 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.420
 international market with a 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.700
 9% growth in New Zealand and 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.950
 an increase of around 5% in 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.840
 the european union the growth of the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.610
 milk production in europe is at 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.680
 connect with a relative 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.630
 relaxation of several countries 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.770
 European Union vis-à-vis their quota 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:35.520
 national on the last campaign 2013 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.680
 2014 which ended in last mass 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.780
 no less than eight countries was in 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.660
 overtaking situation vis-à-vis 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.430
 their national quota and the cumulation of 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.000
 individual movements of these eight 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.269
 country accounted for a volume of 1.4 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.239
 billion liters of milk and an amount 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.550
 overall penalty exceeding 400 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.610
 million euros for the 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.620
 breeders in the countries concerned continues 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.320
 to increase their production on the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.190
 current campaign 2014 2015 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.770
 because milk prices were an incentive to 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.830
 produce more on the three 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.990
 first quarters of 2014 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.760
 since the beginning of 2014 the 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.710
 milk production has increased in 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.550
 all European countries to 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.020
 the exception of greece and spain 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.930
 production growths have been 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.209
 sometimes very strong even in countries 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.190
 who were overtaking 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.200
 quotas during the previous campaign 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.260
 of 2013 2014 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.480
 this is particularly the case in Poland 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.320
 grew by 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.030
 production of 7 4% over the first nine 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.610
 month of the year 2014 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.959
 or else from Ireland with a 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.820
 up 6 3% or Germany with a 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.880
 increase of 4 2% 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.610
 these different countries but also 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.250
 austria the netherlands or the danish 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.830
 are under threat of having to acquit 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.040
 record penalties at the end of the 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.250
 2014-2015 campaign well above 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.530
 that of the previous campaign then 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.299
 that the context in terms of the price of 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.580
 milk is much less favorable 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.160
 these record penalty prospects 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.460
 could bring a number of 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.530
 country to slow the pace of progress 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.490
 of their production during the 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.930
 next weeks 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.490
 we can already see it in Germany where the 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.840
 third party production had been very 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.050
 dynamic on the beginning of the year and 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.630
 now begin to slow 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.080
 latest weekly polls show 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.000
 a growth of only 0 5% on the 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.450
 end of November compared 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.600
 at the equivalent period of 2013 and therefore 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.300
 the profile of the collection in germany 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.419
 on the end of 2014 is getting closer 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.190
 strongly from that of the year 2013 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.169
 France presents an evolution of its 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.000
 milk collection quite similar to 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.890
 that of germany during the 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.050
 last weeks 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:11.099
 although France is not threatened 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.260
 by exceeding his quota when 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.630
 the 2014 2015 campaign 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.310
 indeed France benefits from a margin 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.970
 important maneuvering because she had 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.060
 closed the 2013 2014 campaign with a 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.330
 under achievement of 6.9 percent by 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.010
 in relation to its national quota 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.380
 today after a very start 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.880
 sustained marked by growth of 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.979
 nearly 7% of production out of the nine 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.300
 first months of the year the collection 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:44.300
 time now 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.879
 a slow down she joins since 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.849
 the end of october the profile 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:52.550
 evolution of the 2013 collection according to 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:56.180
 franceagrim the standard price of milk 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:59.690
 of cow was 358 euros of the 1000 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.919
 liters in the month of October and this price of 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.879
 milk will be maintained at levels 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:08.210
 relatively high over the entire 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:10.819
 last quarter of 2014 and on 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.360
 the full year of 2014 the price 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:17.960
 average milk should be 6 to 7% 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.210
 higher than that of the year 2013 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.330
 as regards the beginning of the year 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.900
 2015 is expected, however, that the 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.550
 price of milk is a notch below 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.919
 levels reached by the end of 2014 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.979
 with regard to all 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:37.039
 operating expenses ' the ipampa index 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:39.849
 of the Livestock Institute shows a 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:44.070
 very slight downtrend 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:45.810
 we note especially at 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.610
 feeding costs that are 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.610
 represented in glass on this graph 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.610
 a significant enough decline for 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:56.460
 as much as this decline did not have strong 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.100
 impacts on the general index which is 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.170
 shown in blue on this chart because 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.450
 other expense items increased 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:06.450
 in parallel in particular the expenses 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:09.180
 veterinarians but also the costs 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.690
 maintenance and repair 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.150
 vehicles 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.500
 In conclusion, the price of milk 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.770
 the farm will stay at levels 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:20.010
 relatively high over the entire 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:22.140
 last quarter of 2014 before starting 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.070
 a phase of decline on the beginning of 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.710
 the year 2015 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.690
 it is difficult to estimate on time 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.950
 present-day 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.440
 the magnitude and duration of this period 

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.900
 of floating but even if we are going 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.110
 go through a complicated period during 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.720
 a few months a turnaround 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.890
 in the course of the year 2015 is everything 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.260
 in fact conceivable 

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.360
 international demand, particularly in 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.860
 emerging countries remains indeed 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.860
 globally well oriented
