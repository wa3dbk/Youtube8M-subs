gets hurt on the first play the game and
he<00:02:22.730> hasn't<00:02:23.299> been<00:02:23.450> incensed<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.079> I've<00:02:24.200> played

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
he hasn't been incensed and I've played

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.319

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
six or seven games he was out for I

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.759 
six or seven games he was out for I
think<00:02:26.540> 10<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.720> then<00:02:29.720> comes<00:02:29.959> Dennis<00:02:30.260> Dixon<00:02:30.470> and

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
think 10 so then comes Dennis Dixon and

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.250 
think 10 so then comes Dennis Dixon and
he's<00:02:30.920> been<00:02:31.099> leading<00:02:31.250> one<00:02:31.519> ever<00:02:31.700> since<00:02:31.909> i<00:02:32.030> have

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
he's been leading one ever since i have

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.599 
he's been leading one ever since i have
bought<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.290> new<00:02:33.560> quarterback<00:02:33.950> he's<00:02:34.280> not<00:02:34.459> from

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
bought a new quarterback he's not from

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.160 
bought a new quarterback he's not from
Nebraska<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.239> haven't<00:02:35.540> found<00:02:35.629> a<00:02:35.780> Nebraska

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
Nebraska I haven't found a Nebraska

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.920 
Nebraska I haven't found a Nebraska
quarterback<00:02:36.409> yet<00:02:37.329> and<00:02:38.889> I<00:02:40.599> don't<00:02:41.599> know<00:02:41.870> if

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
quarterback yet and I don't know if

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.379 
quarterback yet and I don't know if
we're<00:02:42.049> actually<00:02:42.139> will<00:02:42.560> be<00:02:42.709> one<00:02:43.120> it's<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.389 
we're actually will be one it's the

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.300 
we're actually will be one it's the
database<00:02:45.019> is<00:02:45.170> built<00:02:45.650> off<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:47.919> the<00:02:48.919> NFL

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
database is built off of the the NFL

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.759 
database is built off of the the NFL
player<00:02:49.750> Association<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.109> there<00:02:51.470> isn't<00:02:51.709> a

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
player Association so there isn't a

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.629 
player Association so there isn't a
current<00:02:52.099> Nebraska<00:02:52.549> quarterback<00:02:52.790> in<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.180> NFL

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
current Nebraska quarterback in the NFL

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.909 
current Nebraska quarterback in the NFL
so<00:02:55.750> we<00:02:56.750> might<00:02:56.930> we<00:02:57.230> might<00:02:57.260> have<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.590> do<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.709> little

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
so we might we might have to do a little

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.339 
so we might we might have to do a little
bit<00:02:58.040> something<00:02:58.250> different<00:02:58.639> there<00:02:58.790> now<00:02:59.349> this

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349

every<00:03:08.930> year<00:03:09.409> to<00:03:10.400> do<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:11.569> last<00:03:11.659> company<00:03:11.959> to

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
every year to do the last company to

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.360 
every year to do the last company to
spend<00:03:12.349> a<00:03:12.379> little<00:03:12.439> bit<00:03:12.590> more<00:03:12.799> difficult<00:03:12.950> but

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
spend a little bit more difficult but

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.399 
spend a little bit more difficult but
with<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.760> improvement<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.569> V<00:03:14.780> game<00:03:15.139> and

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
with the improvement in V game and

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.250 
with the improvement in V game and
rushing<00:03:15.799> style<00:03:16.669> of<00:03:17.000> this<00:03:17.180> game<00:03:17.389> I<00:03:17.690> think<00:03:18.079> that

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
rushing style of this game I think that

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.819 
rushing style of this game I think that
it<00:03:18.379> could<00:03:18.409> work<00:03:18.889> out<00:03:19.010> really<00:03:19.250> well<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:21.440> you

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
it could work out really well and you

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.530 
it could work out really well and you
also<00:03:21.859> only<00:03:22.340> play<00:03:22.549> I<00:03:22.579> think<00:03:22.879> two<00:03:23.150> or<00:03:23.359> three

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
also only play I think two or three

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
also only play I think two or three
minute<00:03:23.780> quarters<00:03:23.989> here<00:03:24.169> in<00:03:24.290> these<00:03:24.409> first

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
minute quarters here in these first

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.610 
minute quarters here in these first
