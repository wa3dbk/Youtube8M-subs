00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello my name is so nelson today I'm going to 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.040
 teach them to use the simple line line 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.260
 daily brown and a way to draw and 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.170
 make husbands that would be the label 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.920
 purple pencils pencils 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.660
 graphite pastel soft oil pastel 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.609
 charcoal and other things, I'll go 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 We become an expert will 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.990
 start then with the game of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.269
 graphite pencils is perhaps where the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.669
 Most of you feel more 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.280
 comfortable many of us grew up in 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.530
 the school using pencils and it gives us the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.840
 feeling that we understand if you never 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.180
 have used a set of pencils to make 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.340
 husbands maybe you do not understand because they form 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.039
 such a wide variety of hardness and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.780
 softness a little exercise that I did 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.730
 a little while ago I got all the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.039
 pencils and made a quick scale of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.820
 value is the black square so black 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.370
 as I could and then dark half light and 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.129
 very clear using each of the pencils 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.470
 you do not need to do this but if you do 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.720
 you will discover quickly because 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.790
 constitutes such a wide range of hardness 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.430
 it really made a difference 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.130
 and it's much easier to use pencils 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.950
 hard to get a very light color and 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.890
 so on so maybe so 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.660
 what you want to do for fun 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.450
 Now I'm going to make a fast husband 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.640
 using our pencils and I'm going to start 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.130
 to use these spouse notebooks 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.130
 understands that it is a role that 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.620
 weighs 65 pounds and contains no acids 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.560
 this means that it will last until your 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.960
 great grandchild can redeem it for great 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.330
 sums of money which will be wonderful 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.270
 for you they are special for pencils 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.970
 pens and ink come in two colors 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.190
 different extra white and soft white 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.619
 the soft white is a little more color 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.530
 warm and has a touch a little more 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.450
 rough is is enough information 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.450
 let's assume that you want to make a 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.820
 fast husband I do not know if you've done any 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.530
 before it is a small mannequin in the first 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.360
 place is fun to play with them 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.850
 you can put them in any kind of 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.770
 pose frankly is not a bad way to 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.320
 learning human anatomy is not the last 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.370
 step of the process but it is a very good 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.850
 first step 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.830
 if you want 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.050
 learn to draw the human form I take 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.370
 having one of these little guys 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.740
 placed on my table during 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.690
 probably thirty years already and it has 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.850
 helped a lot to be able to 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.710
 perform husbands so let's do 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.710
 one I'm going to put it 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.420
 your assumption is as valid as mine 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.819
 I'm going to put it in a pose and then 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.610
 make a husband to start I'm going to 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.069
 take a medium hardness in this 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.769
 case is a b and I'm going to open my little 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.569
 Husband's notebook on this page 10 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.340
 that I need to teach you before you start 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.980
 the first thing you're going to realize 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.750
 is that I'm taking my pencil from a 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.880
 very strange way let me get you 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.190
 recommend you do the same here it is 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.730
 because when you take your pencil from this 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.780
 way you are moving your fingers and the 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.260
 part of your brain 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.250
 that controls your fingers are you preparing 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.200
 for this is not as good an artist as 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.069
 part of the brain that controls all of your 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.950
 arm 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.219
 You do not have to believe me but I'm right 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.459
 therefore as my pencil alosilla 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:28.230
 amazon so I call it and I can put it 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.749
 under any finger it does not matter which 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.790
 maybe you would like to do the same 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:34.859
 start by making a fast husband 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.349
 looking at the great ways of this 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.349
 mannequin let me recommend you 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.660
 that while I paint, it's not the thousands 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.180
 those who draw the paper 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.240
 but pay attention to how 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.160
 the one that moves moves the hands begins 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.280
 to emulate or imitate the way I 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.680
 I probably move my biggest advantage or 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.140
 point in favor to become 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.350
 artist was that my father was very good 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.350
 artist 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.400
 I remember perfectly seeing the draw 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.400
 when I was 3 4 or 5 years old 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.500
 the way he was moving is made me 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.690
 start with a good foot so you 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.760
 you should also do it there 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.920
 certain words that I would use for 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.310
 describe the nature of the line that 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.310
 I am drawing 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.380
 doodle this would be the term no 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.400
 technical but perfectly appropriate 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.340
 loose fluid 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.020
 free to 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:44.050
 happy happy world peace 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.289
 these are words that can be changed 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.240
 and move easily now once 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.400
 my husband is done 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.520
 and I have the big lines where I want 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.880
 have them I can turn my hand towards the 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.880
 other side 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.570
 now let me take a pencil more 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.050
 soft for example this you do not have to 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.530
 do this in no order but this is 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.639
 an egg-to-egg 5b and I'm going to take my 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.639
 pencil in the traditional way 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.940
 and delay in certain media on 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.450
 lines that I think are good in 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.450
 my husband 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.449
 it makes sense 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.009
 I'm not going to complete it because you do not need 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.050
 see me do all this drawing 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.689
 I just want you to take the basic idea 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.869
 but let's do some of this and 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:44.659
 after a certain point we want to put something 

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:47.360
 of shading here again because 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.279
 would someone draw the mannequin a 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.919
 reason is that a very good practice 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:54.020
 to learn to draw the human figure 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.240
 but when you're going to draw the figure 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.149
 current a model or simply people 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.399
 walking on the sidewalk when you look at them 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:03.409
 you will be able to draw faster read 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:06.399
 and more precisely because you've 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:06.399
 practiced something like that 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.860
 enough now some shading and I'm going 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.220
 to use one of the pencils here 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.009
 hard I'm going to take an h you can not see 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.940
 this mannequin where the same angle as 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:28.740
 me so you're going to have to notice me 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.990
 I'm doing the shading more than 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.449
 nothing from my point of view and by 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.600
 course in the camera your point of view 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.280
 it will be slightly different and now I'm 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.949
 taking the pencil from the way in which 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.449
 you're probably comfortable with the 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:44.669
 way you learned to pick up the pencil 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.280
 when you were learning to write to 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.400
 by c at school when you were a child 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.830
 small 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.780
 that's why it's most comfortable for most 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.780
 we are another way to grab it 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.300
 It seems difficult at first but 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.220
 I recommend nx energetically that you 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.020
 you usually get it this way and 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.120
 this is something that definitely 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.580
 would call a husband let's make a 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.460
 distinction between husband and final drawing 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.199
 not the husband often looks like this 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.750
 strong and spontaneous a husband 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:17.120
 normally it is not very elaborate in 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.550
 just do it fast and you can 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.770
 leave it to go back over them more 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.539
 late and turn it into a drawing and this 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.970
 it's one of the differences between paper 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:28.789
 for husband and the drawing paper the 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.130
 drawing paper weighs almost always more and 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:34.490
 it has a more end-to-touch sensation or 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:36.320
 more super thin finer so there's less 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.270
 variations or imperfections in the 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.419
 surface would resist a lot of 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.970
 fruity and erased and talking about rubbing 

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:46.570
 and delete let's open the game to 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.570
 to make husbands
