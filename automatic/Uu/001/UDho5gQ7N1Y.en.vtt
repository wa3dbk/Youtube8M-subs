all the cables are routed as much as

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.639 
all the cables are routed as much as
they<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.820> through<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.210> back<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> case<00:00:51.840> so

they can through the back of the case so

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.139 
they can through the back of the case so
the<00:00:52.770> clutters<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> back<00:00:53.489> keep<00:00:53.940> being

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
actually I'd help the label pointing

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.920 
actually I'd help the label pointing
this<00:02:15.100> way<00:02:15.160> cuz<00:02:15.519> it's<00:02:15.670> going<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.060> vent<00:02:16.239> through

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
millimeter fan right over here so I

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.660 
millimeter fan right over here so I
convince<00:02:32.350> some<00:02:32.560> more<00:02:32.799> air<00:02:33.100> right<00:02:33.340> into<00:02:33.579> the

convince some more air right into the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.960 
video cards so you can see the cables
are<00:02:39.000> pretty<00:02:40.000> much<00:02:40.209> out<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.630> way<00:02:41.880> here's<00:02:42.880> a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
nice large case fan I'm not show the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.400 
nice large case fan I'm not show the

the case and being pulled out through
here<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.959> here<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:57.570> i<00:02:58.950> think<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.040> eaten<00:03:00.220> tidy

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
here and here and i think is eaten tidy

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.470 
here and here and i think is eaten tidy
here's<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.970> modular<00:03:01.480> case<00:03:02.280> modular<00:03:03.480> 1200

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
here's the modular case modular 1200

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.360 
here's the modular case modular 1200
watt<00:03:04.660> power<00:03:05.650> supply<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:08.350> this<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:08.890> look<00:03:09.220> at

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
watt power supply and this is a look at

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.199 
watt power supply and this is a look at
what<00:03:09.640> some<00:03:09.820> of<00:03:09.880> these<00:03:10.090> cables<00:03:10.600> look<00:03:10.750> like<00:03:12.209> see

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
what some of these cables look like see

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.660 
what some of these cables look like see
this<00:03:13.390> end<00:03:13.930> goes<00:03:14.380> into<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.130> back<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.459> power

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
this end goes into the back of the power

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:24.740 
this end goes into the back of the power
supply<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:17.700> listen<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.820> your<00:03:18.940> component

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.490 

now<00:03:25.750> as<00:03:25.870> far<00:03:26.049> as<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.260> rear<00:03:26.409> of<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.620> case<00:03:28.500> where

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
now as far as the rear of the case where

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.080 
now as far as the rear of the case where
everything<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.189> all<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.489> fun<00:03:30.670> is<00:03:30.790> hitting

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
everything is all the fun is hitting

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:39.479 
everything is all the fun is hitting
it's<00:03:32.079> where<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.349> message<00:03:37.890> see<00:03:38.890> everything<00:03:39.340> is

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
it's where the message see everything is

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.069 
it's where the message see everything is
routed<00:03:39.879> through<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.090> back<00:03:40.359> through<00:03:40.959> the

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
routed through the back through the

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:54.899 
routed through the back through the
various<00:03:41.260> holes<00:03:41.590> in<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:41.920> case<00:03:53.549> this<00:03:54.549> some

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
various holes in the case this some

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.170 
various holes in the case this some
whole<00:03:55.739> exposing<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.799> CPU<00:03:57.250> could<00:03:57.730> stand<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.150> be

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
whole exposing the CPU could stand to be

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.379 
whole exposing the CPU could stand to be
a<00:03:58.299> little<00:03:58.359> larger<00:03:58.889> as<00:03:59.889> you<00:04:00.280> see<00:04:00.489> this<00:04:00.670> the

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
a little larger as you see this the

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.229 
a little larger as you see this the
mounting<00:04:01.750> bracket<00:04:02.459> for<00:04:03.459> this<00:04:03.700> cooler<00:04:04.000> is

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
mounting bracket for this cooler is

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:11.099 
mounting bracket for this cooler is
right<00:04:05.230> at<00:04:05.379> the<00:04:05.470> very<00:04:05.500> edge<00:04:08.760> over<00:04:09.760> here<00:04:09.970> so<00:04:10.959> i'm

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
right at the very edge over here so i'm

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.690 
right at the very edge over here so i'm
not<00:04:11.290> sure<00:04:11.500> if<00:04:11.590> I'd<00:04:11.709> be<00:04:11.739> able<00:04:11.889> to<00:04:12.280> remove<00:04:12.459> this

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
not sure if I'd be able to remove this

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.159 
not sure if I'd be able to remove this
without<00:04:13.090> removing<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.569> entire<00:04:13.870> motherboard

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
without removing the entire motherboard

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.849 
without removing the entire motherboard
the<00:04:15.129> whole<00:04:15.280> point<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.609> this<00:04:15.730> hole<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.269> too<00:04:16.859> so

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
the whole point of this hole is too so

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.339 
the whole point of this hole is too so
you<00:04:17.919> don't<00:04:18.130> have<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.459> remove<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.820> motherboard

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
you don't have to remove the motherboard

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.080 
you don't have to remove the motherboard
but<00:04:20.349> that<00:04:20.530> could<00:04:20.859> be<00:04:20.979> an<00:04:21.099> issue<00:04:21.190> but<00:04:21.549> hopefully

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
but that could be an issue but hopefully

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.990 
but that could be an issue but hopefully
I'll<00:04:22.599> never<00:04:22.810> need<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.800> or<00:04:23.979> wants<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.490> replace

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
I'll never need to or wants to replace

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.760 
I'll never need to or wants to replace
the<00:04:25.590> puller<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:30.870> there<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:31.990> have<00:04:32.050> it<00:04:32.260> I<00:04:32.560> will

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
the puller and there you have it I will

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.480 
the puller and there you have it I will
do<00:04:33.010> another<00:04:33.370> post<00:04:33.729> with<00:04:34.120> uh<00:04:34.919> some<00:04:35.919> benchmarks

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
do another post with uh some benchmarks

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.460 
do another post with uh some benchmarks
on<00:04:36.699> this<00:04:36.849> puppy<00:04:37.090> in<00:04:37.570> heaven<00:04:38.409> 2.5<00:04:40.080> maybe<00:04:41.080> send<00:04:41.409> a

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
on this puppy in heaven 2.5 maybe send a

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.590 
on this puppy in heaven 2.5 maybe send a
bench<00:04:41.680> as<00:04:42.639> well<00:04:43.110> we'll<00:04:44.110> see<00:04:44.260> how<00:04:44.380> girls
