00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.699 

so<00:00:10.780> I<00:00:11.110> just<00:00:11.469> played<00:00:11.650> some<00:00:11.769> metal<00:00:12.539> and<00:00:13.709> I'm

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:14.709 
so I just played some metal and I'm

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.560 
so I just played some metal and I'm
going<00:00:14.889> to<00:00:14.950> talk<00:00:15.100> about<00:00:15.180> distortion<00:00:16.180> though<00:00:16.330> I

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
going to talk about distortion though I

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.450 
going to talk about distortion though I
went<00:00:16.960> straight<00:00:17.199> to<00:00:17.320> metal<00:00:17.560> because<00:00:17.859> there<00:00:18.310> is

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
went straight to metal because there is

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.700 
went straight to metal because there is
no<00:00:18.670> metal<00:00:18.850> without<00:00:19.090> distortion<00:00:19.810> but<00:00:20.170> I<00:00:20.380> wanted

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
no metal without distortion but I wanted

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.460 
no metal without distortion but I wanted
to<00:00:20.830> talk<00:00:21.010> about<00:00:21.570> distortion<00:00:22.570> and<00:00:22.750> exactly<00:00:23.320> how

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
to talk about distortion and exactly how

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.070 
to talk about distortion and exactly how
to<00:00:23.529> use<00:00:23.619> it<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.970> get<00:00:25.120> a<00:00:25.180> sound<00:00:25.450> that<00:00:25.720> ranges

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
to use it to get a sound that ranges

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.830 
to use it to get a sound that ranges
anywhere<00:00:26.230> from<00:00:26.730> classic<00:00:27.730> rock<00:00:27.760> to<00:00:28.240> heavy

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
anywhere from classic rock to heavy

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.050 
anywhere from classic rock to heavy
metal<00:00:29.200> what<00:00:29.920> I<00:00:29.950> have<00:00:30.190> here<00:00:30.400> is<00:00:30.550> I<00:00:30.670> have<00:00:30.699> two

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
metal what I have here is I have two

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.400 
metal what I have here is I have two
very<00:00:31.300> different<00:00:31.660> kinds<00:00:31.869> of<00:00:31.930> distortion

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
very different kinds of distortion

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.229 
very different kinds of distortion
pedals<00:00:32.739> the<00:00:33.460> one<00:00:33.610> I<00:00:33.640> was<00:00:33.850> just<00:00:33.879> playing

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
pedals the one I was just playing

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.600 
pedals the one I was just playing
through<00:00:34.510> is<00:00:34.719> the<00:00:35.079> metal<00:00:35.590> zone<00:00:35.770> pedals<00:00:36.219> made<00:00:36.460> by

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
through is the metal zone pedals made by

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.459 
through is the metal zone pedals made by
boss<00:00:36.789> they<00:00:37.510> used<00:00:37.690> to<00:00:37.780> make<00:00:37.930> a<00:00:37.989> pedal<00:00:38.289> called

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
boss they used to make a pedal called

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.229 
boss they used to make a pedal called
the<00:00:38.530> heavy<00:00:38.739> metal<00:00:39.070> pedal<00:00:39.370> back<00:00:39.670> in<00:00:39.850> the<00:00:39.910> 80s

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
the heavy metal pedal back in the 80s

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.090 
the heavy metal pedal back in the 80s
and<00:00:40.360> I<00:00:40.720> don't<00:00:41.050> know<00:00:41.230> if<00:00:41.320> they<00:00:41.410> make<00:00:41.590> it<00:00:41.710> anymore

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
and I don't know if they make it anymore

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.979 
and I don't know if they make it anymore
but<00:00:42.610> this<00:00:42.790> one<00:00:43.000> is<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.149> closest<00:00:43.630> thing<00:00:43.780> that<00:00:43.960> I

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
but this one is the closest thing that I

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.870 
but this one is the closest thing that I
could<00:00:44.230> find<00:00:44.470> to<00:00:44.739> that<00:00:45.070> pedal<00:00:45.370> that<00:00:45.489> they<00:00:45.610> still

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
could find to that pedal that they still

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.420 
could find to that pedal that they still
make<00:00:46.090> you<00:00:46.470> have<00:00:47.470> some<00:00:47.620> very<00:00:47.710> basic<00:00:48.070> settings

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
make you have some very basic settings

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.100 
make you have some very basic settings

pedals or overdrive pedals that we were

pedals or overdrive pedals that we were
talking<00:00:52.809> about<00:00:52.989> before<00:00:53.200> you<00:00:53.530> have<00:00:53.680> an<00:00:53.950> overall

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460

you<00:00:56.500> have<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.710> distortion<00:00:57.070> which<00:00:57.610> is<00:00:57.730> the

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
you have the distortion which is the

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.950 
you have the distortion which is the
amount<00:00:57.940> of<00:00:58.059> distortion<00:00:58.329> minimum<00:00:58.840> to<00:00:58.930> maximum

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.900 
and the EQ settings are in the middle
different<00:01:02.050> frequencies<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:03.190> gray<00:01:03.520> area

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
different frequencies the gray area

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.700

about<00:01:04.119> overdrive<00:01:04.600> versus<00:01:04.960> distortion<00:01:05.500> is

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
about overdrive versus distortion is

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.100 
about overdrive versus distortion is
that<00:01:06.009> really<00:01:06.700> to<00:01:07.090> me<00:01:07.119> the<00:01:07.570> simplest<00:01:07.930> way<00:01:08.049> to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
that really to me the simplest way to

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.709 
that really to me the simplest way to
describe<00:01:08.979> it<00:01:09.159> is<00:01:09.369> where<00:01:09.969> as<00:01:10.090> overdrive<00:01:10.539> is

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
describe it is where as overdrive is

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.240 
describe it is where as overdrive is
trying<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.049> achieve<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.469> sound<00:01:11.649> of<00:01:11.829> a<00:01:11.890> cranked

trying to achieve the sound of a cranked

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.190 
trying to achieve the sound of a cranked
amp<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.960> works<00:01:14.409> with<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:15.220> clean

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
amp and it works with the clean

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.750 
amp and it works with the clean
transparent<00:01:17.200> sound<00:01:17.619> of<00:01:17.920> your<00:01:18.130> guitar<00:01:18.280> signal

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
transparent sound of your guitar signal

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.289 
transparent sound of your guitar signal
with<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.540> amp<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:20.580> sometimes<00:01:21.580> color<00:01:21.940> it<00:01:22.119> but

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
with the amp to sometimes color it but

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.719 
with the amp to sometimes color it but
mostly<00:01:23.080> it's<00:01:23.350> trying<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.890> emulate<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.549> sound

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
mostly it's trying to emulate the sound

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.210 
mostly it's trying to emulate the sound

what<00:01:37.210> distortion<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:38.140> when<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:38.409> finally

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
what distortion is is when you finally

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.090 
what distortion is is when you finally
cross<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.310> line<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.520> where<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.299> gain<00:01:40.540> is

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
coloring the tone this is without it so

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.800 
coloring the tone this is without it so
the<00:03:05.739> amp<00:03:05.890> is<00:03:06.010> completely<00:03:06.459> clean<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:07.450> all<00:03:07.659> of

the amp is completely clean so all of

the distortion is coming from the pedal

the distortion is coming from the pedal

one<00:03:22.269> thing<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.510> really<00:03:22.750> like<00:03:22.900> about<00:03:23.049> this<00:03:23.260> pedal

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
one thing I really like about this pedal

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.979 
one thing I really like about this pedal
is<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.610> breaks<00:03:24.790> up<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.360> starts<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.750> sound

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
is that it breaks up and starts to sound

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.619 
is that it breaks up and starts to sound
almost<00:03:26.260> like<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.980> speaker<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.549> failing<00:03:27.879> the

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
almost like the speaker is failing the

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
zvex pedals are pretty crazy in the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.830 
zvex pedals are pretty crazy in the
sense<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.489> they<00:03:30.640> go<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.849> extremes<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.660> this

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
sense that they go to extremes and this

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.930 
sense that they go to extremes and this
is<00:03:31.989> definitely<00:03:32.470> no<00:03:32.739> exception<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.760> can

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
is definitely no exception you can

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.860 
is definitely no exception you can
really<00:03:34.950> go<00:03:35.950> crazy<00:03:36.310> with<00:03:36.549> this<00:03:36.670> pedal<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.150> and

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
really go crazy with this pedal and and

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.420 
really go crazy with this pedal and and
and<00:03:38.260> really<00:03:38.379> get<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.859> sound<00:03:39.069> like<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.280> amp

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
and really get it to sound like the amp

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.610 
and really get it to sound like the amp
is<00:03:39.640> trashed<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.329> some<00:03:40.989> people<00:03:41.230> really<00:03:41.379> like

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
is trashed and some people really like

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.460 
is trashed and some people really like
that<00:03:41.799> effect<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:43.150> you<00:03:43.959> can<00:03:44.109> do<00:03:44.170> some<00:03:44.319> really

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
that effect and you can do some really

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.440 
that effect and you can do some really
cool<00:03:44.590> things<00:03:44.950> with<00:03:45.069> it

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
cool things with it
