to show you what it really does so this

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.170 
to show you what it really does so this
like<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.770> your<00:01:37.920> band<00:01:38.100> also<00:01:38.310> comes<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.850> USB

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.109 
in itself so you could just plug it in
directly<00:01:42.479> into<00:01:42.570> computer<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.200> that's<00:01:43.320> it

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
directly into computer and that's it
