the<00:00:57.870> reason<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.200> like<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:58.950> is<00:00:59.219> because

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the reason I like this one is because

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.900 
the reason I like this one is because
the<00:00:59.700> collar<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.420> not<00:01:00.660> too<00:01:00.840> big<00:01:01.079> or<00:01:01.320> too<00:01:01.739> small

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
the collar is not too big or too small

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.400 
the collar is not too big or too small
which<00:01:02.910> makes<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.329> very<00:01:03.360> versatile<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.170> can

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.130 
which makes it very versatile you can
wear<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.800> with<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.009> tie<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.700> bow<00:01:06.119> tie<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.690> no<00:01:06.899> tie
