fourth and let me talk a bit about how I
got<00:00:24.210> inspired<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.779> build<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.500> kind<00:00:25.740> of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
got inspired to build in this kind of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.950 
got inspired to build in this kind of
style<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.670> tower<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.449> based<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.810> what

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
style this tower is really based on what

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.189 
style this tower is really based on what
I<00:00:27.990> saw<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.740> faon<00:00:29.359> style<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.480> their<00:00:30.689> belts<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.170> I

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
I saw in faon style of their belts but I

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.830 
I saw in faon style of their belts but I
added<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> lot<00:00:31.769> more<00:00:31.830> windows<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> top<00:00:33.180> just

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
added a lot more windows to the top just

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.900 
added a lot more windows to the top just
to<00:00:33.989> make<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.559> little<00:00:34.920> bit<00:00:35.130> more<00:00:35.250> interesting

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
to make it a little bit more interesting

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.150 
to make it a little bit more interesting
and<00:00:36.440> yeah<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> kind<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.059> bit

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
and yeah I kind of like it it's a bit

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.310 
and yeah I kind of like it it's a bit
over<00:00:41.160> top<00:00:41.399> maybe<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.000> yeah<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.360> kind<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.079> like

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
over top maybe but yeah I kind of like

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.799 
over top maybe but yeah I kind of like
it<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.829> then<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.489> wanted<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> fort<00:00:45.539> itself

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
it and then I wanted for the fort itself

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.619 
it and then I wanted for the fort itself
or<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.770> still<00:00:46.950> see<00:00:47.370> my<00:00:47.520> way<00:00:47.700> point<00:00:48.030> for

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
or you can still see my way point for

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.270 
or you can still see my way point for
fort<00:00:48.870> itself<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.440> wanted<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.829> little<00:00:50.070> bit<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
fort itself I wanted a little bit of a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.760 
fort itself I wanted a little bit of a
different<00:00:50.370> kind<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.180> towers<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.260> didn't<00:00:52.559> want<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
different kind of towers I didn't want a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.220 
different kind of towers I didn't want a
roof<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.129> them<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> came<00:00:54.210> up<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:54.960> this

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
roof on them so I came up with this

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.760 
roof on them so I came up with this
design<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.010> actually<00:00:56.809> really<00:00:57.809> liking<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.500> I

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
design and actually really liking it I

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.970 
design and actually really liking it I
don't<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.399> it<00:01:00.300> really<00:01:00.629> looks

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
don't know what it really looks

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.729 
don't know what it really looks
realistic<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> fort<00:01:02.850> could<00:01:03.059> actually<00:01:03.210> be

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
realistic like a fort could actually be

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.170 
realistic like a fort could actually be
but<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.830> course<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.519> some<00:01:05.760> extra

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
but of course just with some extra

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.660 
but of course just with some extra
detail<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.869> then<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.650> wall<00:01:07.920> design<00:01:08.310> came

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
detail and then the wall design came

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.580 
detail and then the wall design came
very<00:01:09.000> fast<00:01:09.150> idly<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:12.229> then<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> wall

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
very fast idly I and then the wall

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.249 
very fast idly I and then the wall
design<00:01:13.950> came<00:01:14.189> pretty<00:01:14.490> fast<00:01:14.610> actually<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.450> that

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
design came pretty fast actually so that

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.280 
design came pretty fast actually so that
was<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:16.799> skewed<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.810> whole<00:01:18.930> thing

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
was a little skewed so this whole thing

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.789 
was a little skewed so this whole thing
I've<00:01:19.590> build<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.580> then<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.909> keep<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.680> if<00:01:22.680> you

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
I've build and then to keep and if you

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.440 
I've build and then to keep and if you
watch<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.220> storyline<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.850> will<00:01:24.030> know<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
watch the storyline you will know that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.170 
watch the storyline you will know that
this<00:01:24.659> keep<00:01:24.990> isn't<00:01:25.770> really<00:01:26.100> destroyed<00:01:26.820> but

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
this keep isn't really destroyed but

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.140 
this keep isn't really destroyed but
just<00:01:27.420> abandoned<00:01:27.990> empty<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.770> full<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.670> spiders

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
just abandoned empty and full of spiders

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.560 
just abandoned empty and full of spiders
really<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.290> all<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> towers<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:32.570> completely

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
really and all the towers are completely

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.840 
really and all the towers are completely
filled<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:34.020> cobwebs<00:01:34.320> except<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.520> one

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
filled with cobwebs except this one

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.620 
filled with cobwebs except this one
where<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> wind<00:01:36.900> up<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> book<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.630> will

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
where I wind up to get a book and will

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.039 
where I wind up to get a book and will
go<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:39.990> there<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.520> show<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:42.060> how

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
go up there now just to show you how

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.190 
go up there now just to show you how
those<00:01:43.350> towers<00:01:43.950> look<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.549> there<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:46.049> yeah

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
those towers look up there so yeah

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.929 
those towers look up there so yeah
basically<00:01:46.439> up<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> towers<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.430> didn't<00:01:47.729> want<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
basically up the towers I didn't want to

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.060 
basically up the towers I didn't want to
roof<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> added<00:01:48.869> these<00:01:49.170> these<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:49.979> of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
roof so I added these these kind of

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.190 
roof so I added these these kind of
spikes<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.850> don't<00:01:51.030> know<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.390> call<00:01:51.659> them

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
spikes I don't know what you call them

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.270 
spikes I don't know what you call them
but<00:01:52.790> basically<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.299> allows<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
but basically so that allows you to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.910 
but basically so that allows you to
shoot<00:01:56.280> arrows<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:57.119> your<00:01:57.299> enemies<00:01:57.680> down<00:01:58.680> on

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
shoot arrows to your enemies down on

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.249 
shoot arrows to your enemies down on
your<00:01:59.040> enemies<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.939> could<00:02:00.570> stand<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:00.930> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
your enemies like I could stand here and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.179 
your enemies like I could stand here and
shoot<00:02:01.500> them<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:04.439> could<00:02:04.619> hide<00:02:04.860> behind

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
shoot them and you could hide behind

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.570 
shoot them and you could hide behind
those<00:02:05.549> spikes<00:02:05.969> yourself<00:02:06.890> so<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.220> was<00:02:08.369> kind

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
those spikes yourself so that was kind

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.740 
those spikes yourself so that was kind
of<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.700> idea<00:02:08.819> we're<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.360> going<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.599> go<00:02:09.720> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
of the idea we're just going to go to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.559 
of the idea we're just going to go to
the<00:02:10.050> bigger<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.099> before<00:02:11.489> we<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:11.610> down<00:02:11.940> into

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
the bigger one before we go down into

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.949 
the bigger one before we go down into
the<00:02:13.200> trap<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.829> you<00:02:14.069> have<00:02:14.450> maybe<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.599> may<00:02:15.840> have

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
the trap that you have maybe I may have

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.009 
the trap that you have maybe I may have
seen<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.409> the<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.889> the<00:02:16.950> storyline<00:02:17.700> video<00:02:21.019> so

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
seen in the in the storyline video so

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.099 
seen in the in the storyline video so
yeah<00:02:22.200> we'll<00:02:22.379> go<00:02:22.560> up<00:02:22.739> here<00:02:23.159> and<00:02:23.959> yeah<00:02:24.959> basically

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
yeah we'll go up here and yeah basically

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.259 
yeah we'll go up here and yeah basically
all<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.799> isn't<00:02:26.129> decorated<00:02:26.579> because<00:02:26.879> you

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
all of this isn't decorated because you

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.619 
all of this isn't decorated because you
wouldn't<00:02:27.629> see<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:29.489> storyline<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.510> I

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
wouldn't see it in the storyline and I

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.929 
wouldn't see it in the storyline and I
don't<00:02:31.079> know<00:02:31.260> if<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.739> building<00:02:32.459> will<00:02:32.790> have

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
don't know if this building will have

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.599 
don't know if this building will have
another<00:02:33.150> purpose<00:02:33.719> beside<00:02:34.109> that<00:02:34.349> so<00:02:34.799> you<00:02:35.370> can

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
another purpose beside that so you can

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.179 
another purpose beside that so you can
see<00:02:35.879> a<00:02:35.909> big<00:02:36.150> space<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:36.900> could<00:02:37.079> hide<00:02:37.920> behind

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
see a big space you could hide behind

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.699 
see a big space you could hide behind
these<00:02:38.609> and<00:02:38.669> then<00:02:39.090> shoot<00:02:39.359> people<00:02:39.750> between<00:02:40.349> them

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
these and then shoot people between them

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.990 
these and then shoot people between them
so<00:02:41.459> it's<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.969> pretty<00:02:43.189> pretty<00:02:44.189> good<00:02:44.459> defendable

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
so it's a pretty pretty good defendable

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.459 
so it's a pretty pretty good defendable
fort<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:47.870> yeah<00:02:48.870> we<00:02:49.439> need<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.650> be<00:02:50.579> one<00:02:50.790> lower<00:02:51.469> so

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:52.469 
fort and yeah we need to be one lower so

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.250 
fort and yeah we need to be one lower so
yeah<00:02:52.650> we'll<00:02:52.859> now<00:02:53.040> go<00:02:53.099> over<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.969> the<00:02:54.480> trap<00:02:54.870> what

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
yeah we'll now go over to the trap what

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.649 
yeah we'll now go over to the trap what
