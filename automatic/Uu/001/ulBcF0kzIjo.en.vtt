you

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.430 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.129 

welcome<00:00:08.430> to<00:00:08.519> sbcu<00:00:08.670> today<00:00:09.570> we're<00:00:09.930> going<00:00:10.049> to

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
welcome to sbcu today we're going to

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.379 
welcome to sbcu today we're going to
talk<00:00:10.290> about<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.620> diverge<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.730> diverge<00:00:12.120> it's

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
talk about the diverge the diverge it's

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.629 
talk about the diverge the diverge it's
all<00:00:12.660> about<00:00:12.900> redefining<00:00:13.320> what's<00:00:13.950> possible<00:00:14.039> on

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
all about redefining what's possible on

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.150 
all about redefining what's possible on
a<00:00:14.730> road<00:00:14.969> bike<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.929> you've<00:00:16.080> always<00:00:16.259> been<00:00:16.740> riding

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
a road bike so you've always been riding

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.370 
a road bike so you've always been riding
you<00:00:17.369> see<00:00:17.610> that<00:00:17.790> gate<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.660> wonder<00:00:18.960> what's

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
you see that gate and you wonder what's

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.780 
you see that gate and you wonder what's
on<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> other<00:00:19.650> side<00:00:19.800> where<00:00:20.310> does<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.580> dirt

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
on the other side where does that dirt

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.999 
on the other side where does that dirt
road<00:00:20.970> go<00:00:21.240> with<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.020> diverged<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.860> can

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
road go with the diverged you can

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.470 
road go with the diverged you can
explore<00:00:23.399> that<00:00:23.460> road<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.329> do<00:00:24.450> it

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
explore that road and you can do it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.790 
explore that road and you can do it
confidently

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.170 

so<00:00:30.800> it<00:00:30.949> starts<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.369> geometry<00:00:31.820> of<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.000> bike

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
so it starts the geometry of the bike

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.299 
so it starts the geometry of the bike
and<00:00:32.390> when<00:00:32.930> we<00:00:33.050> built<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.410> diverge<00:00:33.680> we<00:00:34.040> wanted

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
and when we built the diverge we wanted

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.400 
and when we built the diverge we wanted
to<00:00:34.370> make<00:00:34.520> sure<00:00:34.550> that<00:00:35.120> we<00:00:35.270> had<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:35.660> bike<00:00:36.079> that<00:00:36.290> had

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
to make sure that we had a bike that had

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.410 
to make sure that we had a bike that had
its<00:00:36.559> roots<00:00:36.829> based<00:00:37.280> in<00:00:37.460> performance<00:00:37.970> was

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
its roots based in performance was

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.810 
its roots based in performance was
really<00:00:38.660> fun<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:39.260> really<00:00:39.590> fast<00:00:39.920> what<00:00:40.520> we<00:00:40.640> ended

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
really fun and really fast what we ended

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.970 
really fun and really fast what we ended
up<00:00:40.940> building<00:00:41.120> was<00:00:41.840> a<00:00:41.870> bike<00:00:42.170> that<00:00:42.410> features<00:00:42.770> our

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
up building was a bike that features our

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.460 
up building was a bike that features our
endurance<00:00:43.370> geometry<00:00:44.090> what<00:00:44.900> that<00:00:45.079> means<00:00:45.290> for

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
endurance geometry what that means for

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.320 
endurance geometry what that means for
you<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:45.769> rider<00:00:46.010> is<00:00:46.250> that<00:00:46.760> we<00:00:46.850> put<00:00:47.059> you<00:00:47.180> in<00:00:47.210> a

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
you the rider is that we put you in a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.759 
you the rider is that we put you in a
nice<00:00:47.510> comfortable<00:00:47.930> position<00:00:48.199> with<00:00:48.650> a

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
nice comfortable position with a

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.890 
nice comfortable position with a
slightly<00:00:49.190> taller<00:00:49.519> head<00:00:49.850> tube<00:00:50.089> but<00:00:50.750> we've

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
slightly taller head tube but we've

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.750 
slightly taller head tube but we've
still<00:00:51.140> kept<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:51.620> wheelbase<00:00:51.949> nice<00:00:52.519> and

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
still kept the wheelbase nice and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.970 
still kept the wheelbase nice and
compact<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.870> chain<00:00:54.110> stays<00:00:54.379> nice<00:00:54.739> and

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
compact and the chain stays nice and

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.119 
compact and the chain stays nice and
short<00:00:55.300> resulting<00:00:56.300> in<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:56.960> ride<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.769> provides

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
short resulting in a ride that provides

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.280 
short resulting in a ride that provides
for<00:00:58.489> quick<00:00:58.670> acceleration<00:00:58.970> great<00:00:59.690> climate<00:01:00.140> and

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
for quick acceleration great climate and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.560 
for quick acceleration great climate and
descending<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.100> overall<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:02.059> can<00:01:02.420> have<00:01:02.539> a

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
descending and overall you can have a

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.820 
descending and overall you can have a
really<00:01:02.840> spirited<00:01:03.379> ride<00:01:03.559> on<00:01:03.710> this<00:01:03.829> bike

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.680 

so<00:01:09.700> if<00:01:09.790> you're<00:01:09.940> going<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.090> redefine<00:01:10.390> what's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
so if you're going to redefine what's

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.270 
so if you're going to redefine what's
possible<00:01:11.050> on<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.200> road<00:01:11.350> bike<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.890> better<00:01:12.130> have

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
possible on a road bike you better have

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.980 
possible on a road bike you better have
the<00:01:12.310> confidence<00:01:12.850> to<00:01:12.910> do<00:01:13.120> it<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.420> we<00:01:13.750> wanted<00:01:13.930> to

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
the confidence to do it and we wanted to

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.450 
the confidence to do it and we wanted to
make<00:01:14.170> sure<00:01:14.200> we<00:01:14.410> built<00:01:14.620> in<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.860> few<00:01:15.010> things<00:01:15.250> to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
make sure we built in a few things to

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.370 
make sure we built in a few things to
give<00:01:15.640> you<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.850> confidence<00:01:16.060> so<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.140> first

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
give you that confidence so the first

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.050 
give you that confidence so the first
thing<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.770> disc<00:01:17.980> brakes<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.460> disc<00:01:19.000> brakes

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
thing is the disc brakes and disc brakes

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.940 
thing is the disc brakes and disc brakes
are<00:01:19.390> found<00:01:19.570> on<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.750> diverge<00:01:20.110> all<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.860> way

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
are found on the diverge all the way

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.280 
are found on the diverge all the way
through<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.310> entire<00:01:21.610> line<00:01:21.940> disc<00:01:22.900> brakes<00:01:23.140> are

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
through the entire line disc brakes are

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.470 
through the entire line disc brakes are
awesome<00:01:23.680> they<00:01:24.100> give<00:01:24.250> you<00:01:24.370> more<00:01:24.400> control<00:01:24.880> they

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
awesome they give you more control they

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.870 
awesome they give you more control they
give<00:01:25.660> you<00:01:25.750> more<00:01:25.900> power<00:01:26.140> more<00:01:27.010> modulation<00:01:27.520> and

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
give you more power more modulation and

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.760 
give you more power more modulation and
actually<00:01:28.300> require<00:01:28.600> less<00:01:28.960> effort<00:01:29.230> from<00:01:29.710> the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
actually require less effort from the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.980 
actually require less effort from the
rider<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.280> bring<00:01:30.460> you<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.700> stop<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.270> best<00:01:31.870> of

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
come with it through axle what this does

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.190 
come with it through axle what this does
is<00:01:42.280> provides<00:01:42.910> more<00:01:43.180> stiffness<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.810> better

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
is provides more stiffness and better

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.040 
is provides more stiffness and better

here<00:01:51.460> too<00:01:51.640> so<00:01:51.910> we<00:01:52.000> provided<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.600> little<00:01:53.050> bit

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
here too so we provided a little bit

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.110 
here too so we provided a little bit
more<00:01:53.380> tire<00:01:53.980> clearance<00:01:54.400> and<00:01:54.520> ones<00:01:54.640> typically

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
more tire clearance and ones typically

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.720 
more tire clearance and ones typically
found<00:01:55.300> on<00:01:55.510> a<00:01:55.600> road<00:01:55.900> bike<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.260> respect<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:57.160> wider

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
found on a road bike and respect a wider

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.310 
found on a road bike and respect a wider
tire<00:01:58.000> which<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.390> would<00:01:58.510> typically<00:01:58.810> find<00:01:59.080> on<00:01:59.260> a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
tire which you would typically find on a
