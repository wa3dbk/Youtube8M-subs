it's<00:00:44.940> organized<00:00:45.539> chaos<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.200> think<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it's organized chaos I think that's a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.680 
it's organized chaos I think that's a
word<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.550> give<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.789> ever<00:00:48.480> since

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
word that I can give it ever since

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.779 
word that I can give it ever since
muhlenberg<00:00:49.410> close<00:00:49.620> we've<00:00:49.829> had<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> challenge

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
muhlenberg close we've had a challenge

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.160 
muhlenberg close we've had a challenge
we've<00:00:51.000> had<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.360> accommodate<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.930> lot<00:00:52.050> more

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
we've had to accommodate a lot more

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.799 
we've had to accommodate a lot more
patients<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.070> very<00:00:53.340> small<00:00:53.670> space<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.539> it's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
patients in a very small space so it's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.720 
patients in a very small space so it's
been<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.260> little<00:00:55.440> bit<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> challenge<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.670> us

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
been a little bit of a challenge for us

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.880 
been a little bit of a challenge for us
but<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.260> teamwork<00:00:58.260> has<00:00:58.440> allowed<00:00:58.649> us<00:00:58.710> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
but I think teamwork has allowed us to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.250 
but I think teamwork has allowed us to
get<00:00:59.820> through<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.329> make<00:01:00.750> sure<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
get through it and make sure that the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.569 
get through it and make sure that the
new<00:01:01.379> things<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.649> we've<00:01:01.859> implemented<00:01:02.219> have

working in this field they can't at all
understand<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.810> go<00:01:27.930> through<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.320> I

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
understand what you go through so I

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
understand what you go through so I
think<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.520> stress<00:01:29.729> level<00:01:29.790> yes<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.479> very

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
think the stress level yes it's very

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.200 
think the stress level yes it's very
high<00:01:30.869> we<00:01:31.619> are<00:01:31.710> here<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> pediatric<00:01:32.400> unit

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
high we are here in the pediatric unit

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.840 
high we are here in the pediatric unit
of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.650> emergency<00:01:34.650> department<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.670> I'm

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
of the emergency department and and I'm

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.490 
of the emergency department and and I'm
curious<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.920> different<00:01:38.340> or<00:01:38.400> how<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
curious is this different or how is

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.960 
curious is this different or how is
treating<00:01:40.500> patients<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.400> kids<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
treating patients you know kids and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.380 
treating patients you know kids and
their<00:01:42.540> families<00:01:42.720> different<00:01:43.759> here<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:44.909> opposed

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
their families different here as opposed

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.840 
their families different here as opposed
to<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> other<00:01:46.259> part<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> emergency

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
to the other part of the emergency

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.920 
to the other part of the emergency
department<00:01:47.939> even<00:01:48.240> though<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
department even though I know this is a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.020 
department even though I know this is a
big<00:01:49.049> expansion<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.610> pavilions

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
big expansion going on and the pavilions

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.100 
big expansion going on and the pavilions
going<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.299> happening<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.659> go<00:01:51.780> ahead<00:01:51.899> talk

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
going to be happening to go ahead talk

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.230 
going to be happening to go ahead talk
to<00:01:52.290> us<00:01:52.380> about<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.829> pediatric<00:01:53.399> piece<00:01:53.549> well<00:01:54.210> I

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
to us about the pediatric piece well I

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.550 
to us about the pediatric piece well I
think<00:01:54.509> that's<00:01:54.720> different<00:01:54.990> here<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.170> pedes<00:01:55.409> is

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
think that's different here in pedes is

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.830 
think that's different here in pedes is
that<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.460> patients<00:01:56.880> are<00:01:57.479> our

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that you know the patients are our

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.999 
that you know the patients are our
children<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.320> they<00:01:58.380> can't<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.710> lot<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
children and they can't a lot of the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.859 
children and they can't a lot of the
times<00:01:59.219> speak<00:01:59.399> up<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.549> themselves<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
times speak up for themselves so as the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.389 
times speak up for themselves so as the
nurse<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> lot<00:02:01.799> more<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.100> an

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
nurse you have to be a lot more of an

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.639 
nurse you have to be a lot more of an
advocate<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.060> patient<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.570> opposed<00:02:04.409> to

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
advocate for the patient as opposed to

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.139 
advocate for the patient as opposed to
when<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.100> an<00:02:05.189> adult<00:02:05.369> population<00:02:06.000> you
