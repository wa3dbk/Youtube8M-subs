here<00:02:23.530> we<00:02:23.650> go<00:02:23.799> with<00:02:24.040> another<00:02:24.250> big-time

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
here we go with another big-time

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.940 
here we go with another big-time
developer<00:02:25.719> saying<00:02:25.959> Direct<00:02:26.230> X<00:02:26.349> 12<00:02:26.469> will<00:02:26.829> in

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
fact have some kind of impact the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.119 
fact have some kind of impact the
witcher<00:02:28.780> developers<00:02:29.290> said<00:02:29.439> it<00:02:29.560> will<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:29.980> can

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
witcher developers said it will you can

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.039 
witcher developers said it will you can
even<00:02:30.219> update<00:02:30.639> it<00:02:31.120> after<00:02:31.659> the<00:02:31.750> game<00:02:31.780> to

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
even update it after the game to

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.270 
even update it after the game to
released<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:32.530> it's<00:02:32.620> going<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.799> have<00:02:32.950> some

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
released and it's going to have some

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.949 
released and it's going to have some
sort<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.579> impact<00:02:33.849> so<00:02:34.060> I'll<00:02:34.120> imagine<00:02:34.629> games

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
sort of impact so I'll imagine games

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.270 
sort of impact so I'll imagine games
that<00:02:35.170> are<00:02:35.290> built<00:02:35.469> from<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.650> ground<00:02:35.769> up<00:02:36.129> I

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
that are built from the ground up I

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.860 
that are built from the ground up I
think<00:02:36.519> it's<00:02:36.670> getting<00:02:36.879> to<00:02:36.939> the<00:02:37.000> point<00:02:37.060> where<00:02:37.329> we

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
think it's getting to the point where we

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.929 
think it's getting to the point where we
can<00:02:38.079> say<00:02:38.319> we<00:02:38.950> know<00:02:39.069> it's<00:02:39.189> gonna<00:02:39.280> do<00:02:39.519> something

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939

can say we know it's gonna do something
you<00:02:40.120> know<00:02:40.269> there<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.930> doesn't<00:02:41.109> matter<00:02:41.470> if<00:02:41.769> it's

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
you know there it doesn't matter if it's

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.890 
you know there it doesn't matter if it's
big<00:02:42.189> or<00:02:42.370> small<00:02:42.489> or<00:02:43.000> medium<00:02:43.389> it's<00:02:43.569> you<00:02:43.750> know
