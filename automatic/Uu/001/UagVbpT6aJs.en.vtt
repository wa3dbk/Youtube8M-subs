00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.250 

but<00:02:22.790> had<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.060> had<00:02:23.210> it<00:02:23.240> had<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.630> in<00:02:23.870> more<00:02:24.050> light

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
but had it had it had it in more light

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.000 
but had it had it had it in more light
I'd<00:02:24.410> be<00:02:24.590> more<00:02:25.400> successful<00:02:25.640> for<00:02:26.120> focusing<00:02:26.570> that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
I'd be more successful for focusing that

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:37.750 
I'd be more successful for focusing that
this<00:02:28.010> shouldn't<00:02:28.310> take<00:02:28.370> too<00:02:28.490> long<00:02:28.640> now

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.910 

it's<00:02:38.330> funny<00:02:38.540> when<00:02:38.689> it's<00:02:38.840> trying<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.230> focus<00:02:39.409> the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
it's funny when it's trying to focus the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.429 
it's funny when it's trying to focus the
background<00:02:40.430> kind<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.239> shakes<00:02:41.510> because<00:02:42.140> this

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
background kind of shakes because this

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.149 
background kind of shakes because this
is<00:02:42.590> now<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.799> focus<00:02:43.040> point<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.549> camera<00:02:43.909> so

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
is now the focus point of the camera so
