00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.840
 welcome to crafts with children 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.840
 dot com 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.380
 episode 540 how to make a desk and 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.380
 small table with matches and cardboard 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:37.030
 for this project we are going to use 21 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.120
 matches in the head box of matches 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.610
 glue scissors optional bit 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.220
 fabric or decorative paper here we have a 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.100
 match and to remove the head what 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.739
 What I do is take a nail clipper or 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.160
 take a plier to cut as you see 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.780
 here and remove the head before 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.410
 start this is what you should do in 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.089
 house mom or dad so that the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.699
 children who are going to do this 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.970
 craftsmanship are not going to burn or do 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.520
 something that could hurt you here 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.890
 to put a little bit of glue this is 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.540
 the same box of matches and go 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.690
 to put a little bit of glue on each 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.860
 corner the tail that I'm using today 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.659
 it's called tag and club and that quick drying 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.280
 and you can also use glue in 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.590
 white although the drying is going to be a 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.170
 little bit slower you can also 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.740
 use the cold gun 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.780
 or the silicone gun to the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.700
 preference depends on you now 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.220
 let's leave here to dry a 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.060
 little bit and we're going to take a bit of 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.830
 pre-cut fabric I'm putting a 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.369
 little glue on the fabric this is 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.530
 optional clear but gives it one more touch 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.080
 realistic to our desk so we 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.950
 I'm going to put a little bit of glue already 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.369
 I have cut the fabric almost to the size of 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.710
 my little box of matches so that lateral 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.049
 it looks very good 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.590
 my desk again this is 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.230
 optional to give it one more touch 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.330
 the desk that we are going to make today is 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.519
 a very simple desk in the future 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.849
 I will teach you how to make desks for 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.480
 bigger dolls this is for a 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.700
 very small doll about 4 inches 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.670
 and now let's make the chair the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.519
 Chair is very simple for the first 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.150
 visit we did we used around 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:38.610
 of 40 for the little tables that we are going to make 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.280
 now we are going to use 12 in matches 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.030
 all the pieces are already trimmed and 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.640
 what we are going to do is put the pieces 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:53.550
 matches of the matches in this way 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:55.500
 until forming the back of the chair and 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.750
 the back has to look more or less 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.210
 This way they can pre-cut 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.660
 transit of cardboard from the same box 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.850
 matches that we used before and we're going to 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.780
 put a little bit of glue around 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.030
 for this they can use their gun 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.850
 silicone or can use again 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.160
 blank glue we let the base 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.010
 dry this is going to be the base of down 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.830
 of the chair and in each corner then 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.820
 we are going to paste little stones that are going to make 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.000
 the legs for the chair in the part of 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.000
 down 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.960
 like a match and I hit each corner and 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.810
 we're going to have to grab for a little while 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.000
 here until each of the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.120
 legs once the leg has been 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.390
 dried then let's put bits 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.180
 of matches on each side in this way 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.980
 so that the base is formed 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.250
 we stick the back 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.019
 to the base and here we have the chair as 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.030
 can see the little chair was very good 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.390
 to the wrist since the wrist is fine 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.549
 small and here is the chair and the table 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.409
 if they want to make a bigger one with 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.599
 matches only have to 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.760
 use larger matches 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.010
 I hope you liked these two 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.230
 annuities that we make today and we 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.230
 we see in the next video see you later
