00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
tray inside the pound and then you just

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.140 
tray inside the pound and then you just
cover<00:03:08.550> with<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.820> lid<00:03:08.850> very<00:03:09.330> fast<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:12.120> that

way it cooks up all inside and this way

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.440 
way it cooks up all inside and this way
it<00:03:15.180> does<00:03:15.930> it's<00:03:16.200> not<00:03:16.290> super<00:03:17.000> oily<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.240> then<00:03:18.360> you

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
it does it's not super oily and then you

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.900 
it does it's not super oily and then you
stop<00:03:18.840> deep-fried<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.580> Sh

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
stop deep-fried just to Sh

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.490 
stop deep-fried just to Sh
oil<00:03:21.090> just<00:03:21.510> need<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.660> little<00:03:21.960> bit<00:03:22.080> oil<00:03:22.290> just<00:03:22.440> so

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500

it<00:03:22.620> doesn't<00:03:22.650> stick<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.370> then<00:03:23.970> just<00:03:24.240> like<00:03:24.390> that

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
it doesn't stick and then just like that

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.950 
it doesn't stick and then just like that
so<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:24.930> leave<00:03:25.140> for<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.410> bit<00:03:25.940> not<00:03:26.940> too<00:03:27.180> long<00:03:27.450> and

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
so you leave for a bit not too long and

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.910 
so you leave for a bit not too long and
open<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.410> again

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:52.340 

when<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.000> close<00:03:37.240> it<00:03:37.270> again<00:03:37.770> wait

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350
