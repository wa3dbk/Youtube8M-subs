all what do you do you know it's really

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.600 
all what do you do you know it's really
painless<00:02:00.200> is<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.380> expensive<00:02:01.740> people<00:02:02.159> want<00:02:02.520> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
painless is it expensive people want to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.910

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
know that no it's probably depending on

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.130 
know that no it's probably depending on
the<00:02:05.009> size<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> tattoo<00:02:05.729> between<00:02:06.450> 300<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
they're all different it really varies

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.149 
they're all different it really varies
depending<00:02:16.540> upon<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:16.870> color<00:02:17.200> how<00:02:17.620> deep<00:02:17.859> it<00:02:18.010> is
