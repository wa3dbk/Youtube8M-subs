00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
fight we have our our launcher or a

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.480 
fight we have our our launcher or a
little<00:04:33.300> gamepad<00:04:33.750> i<00:04:33.780> should<00:04:34.050> say<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.470> then<00:04:35.040> it

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
little gamepad i should say and then it

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.640 
little gamepad i should say and then it
comes<00:04:35.790> with<00:04:36.000> two<00:04:36.180> traps<00:04:36.600> now<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:36.960> first<00:04:37.230> trap

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
comes with two traps now the first trap

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.730 
comes with two traps now the first trap
is<00:04:37.860> this<00:04:38.370> blue<00:04:38.640> trap<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.450> is<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:40.380> water

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
is this blue trap and it is the water

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.640 
is this blue trap and it is the water
trap<00:04:41.250> i<00:04:41.520> guess<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.450> basically<00:04:43.020> in<00:04:43.170> this<00:04:43.320> game

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
trap i guess so basically in this game

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.520 
trap i guess so basically in this game
you<00:04:44.250> come<00:04:44.460> across<00:04:44.700> different<00:04:45.390> bad<00:04:45.810> guys<00:04:46.170> and

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
you come across different bad guys and

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.530 
you come across different bad guys and
you<00:04:46.620> have<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.830> trap<00:04:47.100> them<00:04:47.280> now<00:04:47.760> each<00:04:47.970> bad<00:04:48.270> guy

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
you have to trap them now each bad guy

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.570 
you have to trap them now each bad guy
has<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.810> type<00:04:49.170> i<00:04:49.350> guess<00:04:49.530> like<00:04:49.560> water<00:04:49.980> type<00:04:50.280> fire

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
has a type i guess like water type fire

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.150 
has a type i guess like water type fire
type<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.150> then<00:04:51.690> these<00:04:51.840> little<00:04:52.170> traps<00:04:52.500> hold

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
type and then these little traps hold

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.280 
type and then these little traps hold
them<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:53.670> i<00:04:54.360> think<00:04:54.570> that's<00:04:54.720> really<00:04:54.930> sick<00:04:55.260> so

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
them and i think that's really sick so

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.200 
them and i think that's really sick so
each<00:04:55.560> rep<00:04:55.830> can<00:04:55.950> hold<00:04:56.100> one<00:04:56.370> bad<00:04:56.670> guy<00:04:56.940> so<00:04:56.970> you

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
each rep can hold one bad guy so you

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.300 
each rep can hold one bad guy so you
have<00:04:57.420> to<00:04:57.510> get<00:04:57.630> more<00:04:57.750> traps<00:04:58.140> if<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:59.040> want<00:04:59.220> to

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
have to get more traps if you want to

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.370 
have to get more traps if you want to
trap<00:04:59.490> all<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.760> bad<00:04:59.940> guys<00:05:00.120> so<00:05:00.780> we<00:05:00.990> have<00:05:01.080> a<00:05:01.110> water

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
trap all the bad guys so we have a water

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.740 
trap all the bad guys so we have a water
trap<00:05:01.710> so<00:05:02.040> that<00:05:02.250> we<00:05:02.370> can<00:05:02.640> help<00:05:02.760> us<00:05:02.940> capture<00:05:03.180> some

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
trap so that we can help us capture some

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.230 
trap so that we can help us capture some
evil<00:05:04.080> water<00:05:04.350> man<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:05.010> then<00:05:05.340> our<00:05:05.430> last<00:05:05.610> trap<00:05:05.970> is

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
evil water man and then our last trap is

hammer and this is gonna capture life
I've<00:05:25.770> guess<00:05:25.980> he<00:05:26.100> like<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.400> like<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.640> like<00:05:26.970> a<00:05:27.420> plant

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
I've guess he like a like a like a plant

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.230 
I've guess he like a like a like a plant
type<00:05:28.350> of<00:05:28.590> it's<00:05:29.160> like<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.340> food<00:05:29.640> fight<00:05:29.820> type<00:05:30.060> of

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
type of it's like a food fight type of

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.720 
type of it's like a food fight type of
bad<00:05:30.630> guy<00:05:30.930> so<00:05:31.380> if<00:05:31.560> food<00:05:31.860> fight<00:05:32.070> was<00:05:32.220> a<00:05:32.250> bad<00:05:32.490> guy

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
bad guy so if food fight was a bad guy

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.090 
bad guy so if food fight was a bad guy
this<00:05:33.330> trap<00:05:33.630> would<00:05:33.780> probably<00:05:34.110> trap<00:05:34.290> him<00:05:34.530> now

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100
