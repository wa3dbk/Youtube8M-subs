00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.250 

the<00:04:12.569> advantage<00:04:13.020> of<00:04:13.170> this<00:04:15.079> modification<00:04:16.079> is

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
the advantage of this modification is

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.420 
the advantage of this modification is
that<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:17.989> drones<00:04:18.989> shell<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.950> only<00:04:20.220> thing

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
that the drones shell is the only thing

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.120 
that the drones shell is the only thing
that<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.700> modified<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.950> really<00:04:22.950> it's

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
that is modified and really it's

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.570 
that is modified and really it's
modified<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> extent<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:24.660> something<00:04:25.350> is

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
modified to the extent that something is

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.510 
modified to the extent that something is
sticker<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.060> with<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.600> adhesive<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:29.130> that

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
sticker to it with the adhesive and that

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.370 
sticker to it with the adhesive and that
there's<00:04:29.730> a<00:04:29.820> couple<00:04:30.000> pinholes<00:04:30.480> put<00:04:30.780> in<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.050> and

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
there's a couple pinholes put in it and

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.379 
there's a couple pinholes put in it and
there's<00:04:31.919> no<00:04:32.100> modification<00:04:32.880> made<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.240> the

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
there's no modification made to the

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.280 
there's no modification made to the
drone<00:04:33.660> body<00:04:33.930> itself<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:36.720> draw<00:04:36.990> of<00:04:37.169> the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
drone body itself and the draw of the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.700 
drone body itself and the draw of the
current<00:04:37.650> from<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:38.360> LEDs<00:04:39.360> is<00:04:39.720> 50<00:04:40.410> milliamps

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
current from the LEDs is 50 milliamps

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.860 
current from the LEDs is 50 milliamps
per<00:04:41.010> strip<00:04:41.520> in<00:04:41.700> this<00:04:41.880> case<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:43.490> there<00:04:44.490> are<00:04:44.870> two

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
per strip in this case and there are two

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.159 
per strip in this case and there are two
three<00:04:46.190> seventy-nine<00:04:47.220> twelve<00:04:47.940> LEDs<00:04:48.600> per<00:04:48.870> strip

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
three seventy-nine twelve LEDs per strip

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.360 
three seventy-nine twelve LEDs per strip
and<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:51.419> total<00:04:51.810> draw<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.440> course<00:04:52.680> now<00:04:52.919> is<00:04:53.130> a

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
and the total draw of course now is a

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.430 
and the total draw of course now is a
tenth<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.700> an<00:04:53.820> amp<00:04:53.970> not<00:04:54.690> sure<00:04:54.900> how<00:04:55.110> much<00:04:55.380> that

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
tenth of an amp not sure how much that

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.400 
tenth of an amp not sure how much that
will<00:04:55.830> affect<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.910> flight<00:04:57.180> duration<00:04:57.540> but<00:04:58.110> this

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
will affect the flight duration but this

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.680 
will affect the flight duration but this
is<00:04:58.560> an<00:04:58.740> optional<00:04:59.220> thing<00:04:59.430> you<00:05:00.120> don't<00:05:00.300> have<00:05:00.510> to

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
is an optional thing you don't have to

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.750 
is an optional thing you don't have to
plug<00:05:00.870> it<00:05:01.050> in<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:02.040> way<00:05:02.190> that<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.460> strip's

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
plug it in and the way that the strip's

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.800 
plug it in and the way that the strip's
is<00:05:03.600> very<00:05:04.080> low<00:05:04.490> so<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.729> probably<00:05:06.570> won't<00:05:06.750> affect

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
is very low so it probably won't affect

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.600 
is very low so it probably won't affect
flight<00:05:07.380> life<00:05:07.620> at<00:05:07.800> all<00:05:07.860> I<00:05:07.889> mean<00:05:08.100> this<00:05:08.460> is

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
flight life at all I mean this is

00:05:08.610 --> 00:06:59.280 
flight life at all I mean this is
nothing

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.630 

out<00:07:00.290> here<00:07:00.440> at<00:07:00.590> night<00:07:00.650> you<00:07:00.980> can<00:07:01.130> actually<00:07:01.160> see

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:01.640 
out here at night you can actually see

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.540 
out here at night you can actually see
it<00:07:01.730> lit<00:07:02.030> the<00:07:02.960> ground<00:07:03.290> even<00:07:04.070> though<00:07:04.190> the<00:07:04.310> lights

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
it lit the ground even though the lights

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.600 
it lit the ground even though the lights
are<00:07:04.790> on<00:07:05.030> the<00:07:05.480> top<00:07:05.660> of<00:07:05.840> the<00:07:06.160> drone<00:07:07.160> and<00:07:07.460> not

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
are on the top of the drone and not

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.080 
are on the top of the drone and not
underneath<00:07:08.710> flying<00:07:09.710> at<00:07:09.890> night<00:07:09.920> is<00:07:10.100> a<00:07:10.490> problem

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090 
underneath flying at night is a problem

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.670 
underneath flying at night is a problem
because<00:07:11.240> the<00:07:11.450> bottom<00:07:11.990> camera<00:07:12.350> can't<00:07:12.590> see

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 
because the bottom camera can't see

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.780 
because the bottom camera can't see
anything<00:07:13.100> and<00:07:14.140> it<00:07:15.140> can't<00:07:15.890> maintain<00:07:16.310> its
