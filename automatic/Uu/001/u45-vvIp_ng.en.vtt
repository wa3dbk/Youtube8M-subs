a really yellow color and this is in the
shade<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.909> banana<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.750> think<00:01:21.960> banana<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
shade of banana and I think banana is a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
shade of banana and I think banana is a
perfect<00:01:23.070> shade<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> filipinos<00:01:24.299> out

perfect shade for all the filipinos out

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.840 
perfect shade for all the filipinos out
there<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.650> also<00:01:25.860> very<00:01:26.159> similar<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
there this is also very similar to the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.730 
there this is also very similar to the
banana<00:01:27.180> luxury<00:01:27.570> powder<00:01:27.900> from<00:01:28.259> van<00:01:28.530> night

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
banana luxury powder from van night

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.200 
banana luxury powder from van night
although<00:01:29.130> been<00:01:29.340> night<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> bit<00:01:29.970> expensive

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
although been night is a bit expensive

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.569 
although been night is a bit expensive
so<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> think<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.560> guys<00:01:31.710> should<00:01:31.770> try<00:01:32.070> out<00:01:32.369> a

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
nose area even my chin so I think I'm

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.360

just going to give it more time but I

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.190 
just going to give it more time but I
think<00:03:00.610> that<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:00.940> one<00:03:01.180> very<00:03:01.510> unique<00:03:01.900> thing

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
think that is one very unique thing

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.470 
think that is one very unique thing
about<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:03.100> pattern<00:03:03.489> I<00:03:03.820> really<00:03:04.299> I<00:03:04.330> really

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
about this pattern I really I really

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.479 
about this pattern I really I really
honestly<00:03:05.019> haven't<00:03:05.709> tried<00:03:05.980> out<00:03:06.130> any<00:03:06.310> other

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
honestly haven't tried out any other

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.850 
honestly haven't tried out any other
powders<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.060> have<00:03:07.390> this<00:03:07.600> very<00:03:07.860> cooling

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
powders that have this very cooling

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.550 
powders that have this very cooling
effect<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.330> think<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.810> perfect<00:03:11.049> for

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
effect so I think this is perfect for

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.720 
effect so I think this is perfect for
all<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.799> filipinas<00:03:12.250> out<00:03:12.400> there<00:03:12.610> especially
