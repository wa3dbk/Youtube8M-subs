00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:08.490
 we can but there is a world 25 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:15.440
 probably the door to the side and press the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.440
 Threshold for exhibitors is activated 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.779
 21 almost on the plates 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.780
 switched on and now the camera a 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.780
 guardian who takes care of me 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:07.470
 I am ready that is really very 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.360
 very high where I stand 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.320
 small forests below me from now on come 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.320
 i back to you you little world 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.940
 Wow 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.470
 he races at the speed of one 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.570
 Jet jets still accelerate 40 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.280
 in about a second, then he is on more 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.500
 than 1000 kilometers per hour 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.790
 1100 does not seem to do 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.470
 not to come in the spin 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.540
 it's just flying around this world 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.310
 position down my goodness we see 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.259
 also the estimated speed that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.250
 is crazy now or at 1100 km h 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.840
 Now the city ​​probably had 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.240
 worked there and see from afar with 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.440
 this little child will rush down the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.580
 speed record also had now 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.289
 are unfortunately only the control center 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.229
 He turned a little bit like that 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.600
 there is a movement in the moment 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.700
 come see that you will stumble but 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.509
 it is not therefore ensures that was a 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.770
 longer parking 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.979
 we do not know what height is and 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.370
 when will he be himself then 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.959
 stabilized again 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.630
 now he has stabilized it would have to 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.630
 indeed worked 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.200
 he has now missed a record 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.220
 possibly as paradoxical as it may sound 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:11.220
 because he was faster actually 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.200
 initially at 1500 meters together so around 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.200
 to have a very long free fall
