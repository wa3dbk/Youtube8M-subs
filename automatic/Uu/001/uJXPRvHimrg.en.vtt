00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.000
 hi friends from youtube I bring you a 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:11.440
 small versus 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.129
 with the two mid-range terminals very 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:21.160
 Popular in the current market in Mexico 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.160
 they are the samsung galaxy mails 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.000
 and the lg optimus sun 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:36.760
 number we have the samsung galaxy 6 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.440
 which has a screen 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:46.600
 3.5 inches 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:52.289
 a resolution of 320 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.289
 by 480 pixels 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.020
 and a 5 megapixel camera with flash 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:08.799
 a 800 megahertz qualcomm processor 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.799
 pretty decent 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.610
 those are the characteristics a little 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.470
 rough generals of samsung 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.260
 galaxy page 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.260
 well we see it lg optimus sun 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.970
 with a 5 megapixel camera without 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.840
 flash led 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.530
 and a 38-inch screen 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.070
 I can make a resolution 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.070
 d 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.720
 480 400 pixels 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.520
 a lot more 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.570
 than the one of the samsung 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.930
 a qualcomm snapdragon processor to a 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.190
 giga hertz 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.190
 I only core 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.320
 quite also faster than samsung 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.320
 we see how they look 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.160
 screens working 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.260
 we have 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.880
 and we can see 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.990
 that the samsung has a density of 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.730
 pixels on the 164 page screen 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:40.110
 while while I had fun 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.410
 Much has 244 pp and you have much more 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.230
 pixel needs in the jeep what 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.830
 we can see so much is one more screen 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.830
 clear 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.800
 without counting that the samsung screen 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.230
 it's that type tdt 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.380
 capacitive 16 million colors 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.430
 while he swims and is a tip 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:09.159
 amoled capacitive 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.159
 of 16 million colors well 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.069
 we'll see 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.069
 that the samsung factory account with 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:25.720
 I 'm not mistaken, it must be a horse 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.720
 with android 2.2 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:35.250
 and it comes with android 2.3 gingerbread 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.140
 factory 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.220
 and the fluidity of the screen 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.910
 it's pretty good in both 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.910
 positives 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.670
 I feel a little more fluid of good 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:08.709
 in general costs the samsung is 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:13.000
 around 3 thousand 700 pesos 3000 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:18.090
 800 and the elvis is a bit more expensive in 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.250
 4 thousand 900 pesos around that price 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.120
 but we will see that it has a 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.680
 benefits 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.289
 top 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.380
 both in image quality on screen 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.910
 as a size 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.910
 and in processing 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.350
 a disadvantage that I see him and he is the 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.910
 fact that the camera does not have flash 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:49.120
 and in that aspect of sanz they are a little 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:52.060
 better has a led flash 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.820
 and then you hear a little better too 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.110
 the Horn 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.350
 of samsung with respect to the law and 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:05.200
 then out of those characteristics 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.280
 now of those details is much better 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.340
 team for how I see it 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.880
 the god 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.790
 so yes 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:19.050
 both compare a team 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.050
 I would recommend 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.470
 the best performance better 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:30.010
 functioning 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.889
 Well, in this case, it 's a lot 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.580
 best team 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:39.259
 Well I hope you liked it is 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.259
 nothing else something like this very general 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.630
 some characteristics of both equipment 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:49.520
 later upload a little more complete 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.700
 our equipment in a little more than 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.700
 weather 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.110
 that 's all 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.110
 see you
