00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
of the construction paper it's only

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.959 
of the construction paper it's only
because<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.320> ran<00:00:49.469> out<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.100> color<00:00:50.309> the

because I ran out of the one color the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
let the variety of the construction

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.700 
let the variety of the construction
paper<00:00:55.800> used<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:57.230> even<00:00:58.230> though<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.379> can't

construction paper shining through some

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.149 
construction paper shining through some
bits<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.869> see<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> black<00:01:07.409> shining

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.210 
bits of you can see the black shining
through<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> blue<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.039 
through and this is the blue one and you
can<00:01:11.400> also<00:01:11.549> see<00:01:11.880> some<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> blue<00:01:12.600> shining

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.000 
can also see some of the blue shining
through<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.470> gives<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.740> really<00:01:13.979> cool

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
through and it gives a really cool

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.530 
through and it gives a really cool
effect<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.700> wall<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.090> doesn't<00:01:15.450> really

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
effect on the wall so it doesn't really

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
effect on the wall so it doesn't really
matter<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:15.990> kind<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.380> color<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.310> use<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
then all I need to do is to make these

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.640 
then all I need to do is to make these
very<00:01:21.030> easy<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.689> I'll<00:01:21.750> show<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.439> bit

it's called blue tag on the back of it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.840 
it's called blue tag on the back of it
or<00:01:28.140> make<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> double-sided<00:01:28.860> tape<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.369> then

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
or make the double-sided tape and then

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.840 
or make the double-sided tape and then
just<00:01:30.060> put<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.689> wall<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.079> this

then<00:02:25.180> cut<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.570> out<00:02:26.340> now<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.400> need<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.880> print

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
then cut it out now you need to print

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.000 
then cut it out now you need to print
out<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.660> then<00:02:28.840> cut<00:02:29.110> out<00:02:29.260> two<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.740> same

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
out and then cut out two of the same

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.770 
out and then cut out two of the same
stencils<00:02:30.670> because<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.210> need<00:02:31.390> one<00:02:31.570> of<00:02:31.660> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
stencils because you need one of the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.010 
stencils because you need one of the
triangles<00:02:32.320> for<00:02:32.560> later<00:02:33.480> now<00:02:34.480> cut<00:02:34.750> out<00:02:34.780> the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
triangles for later now cut out the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.190 
triangles for later now cut out the
stencils<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.590> need<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.950> work<00:02:36.130> with<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:37.200> then

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
stencils you need to work with and then

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.020 
stencils you need to work with and then
take<00:02:38.440> one<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.710> the<00:02:38.830> stencils<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.580> then<00:02:39.820> cut

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
take one of the stencils and then cut

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.110 
take one of the stencils and then cut
off<00:02:40.120> one<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.630> triangles<00:02:44.670> then<00:02:45.670> take<00:02:45.970> the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
off one of the triangles then take the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.820 
off one of the triangles then take the
other<00:02:46.150> whole<00:02:46.570> stencil<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.260> then<00:02:47.410> put<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.709> on

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
other whole stencil and then put it on

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.680 
other whole stencil and then put it on
top<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.040> your<00:02:48.220> construction<00:02:48.670> paper<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.300> then

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
top of your construction paper and then

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.900 
top of your construction paper and then
draw<00:02:49.959> around<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:51.360> then<00:02:52.360> cut<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.780> out<00:02:53.910> now

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
draw around it and then cut it out now

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.430 
draw around it and then cut it out now
as<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:55.209> can<00:02:55.330> see<00:02:55.390> they're<00:02:55.810> almost<00:02:56.080> identical

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
as you can see they're almost identical

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.860 
as you can see they're almost identical
we<00:02:57.160> only<00:02:57.400> need<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.850> copy<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.300> lines<00:02:58.510> from<00:02:58.780> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
we only need to copy the lines from the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.220 
we only need to copy the lines from the
stencil<00:02:59.380> onto<00:02:59.590> the<00:03:00.250> construction<00:03:00.820> paper<00:03:01.230> so

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
stencil onto the construction paper so

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.930 
stencil onto the construction paper so
take<00:03:02.530> your<00:03:02.680> ruler<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.100> your<00:03:03.370> PIN<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:03.730> then

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
take your ruler and your PIN and then

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.880 
take your ruler and your PIN and then
draw<00:03:04.209> lines<00:03:04.510> according<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.230> stencil<00:03:05.740> and

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
draw lines according to the stencil and

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.370 
draw lines according to the stencil and
then<00:03:06.030> just<00:03:07.030> continue<00:03:07.240> on<00:03:07.480> copying<00:03:08.020> all<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
then just continue on copying all the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.900 
then just continue on copying all the
lines<00:03:08.560> from<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.980> stencil<00:03:09.370> onto<00:03:09.580> the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
lines from the stencil onto the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.490 
lines from the stencil onto the
construction<00:03:10.420> paper<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.840> then<00:03:11.290> worry<00:03:11.470> about

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
construction paper and then worry about

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.680 
construction paper and then worry about
any<00:03:12.010> visible<00:03:12.459> lines<00:03:12.670> because<00:03:13.390> they'll<00:03:13.630> be

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
any visible lines because they'll be

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.680 
any visible lines because they'll be
hidden<00:03:13.870> within<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.410> figure<00:03:14.709> itself<00:03:15.480> now<00:03:16.480> they

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
hidden within the figure itself now they

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.460 
hidden within the figure itself now they
should<00:03:16.900> look<00:03:17.019> identical<00:03:22.019> now<00:03:23.019> we<00:03:23.080> need<00:03:23.350> to

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
should look identical now we need to

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.229 
should look identical now we need to
make<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.769> figure<00:03:24.070> more<00:03:24.250> flexible<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.000> take

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
make the figure more flexible so take

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.850 
make the figure more flexible so take
your<00:03:25.390> ruler<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:25.810> place<00:03:26.019> on<00:03:26.260> top<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.680> lines

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
your ruler and place on top of the lines

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.390 
your ruler and place on top of the lines
and<00:03:27.130> then<00:03:27.459> fold<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.820> paper<00:03:28.030> over<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:29.400> and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
and then fold the paper over it and

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.190 
and then fold the paper over it and
remember<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.910> give<00:03:31.120> all<00:03:31.330> your<00:03:31.480> scoring's<00:03:31.930> and

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
remember to give all your scoring's and

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.990 
remember to give all your scoring's and
foldings<00:03:32.560> or<00:03:32.680> good<00:03:32.830> squeeze<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.670> make<00:03:33.820> them

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
foldings or good squeeze to make them

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.280 
foldings or good squeeze to make them
more<00:03:34.120> visible<00:03:36.420> now<00:03:37.420> let's<00:03:37.690> move<00:03:37.930> on<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.170> the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
more visible now let's move on to the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.259 
more visible now let's move on to the
shiny<00:03:38.530> part<00:03:38.860> so<00:03:39.220> take<00:03:39.549> your<00:03:39.670> fall<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.120> then

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
shiny part so take your fall and then

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.180 
shiny part so take your fall and then
cut<00:03:40.480> out<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.630> piece<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.380> make<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.680> more<00:03:41.830> easier

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
cut out a piece to make it more easier

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.860 
cut out a piece to make it more easier
to<00:03:42.220> work<00:03:42.519> with<00:03:44.940> now<00:03:45.940> remember<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.420> triangle

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
to work with now remember the triangle

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.990 
to work with now remember the triangle
you<00:03:46.989> cut<00:03:47.170> out<00:03:47.260> earlier<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:47.890> need<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.580> use<00:03:48.850> it

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
you cut out earlier you need to use it

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.460 
you cut out earlier you need to use it
to<00:03:49.030> make<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.390> shiny<00:03:49.630> parts<00:03:50.019> of<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.320> wall

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
to make the shiny parts of the wall

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.830 
to make the shiny parts of the wall
decoration<00:03:51.090> we<00:03:52.090> need<00:03:52.269> to<00:03:52.390> use<00:03:52.540> it<00:03:52.690> as<00:03:52.810> a

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
decoration we need to use it as a

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.930 
decoration we need to use it as a
stencil<00:03:53.140> for<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.709> non<00:03:53.860> shiny<00:03:54.220> part<00:03:54.549> of<00:03:54.610> the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
stencil for the non shiny part of the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.630 
stencil for the non shiny part of the
foil<00:03:55.209> so<00:03:56.110> draw<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.500> triangle<00:03:57.070> and<00:03:57.190> then<00:03:57.370> cut

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
foil so draw the triangle and then cut

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.479 
foil so draw the triangle and then cut
it<00:03:57.670> out<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.530> then<00:03:59.530> stick<00:03:59.830> it<00:03:59.860> on<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.280> one<00:04:00.459> of

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
it out and then stick it on to one of

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.140 
it out and then stick it on to one of
the<00:04:00.730> figures<00:04:01.090> triangles

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.089 

there<00:04:08.150> might<00:04:08.480> be<00:04:08.510> some<00:04:08.900> excessive<00:04:09.470> fall<00:04:09.709> but

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
there might be some excessive fall but

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.490 
there might be some excessive fall but
just<00:04:10.370> cut<00:04:10.579> it<00:04:10.700> out<00:04:10.819> better<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.930> have<00:04:12.110> more<00:04:12.439> than

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
just cut it out better to have more than

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.850 
just cut it out better to have more than
not<00:04:13.040> enough<00:04:13.069> and<00:04:14.260> then<00:04:15.260> continue<00:04:15.680> on<00:04:15.709> to

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
not enough and then continue on to

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.069 
not enough and then continue on to
making<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.370> triangles<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.389> stick<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:17.780> on<00:04:17.900> to

making the triangles to stick it on to

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.210 
making the triangles to stick it on to
the<00:04:18.199> figure<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:20.500> always<00:04:21.500> check<00:04:21.769> if<00:04:21.949> there's

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
the figure and always check if there's

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.749 
the figure and always check if there's
excessive<00:04:22.789> fall<00:04:23.000> you<00:04:23.150> need<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.449> cut<00:04:23.660> out<00:04:24.759> and

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 
excessive fall you need to cut out and

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.790 
excessive fall you need to cut out and
be<00:04:26.180> careful<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.600> not<00:04:26.870> cut<00:04:27.110> in<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.470> figure

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
be careful to not cut in the figure

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.700 
be careful to not cut in the figure
itself<00:04:28.690> but<00:04:29.690> continue<00:04:30.110> on<00:04:30.259> to<00:04:30.410> making<00:04:30.590> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.800 
itself but continue on to making the
triangles<00:04:31.310> until<00:04:31.880> you<00:04:32.000> have<00:04:32.120> no<00:04:32.300> more<00:04:32.330> left<00:04:32.660> to

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
triangles until you have no more left to

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.770 
triangles until you have no more left to
make

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
make

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.969 
make
we<00:04:35.780> need<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.080> glue<00:04:36.259> the<00:04:36.380> whole<00:04:36.590> thing<00:04:36.800> together

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
we need to glue the whole thing together

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.830 
we need to glue the whole thing together
so<00:04:37.280> put<00:04:37.639> some<00:04:37.789> glue<00:04:37.970> on<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.270> flap<00:04:38.510> underneath

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
so put some glue on the flap underneath

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.610 
so put some glue on the flap underneath
one<00:04:39.320> of<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.560> triangles<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:41.080> then<00:04:42.080> connect<00:04:42.470> it

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
one of the triangles and then connect it

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.219 
one of the triangles and then connect it
to<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.889> end<00:04:43.070> triangle<00:04:46.900> squeeze<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.080> whole

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
to the end triangle squeeze the whole

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.689 
to the end triangle squeeze the whole
thing<00:04:48.500> together<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:49.130> make<00:04:49.280> a<00:04:49.310> stick<00:04:49.580> properly

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
thing together to make a stick properly

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.070 
thing together to make a stick properly
we<00:04:52.699> also<00:04:52.850> need<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.240> glue<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:53.539> bottom<00:04:53.840> to<00:04:53.960> the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
we also need to glue the bottom to the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.340 
we also need to glue the bottom to the
top

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
top

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.620 
top
so<00:04:54.860> put<00:04:55.070> some<00:04:55.220> glue<00:04:55.370> on<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.580> remaining<00:04:56.060> flaps

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:07.590 

and<00:05:01.060> then<00:05:02.060> gently<00:05:02.360> push<00:05:02.750> them<00:05:02.960> together

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.630 

and<00:05:07.690> then<00:05:08.320> give<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:08.710> sides<00:05:08.980> a<00:05:09.160> good<00:05:09.340> squeeze

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
and then give the sides a good squeeze

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.780 
and then give the sides a good squeeze
and<00:05:09.880> then<00:05:10.240> let<00:05:10.450> it<00:05:10.480> dry<00:05:12.810> if<00:05:14.370> you<00:05:15.370> want<00:05:15.550> to<00:05:15.640> make

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
and then let it dry if you want to make

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.430 
and then let it dry if you want to make
the<00:05:15.910> smaller<00:05:16.180> ones<00:05:16.450> need<00:05:16.990> to<00:05:17.110> follow<00:05:17.290> the

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
the smaller ones need to follow the

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.240 
the smaller ones need to follow the
exact<00:05:17.770> same<00:05:17.800> procedure<00:05:19.200> it<00:05:20.200> takes<00:05:20.560> no<00:05:20.800> time<00:05:20.830> to

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
exact same procedure it takes no time to

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.100
