00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.860
 only a good antioxidant 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.080
 the contents of beta - carotene are very 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.810

 for Claudia that if our 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.410
 farmers are not put here I am 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.280
 biologist i am a businessman i am a scientist 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.530
 I am an alchemist, you are workers, never 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.500
 I stopped being people because you like the 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.930
 environment this and I am not so many things 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.840
 none but above all farmer who 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.520
 that means a lot and a lifetime 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.160
 behind them since my 13 years 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.470
 retired from school until 46 and 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.540
 those are 30 years dedicated 30 and so much 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.180
 dedicates exclusively to living with the 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.250
 plants and it gives me a lot of energy and it leaves me 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.900
 and it makes me want to live and I live like and 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.560
 what I do if I do what I like two 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.810
 good times will see your tomatito 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.020
 family is worth those we bought 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.370
 with me the good day we see that your 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.300
 installation are prepared for 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.530
 any technical inspection that you 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.230
 they demand 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.389
 they demand it to you and to fix to fix you girls 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.460
 but apart from demands 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.900
 I do not want or is the requirement me 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.669
 I put no one to put my 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.430
 requirement because I have more values ​​than 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.020
 many of the texts that make the laws 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.030
 and the norms the values ​​have to have 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.050
 the titles you can take them to 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.580
 cape 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.900
 how many people were here working 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.909
 how much to advance between six and seven 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.110
 people depend on the moment of 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:04.500
 production that has what you have to 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.389
 do 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.460
 around three people per hectare of 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:12.509
 crop because this is made plant to 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.639
 plant and remove twine is not correct and there 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.580
 to go helping him and as he goes up 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.409
 it is here it is all work we are seeing 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.169
 removing the secondary stems for 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.970
 that the force or the fruit is what 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.110
 predominant of the plant take away the 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.760
 stems that do not have a vegetation 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.370
 exuberant 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.900
 and helping him to defoliate a little so that 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.700
 the zoo between well so that the 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.140
 flavors of the fruit at the end have 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.750
 more sugars and it's called exquisite 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:42.090
 face the consumer always looking for 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:44.250
 the consumer for good work and still 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.310
 tomatito you already have tomato when you've 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.360
 raised this and August 24 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.360
