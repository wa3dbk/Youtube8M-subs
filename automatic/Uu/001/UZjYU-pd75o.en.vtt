this<00:00:21.869> particular<00:00:22.350> field<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> soybean<00:00:23.670> field

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
this particular field is a soybean field

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.670 
this particular field is a soybean field
that's<00:00:25.050> just<00:00:25.470> been<00:00:25.910> harvested<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.680> here's

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that's just been harvested and here's

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.679 
that's just been harvested and here's
the<00:00:28.920> tiling<00:00:29.310> machine<00:00:29.640> coming<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:30.359> through

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the tiling machine coming up through

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.130 
the tiling machine coming up through
here

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
here

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.670 
here
and<00:00:33.530> there<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.040> connect<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.260> roll<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and there have to connect the roll to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.380 
and there have to connect the roll to
the<00:00:38.040> tile<00:00:38.340> that's<00:00:38.579> laying<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> ground

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the tile that's laying on the ground

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.490 
the tile that's laying on the ground
there<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.489> they<00:00:41.489> use<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> coupler<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.570> just

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
there and they use a coupler and just

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.229 
there and they use a coupler and just
some<00:00:43.940> black<00:00:44.940> tape<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:46.820> fasten<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.879> together

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
some black tape to fasten it together

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.430 
some black tape to fasten it together
and<00:00:51.559> this<00:00:52.760> collie<00:00:53.760> machine<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.629> controlled<00:00:55.199> by

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and this collie machine is controlled by

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.369 
and this collie machine is controlled by
laser<00:00:56.539> they<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> laser<00:00:59.780> set<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
laser they have a laser set up in the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.560 
laser they have a laser set up in the
middle<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> field<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.399> that's<00:01:03.059> how<00:01:03.359> they

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
middle of a field and that's how they

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.010 
middle of a field and that's how they
get<00:01:03.780> their<00:01:03.960> grade<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:05.390> they're<00:01:06.390> starting<00:01:06.869> up

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
get their grade and they're starting up

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.060 
get their grade and they're starting up
the<00:01:07.290> drainage<00:01:08.010> ditch<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.439> moving<00:01:11.869> up<00:01:13.070> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the drainage ditch and moving up the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.820 
the drainage ditch and moving up the
field<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.030> then<00:01:15.360> we'll<00:01:15.479> connect

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
field here and then we'll connect

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.770 
field here and then we'll connect
laterals<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.340> big<00:01:17.790> tile<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
laterals to this big tile here this is a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.270 
laterals to this big tile here this is a
12<00:01:19.110> inch<00:01:19.259> tile<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:21.650> here<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.920> see<00:01:23.159> him

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
12 inch tile and here you see him

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.240 
12 inch tile and here you see him
digging<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.470> there's<00:01:25.470> another<00:01:25.680> guy<00:01:25.920> down<00:01:26.189> in

later<00:01:34.619> they'll<00:01:34.920> use<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.640> auger<00:01:36.509> machine<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
later they'll use this auger machine the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.530 
later they'll use this auger machine the
one<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:38.790> hits<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.680> towel<00:01:40.680> rack<00:01:41.540> I'll

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
one that's hits to the towel rack I'll

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.109 
one that's hits to the towel rack I'll
drive<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.049> along<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.530> side<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.939> fill<00:01:44.939> them

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
automatically and years ago they used to

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.340 
automatically and years ago they used to
use<00:02:30.430> clay<00:02:30.970> tile<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.750> there<00:02:32.680> are<00:02:32.740> only<00:02:32.860> about

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
use clay tile and there are only about

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.260 
use clay tile and there are only about
14<00:02:35.350> inches<00:02:35.380> long<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.220> they'd<00:02:36.340> have<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.700> put

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
14 inches long and they'd have to put

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.540 
14 inches long and they'd have to put
them<00:02:37.510> down<00:02:37.750> one<00:02:38.140> at<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.380> time<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:42.160> problem

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
them down one at a time and the problem

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.130 
them down one at a time and the problem
with<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.760> clay<00:02:42.940> tile<00:02:43.240> is<00:02:43.480> they<00:02:43.720> would<00:02:43.870> break

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
with the clay tile is they would break

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.690 
with the clay tile is they would break
and<00:02:45.840> then<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:47.110> have<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.350> washout<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.370> have<00:02:48.520> to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
and then you have a washout you have to

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.920 
and then you have a washout you have to
come<00:02:49.090> in<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.450> repair<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.130> how<00:02:51.310> here

of tile and here's a little

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.710 
of tile and here's a little
demonstration<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.640> how<00:03:12.820> they<00:03:13.030> get<00:03:13.239> these<00:03:13.390> big

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
demonstration of how they get these big

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.400 
demonstration of how they get these big
rolls<00:03:13.930> onto<00:03:14.830> this<00:03:15.400> dolly<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.120> then<00:03:17.020> just<00:03:17.170> back

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
rolls onto this dolly and then just back

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.280 
rolls onto this dolly and then just back
into<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.250> they<00:03:19.060> have<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.239> little<00:03:19.600> hydraulic

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
into it and they have a little hydraulic

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.680 
into it and they have a little hydraulic
motor<00:03:20.530> on<00:03:20.739> there<00:03:20.950> or<00:03:21.370> motor<00:03:21.730> runs<00:03:22.060> a<00:03:22.180> hydraulic

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
motor on there or motor runs a hydraulic

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.180 
motor on there or motor runs a hydraulic
cylinder<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.850> they<00:03:24.850> can<00:03:25.060> just<00:03:25.239> simply<00:03:26.190> tilt

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
cylinder and they can just simply tilt

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.500 
cylinder and they can just simply tilt
this<00:03:27.459> back<00:03:28.350> upright<00:03:29.350> and

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
this back upright and

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.030 
this back upright and
that's<00:03:31.470> how<00:03:31.650> they<00:03:31.860> get<00:03:32.010> those<00:03:32.280> loaded<00:03:32.849> and

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
that's how they get those loaded and

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.600 
that's how they get those loaded and
