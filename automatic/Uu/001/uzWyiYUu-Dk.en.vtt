employee to me the woman at the time was
not<00:00:58.920> willing<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.609> fast<00:00:59.879> she<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.690> afraid<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.050> it

illustrate for you we've all heard about
the<00:05:30.610> straw<00:05:30.970> that<00:05:31.210> breaks<00:05:31.420> the<00:05:31.600> camel's<00:05:31.690> back

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
the straw that breaks the camel's back

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.340 
the straw that breaks the camel's back
so<00:05:32.560> if<00:05:33.280> we<00:05:33.520> imagine<00:05:33.760> there's<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.450> camel<00:05:34.840> that

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
so if we imagine there's the camel that

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.740 
so if we imagine there's the camel that
one<00:05:35.680> last<00:05:36.010> straw<00:05:36.430> maybe<00:05:36.670> the<00:05:36.880> 10,000th<00:05:37.660> who

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
one last straw maybe the 10,000th who

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.020 
one last straw maybe the 10,000th who
knows<00:05:37.930> straw<00:05:38.320> goes<00:05:38.560> on<00:05:38.740> their<00:05:38.950> camel's<00:05:39.850> back

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
knows straw goes on their camel's back

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.480 
knows straw goes on their camel's back
caves<00:05:40.360> in<00:05:40.600> if<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:41.560> camel's<00:05:41.980> back<00:05:42.160> had<00:05:42.460> a

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
caves in if the camel's back had a

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.900 
caves in if the camel's back had a
spring<00:05:42.910> in<00:05:43.270> it<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.570> could<00:05:44.110> pop<00:05:44.410> back<00:05:44.710> up<00:05:44.740> if<00:05:45.220> we

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
spring in it and could pop back up if we

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.930 
spring in it and could pop back up if we
took<00:05:46.120> one<00:05:46.540> straw<00:05:46.960> off<00:05:47.230> at<00:05:47.740> that<00:05:48.370> point<00:05:48.430> what

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
took one straw off at that point what

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.520 
took one straw off at that point what
would<00:05:49.030> happen<00:05:49.360> what<00:05:49.870> would<00:05:49.900> go<00:05:50.110> right<00:05:50.260> back<00:05:50.500> to

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
would happen what would go right back to

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.600 
would happen what would go right back to
where<00:05:50.770> it<00:05:50.830> was<00:05:50.980> before

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
where it was before

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.090 
where it was before
I<00:05:51.810> explained<00:05:52.810> to<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.080> woman<00:05:53.410> that<00:05:53.920> this

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
I explained to the woman that this

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.060 
I explained to the woman that this
client<00:05:54.340> with<00:05:54.580> MS<00:05:54.910> that<00:05:55.180> her<00:05:56.110> symptoms<00:05:56.650> her

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
client with MS that her symptoms her

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.660 
client with MS that her symptoms her
problem<00:05:57.610> was<00:05:57.820> perhaps<00:05:58.240> only<00:05:59.200> one<00:05:59.620> straw<00:06:00.190> away

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
problem was perhaps only one straw away

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.810 
problem was perhaps only one straw away
from<00:06:01.450> returning<00:06:02.220> although<00:06:03.220> she<00:06:03.280> was<00:06:03.520> thinking

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
from returning although she was thinking

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.780 
from returning although she was thinking
as<00:06:03.910> clearly<00:06:03.970> as<00:06:04.420> ever<00:06:04.630> that<00:06:05.320> maybe<00:06:05.680> she<00:06:06.370> wanted

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
as clearly as ever that maybe she wanted

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.150 
as clearly as ever that maybe she wanted
to<00:06:06.910> keep<00:06:07.180> going<00:06:07.320> so<00:06:08.320> that<00:06:08.350> she<00:06:08.620> could<00:06:08.800> take<00:06:08.950> as

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
to keep going so that she could take as

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.130 
to keep going so that she could take as
many<00:06:09.340> straws<00:06:09.820> off<00:06:10.180> the<00:06:10.390> camel's<00:06:10.750> back<00:06:10.810> as

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
many straws off the camel's back as

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.010 
many straws off the camel's back as
possible<00:06:11.880> again<00:06:12.880> she<00:06:13.060> wouldn't<00:06:13.330> be<00:06:13.420> persuaded

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
possible again she wouldn't be persuaded

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.770 
possible again she wouldn't be persuaded
she<00:06:14.740> broke<00:06:14.920> her<00:06:14.980> fast<00:06:15.370> she<00:06:15.850> went<00:06:16.030> home<00:06:16.180> she<00:06:16.480> was

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
she broke her fast she went home she was

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.650 
she broke her fast she went home she was
doing<00:06:17.020> great<00:06:17.290> she<00:06:17.320> was<00:06:17.560> thinking<00:06:17.830> clearly

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
doing great she was thinking clearly

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.750 
doing great she was thinking clearly
what<00:06:19.660> happened<00:06:20.080> though<00:06:20.260> was<00:06:20.500> that<00:06:21.040> over<00:06:21.610> the

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
what happened though was that over the

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.180 
what happened though was that over the

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
following two or three months and maybe

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.370 
following two or three months and maybe
her<00:06:24.430> choices<00:06:24.700> weren't<00:06:25.060> optimal<00:06:25.660> whatever<00:06:26.260> it

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
her choices weren't optimal whatever it

her choices weren't optimal whatever it
was<00:06:26.500> about<00:06:26.740> three<00:06:26.950> months<00:06:27.070> later<00:06:27.250> she<00:06:27.670> sent<00:06:28.090> me

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210

it's come back to a certain extent that

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.460 
it's come back to a certain extent that
I<00:06:39.729> realized<00:06:40.120> I<00:06:40.330> should<00:06:40.539> have<00:06:40.660> fasted<00:06:41.110> longer

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470

after her first fast and she completed
the<00:06:47.620> second<00:06:48.039> fast<00:06:48.250> as<00:06:48.520> intended<00:06:48.909> and<00:06:49.440> to<00:06:50.440> this

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620
