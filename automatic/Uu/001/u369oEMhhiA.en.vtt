see<00:01:41.909> why<00:01:42.090> I'm<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.329> excited<00:01:42.659> about<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.170> so

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
see why I'm so excited about it and so

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.679 
see why I'm so excited about it and so
interested<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.159> trying<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.939> testing

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
interested in trying this and testing

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.870 
interested in trying this and testing
the<00:01:45.750> boundaries<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.140> what<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.979> happen<00:01:47.610> with

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the boundaries of what can happen with

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.969 
the boundaries of what can happen with
his<00:01:48.030> teeth<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.710> really

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
his teeth so this is going to be really

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.639 
his teeth so this is going to be really
weird<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.399> me<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.579> say<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:50.939> camera<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.780> let's

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
weird for me to say on camera but let's

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:20.949 
weird for me to say on camera but let's
go<00:01:52.770> ahead<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.040> drew<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> cup<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.549> tea<00:01:53.759> showing

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.479 

so<00:02:21.959> it's<00:02:22.110> been<00:02:22.230> about<00:02:22.410> 5<00:02:22.800> minutes<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
so it's been about 5 minutes and the

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.800 
so it's been about 5 minutes and the
tea's<00:02:23.700> pretty<00:02:24.000> much<00:02:24.150> done<00:02:24.360> brewing<00:02:24.540> it's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
tea's pretty much done brewing it's

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.900 
tea's pretty much done brewing it's
actually<00:02:25.110> extracted<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.250> good<00:02:26.610> amount<00:02:26.849> of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
actually extracted a good amount of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.119 
actually extracted a good amount of
color<00:02:27.180> out<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.810> leaves<00:02:28.260> or<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.739> flowers

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
color out of the leaves or the flowers

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.100 
color out of the leaves or the flowers
and<00:02:29.400> now<00:02:30.000> I'm<00:02:30.150> gonna<00:02:30.360> go<00:02:30.629> ahead<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.870> give<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.050> a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
and now I'm gonna go ahead and give it a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.979 
and now I'm gonna go ahead and give it a
taste<00:02:31.260> test<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.120> I'm<00:02:33.120> gonna<00:02:33.239> put<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.750> a

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
taste test and I'm gonna put it in a

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.470 
taste test and I'm gonna put it in a
champagne<00:02:34.440> flute<00:02:34.620> just<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.550> show<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.300> big

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
champagne flute just to show you the big

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.690 
champagne flute just to show you the big
color<00:02:36.720> difference<00:02:37.050> has<00:02:37.200> changed<00:02:37.769> in<00:02:38.519> about

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
color difference has changed in about

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.460 
color difference has changed in about
five<00:02:38.910> minutes<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.810> taste<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.319> is

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
five minutes so the taste of it is

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.530 
five minutes so the taste of it is
really<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.310> subtle<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.790> doesn't<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.180> any

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
really really subtle it doesn't have any

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.630 
really really subtle it doesn't have any
kind<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.230> overpowering<00:02:43.680> characteristics<00:02:44.459> one

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
kind of overpowering characteristics one

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.520 
kind of overpowering characteristics one
way<00:02:44.819> or<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.060> other<00:02:45.090> it's<00:02:45.690> slightly<00:02:46.019> floral

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
way or the other it's slightly floral

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.259 
way or the other it's slightly floral
and<00:02:46.800> obviously<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.670> fascinating<00:02:48.150> thing

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
and obviously the fascinating thing

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.420 
and obviously the fascinating thing
about<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.629> is<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.019> color<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.530> added<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.340> little

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
about it is the color I added a little

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.890 
about it is the color I added a little
bit<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.700> simple<00:02:50.940> syrup<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.780> that

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
bit of simple syrup to it and that

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.059 
bit of simple syrup to it and that
helped<00:02:52.110> kind<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.349> bring<00:02:52.500> some<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.800> flavor

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
helped kind of bring some of the flavor

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.940 
helped kind of bring some of the flavor
out<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.489> but<00:02:54.090> it's<00:02:54.390> not<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.870> very<00:02:55.080> aggressive

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
out of it but it's not a very aggressive

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.000 
out of it but it's not a very aggressive
flavor<00:02:56.190> at<00:02:56.340> all<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:57.500> next<00:02:58.500> time<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.769> brew<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
flavor at all so next time I brew the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.589 
flavor at all so next time I brew the
tea<00:02:59.040> I'm<00:02:59.310> probably<00:02:59.519> going<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.819> increase<00:03:00.180> the

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
tea I'm probably going to increase the

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.479 
tea I'm probably going to increase the
amount<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.989> flowers<00:03:01.319> I<00:03:01.440> put<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:01.709> by<00:03:02.129> at<00:03:02.310> least

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
amount of flowers I put in by at least

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.089 
amount of flowers I put in by at least
double<00:03:02.970> oven<00:03:03.629> C<00:03:03.840> kind<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.290> if<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:04.769> has

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
double oven C kind of if that has

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.860 
double oven C kind of if that has
anything<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.489> do<00:03:05.700> with<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.120> most<00:03:06.540> likely

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
anything to do with it and most likely

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.479 
anything to do with it and most likely
I'll<00:03:06.989> probably<00:03:07.019> increase<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.010> extraction

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
I'll probably increase the extraction

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.509 
I'll probably increase the extraction
time<00:03:08.909> or<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.420> time<00:03:09.599> it<00:03:09.629> steeps<00:03:10.190> for<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> little

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
time or the time it steeps for a little

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.410 
time or the time it steeps for a little
bit<00:03:11.610> as<00:03:11.819> well

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
bit as well

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.449 
bit as well
now<00:03:12.780> some<00:03:13.440> simple<00:03:13.709> syrup<00:03:13.800> definitely<00:03:14.280> helps

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
now some simple syrup definitely helps

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.890 
now some simple syrup definitely helps
to<00:03:14.580> kind<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.879> accentuate<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.450> bring<00:03:15.599> out<00:03:15.750> some

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
to kind of accentuate and bring out some

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.320 
to kind of accentuate and bring out some
of<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.019> flavor<00:03:16.349> but<00:03:17.040> even<00:03:17.700> then<00:03:17.879> it's<00:03:18.150> very

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
of that flavor but even then it's very

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.720 
of that flavor but even then it's very
very<00:03:18.480> subtle<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.290> now<00:03:20.010> for<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.280> fun<00:03:20.400> part<00:03:20.459> now

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
very subtle so now for the fun part now

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.250 
very subtle so now for the fun part now
we're<00:03:21.030> just<00:03:21.180> going<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.330> add<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.750> little<00:03:21.989> bit<00:03:22.170> of

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
we're just going to add a little bit of

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.619 
we're just going to add a little bit of
lemon<00:03:22.409> juice<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.680> this<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.190> see<00:03:23.400> how<00:03:24.150> drastic

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
lemon juice to this to see how drastic

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.589 
lemon juice to this to see how drastic
the<00:03:24.750> color<00:03:24.989> changes<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:27.180> I'm<00:03:27.239> just<00:03:27.360> going<00:03:27.510> to

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
the color changes so I'm just going to

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:36.140 
the color changes so I'm just going to
add<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:28.019> drop<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.650> lemon<00:03:29.190> juice<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:34.970> holy<00:03:35.970> cow

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
add a drop of lemon juice to it holy cow

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.509 
add a drop of lemon juice to it holy cow
that's<00:03:36.360> crazy<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:37.790> was<00:03:38.790> literally<00:03:39.150> like<00:03:39.900> a

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
that's crazy that was literally like a

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.210 
that's crazy that was literally like a
very<00:03:41.519> small<00:03:41.790> straw<00:03:42.120> full<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.920> lemon<00:03:43.920> juice<00:03:44.010> to

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
very small straw full of lemon juice to

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.970 
very small straw full of lemon juice to
this<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.390> turn<00:03:45.659> this<00:03:45.780> beautiful<00:03:46.560> color

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
this and it is turn this beautiful color

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.890 
this and it is turn this beautiful color
that<00:03:47.340> I'm<00:03:47.519> sure<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.790> can<00:03:47.940> see<00:03:48.120> on<00:03:48.239> on<00:03:48.540> the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
that I'm sure you can see on on the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.949 
that I'm sure you can see on on the
video<00:03:49.110> there<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:50.459> pretty<00:03:51.150> cool<00:03:51.330> technique<00:03:51.720> I

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
video there a pretty cool technique I

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.839 
video there a pretty cool technique I
like<00:03:52.379> this<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.590> lot<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:53.040> think<00:03:53.310> I'm<00:03:53.400> going<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.640> be

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
like this a lot I think I'm going to be

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.809 
like this a lot I think I'm going to be
adapting<00:03:54.239> this<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.540> some<00:03:54.900> cocktails

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
adapting this to some cocktails

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.530 
adapting this to some cocktails
so<00:03:57.170> just<00:03:58.170> for<00:03:58.349> science<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.069> stuff<00:04:00.060> let's<00:04:00.450> add

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
so just for science and stuff let's add

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.699 
so just for science and stuff let's add
a<00:04:00.599> little<00:04:00.720> bit<00:04:00.840> more<00:04:00.870> acid<00:04:01.379> and<00:04:01.500> see<00:04:01.590> what

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
a little bit more acid and see what

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.339 
a little bit more acid and see what
happens

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.530 

not<00:04:07.250> much<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.519> a<00:04:07.579> change<00:04:07.849> so<00:04:08.209> I'm<00:04:08.299> just<00:04:08.450> gonna

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
not much of a change so I'm just gonna

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.300 
not much of a change so I'm just gonna
go<00:04:08.780> ahead<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:09.049> add<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.230> good<00:04:09.469> amount<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.159> and

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
go ahead and add a good amount to it and

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.949 
go ahead and add a good amount to it and
now<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:10.730> we've<00:04:10.969> kind<00:04:11.209> of<00:04:11.239> seen<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.599> effect

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
now that we've kind of seen the effect

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:20.770 
now that we've kind of seen the effect
of<00:04:12.079> it<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:19.280> beautiful<00:04:20.150> it's<00:04:20.570> still

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
of it and it's beautiful it's still

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.779 
of it and it's beautiful it's still
really<00:04:21.079> gorgeous<00:04:21.259> and<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:21.919> can<00:04:22.190> imagine<00:04:22.370> that

really gorgeous and I can imagine that

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.029 
really gorgeous and I can imagine that
the<00:04:23.000> more<00:04:23.180> you<00:04:23.300> acid<00:04:23.780> you<00:04:23.900> add<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.289> it<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.830> more

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
the more you acid you add to it the more

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.159 
the more you acid you add to it the more
this<00:04:25.220> pink<00:04:25.580> color<00:04:25.759> is<00:04:25.910> going<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.180> turn<00:04:26.449> so
