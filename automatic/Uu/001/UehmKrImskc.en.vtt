don't know how many of these are but I
tried<00:00:46.519> to<00:00:46.550> keep<00:00:46.850> them<00:00:47.149> uniform<00:00:47.949> except<00:00:48.949> I

tried to correct some mistakes that I
noticed<00:00:52.219> in<00:00:52.999> my<00:00:53.539> hair<00:00:53.899> like<00:00:54.109> I<00:00:54.469> noticed

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
noticed in my hair like I noticed

noticed in my hair like I noticed
certain<00:00:55.519> areas<00:00:55.909> I<00:00:56.300> ended<00:00:56.960> up<00:00:57.050> combining

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
certain areas I ended up combining

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:59.799 
certain areas I ended up combining
not<00:00:58.339> because<00:00:58.729> they<00:00:59.059> were<00:00:59.120> getting<00:00:59.359> thinner

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
not because they were getting thinner

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.809 
not because they were getting thinner
but<00:01:00.140> because<00:01:00.469> I<00:01:00.499> noticed<00:01:01.039> that<00:01:01.219> a<00:01:01.249> lot<00:01:01.460> of<00:01:01.609> hair

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
but because I noticed that a lot of hair

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:04.240 
but because I noticed that a lot of hair
slipped<00:01:02.120> out<00:01:02.300> of<00:01:02.329> them<00:01:02.629> just<00:01:02.960> from<00:01:03.250> styling

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
slipped out of them just from styling

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.660 
slipped out of them just from styling
and<00:01:04.519> things<00:01:04.760> like<00:01:05.000> that<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.590> they<00:01:06.590> required<00:01:07.250> a

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
and things like that and they required a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.719 
and things like that and they required a
thicker<00:01:08.090> root<00:01:08.780> base<00:01:09.050> for<00:01:09.800> example<00:01:10.310> like<00:01:10.490> right

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
thicker root base for example like right

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.569 
thicker root base for example like right
above<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.210> Nate<00:01:11.450> like<00:01:12.140> right<00:01:12.380> here<00:01:12.829> I<00:01:12.950> made

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
above the Nate like right here I made

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.760 
above the Nate like right here I made
those<00:01:13.790> braids<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.390> little<00:01:14.630> bit<00:01:14.750> bigger<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.320> she

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
those braids a little bit bigger so she

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.190 
those braids a little bit bigger so she
hopefully<00:01:16.520> won't<00:01:16.700> even<00:01:16.969> have<00:01:17.149> to<00:01:17.329> combine

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
hopefully won't even have to combine

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.249 
hopefully won't even have to combine
down<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.680> line<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.479> I<00:01:20.479> did<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:20.810> same<00:01:21.049> thing

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
down the line and I did the same thing

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:22.090 
down the line and I did the same thing
on<00:01:21.409> this<00:01:21.619> side

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
on this side

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.399 
on this side
I<00:01:22.130> also<00:01:22.670> if<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.479> turn<00:01:23.750> around<00:01:23.869> I<00:01:24.259> also<00:01:25.159> did<00:01:25.610> I

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
I also if you turn around I also did I

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.240 
I also if you turn around I also did I
also<00:01:27.409> did<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.920> back<00:01:28.159> row<00:01:28.509> bigger<00:01:29.680> than<00:01:30.680> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
also did the back row bigger than the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.330 
also did the back row bigger than the
other<00:01:31.369> braids

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
other braids

see that when I installed my locs I did
on<00:01:39.200> myself<00:01:39.460> but<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:40.729> was<00:01:41.000> great<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.990> have

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
on myself but this was great to have

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.609 
on myself but this was great to have
eyes<00:01:43.100> in<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.549> back<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:44.350> her<00:01:45.350> head<00:01:45.590> and

eyes in the back of her head and
everything<00:01:46.280> she<00:01:46.729> I<00:01:46.909> could<00:01:47.240> see<00:01:47.420> exactly<00:01:47.810> where

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
everything she I could see exactly where

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:49.719 
everything she I could see exactly where
I<00:01:48.140> was<00:01:48.439> putting<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.920> braids<00:01:49.189> it<00:01:49.429> took<00:01:49.609> me

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
I was putting the braids it took me

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.740

about<00:01:49.969> 6<00:01:50.780> hours<00:01:51.310> 5<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.520> 6<00:01:52.759> hours<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.420> do<00:01:53.570> this

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
about 6 hours 5 to 6 hours to do this

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.090 
about 6 hours 5 to 6 hours to do this
just<00:01:54.049> because<00:01:54.140> her<00:01:54.500> hair<00:01:54.710> is<00:01:54.740> pretty<00:01:54.979> long

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
just because her hair is pretty long

speaking lint out of her hair so it's

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.850 
speaking lint out of her hair so it's
going<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.480> be<00:02:14.599> a<00:02:14.629> learning<00:02:14.930> experience<00:02:15.110> for

checks and at night to look and see if
there's<00:02:31.489> any<00:02:31.700> lint<00:02:32.030> because<00:02:32.329> if<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.599> get<00:02:32.749> them

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
there's any lint because if you get them

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.679 
there's any lint because if you get them
get<00:02:33.079> them<00:02:33.139> out<00:02:33.349> early<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:34.370> may<00:02:34.639> not<00:02:34.879> be<00:02:35.090> as<00:02:35.299> much

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
get them out early it may not be as much

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.270 
get them out early it may not be as much
of<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:36.109> problem<00:02:37.180> but<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.650> like<00:02:39.650> braid<00:02:39.980> locks

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
of a problem but I like braid locks

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.869 
of a problem but I like braid locks
because<00:02:40.609> it's<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.269> very<00:02:41.769> gradual<00:02:42.769> process<00:02:42.919> I

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
because it's a very gradual process I

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.610 
because it's a very gradual process I
know<00:02:44.840> for<00:02:45.260> me<00:02:45.409> it<00:02:45.769> took<00:02:46.370> years<00:02:47.120> for<00:02:47.620> people

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
know for me it took years for people

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.949 
know for me it took years for people
that<00:02:48.769> even<00:02:48.919> realize<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.609> I<00:02:49.669> had<00:02:49.909> locks<00:02:50.239> so

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
that even realize that I had locks so

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.470 
that even realize that I had locks so
that<00:02:51.349> gave<00:02:51.530> me<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.859> chance<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.430> get<00:02:52.730> used<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.180> it

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
that gave me a chance to get used to it

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.640 
that gave me a chance to get used to it
um<00:02:54.349> and<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:54.859> you<00:02:55.280> know<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:56.510> people<00:02:56.930> adjusted

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
um and it you know the people adjusted

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.189 
um and it you know the people adjusted
to<00:02:57.799> my<00:02:57.949> look<00:02:58.219> very<00:02:58.609> slowly<00:02:59.359> so<00:02:59.599> I<00:02:59.629> didn't<00:02:59.989> get<00:03:00.139> a

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:00.199 
to my look very slowly so I didn't get a

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.610 
to my look very slowly so I didn't get a
whole<00:03:00.560> lot<00:03:00.739> of<00:03:00.769> negative<00:03:01.280> comments<00:03:02.409> it's<00:03:03.409> not

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
whole lot of negative comments it's not

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.129 
whole lot of negative comments it's not
until<00:03:03.980> today<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.340> someone<00:03:05.269> will<00:03:05.659> walk<00:03:05.810> up<00:03:06.019> to

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
until today that someone will walk up to

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.140 
until today that someone will walk up to
me<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.379> you<00:03:06.560> know<00:03:07.219> right<00:03:07.489> away<00:03:07.730> know<00:03:07.909> that<00:03:08.120> I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
me and you know right away know that I

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.839 
me and you know right away know that I
have<00:03:08.389> locks<00:03:08.659> so<00:03:09.260> I<00:03:09.530> think<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:10.310> a<00:03:10.430> it's<00:03:10.730> a

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
have locks so I think it's a it's a

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.209 
have locks so I think it's a it's a
process<00:03:11.150> that<00:03:11.389> takes<00:03:11.629> longer<00:03:12.439> to<00:03:12.560> Matt<00:03:12.769> up<00:03:12.980> so

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:13.219 
process that takes longer to Matt up so

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.149 
process that takes longer to Matt up so
she<00:03:13.370> does<00:03:13.760> decide<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.269> change<00:03:14.840> her<00:03:15.109> mind<00:03:15.159> take

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
she does decide to change her mind take

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.390 
she does decide to change her mind take
down<00:03:16.400> will<00:03:16.639> be<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.790> lot<00:03:17.090> easier<00:03:17.650> then<00:03:18.650> um<00:03:18.889> I<00:03:19.129> mean

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
down will be a lot easier then um I mean

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.819 
down will be a lot easier then um I mean
I'm<00:03:19.549> not<00:03:19.730> sure<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.510> know<00:03:20.840> for<00:03:21.199> me<00:03:21.379> after<00:03:21.590> a

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
I'm not sure but I know for me after a

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.949 
I'm not sure but I know for me after a
year<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.129> a<00:03:22.220> half<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:22.759> took<00:03:23.090> down<00:03:23.239> one<00:03:23.299> of<00:03:23.780> my

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
year and a half I took down one of my

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.229 
year and a half I took down one of my
locks<00:03:24.229> because<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:25.370> braid<00:03:25.609> pattern<00:03:25.909> just

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
locks because the braid pattern just

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.969 
locks because the braid pattern just
wasn't<00:03:26.659> disappearing<00:03:27.229> because<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.500> had<00:03:27.769> done

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979 
wasn't disappearing because I had done

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.009 
wasn't disappearing because I had done
it<00:03:28.099> too<00:03:28.250> tightly<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:28.819> it<00:03:29.269> came<00:03:29.449> down<00:03:29.689> very

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
it too tightly and it came down very

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.159 
it too tightly and it came down very
easily<00:03:30.489> um<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.729> it<00:03:32.030> locked<00:03:32.269> back<00:03:32.569> up<00:03:32.599> and<00:03:33.049> it

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
easily um and it locked back up and it

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.030 
easily um and it locked back up and it
looks<00:03:33.379> exactly<00:03:33.560> like<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.430> other<00:03:34.459> locks<00:03:34.879> so

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
looks exactly like the other locks so

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.789 
looks exactly like the other locks so
I'm<00:03:37.040> just<00:03:37.370> hoping<00:03:37.639> that<00:03:38.290> you'll<00:03:39.290> be<00:03:39.470> as<00:03:39.590> happy

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
I'm just hoping that you'll be as happy

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.830 
I'm just hoping that you'll be as happy
with<00:03:39.949> yours<00:03:40.310> as<00:03:40.549> I<00:03:40.669> am<00:03:40.790> with<00:03:41.030> with<00:03:41.389> mine<00:03:41.629> you
