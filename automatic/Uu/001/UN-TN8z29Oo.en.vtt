00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.770

 when I degrees 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.109
 [Music] 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.109
 [Applause] 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.410
 [Music] 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:11.400
 then it's time to add our salt 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:17.630

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.630

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:28.550

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.550
 [Music] 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.860
 if you have any salt on hand i can get you 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.600
 always use an effervescent tablet and then 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:45.940
 you get the exact same edible effect 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:49.450
 then two then thea your crew I check 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.130
 a man waves and the finishing touch too 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.410
 long 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.410
 [Music] 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.750
 Kristalia markets would nevertheless be a buzzing 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.419
 I also choose the salt 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.419
 [Music] 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.930
 so remember you can always be in the 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.629
 trash barges and not again 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.709
