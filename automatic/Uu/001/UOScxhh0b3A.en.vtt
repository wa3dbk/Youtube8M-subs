00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.890 
it's just plain blue block but still it
works<00:03:10.420> for<00:03:10.810> some<00:03:10.870> good<00:03:11.109> head<00:03:12.660> yeah<00:03:13.660> he<00:03:13.750> just

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
works for some good head yeah he just

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
feet right there and he actually stands

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.520 
feet right there and he actually stands
up<00:03:20.739> pretty<00:03:20.950> well<00:03:20.980> obviously<00:03:21.700> is<00:03:22.599> pretty<00:03:23.349> big

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
up pretty well obviously is pretty big

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.240 
up pretty well obviously is pretty big
piece<00:03:25.019> his<00:03:26.019> articulation<00:03:26.380> his<00:03:26.769> head<00:03:26.889> can

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
piece his articulation his head can

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.509 
piece his articulation his head can
rotate<00:03:27.370> 360<00:03:28.180> degrees<00:03:29.220> doesn't<00:03:30.220> really<00:03:30.280> matter

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
rotate 360 degrees doesn't really matter

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.330 
rotate 360 degrees doesn't really matter
ego<00:03:30.760> because<00:03:30.940> he<00:03:31.030> doesn't<00:03:31.180> have<00:03:31.359> a<00:03:31.419> faith<00:03:31.660> so

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
ego because he doesn't have a faith so

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.020 
ego because he doesn't have a faith so
just<00:03:33.340> like<00:03:33.489> stationary<00:03:34.650> um<00:03:35.669> his<00:03:36.669> arms<00:03:36.940> can

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
just like stationary um his arms can

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.409 
just like stationary um his arms can
rotate<00:03:37.180> 360<00:03:38.109> degrees<00:03:38.349> and<00:03:38.910> that's<00:03:39.910> all<00:03:40.269> this

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
rotate 360 degrees and that's all this

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.920 
rotate 360 degrees and that's all this
articulation<00:03:40.930> um<00:03:41.609> but<00:03:42.609> still<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.209> good

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
articulation um but still it's good

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.229
