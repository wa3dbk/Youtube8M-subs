00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.890
 of the video for more information and now 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.230
 everyone here yale or more and parker at 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.389
 of the nest and today with this video 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.190
 of halo 4 let's go quickly our 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.650
 file explorer to variants of 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.199
 maps and look for the gamertag of the place 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.140
 of thirst for those who are not near 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.640
 from an xbox and they want to do this in this 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.039
 I will instantly leave you the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.830
 links in the description to download 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.930
 the maps that I teach them more than anything 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.230
 the shared files of what is given 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.090
 the variants of maps and especially to the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.100
 good to the map that I'm going to show you 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.660
 final how good these maps of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.350
 special are you going to tell them 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.739
 We see that the set had already commented 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.410
 about the link mods in halo 4 and this 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.620
 Once we get on maps, that's us 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.780
 we put a force to him and then normal saint 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.510
 no no, there does not seem to be something different 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.250
 but oh my god what's that over there 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.010
 it turns out that this is only one of the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.320
 variants of mods that he has here 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.909
 we see 256 rocks of that size and 256 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.640
 Coliseum walls apart 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.880
 with the objects that come in shape 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.950
 normal in this other mode we see that there 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.450
 512 green screens I do not understand for 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.569
 what someone would want so many screens 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.490
 green on your map good but if all 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:23.429
 we put them together we could recreate the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.069
 avatar set although the manchester 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.079
 Sorry no fun with these screens 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.390
 green that you can simply start 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.579
 climb the whole giant tower and it's 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.140
 possible to get to the tip the last 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.780
 tips when you're doing the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.420
 force first of all the objects that 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.149
 There here you can not erase because if 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.560
 you do that they are not going to reappear 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.299
 so once you've finished the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.340
 map and you are completely determined to 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.950
 that way it's going to stay and you do not need 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.739
 occupy any other moderate object 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.110
 just delete it also when 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.909
 save the map is not going to save with 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.619
 your name you will not be the author of 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.030
 map but you can always include your 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.739
 name the description 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.359
 the important thing is that you do things that the 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.849
 people find fun 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.619
 more than anything you unfortunately transform 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.239
 you can not change the author's name or 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.770
 it can not be modified since 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.900
 precisely the map is 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.240
 finally with these many can do 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.250
 really fabulous things like this map 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.130
 that I am teaching you at this time 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.170
 this remake of hegel coagulation 2 or 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.180
 black gold single to one that I know that a 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.380
 we all love it and there is precisely one 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.630
 gameplay of this map where this live 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.220
 360 what you play, check out your channel 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.770
 fact is precisely the interview that 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.140
 made me recently this is there the 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.810
 gameplay and I really like how he plays 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.230
 this map feels quite similar to 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.420
 traditional blog coach leave it this way 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.800

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.170
 description as I always hope that you 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.390

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.220
 Anyway I'm he loves and for the channel
