scratching my head what are they talking

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.930 
scratching my head what are they talking
about<00:01:56.540> because<00:01:57.540> an<00:01:57.960> officer<00:01:58.830> carries<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.700> gun

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
about because an officer carries a gun

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.410 
about because an officer carries a gun
even<00:02:00.740> years<00:02:01.740> ago<00:02:02.040> when<00:02:02.250> bullying<00:02:02.640> became<00:02:03.120> in

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
even years ago when bullying became in

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.570 
even years ago when bullying became in
the<00:02:03.479> forefront<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.979> was<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> major<00:02:05.340> issue

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
the forefront it was a major issue

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.340 
the forefront it was a major issue
happening<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.330> schools<00:02:06.450> there<00:02:06.990> was<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> lot

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
happening in the schools there was a lot

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.229 
happening in the schools there was a lot
of<00:02:07.380> police<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.099> school<00:02:08.310> collaboration<00:02:09.060> on

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
of police and school collaboration on

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.130 
of police and school collaboration on
the<00:02:09.869> notion<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.289> community<00:02:11.039> policing<00:02:11.549> and

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
the notion of community policing and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.140 
the notion of community policing and
cops<00:02:13.140> were<00:02:13.319> there<00:02:13.580> even<00:02:14.580> talking<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.000> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
cops were there even talking to the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.149 
cops were there even talking to the
classroom<00:02:15.330> kids<00:02:15.750> these<00:02:16.170> are<00:02:16.319> armed<00:02:16.650> officers

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
classroom kids these are armed officers

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.380 
classroom kids these are armed officers
so<00:02:17.400> I'm<00:02:17.580> wondering<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.150> see<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:18.330> difference

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
so I'm wondering do you see a difference

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.080 
so I'm wondering do you see a difference
here<00:02:18.840> or<00:02:19.049> is<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.290> how<00:02:19.560> its<00:02:19.769> presented<00:02:20.029> by<00:02:21.029> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
here or is that how its presented by the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.720 
here or is that how its presented by the
media<00:02:21.359> and<00:02:21.719> by<00:02:22.049> these<00:02:22.319> yards<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.340> think<00:02:23.579> it

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
media and by these yards I think it

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.800 
media and by these yards I think it
really<00:02:23.760> comes<00:02:24.239> down<00:02:24.329> to<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
really comes down to the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.559 
really comes down to the
whole<00:02:24.930> idea<00:02:25.349> that<00:02:25.940> guns<00:02:26.940> don't<00:02:27.060> murder<00:02:27.420> people

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
whole idea that guns don't murder people

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.240 
whole idea that guns don't murder people
but<00:02:28.170> they<00:02:28.260> sometimes<00:02:28.530> prevent<00:02:29.099> them<00:02:29.220> from

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
but they sometimes prevent them from

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.710 
but they sometimes prevent them from
being<00:02:29.550> murdered<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.180> all<00:02:30.300> depends<00:02:30.599> on

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
being murdered and it all depends on

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.660 
being murdered and it all depends on
who's<00:02:30.900> holding<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.500> gun<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:32.430> end<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
who's holding that gun the end the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.640 
who's holding that gun the end the
morality<00:02:32.910> behind<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.599> if<00:02:33.720> someone's<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.530> know

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
morality behind it if someone's you know

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.559 
morality behind it if someone's you know
flashing<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.130> gun<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.610> as<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:36.090> show<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.390> bravado

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
flashing a gun and as a show of bravado

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.080 
flashing a gun and as a show of bravado
that's<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.380> person<00:02:37.800> who's<00:02:37.920> dangerous<00:02:38.160> if<00:02:38.910> he's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
that's a person who's dangerous if he's

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.270 
that's a person who's dangerous if he's
wearing<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.480> gun<00:02:40.050> on<00:02:40.230> his<00:02:40.380> holster<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.010> he's

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
wearing a gun on his holster and he's

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.000 
wearing a gun on his holster and he's
wearing<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.580> badge<00:02:41.849> that's<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.959> reassurance<00:02:43.590> but

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
wearing a badge that's a reassurance but

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.979 
wearing a badge that's a reassurance but
I<00:02:44.040> don't<00:02:44.250> need<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.640> kind<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.150> presence<00:02:45.660> in<00:02:45.810> a

I don't need that kind of presence in a

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.660 
I don't need that kind of presence in a
school<00:02:46.230> country<00:02:46.830> school<00:02:47.099> where<00:02:47.340> everything's
