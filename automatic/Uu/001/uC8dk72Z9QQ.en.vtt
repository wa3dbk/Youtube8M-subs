you<00:00:29.220> didn't<00:00:29.820> design<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.330> week<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.750> looks

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you didn't design this week it looks

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.959 
you didn't design this week it looks
like<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.199> designed<00:00:31.349> by<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.710> madman<00:00:32.219> you

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
like it was designed by a madman you

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.970 
like it was designed by a madman you
know<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.809> part<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> appeal<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.829> some

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
know that is part of the appeal to some

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
know that is part of the appeal to some
people<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:36.030> appeal<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.570> me<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.079> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
people the appeal to me is that this is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.600 
people the appeal to me is that this is
seventy<00:00:37.620> dollars<00:00:37.860> with<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> gears<00:00:38.340> opposed

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
seventy dollars with the gears opposed

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.740 
seventy dollars with the gears opposed
to<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> thousand<00:00:39.120> dollars<00:00:39.360> worth<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.570> gear

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
to a thousand dollars worth of gear

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.569 
to a thousand dollars worth of gear
which<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.290> what<00:00:40.440> sous<00:00:40.680> vide<00:00:40.860> normally<00:00:41.250> cost<00:00:41.460> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
which is what sous vide normally cost to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.010 
which is what sous vide normally cost to
make<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.090> want<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.329> get<00:00:42.420> an<00:00:42.540> industrial

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
make if you want to get an industrial

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.180 
make if you want to get an industrial
recirculate<00:00:43.710> or<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:43.920> used<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
recirculate or that's used in a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.830 
recirculate or that's used in a
chemistry<00:00:44.550> lab<00:00:44.789> yeah<00:00:45.210> that's<00:00:45.570> where<00:00:45.750> this

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
chemistry lab yeah that's where this

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.000 
chemistry lab yeah that's where this
stuff<00:00:46.050> started<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:46.980> are

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
stuff started but then there are

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.170 
stuff started but then there are
consumer<00:00:47.399> units<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.760> are<00:00:47.789> about<00:00:47.940> four<00:00:48.149> or

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
consumer units that are about four or

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.639 
consumer units that are about four or
five<00:00:48.270> hundred<00:00:48.570> dollars<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.559> do

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
five hundred dollars and then you can do

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.930 
five hundred dollars and then you can do
this<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.010> seventy<00:00:50.430> or<00:00:50.460> eighty<00:00:50.550> dollars

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
this for like seventy or eighty dollars

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.090 
this for like seventy or eighty dollars
so<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.170> looking<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.559> what's<00:00:52.980> in

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
so what are we looking at what's in

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.889 
so what are we looking at what's in
there<00:00:53.399> load<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.850> circulator<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.690> just

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
there load a circulator in here is just

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.330 
there load a circulator in here is just
hot<00:00:55.260> water<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:55.920> hot<00:00:56.039> water<00:00:56.190> so

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
hot water now it's just hot water so

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.529 
hot water now it's just hot water so
it's<00:00:56.460> happening<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
it's happening here is this is just a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.360 
it's happening here is this is just a
slow<00:00:57.719> cooker<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.469> got<00:00:58.649> basically<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.070> dumb

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
slow cooker it's got basically a dumb

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.010 
slow cooker it's got basically a dumb
on/off<00:00:59.789> switch<00:01:00.120> which<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.570> important

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
on/off switch which is important

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.810 
on/off switch which is important
thermocouple<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.460> which<00:01:02.579> actually

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
thermocouple right here which actually

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.609 
thermocouple right here which actually
takes<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> temperature<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> water<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
takes the temperature of the water and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.130 
takes the temperature of the water and
we<00:01:04.830> feed<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.549> data<00:01:05.939> into<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.810> guy<00:01:07.020> over

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
we feed that data into this guy over

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.679 
we feed that data into this guy over
here<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.740> thermostatic<00:01:08.280> controller<00:01:08.689> which

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
here this thermostatic controller which

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.230 
here this thermostatic controller which
basically<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.170> cycling<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.100> power<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
basically is cycling the power on and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.050 
basically is cycling the power on and
off<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.689> guy<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> sous<00:01:13.979> vide<00:01:14.130> set<00:01:14.939> up

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
off on this guy so the sous vide set up

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.090 
off on this guy so the sous vide set up
essentially<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.659> use<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> slow<00:01:16.350> cooker<00:01:16.710> it

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
essentially is use a slow cooker it

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.590 
essentially is use a slow cooker it
holds<00:01:17.280> liquid<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.880> normally<00:01:18.150> designed<00:01:18.240> for

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
holds liquid it's normally designed for

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.420 
holds liquid it's normally designed for
this<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.380> cycle<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> power<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.369> off

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
this and then cycle the power on and off

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.490 
this and then cycle the power on and off
so<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.479> control<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> temperature<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
so that you control the temperature to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.380 
so that you control the temperature to
exactly<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.100> temperature<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> want<00:01:23.670> things

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
exactly the temperature you want things

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.670 
exactly the temperature you want things
like<00:01:24.540> salmon<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.259> might<00:01:25.380> cook<00:01:25.560> at

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
like salmon you know you might cook at

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.830 
like salmon you know you might cook at
131<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.670> certain<00:01:26.909> amount<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.119> time<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.570> will

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
131 for certain amount of time that will

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.210 
131 for certain amount of time that will
correctly<00:01:28.080> pasteurize<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.100> for

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
correctly pasteurize it if you do it for

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.859 
correctly pasteurize it if you do it for
the<00:01:29.310> right<00:01:29.369> whole<00:01:29.579> time<00:01:29.790> things<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:30.600> steak

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the right whole time things like steak

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.350 
the right whole time things like steak
may<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.200> cooked<00:01:31.439> 140<00:01:32.159> degrees<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> get

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
may be cooked 140 degrees so you get
