lengthy note the moral of story is a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.189 
lengthy note the moral of story is a
radiator<00:00:23.550> hell's<00:00:23.820> blew<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.480> was<00:00:24.630> overheated

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
radiator hell's blew it was overheated

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.259 
radiator hell's blew it was overheated
severely<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.340> replace<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.910> radiator<00:00:27.240> hose

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
severely you replace the radiator hose

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.200 
severely you replace the radiator hose
and<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:29.070> wants<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.519> overheat

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and now it wants to overheat

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.319 
and now it wants to overheat
he<00:00:30.570> has<00:00:30.689> no<00:00:30.929> heat<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.470> inside<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.329> it

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
he has no heat on the inside and it

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.910 
he has no heat on the inside and it
blows<00:00:33.540> all<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.840> cool<00:00:34.110> out<00:00:34.320> into<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> overflow

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
blows all the cool out into the overflow

blows all the cool out into the overflow
jug<00:00:36.590> in<00:00:37.590> order<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.010> test<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.430> vehicle<00:00:38.820> what

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
jug in order to test this vehicle what

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.010 
jug in order to test this vehicle what
I'm<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.300> looking<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.840> is

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
I'm going to be looking for is

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.959 
I'm going to be looking for is
combustion<00:00:40.680> gas<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.489> radiator

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
combustion gas in the radiator

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.180 
combustion gas in the radiator
so<00:00:42.510> essentially<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.230> can<00:00:43.410> happen<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so essentially what can happen is the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
so essentially what can happen is the
head<00:00:44.579> gasket<00:00:45.000> will<00:00:45.090> rupture<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.690> allow

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
head gasket will rupture and allow

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.630 
head gasket will rupture and allow
exhaust<00:00:46.289> gas<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.829> come<00:00:47.010> into<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> radiator

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
exhaust gas to come into the radiator

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
exhaust gas to come into the radiator
and<00:00:47.940> we're<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> use<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.260> little

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.890 
a slight green color to yellow okay so
I'm<00:01:52.910> going<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.090> go<00:01:53.210> ahead<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:53.540> start<00:01:53.810> the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
I'm going to go ahead and start the

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.420 
I'm going to go ahead and start the
vehicle<00:01:54.230> we're<00:01:54.590> going<00:01:54.620> to<00:01:54.740> check<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:55.160> out<00:01:55.220> when

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
vehicle we're going to check it out when

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.160 
vehicle we're going to check it out when
the<00:01:55.520> vehicle<00:01:55.820> is<00:01:55.850> cold<00:01:56.120> and<00:01:56.450> now<00:01:56.930> we're<00:01:57.080> going

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
the vehicle is cold and now we're going

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.050 
the vehicle is cold and now we're going
to<00:01:57.230> continue<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.740> test<00:01:57.980> as<00:01:58.160> vehicle<00:01:58.550> warms<00:01:58.850> up

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
to continue the test as vehicle warms up

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.460 
to continue the test as vehicle warms up
until<00:01:59.630> we<00:01:59.720> get<00:01:59.840> some<00:01:59.990> really<00:02:00.140> definitive

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
until we get some really definitive

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.030 
until we get some really definitive
results<00:02:01.220> if<00:02:01.580> any<00:02:01.820> at<00:02:01.970> all<00:02:02.710> I've<00:02:03.710> got<00:02:03.890> the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
results if any at all I've got the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:22.670 
results if any at all I've got the
engine<00:02:04.280> running<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.820> it's<00:02:04.970> cold<00:02:05.270> right<00:02:05.510> now

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.709 

already<00:02:23.370> appears<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.760> be<00:02:23.879> changing<00:02:24.299> slightly

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
already appears to be changing slightly

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:49.960 
already appears to be changing slightly
green

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.910 

I<00:02:50.090> could<00:02:50.570> already<00:02:50.720> see<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.140> test<00:02:51.380> would<00:02:51.650> start

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
I could already see the test would start

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.470 
I could already see the test would start
to<00:02:52.010> turn<00:02:52.190> yellow<00:02:52.250> it's<00:02:52.940> already<00:02:53.150> turned<00:02:53.390> a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
to turn yellow it's already turned a

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.480 
to turn yellow it's already turned a
pretty<00:02:53.690> light<00:02:54.050> green<00:02:54.320> color<00:02:54.590> I'm<00:02:55.220> going<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.430> go

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
pretty light green color I'm going to go

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.560 
pretty light green color I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:55.730> let<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.910> vehicle<00:02:56.060> warm<00:02:56.390> up

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
ahead and let the vehicle warm up

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.850 
ahead and let the vehicle warm up
because<00:02:56.750> typically<00:02:57.260> when<00:02:57.440> they're<00:02:57.620> warm

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
because typically when they're warm

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.440 
because typically when they're warm
it'll<00:02:58.520> be<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.640> lot<00:02:58.850> worse<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.150> went<00:03:02.390> ahead

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
it'll be a lot worse so I went ahead

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.380 
it'll be a lot worse so I went ahead
replenish<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.440> fluid<00:03:04.000> there<00:03:05.000> feels<00:03:05.210> pretty

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
replenish the fluid there feels pretty

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.280 
replenish the fluid there feels pretty
much<00:03:05.600> warmed<00:03:05.960> up<00:03:06.110> now<00:03:06.320> or<00:03:06.590> on<00:03:07.340> its<00:03:07.550> way<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:08.290> just

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
much warmed up now or on its way I just

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.530 
much warmed up now or on its way I just
stuck<00:03:09.710> it<00:03:09.830> on<00:03:09.980> there<00:03:10.250> just<00:03:10.460> on<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.240> radiator

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
stuck it on there just on the radiator

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.960 
stuck it on there just on the radiator
I'm<00:03:11.630> not<00:03:11.780> even<00:03:11.990> pumping<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:13.490> can<00:03:13.640> see<00:03:13.820> the

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
I'm not even pumping it you can see the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.460 
I'm not even pumping it you can see the
gas<00:03:14.180> that's<00:03:14.480> actually<00:03:14.840> coming<00:03:14.990> up<00:03:15.260> through

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
gas that's actually coming up through

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.320 
gas that's actually coming up through
there<00:03:15.680> I'm<00:03:16.400> gonna<00:03:16.520> go<00:03:16.700> ahead<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:16.850> rub<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.210> up

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
there I'm gonna go ahead and rub it up

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:34.820 
there I'm gonna go ahead and rub it up
and<00:03:17.510> show<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.660> what<00:03:17.870> happened

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.430 

so<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.790> can<00:03:35.940> see<00:03:36.120> how<00:03:36.270> that<00:03:36.330> test<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.960> done<00:03:37.200> and

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
so you can see how that test is done and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.950 
so you can see how that test is done and
well<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.730> results<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.240> this<00:03:39.360> case<00:03:39.570> are<00:03:39.750> pretty

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
well the results in this case are pretty

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.120 
well the results in this case are pretty
definitive<00:03:40.530> I'd<00:03:41.490> say<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:41.940> yellow<00:03:43.130> anyhow

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
definitive I'd say that yellow anyhow

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.490 
definitive I'd say that yellow anyhow
it's<00:03:44.610> all<00:03:44.730> over<00:03:45.000> but<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.180> crying<00:03:45.270> now<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.200> if

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
it's all over but the crying now so if

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.770 
it's all over but the crying now so if
you<00:03:46.770> are<00:03:47.160> suspicious<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:48.030> your<00:03:48.180> own<00:03:48.300> vehicle

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
you are suspicious of your own vehicle

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.970 
you are suspicious of your own vehicle
or<00:03:48.900> you're<00:03:49.050> working<00:03:49.230> on<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.440> vehicle<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.860> you

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
or you're working on a vehicle and you

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.830 
or you're working on a vehicle and you
just<00:03:50.130> want<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.400> know<00:03:50.520> for<00:03:50.700> sure<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:51.540> that

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
just want to know for sure is that

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.740 
just want to know for sure is that
putting<00:03:52.470> combustion<00:03:52.890> gas<00:03:53.070> in<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> radiator

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
putting combustion gas in the radiator

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.050 
putting combustion gas in the radiator
this<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.930> one<00:03:55.110> way<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.320> find<00:03:55.620> out<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:56.880> can<00:03:57.030> use

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
this is one way to find out you can use

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.810 
this is one way to find out you can use
a<00:03:57.150> five<00:03:57.420> gas<00:03:57.630> analyzer<00:03:58.170> but<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:59.280> assume<00:03:59.580> if<00:03:59.730> you

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
a five gas analyzer but I assume if you

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.160 
a five gas analyzer but I assume if you
have<00:03:59.970> one<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.210> those<00:04:00.390> you're<00:04:00.600> probably<00:04:00.870> not

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
have one of those you're probably not

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.900 
have one of those you're probably not
looking<00:04:01.230> on<00:04:01.560> YouTube<00:04:01.800> wondering<00:04:02.790> how<00:04:02.880> to

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
check for a blown head gasket so anyhow
