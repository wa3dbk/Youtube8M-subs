00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
is doing so this is very important you

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.190 
is doing so this is very important you
can<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.280> station<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.570> go<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:42.899> three

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
can go with station we can go with three

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.770 
can go with station we can go with three
or<00:00:43.320> four<00:00:43.530> exercises<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.570> dissociation<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
or four exercises on dissociation and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.500 
or four exercises on dissociation and
they<00:00:46.050> go<00:00:46.260> through<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.010> circuit<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.789> let's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
they go through the circuit like let's

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.049 
they go through the circuit like let's
go<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:49.020> 20<00:00:49.649> seconds<00:00:50.070> they<00:00:50.219> are<00:00:50.280> 20<00:00:50.700> seconds

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
go for 20 seconds they are 20 seconds

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.000 
go for 20 seconds they are 20 seconds
they're<00:00:51.270> 20<00:00:51.690> seconds<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.199> repeat<00:00:52.410> okay

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
they're 20 seconds and repeat okay

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.209 
they're 20 seconds and repeat okay
because<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.699> lot<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.300> variation<00:00:54.930> will<00:00:55.170> help<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
because a lot of variation will help to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.049 
because a lot of variation will help to
develop<00:00:56.570> faster<00:00:57.570> okay<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.039> let's<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.000> more

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
develop faster okay so let's do one more

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.689 
develop faster okay so let's do one more
time<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.870> same<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.440> did<00:01:01.649> okay<00:01:02.309> now<00:01:02.489> what

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
time the same you did okay now what

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.680 
time the same you did okay now what
you're<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> do<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.210> you're<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.629> to
