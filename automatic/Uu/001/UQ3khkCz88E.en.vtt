00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
exactly the same thing but now you're

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.859 
exactly the same thing but now you're
just<00:01:47.290> moving<00:01:47.470> up<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.490> fifth<00:01:48.790> fret<00:01:48.970> okay<00:01:49.810> so

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:59.680 
just moving up to the fifth fret okay so
when<00:01:50.290> you<00:01:50.470> do<00:01:50.619> this<00:01:50.770> bird

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.990 

no<00:02:00.230> in<00:02:00.920> this<00:02:01.160> two<00:02:01.310> ways<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:01.460> can<00:02:01.550> do<00:02:01.730> that<00:02:01.760> you

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
no in this two ways you can do that you

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.430 
no in this two ways you can do that you
can<00:02:02.030> never<00:02:02.270> do<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:02.920> finger

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.980 

or<00:02:09.770> I<00:02:10.340> cheat<00:02:10.670> because<00:02:11.150> it's<00:02:11.480> hard<00:02:11.660> for<00:02:11.840> me<00:02:11.900> to

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
or I cheat because it's hard for me to

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.370 
or I cheat because it's hard for me to
quickly<00:02:12.230> get<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:13.700> formation<00:02:14.180> with<00:02:14.570> my<00:02:15.020> with

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
quickly get that formation with my with

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.750 
quickly get that formation with my with
for<00:02:15.650> me<00:02:15.740> anyways<00:02:16.100> it's<00:02:16.280> hard<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:16.610> do<00:02:16.730> that

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
for me anyways it's hard to do that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.020 
for me anyways it's hard to do that
musician<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:19.310> white<00:02:19.490> sheet<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:21.790> just<00:02:22.790> move

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
musician so white sheet I just move

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.950 
musician so white sheet I just move
first<00:02:24.020> finger<00:02:24.290> back<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:26.660> once<00:02:26.810> again

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
first finger back so once again

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:47.540 
first finger back so once again
everything<00:02:27.560> up<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.710> that<00:02:27.830> point<00:02:28.220> would<00:02:28.640> be

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.990 

I'm<00:02:48.390> going<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.630> stop<00:02:48.930> there<00:02:49.580> because<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.760> got<00:02:50.910> to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
I'm going to stop there because I got to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.120 
I'm going to stop there because I got to
run<00:02:51.150> at<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.300> time<00:02:51.540> again<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.560> next<00:02:52.740> part<00:02:52.950> gets<00:02:53.070> a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
run at a time again the next part gets a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.790 
run at a time again the next part gets a
little<00:02:53.250> trickier<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:54.210> I<00:02:54.660> do<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.620> whole<00:02:55.770> thing

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
little trickier so I do the whole thing

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.890 
little trickier so I do the whole thing
one<00:02:56.130> more<00:02:56.280> time<00:02:56.340> here's<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.150> picking<00:02:57.510> pattern

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
one more time here's the picking pattern

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.140 
one more time here's the picking pattern
you're<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.230> whole<00:02:58.410> thing<00:02:58.850> see<00:02:59.850> what<00:03:00.000> I'm

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
you're the whole thing see what I'm

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.690 
you're the whole thing see what I'm
doing<00:03:00.710> so<00:03:01.710> here's<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.040> actual<00:03:02.190> picking

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
doing so here's the actual picking

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.090 
doing so here's the actual picking
pattern<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.360> can<00:03:03.510> see<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.930> I'll<00:03:04.890> try<00:03:05.010> to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
pattern if you can see that I'll try to

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:14.090 
pattern if you can see that I'll try to
go<00:03:05.310> slow

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:27.430 

you

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.720 

my<00:03:28.070> candy

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
my candy

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:43.120 
my candy
we<00:03:30.209> don't<00:03:30.360> have<00:03:30.629> to<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.050> can<00:03:31.080> also<00:03:31.349> go

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.309 

you<00:03:44.130> don't<00:03:44.310> have<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.700> do<00:03:44.820> that

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.890 

two<00:03:48.890> sizes<00:03:49.280> into<00:03:50.239> all<00:03:50.359> kinds<00:03:50.599> of<00:03:50.629> variations

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
two sizes into all kinds of variations

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.949 
two sizes into all kinds of variations
with<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.349> once<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:51.680> get<00:03:51.829> it<00:03:51.920> down<00:03:52.239> so<00:03:53.239> part<00:03:53.659> 3

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
with the once you get it down so part 3

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.599 
with the once you get it down so part 3
