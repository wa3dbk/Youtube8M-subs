00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
all of this packaging off of there just

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.309 
all of this packaging off of there just
quite<00:02:38.910> sticky<00:02:39.209> actually<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.050> lot

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
quite sticky actually it's a lot

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.390 
quite sticky actually it's a lot
stickier<00:02:40.560> than<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.830> thought<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.040> was<00:02:41.190> going<00:02:41.340> to

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
stickier than I thought it was going to

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.100 
stickier than I thought it was going to
be<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.900> sticking<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.020> card<00:02:43.230> quite<00:02:43.530> well<00:02:45.110> get

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
be and sticking the card quite well get

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.309 
be and sticking the card quite well get
all<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.319> stuff<00:02:46.530> off<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.890> there<00:02:48.020> peel<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.200> all

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
all this stuff off of there peel it all

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.470 
all this stuff off of there peel it all
off<00:02:49.560> all<00:02:49.890> right

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
off all right

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.140 
off all right
so<00:02:51.200> there<00:02:51.379> we<00:02:51.530> go<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.550> I'm<00:02:52.610> gonna<00:02:52.730> flip<00:02:52.970> it

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
so there we go so I'm gonna flip it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.270 
so there we go so I'm gonna flip it
around<00:02:53.209> anyways<00:02:53.510> one<00:02:53.690> more<00:02:53.840> time<00:02:54.019> ply<00:02:55.010> better

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
around anyways one more time ply better

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280 
around anyways one more time ply better
view<00:02:55.519> this<00:02:55.670> way<00:02:55.879> sorry<00:02:56.239> about<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:57.080> let's

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
view this way sorry about that so let's

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.680 
view this way sorry about that so let's

right<00:03:03.530> here<00:03:03.560> there's<00:03:04.340> little<00:03:04.610> windows

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
right here there's little windows

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.990 
right here there's little windows
they'll<00:03:05.180> be<00:03:05.299> lights<00:03:05.540> in<00:03:05.720> this<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:07.760> little

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
they'll be lights in this this little

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.789 
they'll be lights in this this little
blue<00:03:08.120> thing<00:03:08.180> right<00:03:08.569> here<00:03:08.599> just<00:03:09.410> looks<00:03:09.620> good

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
blue thing right here just looks good

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.070 
blue thing right here just looks good
doesn't<00:03:09.980> actually<00:03:10.280> do<00:03:10.640> anything<00:03:10.750> now<00:03:11.750> as<00:03:11.900> far

button now the lethal boost button used

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.319 
button now the lethal boost button used
to<00:03:38.959> see<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.410> twin<00:03:40.040> BIOS<00:03:40.400> on<00:03:40.609> here<00:03:40.910> with<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.090> little

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
to see a twin BIOS on here with a little

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.330 
to see a twin BIOS on here with a little
pin<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:41.720> still<00:03:41.959> click<00:03:42.260> back<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.680> forth<00:03:42.920> well

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
pin you still click back and forth well

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.160 
pin you still click back and forth well
this<00:03:43.519> also<00:03:43.700> has<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.060> dual<00:03:44.329> BIOS<00:03:44.690> but<00:03:44.870> it<00:03:44.959> works

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
this also has a dual BIOS but it works

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.349 
this also has a dual BIOS but it works
differently<00:03:45.310> now<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.370> lethal<00:03:46.940> boost<00:03:47.180> is

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
differently now the lethal boost is

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.390 
differently now the lethal boost is
actually<00:03:47.720> one<00:03:47.959> BIOS<00:03:48.319> and<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.829> standard<00:03:49.160> bios

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
actually one BIOS and the standard bios

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.890 
actually one BIOS and the standard bios
is<00:03:49.549> the<00:03:49.670> other<00:03:49.790> one<00:03:49.970> so<00:03:50.150> all<00:03:50.269> you<00:03:50.390> do<00:03:50.510> is<00:03:50.660> click

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
is the other one so all you do is click

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.839 
is the other one so all you do is click
this<00:03:51.049> boost<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:51.650> as<00:03:52.040> soon<00:03:52.160> as<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.340> hit<00:03:52.519> the

effective bandwidth on the memory so a

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.819

lot<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.000> changes<00:04:05.450> there<00:04:05.630> here<00:04:06.410> are<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.680> two

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
lot of changes there here are the two

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.099 
lot of changes there here are the two
crossfire<00:04:07.370> fingers<00:04:07.819> and<00:04:08.030> right<00:04:08.720> here<00:04:08.989> are

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
crossfire fingers and right here are

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.140 
crossfire fingers and right here are
lights<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:09.769> what<00:04:10.069> these<00:04:10.190> lights<00:04:10.489> do<00:04:10.760> is<00:04:10.970> they

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
lights and what these lights do is they

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.879 
lights and what these lights do is they
light<00:04:11.389> up<00:04:11.419> and<00:04:11.780> according<00:04:12.319> to<00:04:12.349> the<00:04:12.470> color<00:04:12.709> on

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
light up and according to the color on

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.800 
light up and according to the color on
there<00:04:13.069> they'll<00:04:13.280> tell<00:04:13.459> you<00:04:13.609> how<00:04:14.030> hot<00:04:14.299> your<00:04:14.540> card

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
there they'll tell you how hot your card

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.960 
there they'll tell you how hot your card
is<00:04:14.989> so<00:04:15.919> they'll<00:04:16.160> have<00:04:16.280> different<00:04:16.639> colors<00:04:16.940> and

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
is so they'll have different colors and

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.849 
is so they'll have different colors and
if<00:04:17.539> it<00:04:17.690> gets<00:04:17.840> too<00:04:18.049> dang<00:04:18.229> hot<00:04:18.470> they'll<00:04:18.709> probably

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
if it gets too dang hot they'll probably

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.259 
if it gets too dang hot they'll probably
be<00:04:19.070> one<00:04:19.190> on<00:04:19.310> here<00:04:19.459> that<00:04:19.519> lights<00:04:19.820> up<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.090> says

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
be one on here that lights up it says

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.390 
be one on here that lights up it says
