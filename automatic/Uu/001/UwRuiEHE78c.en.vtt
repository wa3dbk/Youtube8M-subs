00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.220
 Welcome to a new video in one 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.750
 channel and today with the theme 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:16.289
 File Manager Yes I am 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.100
 Fought in the store and of course 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.769
 also for myself for a suitable 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.630
 Pick out three different ones 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.689
 File Manager selected from these 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.439
 three I've been looking for the favorites 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.940
 Astro file manager selected because of 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.850
 I just liked the most 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.930
 he is really easy to use 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.640
 So let's start the same 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.309
 app the app is of course free so 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.600
 you do not have to pay 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.110
 from now on also follow really regularly 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.329
 from the creators of this app and is 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.329
 Really, if you have your mobile phone now 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:01:00.570
 from this app has files from 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.309
 wanted to steer or we could 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.229
 Of course, rename files 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:10.110
 move or the files and includes 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:12.540
 Now the things just start with her 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.200
 have here right when the app starts like this 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.979
 three functions so the first function 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.360
 is that you have the places for example 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.549
 on which the files can have to 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.290
 for example on the sd card usb stick 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:34.049
 network on dropbox via facebook and 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.970
 google accounts what is i got one 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.680
 search function about which you can to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.450
 example now gave inserted files 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.750
 the over the pc on the handy over 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.640
 played and you do not see it that way 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.119
 you can find by the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.869
 Suchfunktion for example is the 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:54.030
 relates to write down this file if 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.640
 you look for it all the time and you 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.130
 is the better facilitate 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.420
 is set by fixed in the search 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.350
 and then next we're like that 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.509
 a sub-point that is current there 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.020
 then all the files will be 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.340
 you are in the process of running 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.010
 the time stop 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.110
 had collected tree or has heard 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.420
 have introduced new and there you are allowed 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.900
 We also find the new things 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.560
 play have one of the same time 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.629
 go to features of astro file manager 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.599
 now just on my folder with 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:36.569
 the movie we have now you can through 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.860
 the app now if you are a long time yet 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.290
 soon could be different files 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.510
 mark or if different now 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.420
 want to move files can you 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.519
 mark several files and then they 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.920
 by this key move into one 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.340
 move another folder or you 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.489
 can you for example if now one 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.709
 wrong film format done on your cellphone 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.370
 do not have that location player stop 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.950
 can read 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.190
 can you format the naturally 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:12.019
 change for example now in 3g what the 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:15.660
 Most cell phones can also read it 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.310
 allows you you can see that now the 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.680
 new mobile now read the video format 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.200
 can and usually no 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.910
 has trouble with it when we have 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.849
 Of course you have to try it out first 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.019
 with the video formats now like here 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.989
 intends is I have not read it on 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:35.459
 3gp is rewritten perfectly 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.709
 from the phone and off no problems that 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.630
 the same goes with pictures you can 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.650
 many pictures for example or if you are 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.599
 now really important files have 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.400
 or things on a cell phone not 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.489
 everyone should see you can also the 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.430
 rename files and in me now 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.519
 or just make invisible for 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.880
 the mobile so you can only do it over the 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.900
 av media see that they are filming 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.940
 like here is jackie chan 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.540
 Now do not have that every man 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.190
 what you can see for files 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.900
 on the phone has simply clears the 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:16.739
 last lines with the point there in advance 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.299
 so that the file is an indeterminate 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.700
 File is therefore a blank here 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.460
 Of course I could still stay 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.659
 still about the file 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.180
 so access the files 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:30.810
 the internet opens with video picture or 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.979
 the text function also with text sms the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.479
 not everyone can see that now you can 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.460
 also small in the us profi manager 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:41.400
 copy and rename it so you do not 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:45.330
 Anyone can read that's it now 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.069
