00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.580 
close teammate how did it affect the
rest<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> season<00:01:33.149> for<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.539> you<00:01:34.320> know<00:01:34.409> what

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
rest of the season for you you know what

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.830 
rest of the season for you you know what
to<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.859> honest<00:01:35.159> there<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.520> made<00:01:36.299> us<00:01:36.329> better<00:01:36.689> I

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to be honest there it made us better I

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.200 
to be honest there it made us better I
think<00:01:37.020> not<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.100> he<00:01:38.399> wouldn't<00:01:38.609> help<00:01:38.820> being

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
think not that he wouldn't help being

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.429 
think not that he wouldn't help being
that<00:01:39.390> because<00:01:39.539> obviously<00:01:39.689> what<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.170> he<00:01:40.259> was<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
that because obviously what if he was a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.620 
that because obviously what if he was a
key<00:01:40.740> part<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.039> our<00:01:41.159> team<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.359> know<00:01:42.479> we

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
key part to our team and but you know we

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.359 
key part to our team and but you know we
really<00:01:42.780> rebounded<00:01:43.649> well<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.039> know<00:01:44.159> came

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
really rebounded well and you know came

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.919 
really rebounded well and you know came
together<00:01:44.549> as<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.939> team<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.570> got<00:01:45.719> a<00:01:45.749> lot

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
together as a team up so you got a lot

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:46.999 
together as a team up so you got a lot
closer<00:01:46.170> when<00:01:46.469> something<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.829> happens

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
closer when something like that happens

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.649 
closer when something like that happens
and<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.640> think<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:47.939> played<00:01:48.119> our<00:01:48.240> best<00:01:48.270> hockey

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and I think we played our best hockey

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.480 
and I think we played our best hockey
down<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> stretch<00:01:49.319> you<00:01:49.499> know<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.799> quite

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
down the stretch you know it was quite

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.309 
down the stretch you know it was quite
the<00:01:50.579> inspiration<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.270> play<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
the inspiration and play for so it

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.899 
the inspiration and play for so it
really<00:01:52.499> gave<00:01:52.649> us<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.890> lot<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.100> motivation<00:01:53.340> but

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
really gave us a lot of motivation but

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.609 
really gave us a lot of motivation but
