00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello and welcome to shrek 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.259
 tab in this video we want 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.019
 look like the motorola moto gp in 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.969
 the playing temple edge two bettringer 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.920
 and modern combat four so shrink from 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.150
 customer the usual I have the device 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.310
 just rebooted 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.810
 we do not have any running apps and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.970
 I will play as soon as I am done 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.740
 I'm done closing this again 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.720
 I start a new one so we here 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.340
 really the full power of the smartphone 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.109
 to get to see the games are 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.240
 all not pre-installed you can 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.380
 you temple rang two and the trigger 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.420
 while in a free 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.520
 ad-supported version in place tor 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.710
 documents and you can also modern 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.690
 he will be charged four 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:47.460
 but now I wish you much fun 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:50.190
 watch go and start 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.629
 So make temple edge two as always 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.370
 the game with the least 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.710
 requirements but still completely 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.329
 interesting I am often asked to 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.460
 and above all, I think of one like that 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.230
 cheap smartphone like the motogp is 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.940
 that of course relatively interesting 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.769
 we want the volume a bit behind 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.600
 I can balance up 1 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.580
 the bray loud is really here 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.990
 I've been fine so far 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.030
 we like to go in here quickly 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.250
 the settings and I show you that we 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.560
 the visual quality here, of course 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.439
 Best we go back to Beck 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.150
 and click directly on play and catch 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.189
 then I would say right away 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.080
 This also applies to the graphics 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.299
 she is really nice and sharp 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.860
 really good on this display here the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.049
 I also like contrast very much 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.570
 good and so from the beginning runs 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.680
 actually everything is relatively fluid 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.229
 I would say I think you see that 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.820
 Here, too, very well clear with the brand 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.399
 Two, it should not be a problem 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.930
 have but I can say it there 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.990
 enough smartphones in this 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.710
 Price range around the 169 euro also 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.149
 with tempera two really have problems 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.670
 that was of course the motogp at the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.360
 hardware relatively unlikely though 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.310
 Nevertheless, we want that of course 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.960
 take a closer look and I think so 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.329
 Looks pretty good, everything is working here 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.409
 really nice liquid pretty much 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.689
 I do not really have to anymore 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.170
 really show that was temple rank two 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.580
 on the motorola moto gp and on 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.790
 let's go with the trigger two 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.620
 of these three also play with relative 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.150
 high requirements not quite like 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.980
 modern combat four but we want us 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.300
 the whole course a bit more accurate 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.950
 look at it you will see 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.780
 actually loaded relatively quickly 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.150
 Immediately the loading times are there 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.590
 also no or little difference 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.080
 the smartphones with the qualcomm 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.790
 snapdragon 800, yes still largely 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.390
 significantly more expensive than this motto 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.250
 You here 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.650
 Again, the graphics really 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.870
 very nice the presentation very sharp 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.910
 and here you should also for the first time 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.520
 hear that the speaker really 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.080
 pretty good so we'll be there 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.850
 later this video will continue 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.040
 I'll just go here again fast 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.930
 in the options and down here on the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.760
 performance to show you that the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.680
 performance so the graphics details here 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.709
 of course we are on high 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.360
 go back and catch 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.840
 I would go directly to the game here 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.090
 say 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.070
 So as I said graphic of my opinion 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.660
 after really very nice here 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.090
 I did not expect it so well here 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.770
 Of course motogp is really that too 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.910
 very very good display owed here 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.930
 that's a really good one 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.489
 performance we continue to go up 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.860
 and then here comes the first one 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.290
 zombie 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.709
 we'll just go there too 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.360
 is of course no problem at all and 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.360
 Run down here again 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.340
 here it's off course directly 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.650
 Go on the first shot here 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.080
 you see that with the weapon but also 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.030
 Here the motto of course no 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.220
 problems, too, that really works here 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.350
 very fluently and I have to 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.570
 quite honestly, therefore, say the warrior 2 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.450
 on the motorola moto that really makes 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.830
 a lot of it makes a lot of fun my 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.820
 opinion after there you can at all 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.070
 do not complain 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.260
 And last but not least, we'll take a look 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.880
 now also modern combat 4 an after 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.690
 as before, of course, with relatively high 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.190
 conditions 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.780
 You see her like the others 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.540
 Of course, both of them play again 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.640
 on screen they touch you a lot 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.709
 Take diagonal display away and 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.150
 maybe also here for info we 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.340
 have here the version with 8 gigabytes 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.160
 at internal memory i have here now 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.810
 some music on a few pictures and how 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.729
 So these three games are called temples 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.540
 ranked two modern combat 4 and the 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:28.410
 Warrior 2 and I have about here now 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.360
 19 gb free so too many games should 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.220
 you really are not at the 8 gb version 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.290
 install if you prefer more 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.450
 want to play with your motoki then 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.340
 I would definitely be 16gb version 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.990
 unfortunately expect, yes, but currently 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.700
 not available yet 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.460
 we just skip it now 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.100
 the intro but i think or i hope 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.780
 you also saw very well that the 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.370
 graphics at this intro really 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.530
 So it was pretty awesome 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.340
 at least that's really good 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.070
 looked 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.080
 we look for something and you see 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.870
 that too is relatively fluid 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.760
 even this scene here at the beginning where I am 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.410
 because I ran a bit faster now 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.990
 where you like a few framerate 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.820
 Burglaries are even the running 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.620
 actually really relatively fluid and 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.280
 I think you can see that here too 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.290
 good if we continue here too 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.360
 is running relatively well I have, of course 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:22.500
 Once again a grenade threw that 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:26.070
 belongs here and we do 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:32.280
 Just go back in here 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:39.990
 squat and maybe throw here 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:41.010
 again a grenade forward and that 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.680
 that's it 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.030
 So what about modern combat four too 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.140
 Again, I think you have too 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.300
 Seen here quite well 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.740
 The graphics really great the performance 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.270
 really great there are actually 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.400
 no problems and me personally 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.350
 no great differences 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.270
 recognize to a smartphone with that 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.130
 snapdragon 800 now for example the 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.230
 nexus five the note 3 etc 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.880
 that was really similar here too 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.500
 Liquid is probably because of that 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.520
 anyway, they have not played that way yet 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.620
 really take advantage of it 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.260
 but of course that is definitely one 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.240
 plus point for the motogp close leaves 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.340
 Who would like to tell a game? 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.410
 his smartphone is playing with the 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.300
 motto definitely advise you correctly 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.250
 So you can get there anyway 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.870
 No problems and considering the plug 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.240
 considering the price, I would 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.740
 say that is even a very good one 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.660
 performance we have here in this video 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.220
 have seen 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.020
 yes, that's it again 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.490
 I hope this short gaming test 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.590
 Of course, as always, the video has you 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.960
 Please thank me for watching and 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.960
 say in this sense to the next
