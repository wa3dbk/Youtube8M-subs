knocks<00:00:26.010> away<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> pokeball<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:27.420> you're

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
knocks away the pokeball so what you're

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.870 
knocks away the pokeball so what you're
going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.689> need<00:00:27.900> for<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.410> trick<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.400> work<00:00:29.640> is

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
going to need for this trick to work is

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.440 
going to need for this trick to work is
a<00:00:30.390> gameshark<00:00:30.840> straight<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.820> it<00:00:32.820> will<00:00:33.059> not<00:00:33.090> work

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
a gameshark straight up it will not work

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.500 
a gameshark straight up it will not work
without<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.840> gameshark<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:35.160> these<00:00:35.820> are<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
without a gameshark so these are the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.670 
without a gameshark so these are the
steps<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.960> you're<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> take

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
steps that you're going to have to take

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.560 
steps that you're going to have to take
first<00:00:38.219> you're<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.329> know<00:00:39.540> how

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
first you're going to have to know how

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.930 
first you're going to have to know how
to<00:00:39.809> do<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.170> Miss<00:00:40.350> no<00:00:40.680> glitch<00:00:40.980> second<00:00:41.820> you're

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
to do the Miss no glitch second you're

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.000 
to do the Miss no glitch second you're
going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> have<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.360> start<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.719> new<00:00:42.930> game

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
going to have to start a new game

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.380 
going to have to start a new game
completely<00:00:44.059> with<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.390> first<00:00:46.289> letters<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.390> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
completely with the first letters of the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.139 
completely with the first letters of the
alphabet<00:00:49.820> being<00:00:51.230> G<00:00:53.149> and<00:00:55.070> that<00:00:56.070> will<00:00:56.430> allow<00:00:57.090> for

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
alphabet being G and that will allow for

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.279 
alphabet being G and that will allow for
the<00:00:57.539> missing<00:00:58.079> nose<00:00:59.420> addressing<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the missing nose addressing to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.939 
the missing nose addressing to
eventually<00:01:02.070> come<00:01:02.309> up<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.760> ghosts<00:01:03.449> or<00:01:03.949> gastly

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
eventually come up with ghosts or gastly

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.280 
eventually come up with ghosts or gastly
which<00:01:05.790> will<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.150> turn<00:01:06.180> come<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:06.990> ghosts

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
which will in turn come up with ghosts

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.340 
which will in turn come up with ghosts
eventually<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:10.369> here<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.520> some<00:01:11.900> catch-22s<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
eventually so here are some catch-22s to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.820 
eventually so here are some catch-22s to
this<00:01:14.150> one<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:16.619> game

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
this one this is going to up your game

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.670 
this one this is going to up your game
real<00:01:17.130> bad<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.350> keep<00:01:19.470> that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
real bad so if you want to keep that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.990 
real bad so if you want to keep that
game<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.850> better<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:22.290> sure<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.880> know

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
game you better be sure that you know

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.020 
game you better be sure that you know
you're<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.390> gonna<00:01:25.280> flip<00:01:26.280> out<00:01:26.430> when<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.790> breaks

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
you're not gonna flip out when it breaks

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.270 
you're not gonna flip out when it breaks
or<00:01:27.270> anything<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.409> best<00:01:28.650> suited<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.070> do

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
this on around so these are the codes

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
that you're going to need the first code

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.870 
that you're going to need the first code
you're<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> need<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.610> catch

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
going to need it the second code you're

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.389 
going to need it the second code you're
probably<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.649> want<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.890> use<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.280> the

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
how this works now again because you

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.250

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
the ball away and you can't battle them

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.540 
the ball away and you can't battle them
because<00:02:52.140> you're<00:02:52.260> too<00:02:52.410> afraid<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.860> stuff<00:02:53.370> like
