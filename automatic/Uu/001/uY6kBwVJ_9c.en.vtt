00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 protection well and understand where something merges 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.110
 where do we unscrew four 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.369
 these screws to unprotect well 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.590

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.049

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.830
 look like this 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.110
 these screws 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:48.909
 in order to remove the plastic from this protection 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.909
 we removed you protection and here is a drain plug 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:58.190

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.450
 oil came out faster need cork 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.929
 now see leaked oil here is our 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.190
 filter housing where the card is inserted 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.970
 unscrew this top and and already 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.970
 tore off 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.140
 that is, this top cork which 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.580
 allows us to remove leftovers with a syringe 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.860
 oils that are there 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.680
 but in any case when unscrewing 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.450
 where is the filter itself 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.640
 insert the card you need everything there 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.870

 Anyway she's oil 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.620
 digs and gets left on a rag all 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.550
 Now we take all the threads disconnect everything I 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:58.990
 I installed this puller 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:03.450
 there are friends and spider type pullers and how 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:11.100
 I would try to disrupt it from a place of 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.100
 all enough to rip we shoot everything 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.620
 all possess it manually as rags 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.400
 twisted water burnt with rags 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.400
 start screwing 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.480
 there is 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.310
 all this part should also be postponed 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.270
 so we will pull out to me 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.270
 the oil does not prokop so here I got 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.370
 new katrich bosch narrow today 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.930
 spun this one pulled out old 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.640
 cartridge and we have in Rome set 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:03.340
 big ring that 's changing here 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:07.550
 if there are small ring that 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.760
 changes in there and copper here this 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.090
 brass ring which is placed here 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.090
 here 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:21.140
 change and spin all revise 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.240
 we replaced here gum replaced here 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.940
 gum well, respectively, here is this copper 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:36.710
 also insert the seal here now 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:38.720
 Katrich click aunts all now when we 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.730
 twist the case we can fill in here 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.880
 oil so that it is soaked with everything and then 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.290
 already tighten the cork all twist 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.320
 the filter is pre-planting 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.330
 place there too wipe still behind 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.590
 Do not put a neck with a rag 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.979
 no gulf tickers their butter 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.710
 view all the body I screwed up 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:05.140
 With a cloth, wiped it all now with the same 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.140
 puller need to tighten it all the way 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.669
 another such nuance 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.770
 plastics case itself 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.750
 they are seventy four millimeters that is 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.169
 You can buy a standard one 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.750
 thin-walled head for seventy 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.000
 four millimeters and this will cleverly 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.550
 easier to twist and unscrew than here 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.220
 These pullers are filters like 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.580
 dries out there by paying gum and 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:39.100
 to break it well, well, but such here 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:39.100
 Savichev all clamp puller there 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.629
 9 oils to the left through a syringe 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.910
 swiss small river need lichke 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:02.300
 Well, now everything turns out to be a stopper 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.060
 we screwed the bottom you can pour the oil 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.040
 in the amount of about 80 percent of the total 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:13.050
 volume to understand how it is here on the probe 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:15.650
 then potter lera well now we twist 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.650
 this cork 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.450
 on through rubber stubby too 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.910
 there than now the neck rag 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.210
 put her without any ticker fill 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.210
 butter 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:50.850
 I advise you not to pour out your soul 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:56.230
 the book says you need 3 5 and 9 liters 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:57.850
 the hall somewhere in five and a half start 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.940
 well, respectively, before that 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:04.120
 check the probe head there she 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.250
 engine oil will work on the system 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.470
 the role gets going and then already 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:14.560
 check check and 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:17.290
 add it is important to check whether 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.740
 nowhere is there any leakage here for now 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:23.020
 I did not put the cover on the body from 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:27.240
 filter on gums of all sorts like this 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.530
 and the bottom is also on the pallet for another al 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.030
 at night 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:33.510
 engine warmed up checked level 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:37.360
 slightly removed the oil checked 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:40.750
 rezinochki there not for the party to her squeezed 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:45.280
 still drain cork well and we will go 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:48.910
 thousand ten fifteen well we put everything 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.390
 plastic for the protection of all all bye 

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:54.100
 until 

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:57.930
 if someone liked the information and 

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.930
 I will be useful
