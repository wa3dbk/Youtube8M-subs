00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
of the frame so that it's square and you

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:49.750 
of the frame so that it's square and you
can<00:00:41.429> see<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.820> image<00:00:42.179> all<00:00:42.929> the<00:00:43.079> way<00:00:43.199> around<00:00:43.440> now

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
now we're going to turn the frame around

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.789 
now we're going to turn the frame around
and<00:01:18.820> we're<00:01:19.510> going<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.690> do<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.900> corners<00:01:20.229> which

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
just down the side when stretching it's

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.279 
just down the side when stretching it's
best<00:01:53.619> to<00:01:53.740> work<00:01:54.149> against<00:01:55.149> yourself<00:01:55.929> so<00:01:56.170> that

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
best to work against yourself so that

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.590 
best to work against yourself so that
you<00:01:56.380> get<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.619> nice<00:01:56.979> tight<00:01:57.340> stretch<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:58.450> we

you get a nice tight stretch so we

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.540 
you get a nice tight stretch so we
worked<00:01:58.810> on<00:01:59.080> opposite<00:01:59.800> sides<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.310> canvas

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
worked on opposite sides of the canvas

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.630 
worked on opposite sides of the canvas
we've<00:02:00.970> started<00:02:01.240> on<00:02:01.569> the<00:02:01.780> long<00:02:02.200> side<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.950> then

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
we've started on the long side and then

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:26.990 
we've started on the long side and then
we've<00:02:03.819> put<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.179> corners<00:02:04.630> on<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.440> short<00:02:06.069> edges

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.240 

cut<00:02:28.000> off<00:02:28.209> any<00:02:28.390> excess<00:02:28.840> canvas<00:02:29.380> if<00:02:29.890> required

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
cut off any excess canvas if required

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.460 
cut off any excess canvas if required
and<00:02:30.640> then<00:02:31.330> all<00:02:31.450> we're<00:02:31.569> going<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.750> use<00:02:31.989> is<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> bit

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
and then all we're going to use is a bit

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.260 
and then all we're going to use is a bit
of<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:32.709> brown<00:02:33.010> self-adhesive<00:02:33.610> tape<00:02:33.790> to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
of this brown self-adhesive tape to

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.910 
of this brown self-adhesive tape to
finish<00:02:34.540> off<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.840> back<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.140> frames<00:02:35.410> make<00:02:35.770> them

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
finish off the back the frames make them

00:02:35.920 --> 00:03:13.470 
finish off the back the frames make them
look<00:02:36.040> nice<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.459> neat

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.370 

and<00:03:15.010> that's<00:03:16.010> how<00:03:16.190> easy<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:17.150> use<00:03:17.380> easy

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
and that's how easy it is to use easy

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.800 
and that's how easy it is to use easy
stretch
