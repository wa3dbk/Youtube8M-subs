00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
probably gonna be patched soon because

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.290 
probably gonna be patched soon because
it's<00:02:03.410> it's<00:02:03.890> quite<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.220> exploit<00:02:06.910> so<00:02:07.910> yeah<00:02:08.090> if

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
it's it's quite the exploit so yeah if

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.480 
it's it's quite the exploit so yeah if
you<00:02:08.420> want<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.660> power<00:02:08.840> level<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.500> would

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
you want a power level I would

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.720 
you want a power level I would
definitely<00:02:10.940> get<00:02:11.090> right<00:02:11.300> on<00:02:11.450> this<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:12.730> grind

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
definitely get right on this and grind

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.140 
definitely get right on this and grind
those<00:02:13.910> levels<00:02:14.270> out<00:02:14.420> as<00:02:14.900> quickly<00:02:15.470> as<00:02:15.650> possible

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.700 

but<00:02:20.150> yeah<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.330> thought<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:20.960> would<00:02:21.140> be<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.260> great

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
but yeah I thought this would be a great

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.290 
but yeah I thought this would be a great
opportunity<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.430> share<00:02:23.709> our<00:02:24.709> findings<00:02:25.300> you

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
opportunity to share our findings you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.140 
opportunity to share our findings you
can<00:02:26.420> also<00:02:26.540> check<00:02:26.840> out

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
can also check out

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.290 
can also check out

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
the time go up a little bit depending on

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.800 
the time go up a little bit depending on
how<00:02:51.590> how<00:02:52.459> good<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.760> driver<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:53.180> are<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.690> can

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
how how good of a driver you are you can

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.900 
how how good of a driver you are you can
adjust<00:02:54.200> for<00:02:54.350> this<00:02:54.500> or<00:02:54.860> how<00:02:55.130> quickly<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:55.730> want

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
to just make it as much RP as possible

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.890 
to just make it as much RP as possible
or<00:02:58.580> get<00:02:59.680> as<00:03:00.680> much<00:03:00.860> RP<00:03:01.160> as<00:03:01.250> possible<00:03:01.750> I'm<00:03:02.750> gonna

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
or get as much RP as possible I'm gonna

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.460 
or get as much RP as possible I'm gonna
go<00:03:03.019> ahead<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.320> let<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.470> go<00:03:03.769> up<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:04.040> 120<00:03:04.760> and

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
go ahead and let it go up to 120 and

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.290 
go ahead and let it go up to 120 and
then<00:03:06.470> right<00:03:07.100> here<00:03:07.370> as<00:03:07.550> you<00:03:07.640> can<00:03:07.760> see<00:03:07.880> this<00:03:08.090> is

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
then right here as you can see this is

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.410 
then right here as you can see this is
actually<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.840> lat<00:03:09.050> point<00:03:09.350> is<00:03:09.590> uh<00:03:10.220> right<00:03:11.209> here

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
actually the lat point is uh right here

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.670 
actually the lat point is uh right here
where<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:12.489> face<00:03:13.489> with<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.820> warning<00:03:14.090> sign<00:03:14.269> is

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
where that face with the warning sign is

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.960 
where that face with the warning sign is
just<00:03:15.680> for<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.890> for<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.550> point<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:16.760> this<00:03:16.850> video

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
just for the for the point of this video

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.880 
just for the for the point of this video
I<00:03:17.150> only<00:03:17.269> made<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.540> three<00:03:17.810> laps<00:03:18.050> just<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:18.739> I<00:03:18.830> can

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
I only made it three laps just so I can

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.990 
I only made it three laps just so I can
get<00:03:19.630> one<00:03:20.630> lap<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.019> actually<00:03:21.320> shows<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:22.000> me

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
get one lap that actually shows you me

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.699 
get one lap that actually shows you me
gaining<00:03:23.299> RP<00:03:23.570> as<00:03:23.660> you've<00:03:23.810> seen<00:03:23.989> there<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.440> had

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
gaining RP as you've seen there I had

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.220 
gaining RP as you've seen there I had
the<00:03:24.860> blank<00:03:25.070> world<00:03:25.310> record<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:25.989> then<00:03:26.989> when<00:03:27.200> I

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
the blank world record and then when I

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.780 
the blank world record and then when I
set<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.739> record

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
set that record

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.150 
set that record
I<00:03:28.820> gained<00:03:29.360> RP<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.959> then<00:03:30.560> when<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:30.739> come<00:03:31.040> around

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
I gained RP and then when I come around

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.460 
I gained RP and then when I come around
for<00:03:31.400> this<00:03:31.519> next<00:03:31.820> lap<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.360> I<00:03:32.480> beat<00:03:32.810> my<00:03:33.080> previous

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
for this next lap and I beat my previous

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.729 
for this next lap and I beat my previous
lap<00:03:33.950> which<00:03:34.730> is<00:03:34.880> also<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.269> world<00:03:35.600> record<00:03:35.959> for

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
lap which is also the world record for

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.740 
lap which is also the world record for
me<00:03:36.860> because<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.370> was<00:03:37.400> blank<00:03:37.670> I<00:03:37.910> will<00:03:38.570> gain

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
me because it was blank I will gain

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.560 
me because it was blank I will gain
quite<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:39.680> bit<00:03:40.010> of<00:03:40.100> RP<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.730> when<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.299> do<00:03:41.420> this

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
quite a bit of RP and when you do this

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.860 
quite a bit of RP and when you do this
for<00:03:41.810> like<00:03:42.620> five<00:03:42.890> laps<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.640> then<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.510> just<00:03:44.720> do

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
for like five laps and then you just do

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.290 
for like five laps and then you just do
it<00:03:44.989> over<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.530> over<00:03:45.739> again

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
it over and over again

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.020 
it over and over again
you<00:03:46.420> know<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.600> just<00:03:46.690> set<00:03:47.020> yourself<00:03:47.140> up<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:48.030> do

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
you know you just set yourself up to do

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.660 
you know you just set yourself up to do
a<00:03:49.240> few<00:03:49.600> seconds<00:03:50.020> ahead<00:03:50.110> each<00:03:50.440> time<00:03:50.770> I<00:03:51.100> mean<00:03:51.610> you

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
a few seconds ahead each time I mean you

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.340 
a few seconds ahead each time I mean you
can<00:03:51.790> do<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.000> way<00:03:52.300> more<00:03:52.330> laps<00:03:52.750> than<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.110> if<00:03:53.260> you

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
can do it way more laps than that if you

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.790 
can do it way more laps than that if you
want<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:54.100> just<00:03:54.310> all<00:03:54.430> depends<00:03:54.760> on<00:03:55.590> how<00:03:56.590> long<00:03:56.740> you

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
want it just all depends on how long you

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.250 
want it just all depends on how long you
want<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.190> spend<00:03:57.490> farming<00:03:58.360> these<00:03:58.480> out<00:03:58.720> or

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
want to spend farming these out or

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.520 
want to spend farming these out or
farming<00:04:00.130> these<00:04:00.220> laps<00:04:00.960> to<00:04:01.960> level<00:04:02.950> up<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:04.930> think

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
farming these laps to level up I think

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.650 
farming these laps to level up I think
we<00:04:05.830> we<00:04:06.190> established<00:04:06.820> that<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:07.090> would<00:04:07.450> take

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
we we established that it would take

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.730 
we we established that it would take
around<00:04:09.090> maybe<00:04:11.010> 13<00:04:12.010> hours<00:04:12.400> or<00:04:12.610> less<00:04:12.880> to<00:04:13.870> go<00:04:14.530> from

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
around maybe 13 hours or less to go from

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.539 
around maybe 13 hours or less to go from
1<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:14.950> or<00:04:15.490> from<00:04:16.000> like<00:04:16.320> 1<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.410> 100<00:04:17.770> or<00:04:17.890> you<00:04:18.459> know

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
1 to or from like 1 to 100 or you know

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.070 
1 to or from like 1 to 100 or you know
that's<00:04:18.730> how<00:04:18.880> much<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.360> takes<00:04:19.480> as<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:19.870> seen

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
that's how much it takes as you seen

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.410 
that's how much it takes as you seen
there<00:04:20.260> I<00:04:20.470> gained<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:21.040> huge<00:04:21.340> chunk<00:04:21.730> of<00:04:21.880> RP<00:04:22.210> about

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
there I gained a huge chunk of RP about

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.740 
there I gained a huge chunk of RP about
2<00:04:22.630> bars<00:04:22.870> worth<00:04:23.400> for<00:04:24.400> doing<00:04:24.640> that<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:25.000> then<00:04:25.720> I

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
2 bars worth for doing that and then I

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.830 
2 bars worth for doing that and then I
will<00:04:25.870> gain<00:04:26.260> more<00:04:26.530> when<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:26.860> finish<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:28.780> just

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
will gain more when I finish it just

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.190 
will gain more when I finish it just
doesn't<00:04:29.290> come<00:04:29.410> up<00:04:32.310> as<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:34.000> come<00:04:34.510> around<00:04:34.660> here

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
doesn't come up as I come around here

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.350 
doesn't come up as I come around here
see<00:04:35.710> it's<00:04:35.800> a<00:04:35.860> it's<00:04:35.980> a<00:04:36.130> pretty<00:04:36.430> short<00:04:36.760> map<00:04:37.000> so

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
see it's a it's a pretty short map so

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.110 
see it's a it's a pretty short map so
doesn't<00:04:38.290> make<00:04:38.380> it<00:04:38.470> very<00:04:38.590> difficult<00:04:39.120> except

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
doesn't make it very difficult except

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.630 
doesn't make it very difficult except
I'm<00:04:40.270> failing<00:04:40.750> here<00:04:41.110> obviously<00:04:41.710> one<00:04:42.190> in<00:04:42.280> record

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
I'm failing here obviously one in record

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.540 
I'm failing here obviously one in record
and<00:04:42.790> I<00:04:42.880> gotta<00:04:43.060> mess<00:04:44.050> it<00:04:44.230> up<00:04:44.320> but<00:04:44.590> not<00:04:45.220> doing<00:04:45.400> too

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
and I gotta mess it up but not doing too

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.740 
and I gotta mess it up but not doing too
bad<00:04:46.020> I<00:04:47.460> know<00:04:48.460> what<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.730> carbon<00:04:48.940> RS<00:04:49.300> I<00:04:49.540> could

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
bad I know what the carbon RS I could

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.610 
bad I know what the carbon RS I could
get<00:04:49.870> as<00:04:49.990> low<00:04:50.170> as<00:04:50.200> maybe<00:04:50.560> fifty<00:04:51.010> three<00:04:51.280> seconds

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
get as low as maybe fifty three seconds

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.860 
get as low as maybe fifty three seconds
or<00:04:53.620> less<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:54.190> mean<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:54.430> am<00:04:54.610> doing<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:55.090> custom<00:04:55.630> and

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
or less I mean I am doing a custom and

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.840 
or less I mean I am doing a custom and
I've<00:04:55.960> been<00:04:56.110> doing<00:04:56.320> it<00:04:56.560> over<00:04:56.830> and<00:04:57.580> over<00:04:57.670> again

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
I've been doing it over and over again

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:04.700 
I've been doing it over and over again
so<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:59.860> may<00:05:00.370> might<00:05:02.160> account<00:05:03.160> for<00:05:03.310> it<00:05:03.550> I<00:05:03.640> guess

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
so that may might account for it I guess

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.840 
so that may might account for it I guess
but<00:05:05.710> here<00:05:05.890> I<00:05:05.950> am<00:05:06.130> coming<00:05:06.550> to<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.910> finish<00:05:07.840> and

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
but here I am coming to the finish and

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.180 
but here I am coming to the finish and
then<00:05:09.850> you<00:05:09.940> will<00:05:10.060> see<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.510> I<00:05:10.810> gained<00:05:11.560> quite<00:05:12.010> a

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
then you will see that I gained quite a

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.310 
then you will see that I gained quite a
bit<00:05:12.520> of<00:05:12.640> RP<00:05:12.940> you<00:05:13.210> don't<00:05:13.390> you<00:05:13.780> don't<00:05:13.870> gain<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.110> lot

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
bit of RP you don't you don't gain a lot

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.730 
bit of RP you don't you don't gain a lot
for<00:05:14.560> finishing<00:05:14.950> the<00:05:15.100> race<00:05:16.620> necessarily<00:05:17.620> you

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
for finishing the race necessarily you

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.000 
for finishing the race necessarily you
get<00:05:17.920> about<00:05:18.660> 3,000<00:05:19.660> and<00:05:19.900> then<00:05:20.500> like<00:05:20.680> about<00:05:20.980> a

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
get about 3,000 and then like about a

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.620 
get about 3,000 and then like about a
thousand<00:05:21.460> rpm<00:05:22.060> but<00:05:22.510> as<00:05:22.600> you<00:05:22.690> see<00:05:22.870> there<00:05:23.080> I<00:05:23.320> was

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
thousand rpm but as you see there I was

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.060 
thousand rpm but as you see there I was
with<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.690> previous<00:05:26.020> lap<00:05:26.170> I<00:05:26.380> did<00:05:26.560> only<00:05:26.740> gain

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
with the previous lap I did only gain

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.180 
with the previous lap I did only gain
like<00:05:27.790> so<00:05:28.000> much<00:05:28.120> RP<00:05:28.480> and<00:05:28.750> then<00:05:28.870> I<00:05:29.200> gained<00:05:29.500> a<00:05:29.770> huge

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
like so much RP and then I gained a huge

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.050 
like so much RP and then I gained a huge
chunk<00:05:30.490> there<00:05:30.730> for<00:05:31.060> beating<00:05:31.750> it<00:05:32.130> so<00:05:33.130> yeah

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
chunk there for beating it so yeah

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.250 
chunk there for beating it so yeah
that's<00:05:34.300> something<00:05:34.480> you<00:05:34.660> can<00:05:34.780> do<00:05:34.900> and<00:05:35.080> then<00:05:35.169> you

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
that's something you can do and then you

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.980 
that's something you can do and then you
just<00:05:35.290> can<00:05:35.710> hit<00:05:36.460> that<00:05:36.610> replay<00:05:36.940> button<00:05:37.240> and<00:05:37.780> just

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
just can hit that replay button and just

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.080 
just can hit that replay button and just
do<00:05:38.110> this<00:05:38.260> over<00:05:38.680> and<00:05:38.770> over<00:05:38.860> again<00:05:39.100> until<00:05:39.820> they

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
do this over and over again until they

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.490 
do this over and over again until they
patch<00:05:40.300> it<00:05:40.540> so<00:05:40.750> that's<00:05:41.110> why<00:05:41.230> I'm<00:05:41.320> uploading
