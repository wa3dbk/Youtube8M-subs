00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 computer assembly is extremely time - consuming 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.509
 and responsibly which is to avoid 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.010
 injuries at work from burned out 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.840
 parts better to charge 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.280
 whatever the professional 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.590
 this story we set ourselves a goal 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.299
 give you basic assembly tips a 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.340
 also tell you about things about which 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.789
 often forgotten even computer 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.850
 masters 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.740
 pleasant viewing case if you 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.019
 purchased a cheap case which is not 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.939
 good basic fan set then 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.949
 cooling can be made 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.990
 and independently it is important that the front 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.510
 the fan worked on blowing and so 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.059
 way cooled winchesters and back 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.739
 sure to blow you can put and 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.450
 additional cooling in other 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.480
 shells really deliver at the bottom 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.120
 enclosures and on the top wall in cheap on 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.320
 the side wall all this does not hurt but 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.480
 remember more fans more noise 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.610
 fan supply unit in the power supply 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.829
 must work skills 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.870
 roughly speaking when you install it 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.030
 see in our version of the assembly unit 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.129
 Power located at the bottom of the housing and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.589
 his fan looks accordingly 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.270
 answer recommend you also choose a block 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.280
 power supply with modular connection 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.530
 wires so you get rid of 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.080
 unnecessary clumps of black dude inside 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.150
 wire shells will not stupidly hang in 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.409
 their space is not necessary is not clear 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.759
 as well as it is not clear where to breed the motherboard 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.280
 let's start with the basics the motherboard should 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.100
 not directly attached with screws and housing 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.299
 with a special fist 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.979
 mostly they can be found just in 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.420
 kit body and they look 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.520
 in the following way 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.530
 as for connecting all of these 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.650
 small connectors that are responsible for 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.610
 computer restart button 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.830
 show the hard drive 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.619
 responsible for the work of yusbi connector here 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.689
 on highly recommend you detail 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.610
 study your maternal instruction manual 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.619
 motherboard all motherboards are different and 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.619
 it connects all that stuff the same way 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.189
 different process here its necessary 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.289
 set 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.659
 carefully so as not to bend 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.909
 Contact approval is relevant and 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.710
 replacing the processor installation process itself 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.960
 simple enough and do not leave 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.060
 user rights in manners and error and 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.850
 a little about akter mopar if you bet 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.160
 CPU with a regular cooler we pass already 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.049
 there is thermal grease and if you decide 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.880
 put on it is not a native cooler or 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.730
 replace the cooling then you 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.799
 first you need to erase the old to do it 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.840
 can any way you want in that 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.000
 including and with alcohol wipes 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.980
 the main thing is not to damage and the radiator is new 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.260
 apply a thin layer 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.100
 emphasize thin they are like some 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.780
 apply a layer of memory once if you 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.489
 use two memory bars then you 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.530
 it is necessary to insert them synchronous 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.420
 connectors they are indicated on the motherboard 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.670
 one color or as appropriate 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.810
 sign if we talk about rock then with 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.850
 probably ninety-nine 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.410
 percent synchronous connectors are located 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.579
 in your motherboard through one video card 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.900
 with its installation of special nuances 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.549
 should not arise 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.440
 unless surely do not forget 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.750
 check the number of power connectors on 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.390
 video card write off do not sit x wires 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.400
 which go from your power supply yet 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.769
 These contact tracks should be 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.959
 clean so try not to touch 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.170
 especially their hands and so the words apply and 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.130
 ram winchester one of 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.500
 the most important nuances of the main 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.150
 and the disk in order to avoid vibration is necessary 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.430
 put on the maximum amount 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.740
 bolts as for the sketch here everything 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.570
 depends on the body manufacturer someone 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.970
 offers complete iso adapters 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.680
 slots 2 and 5 inches by three and five. 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.200
 that is, with the surplus put in place 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.120
 standard disks and someone like in ours 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.950
 The specific case offers special 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.630
 baskets that can be placed 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.670
 most different parts of the body 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.430
 fasten scaffold disks are also necessary 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.290
 tightly and most importantly at the end of the assembly 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.420
 be sure to check the accuracy 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.670
 connect all power connectors 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.470
 otherwise the computer just won't start. 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.480
 We hope our short material will help 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.550
 you avoid fatal mistakes and not 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.860
 lets forget about a bunch of different little things 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.870
 who believe one way or another very 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.940
 often just fly out of my head even 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.940
 Professionals successful build you
