00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450 
does in fact float which is really cool
I<00:01:39.329> love<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.930> pontoons<00:01:40.560> allow<00:01:41.040> him<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
I love that the pontoons allow him to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.190 
I love that the pontoons allow him to
float<00:01:41.790> we're<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.780> need<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.079> him

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
float we're going to need to get him

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200 
float we're going to need to get him
filled<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.770> some<00:01:43.950> water<00:01:44.220> though<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
filled up with some water though and the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.170 
filled up with some water though and the
flames<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.439> also<00:01:46.710> float<00:01:47.280> unless

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
flames as you can see also float unless

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.060 
flames as you can see also float unless
they<00:01:48.390> are<00:01:48.479> submerged<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.350> which<00:01:49.560> case<00:01:49.799> they

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
they are submerged in which case they

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.340 
they are submerged in which case they
will<00:01:50.250> sink<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> bottom<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:52.049> what

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
will sink to the bottom so that's what

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.990 
will sink to the bottom so that's what
you're<00:01:52.530> supposed<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.860> do<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.610> got<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.790> try<00:01:53.939> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
you're supposed to do you got to try to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.280 
you're supposed to do you got to try to
douse<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.450> flames<00:01:54.689> as<00:01:54.930> they're<00:01:55.049> floating

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
douse the flames as they're floating

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.289 
douse the flames as they're floating
around<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:56.219> taking<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> little<00:01:56.670> dusty<00:01:57.090> let's

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
around you taking a little dusty let's

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.569 
around you taking a little dusty let's
get<00:01:57.509> him<00:01:57.689> all<00:01:57.899> filled<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.530> water<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.159> start

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
get him all filled with water and start

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.080 
get him all filled with water and start
squirting<00:02:00.360> down<00:02:00.689> flames

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
squirting down flames

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.700 
squirting down flames
alright<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.360> I've<00:02:03.450> got<00:02:03.659> him<00:02:03.840> all<00:02:03.990> submerged

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
alright so I've got him all submerged

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.089 
alright so I've got him all submerged
and<00:02:05.100> he's<00:02:05.340> got<00:02:05.610> some<00:02:05.820> water<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.479> him<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.099> let's

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
and he's got some water in him and let's

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.880 
and he's got some water in him and let's
just<00:02:08.459> try<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.759> hit<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> target<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:10.140> you

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
just try to hit the target now you

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.800 
just try to hit the target now you
simply<00:02:11.220> push<00:02:11.640> down<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:12.090> as<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.420> propeller

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
simply push down it as the propeller

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.990 
simply push down it as the propeller
spin

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
spin

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.710 
spin
you<00:02:15.000> repeat<00:02:15.450> he's<00:02:16.140> raining<00:02:16.709> water<00:02:17.040> depth<00:02:17.400> um

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
you repeat he's raining water depth um

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.320 
you repeat he's raining water depth um
until<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.840> can<00:02:18.989> eventually<00:02:19.459> sink<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.700> thing

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
until you can eventually sink that thing

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:30.770 
until you can eventually sink that thing
oh<00:02:21.590> come<00:02:22.590> on<00:02:29.180> okay<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.239> we<00:02:30.390> did<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.569> little

right<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:35.849> about<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.870> scoop<00:02:37.200> holes<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.769> you

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
right so about to scoop holes and you

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.190 
right so about to scoop holes and you
can<00:02:38.010> sink<00:02:38.940> some<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.239> your<00:02:39.360> little<00:02:39.599> floating

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
can sink some of your little floating

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.309 
can sink some of your little floating
flames<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:42.239> propeller<00:02:42.569> goes<00:02:42.780> too<00:02:43.080> so

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
flames and the propeller goes too so

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.910 
flames and the propeller goes too so
that's<00:02:43.500> equally<00:02:44.459> cool<00:02:48.500> thanks<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:49.590> tuning<00:02:49.709> in

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
little water toy I'm diggin it I like

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.830 
little water toy I'm diggin it I like
the<00:02:59.519> fact<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.910> well<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.360> don't<00:03:00.480> even<00:03:00.720> have

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
the fact that well you don't even have

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.120 
the fact that well you don't even have
to<00:03:00.930> use<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.380> water<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.799> still<00:03:02.010> get

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
to use it in the water and you still get

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.680 
to use it in the water and you still get
that<00:03:02.160> working<00:03:02.489> propeller<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.239> think<00:03:03.450> that's<00:03:03.599> a

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
that working propeller I think that's a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.839 
that working propeller I think that's a
very<00:03:03.959> cool<00:03:04.170> little<00:03:04.349> gimmick<00:03:04.739> but<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.430> do<00:03:05.549> love

the floating workable pontoons those
little<00:03:08.849> fire<00:03:09.090> things<00:03:09.690> are<00:03:09.900> cool<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.380> take<00:03:11.040> care
