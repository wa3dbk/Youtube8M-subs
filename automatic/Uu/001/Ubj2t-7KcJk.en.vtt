now those fog lights are kind of clear
in<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.360> corner<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.930> does<00:00:58.050> give<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> nice

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
in the corner so it does give a nice

also<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:01.289> bi-xenon<00:01:01.890> headlights<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.090> those

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
also the bi-xenon headlights so those

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.299 
also the bi-xenon headlights so those
headlights<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:03.870> high<00:01:04.379> beam<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.650> low<00:01:05.100> beam

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
lines much more formally designed and

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.289 
lines much more formally designed and
this<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.890> nice<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.430> note<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.670> well<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:18.030> will

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
this is nice to note as well this will

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.880 
this is nice to note as well this will
be<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> current<00:01:18.750> body<00:01:19.020> style<00:01:19.380> we're<00:01:19.560> working

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
be the current body style we're working

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.880 
be the current body style we're working
with<00:01:20.009> until<00:01:20.430> roughly<00:01:21.200> 2013<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.409> came<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.740> in

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
with until roughly 2013 this came out in

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.700 
with until roughly 2013 this came out in
2006<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.600> body<00:01:24.869> style<00:01:24.990> will<00:01:25.409> stay<00:01:25.590> like

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
2006 and that body style will stay like

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.679 
2006 and that body style will stay like
current<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.159> about<00:01:26.310> six<00:01:26.610> years<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.540> that

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
current for about six years and on that

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.770 
current for about six years and on that
seventh<00:01:28.110> year<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.680> production<00:01:29.070> update

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
seventh year have the production update

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.780 
seventh year have the production update
the<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:31.439> focused<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.890> lot<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.369> lighting

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
the they focused a lot on the lighting

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.210 
the they focused a lot on the lighting
so<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.270> door<00:01:33.659> handles<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.229> nice<00:01:35.009> little

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
so the door handles have nice little

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.190 
so the door handles have nice little
xenon<00:01:35.579> lights<00:01:36.329> underneath<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.020> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
xenon lights underneath there to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.870 
xenon lights underneath there to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
also not sure if the camera will show it

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.359 
also not sure if the camera will show it
from<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.869> angle<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.680> even<00:01:43.920> from<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.159> side

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
from this angle but even from the side

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.830 
from this angle but even from the side
you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> headlight<00:01:45.600> has<00:01:45.810> a
