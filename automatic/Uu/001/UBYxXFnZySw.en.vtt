was<00:03:15.599> blown<00:03:15.870> away<00:03:15.900> with<00:03:16.200> how<00:03:16.379> fast<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.069> and

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
was blown away with how fast it is and

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.039 
was blown away with how fast it is and
honestly<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.120> was<00:03:18.239> kind<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.599> first<00:03:18.810> time<00:03:19.019> I

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
honestly it was kind of the first time I

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.449

thinking<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:20.940> myself<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.599> could<00:03:21.900> actually<00:03:22.200> use

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
thinking to myself I could actually use

the capability to take advantage of that
so<00:03:56.310> that's<00:03:56.430> something<00:03:56.669> we<00:03:56.910> should<00:03:57.090> see<00:03:57.329> in<00:03:57.569> a

so that's something we should see in a
