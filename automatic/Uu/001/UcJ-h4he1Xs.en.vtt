00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
spring you have to get it to click into

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.439 
spring you have to get it to click into
here<00:04:11.129> into<00:04:11.969> that<00:04:12.209> little<00:04:12.510> notch<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.790> then<00:04:15.269> it

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
here into that little notch and then it

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.670 
here into that little notch and then it
also<00:04:15.780> has<00:04:16.139> to<00:04:16.320> be<00:04:16.349> into<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.009> notch<00:04:17.190> on<00:04:17.489> here

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
also has to be into the notch on here

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.990 
also has to be into the notch on here
like<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:19.709> said<00:04:19.769> every<00:04:20.310> time<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.609> press<00:04:20.820> that

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
like I said every time you press that

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.050 
like I said every time you press that
key<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.680> adjusts<00:04:22.680> this<00:04:22.860> so<00:04:23.580> then<00:04:23.759> it's<00:04:23.909> going

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
key it adjusts this so then it's going

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.460 
key it adjusts this so then it's going
to<00:04:24.120> chew<00:04:24.479> into<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.840> plastic<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.380> the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
to chew into that plastic and the

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.879 
to chew into that plastic and the
further<00:04:25.680> choosing<00:04:26.220> less<00:04:27.080> spring<00:04:28.080> it<00:04:28.199> has<00:04:28.229> so

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
further choosing less spring it has so

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.379 
further choosing less spring it has so
actually<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.280> spring<00:04:29.669> is<00:04:29.759> not<00:04:29.909> bad<00:04:30.120> when<00:04:30.300> you

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
actually the spring is not bad when you

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.830 
actually the spring is not bad when you
see<00:04:30.570> sinking<00:04:30.990> keys<00:04:31.639> so<00:04:32.639> this<00:04:33.180> is<00:04:33.360> very<00:04:33.570> tricky

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
see sinking keys so this is very tricky

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.760 
see sinking keys so this is very tricky
to<00:04:34.050> get<00:04:34.139> this<00:04:34.289> all<00:04:34.470> back<00:04:34.710> in

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.010 

there's<00:04:42.730> a<00:04:42.880> spring<00:04:43.210> down<00:04:43.330> here<00:04:43.570> if<00:04:43.720> you<00:04:43.810> can

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
there's a spring down here if you can

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.600 
there's a spring down here if you can
get<00:04:44.230> flat<00:04:44.470> head<00:04:44.650> under<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:44.980> it's<00:04:45.400> kind<00:04:45.580> of

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
get flat head under it it's kind of

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.150 
get flat head under it it's kind of
easier<00:04:45.940> if<00:04:46.060> you<00:04:46.120> push<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.480> key<00:04:46.690> down<00:04:47.130> get<00:04:48.130> a

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
easier if you push the key down get a

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.910 
easier if you push the key down get a
flat<00:04:48.430> head<00:04:48.670> under<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:49.090> spring<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:50.650> push

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
flat head under that spring and you push

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.840 
flat head under that spring and you push
it<00:04:51.070> up<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:54.690> release<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:56.050> tension<00:04:56.290> on<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:56.850> and

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
it up and release the tension on it and

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.520 
it up and release the tension on it and
that<00:04:58.000> will<00:04:58.120> come<00:04:58.300> out<00:04:58.390> just<00:04:58.720> be<00:04:59.200> carefully

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
that will come out just be carefully

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.810 
that will come out just be carefully
don't<00:04:59.680> put<00:04:59.800> too<00:04:59.950> much<00:05:00.070> tension<00:05:00.310> on<00:05:00.550> it'll

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
don't put too much tension on it'll

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.970 
don't put too much tension on it'll
break<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.420> then<00:05:02.170> the<00:05:02.290> key<00:05:02.470> just<00:05:02.710> kind<00:05:02.890> of

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
break and then the key just kind of

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:16.269 
break and then the key just kind of
pushes<00:05:03.640> up<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.060> out

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:16.279 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:20.439 

and<00:05:16.699> to<00:05:16.939> put<00:05:17.089> the<00:05:17.209> new<00:05:17.329> guy<00:05:17.599> in<00:05:17.679> just<00:05:19.149> back<00:05:20.149> in

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
and to put the new guy in just back in

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:26.589 
and to put the new guy in just back in
first<00:05:22.119> it<00:05:23.119> just<00:05:23.389> clicks<00:05:23.839> right<00:05:24.079> in<00:05:25.239> then<00:05:26.239> the

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
first it just clicks right in then the

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.749 
first it just clicks right in then the
fun<00:05:26.839> part<00:05:27.169> is<00:05:27.439> getting<00:05:27.739> this<00:05:28.149> spring<00:05:29.149> back<00:05:29.449> in

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
fun part is getting this spring back in

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:38.409 
fun part is getting this spring back in
inside<00:05:31.759> there<00:05:36.879> know<00:05:37.879> when<00:05:38.029> you<00:05:38.149> get<00:05:38.299> it

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
inside there know when you get it

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.509 
inside there know when you get it
because<00:05:38.479> this<00:05:38.719> top<00:05:39.109> black<00:05:39.469> thing<00:05:39.799> will<00:05:40.039> get

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:40.519 
because this top black thing will get

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:41.949 
because this top black thing will get
some<00:05:40.729> tension<00:05:40.969> on<00:05:41.269> it<00:05:41.299> and<00:05:41.599> then<00:05:41.689> it<00:05:41.809> won't

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:41.959 
some tension on it and then it won't

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:45.489 
some tension on it and then it won't
just<00:05:42.619> like<00:05:42.769> that<00:05:43.539> and<00:05:44.539> then<00:05:44.959> you<00:05:45.079> just<00:05:45.259> kind<00:05:45.469> of

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:45.499 
just like that and then you just kind of

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:48.600 
just like that and then you just kind of
push<00:05:45.679> it<00:05:45.709> in<00:05:46.539> and<00:05:47.539> just<00:05:47.869> make<00:05:47.959> sure<00:05:48.259> that<00:05:48.289> it's

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
push it in and just make sure that it's

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.369 
push it in and just make sure that it's
all<00:05:49.610> the<00:05:49.849> way<00:05:49.879> back<00:05:50.089> into<00:05:50.449> its<00:05:50.719> kind<00:05:51.169> of<00:05:51.199> ouch

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:51.379 
all the way back into its kind of ouch

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.569 
all the way back into its kind of ouch
there<00:05:51.709> and<00:05:52.699> these<00:05:53.479> are<00:05:53.539> used<00:05:53.929> keys<00:05:54.289> but<00:05:54.649> new<00:05:55.429> to

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:55.579 
there and these are used keys but new to

00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:58.539 
there and these are used keys but new to
this<00:05:55.699> keyboard<00:05:56.239> that<00:05:56.389> were<00:05:56.479> put<00:05:56.719> in<00:05:57.549> looks

00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:58.549 
this keyboard that were put in looks

00:05:58.549 --> 00:06:01.839 
this keyboard that were put in looks
like<00:05:58.729> it<00:05:58.879> it<00:05:59.659> held<00:05:59.899> pretty<00:06:00.169> good<00:06:00.409> there<00:06:00.789> so<00:06:01.789> you

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849 
like it it held pretty good there so you

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:03.579 
like it it held pretty good there so you
can<00:06:01.969> kind<00:06:02.149> of<00:06:02.209> see<00:06:02.389> that<00:06:02.539> we're<00:06:03.199> using<00:06:03.379> the

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:03.589 
can kind of see that we're using the

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:05.619 
can kind of see that we're using the
straight<00:06:03.979> edge<00:06:04.129> just<00:06:04.489> to<00:06:04.699> have<00:06:05.239> a<00:06:05.269> good<00:06:05.509> idea

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:05.629 
straight edge just to have a good idea

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:09.850 
straight edge just to have a good idea
of<00:06:05.869> how<00:06:05.959> some<00:06:06.919> keys<00:06:07.219> are<00:06:07.429> so<00:06:08.559> looks<00:06:09.559> like<00:06:09.589> we're

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
of how some keys are so looks like we're

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.709 
of how some keys are so looks like we're
good<00:06:11.889> this<00:06:12.889> is<00:06:13.069> a<00:06:13.099> tricky<00:06:13.489> part<00:06:13.669> to<00:06:13.939> get<00:06:14.569> this

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:14.719 
good this is a tricky part to get this

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:17.649 
good this is a tricky part to get this
back<00:06:14.929> in<00:06:14.959> you<00:06:15.799> can<00:06:16.159> take<00:06:16.669> all<00:06:16.939> these<00:06:17.209> screws

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
back in you can take all these screws

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:20.529 
back in you can take all these screws
out<00:06:17.869> to<00:06:18.229> do<00:06:18.379> this<00:06:18.529> but<00:06:18.739> I<00:06:18.769> found<00:06:19.039> I<00:06:19.609> can<00:06:20.329> do<00:06:20.449> it

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
out to do this but I found I can do it

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.439 
out to do this but I found I can do it
without<00:06:20.779> doing<00:06:21.110> that<00:06:21.999> kind<00:06:22.999> of<00:06:23.089> make<00:06:23.419> sure

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
without doing that kind of make sure

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.439 
without doing that kind of make sure
that<00:06:23.719> this<00:06:23.929> black<00:06:24.829> piece<00:06:25.129> is<00:06:25.429> lined<00:06:25.999> up<00:06:26.149> in<00:06:26.360> a

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 
that this black piece is lined up in a

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:31.860 
that this black piece is lined up in a
few<00:06:26.689> look<00:06:27.289> at<00:06:27.409> the<00:06:27.529> top

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.490 

you<00:06:31.960> can<00:06:32.310> kind<00:06:33.310> of<00:06:33.400> hold<00:06:33.610> pull<00:06:34.480> this<00:06:34.690> in<00:06:34.960> so<00:06:35.350> it

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
you can kind of hold pull this in so it

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.400 
you can kind of hold pull this in so it
doesn't<00:06:35.610> doesn't<00:06:36.610> go<00:06:36.820> anywhere<00:06:37.150> on<00:06:37.180> you<00:06:40.410> and

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
doesn't doesn't go anywhere on you and

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.620 
doesn't doesn't go anywhere on you and
this<00:06:41.680> is<00:06:41.800> kind<00:06:42.010> of<00:06:42.040> a<00:06:42.190> game<00:06:42.790> of<00:06:43.060> getting<00:06:43.480> the

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.630 
this is kind of a game of getting the

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.310 
this is kind of a game of getting the
feel<00:06:43.870> of<00:06:43.900> it<00:06:45.540> you'll<00:06:46.540> know<00:06:46.810> when<00:06:46.990> you're<00:06:47.140> onto
