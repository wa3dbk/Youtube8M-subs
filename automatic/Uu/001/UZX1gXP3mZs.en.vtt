00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
is trying to do a spline in my base um

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.570 
is trying to do a spline in my base um
it's<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.520> short<00:04:12.730> one<00:04:12.790> today<00:04:14.100> that's<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.280> spline

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
it's a short one today that's the spline

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.879 
it's a short one today that's the spline
rush<00:04:15.819> I<00:04:16.150> probably<00:04:16.630> did<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.900> wrong<00:04:17.019> but<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.739> work

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
for anyone who wants to be a dip like me

for anyone who wants to be a dip like me
you<00:04:25.540> basically<00:04:25.960> just<00:04:26.580> kinda<00:04:27.580> know<00:04:27.700> if<00:04:27.760> there's

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
you basically just kinda know if there's

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.450 
you basically just kinda know if there's
something<00:04:28.240> like<00:04:28.480> at<00:04:28.600> in<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:29.110> team<00:04:29.590> pull<00:04:30.100> and

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
something like at in a team pull and

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.830 
something like at in a team pull and
then<00:04:31.270> just<00:04:31.660> bring<00:04:32.440> over<00:04:32.830> one<00:04:33.100> or<00:04:33.130> two<00:04:33.370> drones

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
then just bring over one or two drones

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.990 
then just bring over one or two drones
shut<00:04:34.840> them<00:04:34.960> down<00:04:35.110> if<00:04:35.710> we<00:04:35.890> do<00:04:36.040> run<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.310> edge<00:04:36.700> I

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
shut them down if we do run the edge I

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.909 
shut them down if we do run the edge I
maybe<00:04:37.330> doesn't<00:04:37.600> work<00:04:37.690> anymore<00:04:37.900> right<00:04:38.740> on<00:04:38.830> the

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
maybe doesn't work anymore right on the

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.500 
maybe doesn't work anymore right on the
edge<00:04:38.980> of<00:04:39.040> the<00:04:39.160> creep<00:04:39.430> then<00:04:39.820> sometimes<00:04:40.270> I<00:04:40.360> don't

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
edge of the creep then sometimes I don't

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.719 
edge of the creep then sometimes I don't
see<00:04:40.690> it<00:04:41.400> anyway<00:04:42.400> that's<00:04:42.640> a<00:04:42.790> um<00:04:44.400> it's<00:04:45.400> today's

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
see it anyway that's a um it's today's

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.300 
see it anyway that's a um it's today's
thing<00:04:46.500> let<00:04:47.500> me<00:04:47.590> know<00:04:47.680> if<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:47.800> got<00:04:47.889> any<00:04:48.010> ideas

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
try already cheeses from a try and I'll

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.150 
try already cheeses from a try and I'll
do<00:04:54.340> that<00:04:55.590> until<00:04:56.590> then<00:04:58.500> may<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.620> dirt<00:04:59.830> be<00:04:59.979> with

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
do that until then may the dirt be with

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.340 
do that until then may the dirt be with
you
