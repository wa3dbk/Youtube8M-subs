00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
I've let it cool for a while because I

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.830 
I've let it cool for a while because I
do<00:02:58.740> want<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.100> ice<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.490> very<00:02:59.670> soon<00:03:00.030> but<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.540> wanted

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
do want to ice it very soon but I wanted

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.050 
do want to ice it very soon but I wanted
to<00:03:00.900> show<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.200> an<00:03:01.440> important<00:03:01.950> step<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.520> I

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
to show you an important step that I

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.390 
to show you an important step that I
always<00:03:03.630> do<00:03:03.900> before<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.530> turn<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.980> oven<00:03:05.130> off<00:03:05.340> and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
always do before I turn the oven off and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.340 
always do before I turn the oven off and
decide<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.210> cake<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.450> fully<00:03:06.840> baked<00:03:07.080> I

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
decide that the cake is fully baked I

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.250 
decide that the cake is fully baked I
take<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:07.980> long<00:03:08.220> toothpick<00:03:08.760> stick<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.870> right

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
take a long toothpick stick it right

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.800 
take a long toothpick stick it right
into<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.740> center<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.280> cake<00:03:11.520> pull<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.600> out

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
into the center of the cake pull it out

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.320 
into the center of the cake pull it out
and<00:03:13.110> if<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.800> comes<00:03:13.980> out<00:03:14.190> clean<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.880> know<00:03:15.000> that

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
and if it comes out clean I know that

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.540 
and if it comes out clean I know that
the<00:03:15.450> cake<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.720> fully<00:03:16.290> baked<00:03:16.500> if<00:03:16.800> there's<00:03:17.370> any

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
the cake is fully baked if there's any

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.340 
the cake is fully baked if there's any
batter<00:03:17.820> sticking<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.930> know<00:03:18.990> that<00:03:19.230> it

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
batter sticking to it I know that it

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.900 
batter sticking to it I know that it
needs<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.680> continue<00:03:20.010> baking<00:03:20.340> for<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.730> bit

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
needs to continue baking for a bit

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.670 
needs to continue baking for a bit
longer<00:03:21.150> because<00:03:21.450> not<00:03:21.900> all<00:03:22.050> of<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.290> batter<00:03:22.470> in

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
longer because not all of the batter in

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.440 
longer because not all of the batter in
the<00:03:22.800> center<00:03:23.100> has<00:03:23.280> turned<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.640> crumbs<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.240> so

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
the center has turned to crumbs and so

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.420 
the center has turned to crumbs and so
we're<00:03:24.630> ready<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.930> make<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.500> mocha<00:03:25.920> icing
