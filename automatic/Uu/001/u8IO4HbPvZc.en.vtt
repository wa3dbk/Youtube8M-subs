the<00:00:42.329> ground<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:42.899> could<00:00:43.050> show<00:00:43.260> them<00:00:43.469> exactly

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the ground so we could show them exactly

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.430 
the ground so we could show them exactly
what<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.480> around<00:00:45.539> them<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.320> was

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
what is going on around them it was

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740 
what is going on around them it was
magical<00:00:46.920> as<00:00:47.640> soon<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.059> camera<00:00:48.480> hit<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
ground I don't think he could have

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.119

women on the ground they usually get

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.730 
women on the ground they usually get
products<00:01:11.000> only<00:01:11.120> maybe<00:01:11.390> once<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:11.840> day<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.620> kind

of<00:01:12.860> see<00:01:13.010> where<00:01:13.160> the<00:01:13.250> fire<00:01:13.460> is<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.940> wind<00:01:14.120> gets

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
of see where the fire is the wind gets

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.360 
of see where the fire is the wind gets
on<00:01:14.570> it<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.110> does<00:01:15.380> things<00:01:15.740> that<00:01:15.860> we<00:01:16.070> can't

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
on it and it does things that we can't

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.310 
on it and it does things that we can't
predict<00:01:16.820> or<00:01:17.030> we<00:01:17.180> can't<00:01:17.450> see<00:01:17.690> because<00:01:17.900> we<00:01:18.140> don't

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
predict or we can't see because we don't

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.469 
predict or we can't see because we don't
have<00:01:18.380> good<00:01:18.890> visual<00:01:19.310> of<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.430> fire<00:01:19.730> we<00:01:20.090> can<00:01:20.270> give

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
have good visual of the fire we can give

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.350 
have good visual of the fire we can give
them<00:01:20.630> full<00:01:20.960> time<00:01:21.020> or<00:01:21.800> 24<00:01:22.280> hour<00:01:22.460> full<00:01:23.120> motion

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
them full time or 24 hour full motion

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.440 
them full time or 24 hour full motion
video<00:01:23.660> so<00:01:24.560> we<00:01:24.740> know<00:01:24.979> when<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.280> hot<00:01:25.460> spots<00:01:25.820> fire

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
video so we know when the hot spots fire

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.660 
video so we know when the hot spots fire
up<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.470> then<00:01:27.650> they<00:01:27.680> can<00:01:27.950> put<00:01:28.100> fire<00:01:28.340> crews

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
up and so then they can put fire crews

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.300 
up and so then they can put fire crews
on<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.300> to<00:01:29.630> stop<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.080> fire<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:30.950> knock<00:01:31.130> it

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310
