00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.879
 fifa fifteen video news 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.729
 because this time I left and released a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.670
 trailer talking once again about the 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:47.070
 new goalkeepers from fifa 11 guys already had 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.229
 a trailer previously released on 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.059
 this subject in which some 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.250
 news that goalkeepers will p and now 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.780
 they talk again on the theme of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.600
 goalkeepers who promise to be truly 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.039
 very differentiated in this fifth peak 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.410
 trailer starts with some defenses 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.140
 varied in various styles was already 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.720
 goal kick 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.789
 defense with the foot the goalkeeper look at the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.979
 goalkeeper corner booed and then they 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.080
 return to a larger intoned gameplay 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.060
 makes a play kick in the back goalkeeper 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.670
 can not stand there and the keeper of 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.380
 futsal by stretching the leg and prevents the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.659
 but they went for two angles well 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.390
 interesting this new model of defense 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.549
 who did not really have fifa on 14 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.829
 then they will throw in that round 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.810
 who is the goalkeeper of everton and in the selection 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.840
 American who say that the way 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.090
 and made a spectacular start for the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.130
 american selection in the world cup nÃ© 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.049
 the round I showed there talking a little 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.759
 how was this work to be able to 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.469
 create movements on the edge of 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.119
 reality for the carini goalkeepers is 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.009
 very interesting because every goalkeeper 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.829
 famous watch will have its 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.390
 and there in the game as well as 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.469
 line players are also 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.630
 showing some bids in which 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.340
 different goalkeepers use their 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.750
 characteristics to make the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.390
 defenses of those goalkeepers who have a 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.549
 ability to dominate the ball already 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.200
 fitting they show then they goalkeepers 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.700
 that has a lot of reflex they show 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.770
 also the way they do to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.090
 defend the ball as they close the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.619
 feathers for both lower legs 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.810
 How do they get out of the goal? 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.850
 How do they play headlamp too? 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.130
 in the case of the round again as they 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.989
 can get out of the goal like this to fit 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.880
 really the ball to the advance the 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.790
 attacker then they show all the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.190
 characteristics of each goalkeeper who goes 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.260
 passing the trailer guys so it's very 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.820
 cool this because they really are 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.829
 looking with other eyes more towards the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.270
 leaving goalkeeper goalkeepers of that fifa 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.100
 already was 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.660
 good but I'm making even better ones 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.800
 apparently 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.010
 and then they show an interesting scene 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.200
 that the raw ends up leading a group of 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.390
 under the legs they had already spoken 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.950
 I trained last that will have others 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.660
 seems to score goals 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.340
 depending on the characteristics of the 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.070
 goalies hit the goalkeeper who left a 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.690
 little more bad if it does not go so well 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.000
 of the goal will have a greater ease of 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.230
 take goals a little more bes, also in 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.360
 compensation to which goalkeepers who are 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.970
 top of the line harder to beat 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.660
 you have more complicated and you stick it 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.490
 that's right 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.110
 I'm telling you, a little about 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.900
 the animation of the goalkeepers to finish the 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.820
 trailer and this image really does 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.350
 for funk goalkeepers will be that 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.600
 really will come better is finding 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.830
 that will galera more realistic and they already 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.630
 said that each one will have his 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.730
 then this is the video of 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.470
 today talking about the goalkeepers there 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.780
 fifa whom I am very eager to play 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.980
 then let that liquid in video 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.500
 Favorite video and you guys are waiting. 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.180
 much that was also inserted and 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.060
 also comments what you found 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.700

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.190
 So that's it until the next fort.
