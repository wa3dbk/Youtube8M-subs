00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.650 

splits<00:00:09.870> then<00:00:10.050> filled<00:00:11.120> bakelite<00:00:12.120> clock<00:00:12.509> have

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
splits then filled bakelite clock have

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.780 
splits then filled bakelite clock have
just<00:00:12.840> finished<00:00:13.280> keeping<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.400> off<00:00:14.610> and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
just finished keeping this off and

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.310 
just finished keeping this off and
polishing<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:17.180> very<00:00:18.180> nice<00:00:18.449> indeed<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.930> love<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
polishing it very nice indeed I love the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.779 
polishing it very nice indeed I love the
shape<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.830> love<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> lines

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
shape of it love the lines

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.150 
shape of it love the lines
it's<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.810> mantel<00:00:22.170> clock<00:00:22.439> but<00:00:22.650> I've<00:00:22.740> got<00:00:22.890> on<00:00:22.980> top

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
it's a mantel clock but I've got on top

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.189 
it's a mantel clock but I've got on top
of<00:00:23.189> my<00:00:23.369> fridge

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
of my fridge

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.540 
of my fridge
most<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.320> my<00:00:25.350> baked<00:00:25.590> lights<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> kitchen

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
most of my baked lights in the kitchen

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.620 
most of my baked lights in the kitchen
has<00:00:26.670> been<00:00:26.699> previously<00:00:27.570> seen<00:00:32.180> yeah<00:00:33.180> very<00:00:33.450> nice

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
has been previously seen yeah very nice

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.709 
has been previously seen yeah very nice
thing<00:00:34.020> fully<00:00:34.290> mechanical<00:00:34.500> no<00:00:35.160> work

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
thing fully mechanical no work

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.049 
thing fully mechanical no work
electricity<00:00:36.719> area<00:00:36.960> anyway<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.649> steamed

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
electricity area anyway to be steamed

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.979 
electricity area anyway to be steamed
that<00:00:39.059> really<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> nice<00:00:39.750> finish<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.800> saying

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
that really is a nice finish just saying

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.369 
that really is a nice finish just saying
and<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:44.420> was<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.510> bit<00:00:45.629> confused<00:00:45.989> my<00:00:46.079> first

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and I was a bit confused my first

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.590 
and I was a bit confused my first
quarter<00:00:46.770> as<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.250> how<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> set<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.510> I

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
quarter as to how to set it because I

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.000 
quarter as to how to set it because I
thought<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.079> those<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.469> deceptive

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
thought one of those will be deceptive

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.930 
thought one of those will be deceptive
but<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.309> course<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.610> wouldn't<00:00:50.879> make

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
but then of course that wouldn't make

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.220 
but then of course that wouldn't make
sense<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> minute<00:00:51.930> hand<00:00:52.079> would

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
sense because the minute hand would

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
sense because the minute hand would
collide<00:00:52.559> both<00:00:53.100> those<00:00:53.340> are<00:00:53.520> actually<00:00:53.789> winders

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
collide both those are actually winders

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.170 
collide both those are actually winders
one<00:00:55.199> one's<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> actual<00:00:55.980> clock<00:00:56.280> mechanism<00:00:56.550> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
one one's the actual clock mechanism and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.090 
one one's the actual clock mechanism and
the<00:00:57.660> other<00:00:57.780> one's<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> mechanism<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the other one's the mechanism for the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.819 
the other one's the mechanism for the
chimes<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.879> got<00:01:00.000> an<00:01:00.059> actual<00:01:00.410> coiled<00:01:01.410> chime

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
chimes it's got an actual coiled chime

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.870 
chimes it's got an actual coiled chime
in<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> back<00:01:04.010> there's<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> key<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.670> as

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
in the back there's the key for it as

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.350 
in the back there's the key for it as
well<00:01:08.750> big<00:01:09.750> okay<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.580> there's<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.880> pendulum

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
well big okay and there's the pendulum

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
well big okay and there's the pendulum
going<00:01:12.540> inside<00:01:13.880> this<00:01:14.880> little<00:01:15.080> hammer<00:01:16.080> I'll

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
going inside this little hammer I'll

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.109 
going inside this little hammer I'll
strike<00:01:16.740> or<00:01:16.979> whatever<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.430> called<00:01:17.670> knows<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
strike or whatever that called knows to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.870 
strike or whatever that called knows to
chime<00:01:18.860> quite<00:01:19.860> tidy<00:01:20.130> condition<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> bit

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
chime quite tidy condition it's a bit

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.280 
chime quite tidy condition it's a bit
dusty<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.299> there<00:01:21.420> I've<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.630> clean<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> inside

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
dusty in there I've not clean the inside

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.289 
dusty in there I've not clean the inside
of<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.590> yeah<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.950> love<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> dismantle<00:01:24.060> all<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
of it yeah I love it a dismantle all the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.660 
of it yeah I love it a dismantle all the
clock<00:01:24.509> because<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.110> clock<00:01:25.409> maker<00:01:25.680> you

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
clock because I'm not a clock maker you

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.890 
clock because I'm not a clock maker you
know<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:27.090> more<00:01:27.240> comfortable<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:27.869> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
know I'm more comfortable with a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.990 
know I'm more comfortable with a
soldering<00:01:28.409> iron<00:01:28.560> than<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.000> watchmakers

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
soldering iron than a watchmakers

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.830 
soldering iron than a watchmakers
screwdriver

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
screwdriver

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.950 
screwdriver
I<00:01:31.020> didn't<00:01:31.890> polish<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.280> back<00:01:32.520> door<00:01:32.960> shameful

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
I didn't polish that back door shameful

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.270 
I didn't polish that back door shameful
that's<00:01:34.170> what<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.320> looked<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.619> all<00:01:34.890> over<00:01:35.189> when

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
that's what it looked like all over when

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.030 
that's what it looked like all over when
I<00:01:35.340> got<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.140> that's<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> back<00:01:37.439> soap<00:01:37.740> opera

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
I got it that that's the back soap opera

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.330 
I got it that that's the back soap opera
I'll<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.990> set<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> by<00:01:40.500> manually<00:01:41.130> moving

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
I'll just you set it by manually moving

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.100 
I'll just you set it by manually moving
the<00:01:41.549> minute<00:01:41.790> hand<00:01:41.970> I'll<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.329> move<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.810> six

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the minute hand I'll just move it to six

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.569 
the minute hand I'll just move it to six
o'clock<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.860> see<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.220> charm

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
o'clock so you can see that charm

00:01:44.579 --> 00:02:06.220 
o'clock so you can see that charm
working

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.670 

heee<00:02:09.940> you're<00:02:10.940> just<00:02:11.270> it<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:11.750> can<00:02:12.230> make<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.620> you

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
heee you're just it you can make it you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.170 
heee you're just it you can make it you
can<00:02:12.830> get<00:02:12.980> these<00:02:13.130> very<00:02:13.430> accurate<00:02:13.910> if<00:02:14.060> you've

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
can get these very accurate if you've

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.760 
can get these very accurate if you've
got<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.480> time<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.960> patience<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.470> do<00:02:15.650> it

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
got the time and the patience to do it

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.650 
got the time and the patience to do it
as<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.980> little<00:02:16.130> than<00:02:16.700> whether<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.000> can<00:02:17.150> sear<00:02:17.450> on

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
as a little than whether you can sear on

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.120 
as a little than whether you can sear on
the<00:02:17.930> on<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.290> pendulum<00:02:18.680> there's<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.920> little

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
the on the pendulum there's a little

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.520 
the on the pendulum there's a little
dial<00:02:19.460> you<00:02:19.760> can<00:02:19.910> turn<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:20.930> moves<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
dial you can turn and that moves the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.530 
dial you can turn and that moves the
pendant<00:02:21.920> up<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.280> down<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.730> arm<00:02:23.180> they're

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
pendant up and down that arm they're

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.940 
pendant up and down that arm they're
slightly<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:23.990> obviously<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.470> horror<00:02:24.710> of<00:02:24.770> it
