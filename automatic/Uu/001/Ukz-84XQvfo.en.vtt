00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.760
 we are with a new video tutorial and the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.290
 today we will try to capture all the 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.420
 content of a directory or folder 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.730
 I have a small list that we can 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.369
 later print 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.439
 if for example we need to have everything 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.430
 this content in a file for 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.680
 then print it 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.480
 most people what they would do is 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.190
 make a capture with print the screen 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.370
 the key that we have so 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.290
 default for this type of task 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.540
 I understand that later 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.090
 we would recover said image or said 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.950
 list in paint 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.240
 there is another alternative that many 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.280
 people could become 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.520
 assuming that is the list that 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.800
 we need to print what many would do 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.370
 people is the call of the tool 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.370
 cuts 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.590
 with cuts we will simply select 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.240
 the area where this is 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.970
 listing or the content of our 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.729
 folder and then we will save it 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.620
 in paint and from there doing this 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.750
 printer I think that is what happens 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.370
 the tool cuts has not achieved 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.950
 capture all the content of this 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.530
 folder here we can see the bar 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.890
 slider that is half-way so 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.020
 the work would not be complete I'm going to 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.730
 explain a better method that we could 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.890
 get to implement to have this 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.740
 listed in a simple text document 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.270
 that's what we'll go back to my 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.340
 original status on my computer 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.720
 the method is applied to any 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.540
 folder or directory with content 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.430
 we go back to our folder 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.600
 original we change the view 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.630
 to details 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.439
 in any empty space we have 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.700
 pressed shift key and subsequently 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.440
 we click with the right button of 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.170
 our mouse to be able to see the menus 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.649
 contextual of all of them 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.370
 we choose the one that says open window of 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.370
 commands here 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.360
 we have opened a command terminal and 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.780
 here the only thing we need to do is 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.930
 write the appropriate sentence for it 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.930
 we simply visit dir directory 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.459
 the sign of greater or soon 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.439
 and the name of the file that we want that 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.710
 is generated with the content listing 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:44.600
 from this folder 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:48.850
 I could put as an example 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.850
 the txt dot listing 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.819
 and press the enter key 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.510
 we minimize this screen 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.049
 we look and it has been created 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.109
 our text file called 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.209
 txt listing we double click and 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.650
 we can effectively see that all the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.930
 content of our folder or 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.150
 directory has become a 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.980
 small listing within this document 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.650
 in which we will have the possibility 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.360
 to send it to print 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.040
 that's all I hope you liked 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.689
 this video tutorial and very soon 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.230
 we will be with another new topic for 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.230
 share
