comparison here's the original TARDIS

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.550 
comparison here's the original TARDIS
and<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:10.200> looks<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.500> same<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.570> yeah<00:02:12.570> that's

window<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.420> look<00:02:15.720> out<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.860> get

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
window to look out of and you get

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.520 
window to look out of and you get
teleported<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.000> place<00:02:18.330> which<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.410> can

teleported in this place which you can
obviously<00:02:19.770> control<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.160> TARDIS<00:02:20.490> in<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.570> know

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
obviously control the TARDIS in you know
