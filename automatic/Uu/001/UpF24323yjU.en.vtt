00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.439
 so here we spent a 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.980
 hair dryer simply see for 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.930
 rush to warm the metal then we 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.570
 is obliged to make a stab 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.699
 to remove any rill which 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.070
 can stay but the former of the last 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.780
 molding here we are going to start mill the 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.059
 wetting is to apply a 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.400
 light layer with a brush is this 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.080
 layer there that for me in my 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.989
 chocolate mold design goes 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.140
 to be done if dick is mostly synonymous 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.870
 of brilliance gathered 2 both 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.620
 the two cocks here we are going to install this 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.620
 called tongs 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.159
 we will fill completely we will 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.479
 lightly tapped to avoid bubbles 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.670
 inside so will fill it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.049
 the viscosity so the thickness of the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.610
 chocolate will do that part of the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.390
 chocolate will stay when we go back 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.530
 the mold and his skis bag and that's what 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.950
 will constitute and determine the thickness 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:29.310
 of a mold we will let it cool 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.810
 so here we go and beard and the way of 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.530
 beards and is simple one removes 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.119
 the surplus with a shop like a 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.649
 palette where it can be with a 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.960
 knife and one raises 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.420
 all this part there that starts to 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.929
 to be let's say semi semi-rigid 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.400
 here are her tears in the presence of one of a 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:53.390
 molding is ready to 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:58.880
 to see his second strain we use a 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.100
 small rack and drainer and then 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.660
 their cause flat mold as I 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.870
 said just now must be tempered 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.140
 in contact with the hand we must not feel 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.210
 the cold of the metal the temperature of the 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.200
 chocolate for milk chocolate is 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.960
 exactly 29 degrees once the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.060
 that the mussels were thus molded and 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.970
 chocolate they have their good thickness 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.530
 we will spend them in a phase of 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.220
 cooling is here so we go the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.220
 current patients 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:34.849
 then there you attend the demolding of the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.590
 fish than when the whole mold to 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:42.379
 the hour so before arriving at this 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.090
 phase there the chocolate goes cold 10 mans 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.629
 what's called retract and 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.010
 only if the chocolate is well 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.389
 cooled he 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.389
 it takes place by itself
