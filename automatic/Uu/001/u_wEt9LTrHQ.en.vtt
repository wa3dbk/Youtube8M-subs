problems with this ROM because this ROM

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.120 
problems with this ROM because this ROM
is<00:00:15.000> actually<00:00:15.599> based<00:00:15.839> off<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.350> Nexus<00:00:16.830> 4

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
is actually based off the Nexus 4

is actually based off the Nexus 4
factory<00:00:17.730> image<00:00:18.000> released<00:00:18.480> by<00:00:18.690> Google<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.619> yes

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
factory image released by Google so yes

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.470

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
from the ground up it's actually built

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.470

by the Nexus 4 stock factory images but

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.240 
by the Nexus 4 stock factory images but
what<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> developer<00:00:25.199> did<00:00:25.410> instead<00:00:26.010> of

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
what the developer did instead of

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.009 
what the developer did instead of
actually<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.730> ahead<00:00:26.880> importing<00:00:27.480> all<00:00:27.720> all

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019

the images and everything over from the
Nexus<00:00:29.970> 5<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.420> Nexus<00:00:30.660> 4<00:00:30.929> was<00:00:31.500> instead

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
Nexus 5 to the Nexus 4 was instead

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.310 
Nexus 5 to the Nexus 4 was instead
building<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> Nexus<00:00:32.759> 4<00:00:32.940> image<00:00:33.420> from<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
building the Nexus 4 image from the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.500 
building the Nexus 4 image from the
Google<00:00:34.710> servers<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.430> then<00:00:35.940> went<00:00:36.180> ahead<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
Google servers and then went ahead and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.869 
Google servers and then went ahead and
ported<00:00:37.110> over<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.500> launchers<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.250> Nexus<00:00:38.700> 5

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
ported over the launchers and Nexus 5

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
ported over the launchers and Nexus 5
features<00:00:39.450> over<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.500> Nexus<00:00:40.770> 4<00:00:41.129> that

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
features over to the Nexus 4 that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.639 
features over to the Nexus 4 that
weren't<00:00:41.760> originally<00:00:42.000> included<00:00:42.620> so<00:00:43.620> this

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
weren't originally included so this

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.010 
weren't originally included so this
isn't<00:00:44.040> being<00:00:44.160> insanely<00:00:44.730> stable<00:00:45.420> compared<00:00:45.899> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
isn't being insanely stable compared to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.319 
isn't being insanely stable compared to
your<00:00:46.170> previous<00:00:46.410> ports<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.149> this

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
your previous ports and all that so this

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.600 
your previous ports and all that so this
latest<00:00:48.750> version<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.309> was<00:00:50.399> released

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
latest version the one that was released

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.150 
latest version the one that was released
on<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> 16th<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.960> damn<00:00:52.110> recording<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.860> um

build<00:01:15.360> number<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.170> what<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.439> will

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
build number so that is what you will

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.289 
build number so that is what you will
really<00:01:16.650> want<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.460> proof<00:01:17.759> right<00:01:18.060> -

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
try it again it doesn't work so you have

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.360 
try it again it doesn't work so you have
to<00:03:09.960> do<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.320> couple<00:03:10.620> times<00:03:10.950> before<00:03:11.160> it

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
to do it a couple times before it

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.430 
to do it a couple times before it
actually<00:03:11.430> does<00:03:11.730> work<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.540> Google<00:03:13.050> command

actually does work of the Google command

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.470 
actually does work of the Google command

I'm<00:03:15.690> having<00:03:15.750> okay<00:03:16.430> Google<00:03:17.430> what<00:03:18.270> time<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.630> it

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.430 

okay<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.000> actually<00:03:24.450> how<00:03:24.780> was<00:03:24.930> wrong<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:25.230> guess

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
okay so actually how was wrong I guess

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.070 
okay so actually how was wrong I guess
before<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.460> tried<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:26.970> twice<00:03:27.240> right<00:03:27.600> away<00:03:27.840> one

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
before I tried it twice right away one

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.810 
before I tried it twice right away one
after<00:03:28.350> another<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.310> second<00:03:29.640> time<00:03:29.790> it

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
after another and the second time it

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.910 
after another and the second time it
really<00:03:30.150> didn't<00:03:30.420> work<00:03:30.660> um<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.080> guess<00:03:31.140> um<00:03:31.680> that

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
really didn't work um I guess um that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.650 
really didn't work um I guess um that
