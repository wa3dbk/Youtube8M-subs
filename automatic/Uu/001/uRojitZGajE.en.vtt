00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.070
 eric it's been a little over a year since the 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.380
 silverado and trails and I love this 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.509
 truck there on your side how was the 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.460
 first year frankly it was a 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.660
 very nice year for the silverado we have 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.220
 spent a lot of time developing it 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.919
 and the response of the public and the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.140
 criticism was very good actually he has 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.840
 been proclaimed truck of the year 2014 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.460
 and we are very proud of it 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.770
 you and chevrolet it's a good job 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.310
 and I'm sure you have plenty of 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.320
 things to say 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.850
 tell me peace of the truck that's the 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.470
 rail country is a level 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.600
 of equipment that was designed having 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.640
 debt luxury and robustness it comes with 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.710
 a distinctive bumper grille 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.480
 of colors and rouen chrome luxury of 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.660
 chrome footboards and an interior in 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.340
 brown leather excuses apart from 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.690
 aesthetic improvements every 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.100
 characteristics that we will see are 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.579
 offered throughout our range of 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.390
 light duty trucks and buy 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.369
 obviously as it is a truck that 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.689
 must be ready for anything we took care of 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.859
 to bring the cashier lining in usi 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.380
 now ah yes I would like you 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:16.600
 loyal tries ok just a hand drawn 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.560
 drop your on the drop 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.420
 sure and certain this is our tailgate is i 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.979
 left low available as an option 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.749
 you will notice that there are others 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.549
 practical elements in the box we have 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:29.740
 detachable lashing hooks and 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.859
 the optional LED lighting we are 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.630
 been designed to facilitate loading 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.639
 gold james there are plenty of features 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.200
 interesting but my favorite is the 

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:39.819
 Foot integrated into the bumper for 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.520
 to access the cash register you are starting to be 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.079
 less flexible in fact this is one of 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.479
 most distinctive features of the 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.069
 truck you know it's the sum of 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.359
 characteristics like that that make it the 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.240
 the most innovative box we have 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.159
 made so far 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.990
 it may be boasting but I 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.880
 have to say that our 5-point engine 3 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.130
 optional liters if america the most 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.850
 energy efficient offered in a pick up and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.470
 for 2015 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.560
 we added something else let me 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.390
 guess a sink not really actually 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.619
 that flaws flaws and the silverado and 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.420
 the first full size pick up 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.989
 offer the white flight 4g lte and to 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.519
 to integrate 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.250
 it's something that is not even 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.260
 do it by the competition in addition it's 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.959
 very easy to use as the wall 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.819
 fault at home was really good 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.610
 past that will help a lot of people 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.920
 frankly if I did not already have 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.450
 will buy what is good is that the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.430
 silverado and the truck with the lowest 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.489
 overall acquisition cost in 2014 according to 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.000
 fine centric and that we are really 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.280
 very proud really is the pick up who 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.440
 received the most awards in 2014 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.600

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.860
