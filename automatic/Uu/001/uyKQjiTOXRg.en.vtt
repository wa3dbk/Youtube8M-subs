00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.859 
just one arm specially modified his body
this<00:01:42.710> is<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.219> push<00:01:43.460> cable<00:01:43.759> because<00:01:44.719> it's

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
this is the push cable because it's

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.840 
this is the push cable because it's
flipped<00:01:45.109> upside<00:01:45.530> down<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:46.130> backwards<00:01:46.369> from

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
flipped upside down and backwards from

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.319 
flipped upside down and backwards from
where<00:01:46.969> it<00:01:47.030> would<00:01:47.179> be<00:01:47.210> on<00:01:47.420> this<00:01:47.600> bar<00:01:47.869> I<00:01:49.179> had<00:01:50.179> to

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
where it would be on this bar I had to

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.059 
where it would be on this bar I had to
flip<00:01:50.509> everything<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:51.170> had<00:01:51.289> to<00:01:51.380> use<00:01:51.859> the

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
flip everything I had to use the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.730 
flip everything I had to use the
opposite<00:01:52.850> cable<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.329> make<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.659> pool<00:01:53.899> but<00:01:54.350> it

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
opposite cable to make it pool but it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.880 
opposite cable to make it pool but it
works<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:55.850> snaps<00:01:56.090> back<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:56.990> that's<00:01:59.770> kept<00:02:00.770> my

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
works and snaps back so that's kept my

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.800 
works and snaps back so that's kept my
clutch<00:02:01.159> in<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.640> same<00:02:01.850> place<00:02:02.149> I<00:02:02.359> just<00:02:02.390> dropped

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
clutch in the same place I just dropped

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.459 
clutch in the same place I just dropped
it<00:02:03.020> lower<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:03.859> I'm<00:02:03.950> caught<00:02:04.159> like<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:05.469> and

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
it lower so I'm caught like that and
