00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.390
 Hi, I'm a month and today I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:14.410
 about this new acquisition in my life 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:18.520
 and I'm going to tell you where I went and where 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.360
 how much it hurt and the recovery and 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.860
 all those things that you need to know 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.890
 I say if you want to do or not ever 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.480
 or something like that and then also like to 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.980
 share my experience and so because 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.319
 for me it was very very useful when before 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.309
 that would make me watch videos of people in 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:38.469
 Youtube 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.230
 that he had done it and how 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:44.690
 care they had 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.219
 how much it hurt them and so I do not know for 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.539
 I was very useful then maybe this 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.320
 video will also come to serve you 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.570
 someone and well I had a lot 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.269
 time wanting to performate in 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.269
 the septum which is what it's called 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.030
 and I decided like out of the blue one day I said 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.920
 on my birthday in fact I said is my 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.909
 I have money, I'm going to make it 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.439
 because there and the place where I had 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.100
 perforations two by one 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.340
 then I did this and I did this 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.080
 another as the second eye because of the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.479
 another side already had two and this side 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.690
 I only had one then I decided to match 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.690
 the but again the point of the video 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.230
 if the crazy ones can not decide that what 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.360
 I decided with nothing else because I had a lot 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.130
 time wanting to do it and I saw many 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.970
 many videos of people like them 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.100
 saying before on youtube to be 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.100
 as prepared and mentalized 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.060
 the piercing boy who did this to me 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.610
 to me he is a very kind person of much 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.280
 A lot of confidence made me feel very 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.560
 quiet very safe very comfortable all the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.840
 time because sometimes some 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.700
 drillers I do not say that all or the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.660
 most for nothing, I just had to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.920
 some are like that just a little clowns 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.890
 or 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.739
 they have like this vibrates like super 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.760
 awesome then one goes all scared 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.530
 and it does not help 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.600
 Adam 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.850
 the boy that I was but it was not like that for 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.920
 nothing is a very kind person I 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.600
 I know from before because I met him in 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.170
 a concert 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.790
 that's why I also decided to go with him because 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.250
 I had already been recommended to people with him 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.230
 and because I already knew him and I think that 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.510
 is a person of confidence I am going to 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.540
 leave the link to your bottom 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.820
 facebook page so that if they live in 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.800
 querÃ©taro or somewhere nearby what 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.230
 can visit is a very very person 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.740
 professional and does excellently well 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.420
 his work 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.700
 one of the things that I precisely 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.400
 I wanted is that I did not want it too low and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.810
 I also wanted the piece to be 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.840
 as especially open so I can 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.210
 do it up or down in the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.870
 moment in which I official and he 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.870
 commissioned that 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.750
 adjust the piece to my nose 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.270
 and put it exactly in place in the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.580
 that I wanted to live up to what I wanted 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.870
 If I liked it very much, like how I 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.950
 he left the earring 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.860
 regarding the level of pain 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.080
 I also have a pierced tongue and 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.200
 ears 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.540
 I think this is honestly the one that most 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.810
 it hurt me but really the one of the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.900
 ears and the tongue did not hurt 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.620
 basically nothing then this yes I 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.409
 did it hurt 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.150
 quite nothing nothing too much in their 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.150
 portals and I am very very very squeaky 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.500
 but if nothing was unbearable nothing 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.769
 made the hole or be good when I 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.599
 he made the hole it did not hurt me so much what 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.360
 it hurt me more was when I passed the 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.510
 piece because as it is round it is 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.019
 a bit difficult and you have to move and 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.769
 so that hurt me but more like 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.290
 because I had sensitive as 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.060
 the area at that time 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.300
 Y 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.730
 really out of that it hurt me in the 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.350
 moment when the needle passed when 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.800
 I pass the earring and that's why it did not come back 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.500
 to hurt 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.509
 Just in case it was a bit terrible for me 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.840
 first as a week and a half after 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.270
 have drilled it 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.630
 because every time I do with a 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.600
 piercing me sick gives me cold like 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.160
 that my body is stressed and they lower me 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.600
 the defenses and then I get sick 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.389
 always always happens to me then 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.440
 If I get sick with the flu and have a cold with 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:08.110
 a new hole in the nose is not 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.960
 fun was pretty hard enough 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.479
 I had to invent myself in a whole method 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.360
 to be able to blow my nose without me 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:19.050
 hurt or without hurting or without putting 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.900
 how recovery is in danger 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.470
 and good what I did for the 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.720
 recovery was that I washed with water 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.599
 and soap three times a day in the morning 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.159
 in the afternoon and in the evening I tried 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.699
 have it always the most clean 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:39.110
 possible not to touch her at all if she had 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:42.210
 dirty hands or whatever 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.819
 I touched it if I had just washed my 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.360
 hands perfectly and after washing 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:51.470
 the every time I dried myself and I put a 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.600
 little bit of solution isodine 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.380
 and the move from side to side so you do not 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.860
 it was like hitting after a 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:04.520
 week and small piece starts to be done as 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.580
 a kind of scab around and that 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:12.110
 It hurts so much it hurts like the hole in 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.970
 yes but the crust move and hurt you 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.070
 the skin of the nose because it is very 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.710
 sensitive 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.890
 then that can be like most 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:25.190
 terrible then what I was doing was 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:28.130
 grab a fret cited and fill it with 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.780
 enough hot water 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.540
 hot but not too much for 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.780
 burn me and put my nose 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.340
 a little while there to loosen the 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.830
 rib and can be removed with a 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:44.400
 cotonete and being able to move the piece 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.860
 already like that it did not bother me anymore because the worst 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.580
 What you can do is leave that crust there 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:53.100
 because it has to be removed 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:55.670
 and that more than more 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:59.330
 I think that really was 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:02.510
 all after a week and I think 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:05.780
 it had a coastline and that was a bit 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:09.710
 uncomfortable game happen now I can 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:13.460
 how to move it perfectly and not 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:16.160
 everything with clean is already has more 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.500
 of 2 months I did it and they told me 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.360
 that two months was like the time of 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.860
 recovery so that it was already 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.110
 totally healed the wound 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.030
 then it is assumed that at this time 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.030
 is already fully healed is already 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.680
 totally closed and could already change 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.750
 I did the piece and everything but the truth is that 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.500
 I am quite happy with this piece 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:40.689
 what I bring I do not want anything too much 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.460
 striking or anything I like as it is and 

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:45.040
 I think I'm going to stay with this piece 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:48.880
 a good time more 

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.530
 and if I think that's basically all of 

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.170
 again I remind you that below I will leave 

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:56.130
 the facebook page of the study 

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:59.640
 the boy who did the punching 

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:02.290
