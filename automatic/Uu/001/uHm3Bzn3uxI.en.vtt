we see a written flat now an important
rule<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.589> remember<00:00:44.710> is<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:46.300> any<00:00:46.809> sharp<00:00:47.710> or

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
rule to remember is that any sharp or

example a flat carries through the

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.180

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.469 
measure let's look down here for a
better<00:01:00.399> example<00:01:02.909> looking<00:01:03.909> at<00:01:04.030> this<00:01:04.150> measure

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
better example looking at this measure

better example looking at this measure
the<00:01:05.110> notes<00:01:05.379> between<00:01:05.680> two<00:01:06.640> vertical<00:01:07.090> lines<00:01:07.740> we

the notes between two vertical lines we

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.900 
the notes between two vertical lines we
see<00:01:09.040> an<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.550> sharp<00:01:10.030> appear<00:01:10.750> as<00:01:11.700> soon<00:01:12.700> as<00:01:12.790> that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
see an a sharp appear as soon as that

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
see an a sharp appear as soon as that
first<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.510> sharp<00:01:13.900> appears<00:01:14.730> we<00:01:15.730> know<00:01:15.940> that<00:01:16.300> every

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
first a sharp appears we know that every

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.010 
first a sharp appears we know that every
other<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.590> that<00:01:18.160> appears<00:01:18.610> in<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.030> measure<00:01:19.240> will

other a that appears in the measure will

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.150 
other a that appears in the measure will
also<00:01:20.560> be<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:20.860> sharp<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.810> this<00:01:23.170> would<00:01:23.920> actually

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
also be a sharp so this would actually

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.770 
also be a sharp so this would actually
be<00:01:24.460> an<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:25.930> sharp<00:01:26.260> and<00:01:26.500> an<00:01:27.340> eight<00:01:27.580> sharp<00:01:27.910> even

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
be an a sharp and an eight sharp even

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.780 
be an a sharp and an eight sharp even
though<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.770> sharp<00:01:30.040> is<00:01:30.190> only<00:01:30.340> written<00:01:30.610> the

first time now if for example a composer
does<00:01:36.460> not<00:01:36.730> want<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.510> sharp<00:01:38.380> or<00:01:38.530> flat<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.890> carry

through the measure he or she might

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.260 
through the measure he or she might
write<00:01:42.730> a<00:01:42.880> natural<00:01:43.480> sign<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:44.320> remind<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.980> reader

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
write a natural sign to remind a reader

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.450 
write a natural sign to remind a reader
of<00:01:46.530> his<00:01:47.530> intentions<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:49.210> here<00:01:49.480> for<00:01:49.510> example<00:01:49.690> we

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
of his intentions so here for example we

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.690 
of his intentions so here for example we
have<00:01:51.460> an<00:01:51.550> A<00:01:51.670> flat<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.650> then<00:01:53.650> a<00:01:53.950> natural<00:01:54.490> and

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
have an A flat and then a natural and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.080 
have an A flat and then a natural and
all<00:01:55.060> that<00:01:55.420> natural<00:01:55.690> means<00:01:56.230> is<00:01:56.760> that<00:01:57.760> there<00:01:58.000> is

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
all that natural means is that there is

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.510 
all that natural means is that there is
no<00:01:58.120> flat<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:58.840> there<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.050> no<00:01:59.260> sharp<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.950> just<00:02:00.370> a

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
no flat and there is no sharp is just a

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.570 
no flat and there is no sharp is just a
regular<00:02:00.760> a<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:02.350> here<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.650> composer<00:02:03.010> had<00:02:03.400> to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
regular a so here the composer had to

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.000 
regular a so here the composer had to
put<00:02:03.760> in<00:02:03.909> a<00:02:03.970> natural<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:05.470> reader<00:02:05.770> knows

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
put in a natural so that a reader knows

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.650

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
a new measure has begun so we know this

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.500 
a new measure has begun so we know this
C<00:02:28.709> will<00:02:28.859> be<00:02:28.889> a<00:02:28.980> regular<00:02:29.189> one<00:02:29.609> the<00:02:30.120> composer

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
C will be a regular one the composer

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.629 
C will be a regular one the composer
helps<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.109> out<00:02:31.139> by<00:02:31.469> writing<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.889> natural<00:02:32.400> to

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
helps you out by writing a natural to

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.170 
helps you out by writing a natural to
remind<00:02:32.969> you<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.389> this<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.379> just<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.980> plain<00:02:35.430> see
