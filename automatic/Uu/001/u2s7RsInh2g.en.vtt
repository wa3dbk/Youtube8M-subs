almost<00:00:41.319> reminds<00:00:41.679> me<00:00:41.769> of<00:00:41.859> flax<00:00:42.159> seed<00:00:42.429> gel<00:00:42.460> if

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
almost reminds me of flax seed gel if

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.459 
almost reminds me of flax seed gel if
you<00:00:43.269> know<00:00:43.390> what<00:00:43.539> that<00:00:43.690> is<00:00:43.870> and<00:00:44.079> that's<00:00:44.170> kind<00:00:44.440> of

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
you know what that is and that's kind of

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.849 
you know what that is and that's kind of
the<00:00:44.589> consistency<00:00:44.920> it<00:00:45.699> comes<00:00:45.940> in<00:00:46.059> a<00:00:46.120> pump<00:00:46.859> and

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
the consistency it comes in a pump and

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.200 
the consistency it comes in a pump and

me get my curl definition poppin as much

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.010 
me get my curl definition poppin as much
as<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.340> can<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.030> use<00:01:28.240> a<00:01:28.270> timing<00:01:28.539> brush<00:01:28.840> in

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
as I can so I use a timing brush in

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.740 
as I can so I use a timing brush in
small<00:01:29.259> sections<00:01:29.500> -<00:01:30.219> you<00:01:30.820> know<00:01:30.909> again<00:01:31.149> separate

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
small sections - you know again separate

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.490 
small sections - you know again separate
and<00:01:32.020> this<00:01:32.469> is<00:01:32.649> what<00:01:32.890> I've<00:01:32.979> got<00:01:33.369> as<00:01:33.609> a<00:01:33.640> result<00:01:34.500> so

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
and this is what I've got as a result so

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.840 
and this is what I've got as a result so
as<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:35.649> can<00:01:35.799> see<00:01:35.979> everything<00:01:36.310> is<00:01:36.429> very<00:01:36.670> very

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
as you can see everything is very very

as you can see everything is very very
defined<00:01:37.509> my<00:01:37.750> hair<00:01:37.960> did<00:01:38.170> shrink<00:01:38.469> a<00:01:38.590> lot<00:01:38.740> but

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
defined my hair did shrink a lot but

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.529 
defined my hair did shrink a lot but
again<00:01:39.100> that<00:01:39.549> comes<00:01:39.820> with<00:01:40.060> curl<00:01:40.299> definition

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
again that comes with curl definition

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.779 
again that comes with curl definition
especially<00:01:41.409> when<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:41.649> start<00:01:41.859> with<00:01:42.039> soaking

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
especially when you start with soaking

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.840 
especially when you start with soaking
wet<00:01:42.969> hair<00:01:43.240> first<00:01:43.539> time<00:01:43.749> I<00:01:43.780> got<00:01:44.140> also<00:01:44.609> the<00:01:45.609> same

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
wet hair first time I got also the same

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.190 
wet hair first time I got also the same
results<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:46.570> time<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:46.840> hadn't<00:01:47.140> even

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
results and that time I hadn't even

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.410 
results and that time I hadn't even
actually<00:01:47.590> washed<00:01:47.829> my<00:01:48.009> hair<00:01:48.249> out<00:01:48.280> fully<00:01:48.759> I<00:01:48.969> did

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
actually washed my hair out fully I did

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.330 
actually washed my hair out fully I did

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
caught on to my hair perfectly well this

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.090 
caught on to my hair perfectly well this
time<00:01:53.920> I<00:01:54.100> just<00:01:54.130> finished<00:01:54.789> washing<00:01:55.060> my<00:01:55.329> hair

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
time I just finished washing my hair

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.130 
time I just finished washing my hair
and<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.400> was<00:01:56.490> soaking<00:01:56.730> wet<00:01:56.970> I<00:01:57.030> let<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> kind<00:01:58.080> of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and it was soaking wet I let it kind of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.920 
and it was soaking wet I let it kind of
air<00:01:58.290> dry<00:01:58.620> with<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.400> product<00:01:59.760> in<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.420> about

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
air dry with the product in it for about

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.870 
air dry with the product in it for about
half<00:02:01.409> an<00:02:01.530> hour<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.220> still<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> little<00:02:02.729> bit

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
half an hour and it's still a little bit

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.550 
half an hour and it's still a little bit
damp<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.990> see<00:02:04.170> there's<00:02:04.350> still<00:02:04.440> some

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
damp and you can see there's still some

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.560 
damp and you can see there's still some
white<00:02:04.890> spots<00:02:05.190> in<00:02:05.310> my<00:02:05.430> head<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:05.910> I<00:02:06.150> guarantee

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
white spots in my head but I guarantee

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.960 
white spots in my head but I guarantee
you<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.200> dries<00:02:07.860> completely<00:02:08.130> clear<00:02:08.789> you

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you that it dries completely clear you

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.639 
you that it dries completely clear you
can't<00:02:09.270> even<00:02:09.450> first<00:02:09.959> time<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.259> used<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.590> I

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
can't even first time I used it I

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.140 
can't even first time I used it I
noticed<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.009> there<00:02:11.220> wasn't<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.640> typical

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
noticed that there wasn't that typical

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.020 
noticed that there wasn't that typical
crunch<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.840> get<00:02:13.050> with<00:02:13.260> most<00:02:14.040> curl

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
crunch that you get with most curl

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.910 
crunch that you get with most curl
definer<00:02:15.360> gels<00:02:15.750> especially<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.620> get<00:02:16.770> that

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
definer gels especially you get that

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.250 
definer gels especially you get that
kind<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.220> crunchy<00:02:17.700> hard<00:02:18.030> feeling<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.930> still

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
kind of crunchy hard feeling this still

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.280 
kind of crunchy hard feeling this still
gave<00:02:19.500> me<00:02:19.590> like<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> soft<00:02:20.370> kind<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.150> moldable<00:02:22.110> and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
gave me like a soft kind of moldable and

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.140 
gave me like a soft kind of moldable and
look<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.770> my<00:02:22.890> hair<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.459> still<00:02:23.670> look<00:02:23.850> like<00:02:23.880> I

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
look to my hair but it still look like I

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.780 
look to my hair but it still look like I
had<00:02:24.360> like<00:02:24.570> very<00:02:25.230> very<00:02:25.530> well-defined<00:02:26.100> hair<00:02:26.550> so

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
had like very very well-defined hair so

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.340 
had like very very well-defined hair so
I<00:02:26.820> really<00:02:27.270> liked<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.570> for<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.810> reason<00:02:28.170> as

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
I really liked it for that reason as

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.310 
I really liked it for that reason as
well<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:30.090> as<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.300> can<00:02:30.450> see<00:02:30.660> my<00:02:30.870> hair<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.110> really

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
well so as you can see my hair is really

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.220 
well so as you can see my hair is really
bouncy<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.430> soft<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.450> still<00:02:33.750> maintains

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
bouncy it's soft and it still maintains

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.500 
bouncy it's soft and it still maintains
that<00:02:34.350> curl<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:35.040> I'm<00:02:35.250> looking<00:02:35.520> for<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.480> I'm

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
that curl that I'm looking for so I'm

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.330 
that curl that I'm looking for so I'm
really<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.290> far<00:02:37.320> satisfied<00:02:38.040> with<00:02:38.220> this

really so far satisfied with this

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.510 
really so far satisfied with this
product<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.760> have<00:02:38.880> no<00:02:39.270> negative<00:02:40.520> no

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520

product that have no negative no
negative<00:02:41.910> points<00:02:41.940> about<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.480> at<00:02:42.630> all<00:02:42.959> since

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
negative points about it at all since

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.110 
negative points about it at all since
it's<00:02:43.380> working<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:43.890> well<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.280> my<00:02:44.430> hair<00:02:44.670> my<00:02:44.850> hair

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
it's working so well on my hair my hair

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.060 
it's working so well on my hair my hair
is<00:02:45.239> definitely<00:02:45.360> like<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.170> four<00:02:46.470> range<00:02:46.830> if

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
is definitely like in the four range if

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.470 
is definitely like in the four range if
you<00:02:47.160> want<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.370> talk<00:02:47.519> about<00:02:47.550> curl<00:02:47.880> pattern<00:02:48.300> I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
you want to talk about curl pattern I

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.150 
you want to talk about curl pattern I
feel<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.170> would<00:02:49.290> definitely<00:02:49.410> work<00:02:49.739> very

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
feel like it would definitely work very

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.550 
feel like it would definitely work very
well<00:02:50.220> as<00:02:50.519> well<00:02:50.790> for<00:02:51.420> looser<00:02:52.080> curl<00:02:52.290> types

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
well as well for looser curl types

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.650 
well as well for looser curl types
because<00:02:53.010> if<00:02:53.519> you<00:02:53.640> can<00:02:53.790> work<00:02:53.880> on<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.540> can

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
because if you can work on this it can

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.479 
because if you can work on this it can
definitely<00:02:54.810> work<00:02:55.110> on<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> bigger<00:02:55.650> curl<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.310> I'm

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
definitely work on a bigger curl so I'm

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.370 
definitely work on a bigger curl so I'm
really<00:02:56.730> really<00:02:56.850> excited<00:02:57.060> about<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.080> think

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
really really excited about it I think

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.990 
really really excited about it I think
they've<00:02:58.530> done<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.709> great<00:02:58.980> job<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.250> remaking<00:02:59.760> the
