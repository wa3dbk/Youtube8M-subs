00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
show off the fishtail part of this one

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.270 
show off the fishtail part of this one
so<00:03:08.030> make<00:03:08.270> sure<00:03:08.300> that<00:03:08.870> you're<00:03:09.410> putting<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.190> in

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
so make sure that you're putting it in

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.780 
so make sure that you're putting it in
places<00:03:10.640> where<00:03:10.790> people<00:03:10.940> can<00:03:11.270> see<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:11.980> then<00:03:12.980> take

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
places where people can see it then take

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.540 
places where people can see it then take
that<00:03:14.240> piece<00:03:14.630> of<00:03:14.660> hair<00:03:14.990> that<00:03:15.020> you<00:03:15.410> put<00:03:15.800> off<00:03:16.040> to

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
that piece of hair that you put off to

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.490 
that piece of hair that you put off to
the<00:03:16.670> side<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.240> just<00:03:17.990> make<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> regular

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
the side and just make a regular

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.550 
the side and just make a regular
three-strand<00:03:19.100> ready<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.730> start<00:03:19.970> off<00:03:20.120> with<00:03:20.560> but

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
three-strand ready to start off with but

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.680 
three-strand ready to start off with but
as<00:03:21.710> you<00:03:21.890> do<00:03:22.130> it<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:22.370> want<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.850> pull<00:03:23.120> out<00:03:23.360> pieces

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
as you do it you want to pull out pieces

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.890 
as you do it you want to pull out pieces
to<00:03:24.110> make<00:03:24.320> it<00:03:24.380> really<00:03:25.100> textured<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:26.120> really

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
to make it really textured and really

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.370 
to make it really textured and really
big<00:03:27.260> so<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:27.980> have<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.400> side<00:03:28.820> braid<00:03:29.720> leading

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
big so you have that side braid leading

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.670 
big so you have that side braid leading
into<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.190> braided<00:03:31.550> bun<00:03:31.820> that<00:03:32.480> adds<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:33.410> just

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
into the braided bun that adds it just

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.160 
into the braided bun that adds it just
adds<00:03:33.890> for<00:03:34.370> some<00:03:34.550> texture<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.660> first<00:03:35.930> time<00:03:36.140> I

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
adds for some texture the first time I

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.680 
adds for some texture the first time I
did<00:03:36.470> this<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.770> didn't<00:03:37.070> have<00:03:37.280> this<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:37.880> I<00:03:38.330> wound

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
did this I didn't have this and I wound

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.960 
did this I didn't have this and I wound
up<00:03:38.900> adding<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:39.650> little<00:03:39.710> braid<00:03:40.130> just<00:03:40.790> so

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
up adding this little braid just so

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.060 
up adding this little braid just so
there<00:03:41.240> would<00:03:41.360> be<00:03:41.390> something<00:03:41.750> going<00:03:42.410> on<00:03:42.530> on<00:03:42.770> the

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
there would be something going on on the

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.560 
there would be something going on on the
other<00:03:43.100> side<00:03:43.520> of<00:03:43.640> my<00:03:43.760> head<00:03:43.940> so<00:03:44.180> that<00:03:44.210> it<00:03:44.390> wasn't

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
other side of my head so that it wasn't

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.200 
other side of my head so that it wasn't
so<00:03:44.870> smooth<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:45.560> love<00:03:46.160> how<00:03:46.400> much<00:03:46.520> texture<00:03:47.090> that

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
so smooth I love how much texture that

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.910 
so smooth I love how much texture that
this<00:03:47.390> braid<00:03:47.630> gives<00:03:47.900> so<00:03:48.470> I've<00:03:48.530> been<00:03:48.680> adding

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
this braid gives so I've been adding

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.390 
this braid gives so I've been adding
this<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.370> lot<00:03:49.610> of<00:03:49.730> my<00:03:49.820> updos<00:03:50.240> lately

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.160 

then<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.550> want<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.790> take<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.299> and<00:03:56.450> wrap<00:03:56.810> it<00:03:57.049> and

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
then you want to take it and wrap it and

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.809 
then you want to take it and wrap it and
make<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.590> sure<00:03:57.980> that<00:03:58.010> it's<00:03:58.370> sitting<00:03:58.580> in<00:03:58.760> the

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
make it sure that it's sitting in the

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.759 
make it sure that it's sitting in the
right<00:03:58.940> place<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.450> just<00:03:59.959> pin<00:04:00.170> it<00:04:00.200> into<00:04:00.470> place

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
right place and just pin it into place

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:16.460 
right place and just pin it into place
on<00:04:01.010> top<00:04:01.099> of<00:04:01.849> the<00:04:02.060> bun

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
everything so that it doesn't go
