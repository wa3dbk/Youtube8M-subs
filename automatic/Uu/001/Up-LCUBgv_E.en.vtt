here<00:00:34.280> let's<00:00:35.000> start<00:00:35.090> on<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.360> left-hand<00:00:35.780> side

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
here let's start on the left-hand side

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.620 
here let's start on the left-hand side
with<00:00:36.290> this<00:00:36.440> 90-degree<00:00:37.040> elbow<00:00:37.399> this<00:00:38.390> is<00:00:38.540> gonna

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
with this 90-degree elbow this is gonna

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.080 
with this 90-degree elbow this is gonna
be<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:38.960> fuel<00:00:39.200> output<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.920> wood<00:00:40.100> gas<00:00:40.370> air

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
be the fuel output the wood gas air

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.120 
be the fuel output the wood gas air
ratio<00:00:41.330> mixture<00:00:41.960> output<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.440> feeds<00:00:42.650> into<00:00:42.830> the

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
ratio mixture output the feeds into the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.520 
ratio mixture output the feeds into the
generator<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:44.150> make<00:00:44.270> it<00:00:44.390> run<00:00:44.540> on<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.350> right

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
generator to make it run on the right

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.960 
generator to make it run on the right
hand<00:00:45.770> side<00:00:46.010> here<00:00:46.310> is<00:00:46.460> going<00:00:46.580> to<00:00:46.640> be<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:46.820> raw

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
hand side here is going to be the raw

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.540 
hand side here is going to be the raw
wood<00:00:47.210> gas<00:00:47.480> going<00:00:47.810> in<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:48.290> on<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.100> top<00:00:49.280> of<00:00:49.460> this

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
wood gas going in and on the top of this

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.160 
wood gas going in and on the top of this
is<00:00:49.760> gonna<00:00:49.880> be<00:00:50.060> where<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.240> fresh<00:00:50.510> air<00:00:50.720> goes<00:00:50.930> in

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
is gonna be where the fresh air goes in

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.380 
is gonna be where the fresh air goes in
and<00:00:51.770> of<00:00:51.860> course<00:00:52.070> I<00:00:52.220> got<00:00:52.370> two<00:00:52.579> valves<00:00:53.090> that<00:00:53.329> I

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
and of course I got two valves that I

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.600 
and of course I got two valves that I
can<00:00:53.570> adjust<00:00:53.840> ratios<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:55.190> get<00:00:55.340> them<00:00:55.430> set

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
can adjust ratios on to get them set

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.640 
can adjust ratios on to get them set
correctly<00:00:55.850> I<00:00:56.270> don't<00:00:56.930> have<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.200> handles<00:00:57.530> on

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
correctly I don't have the handles on

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.680 
correctly I don't have the handles on
here<00:00:57.920> but<00:00:58.190> I'm<00:00:58.280> going<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.579> make<00:00:59.150> those<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.570> put

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
here but I'm going to make those and put

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.780 
here but I'm going to make those and put
them<00:00:59.780> on<00:00:59.900> in<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.110> morning<00:01:00.200> when<00:01:00.560> I<00:01:00.590> get<00:01:00.680> up<00:01:00.860> now

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
them on in the morning when I get up now

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.139 
them on in the morning when I get up now
think<00:01:02.690> I'm<00:01:02.810> off<00:01:02.930> really<00:01:03.320> sweet<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.100> for<00:01:05.059> my

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
think I'm off really sweet and for my

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.580 
think I'm off really sweet and for my
generator<00:01:05.630> it's<00:01:05.810> gonna<00:01:05.930> sit<00:01:06.140> up<00:01:06.170> just<00:01:06.439> like

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
generator it's gonna sit up just like

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.889 
generator it's gonna sit up just like
this<00:01:06.799> that's<00:01:07.790> why<00:01:08.000> I<00:01:08.030> built<00:01:08.299> it<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.570> this<00:01:08.720> sort

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
this that's why I built it in this sort

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.320 
this that's why I built it in this sort
of<00:01:09.020> footprint<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:10.700> when<00:01:10.850> I'm<00:01:10.940> finished<00:01:11.090> with

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
of footprint and when I'm finished with

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.730 
of footprint and when I'm finished with
it<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.720> I'm<00:01:11.780> gonna<00:01:11.930> have<00:01:12.140> an<00:01:12.229> adapter<00:01:12.680> that

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
it and I'm gonna have an adapter that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.500 
it and I'm gonna have an adapter that
goes<00:01:12.950> on<00:01:13.100> top<00:01:13.250> of<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.490> fresh<00:01:13.729> air<00:01:13.940> intake<00:01:14.120> that

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
goes on top of the fresh air intake that

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.750 
goes on top of the fresh air intake that
will<00:01:14.659> allow<00:01:14.930> me<00:01:15.110> to<00:01:15.140> mount<00:01:15.530> an<00:01:15.770> air<00:01:16.310> filter<00:01:16.460> on

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
will allow me to mount an air filter on

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.760 
will allow me to mount an air filter on
top<00:01:16.970> of<00:01:17.120> this<00:01:17.210> even<00:01:18.140> let<00:01:18.260> you<00:01:18.350> get<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.500> look<00:01:18.680> at

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.170 
top of this even let you get a look at
the<00:01:18.890> valves<00:01:19.220> in<00:01:19.340> here<00:01:19.490> they<00:01:19.610> come<00:01:19.760> off<00:01:19.880> really

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
the valves in here they come off really

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.550

up wide open or I can close it off same
thing<00:01:28.299> with<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.420> fuel<00:01:29.659> intake<00:01:29.960> on<00:01:30.170> here<00:01:30.409> I<00:01:30.670> can

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
thing with the fuel intake on here I can

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.780 
thing with the fuel intake on here I can
open<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:31.970> up<00:01:32.120> wide<00:01:32.330> open<00:01:32.950> or<00:01:33.950> close<00:01:34.190> it<00:01:34.340> off<00:01:34.490> now
