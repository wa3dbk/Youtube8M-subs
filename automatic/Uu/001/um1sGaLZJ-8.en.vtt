the<00:02:15.470> edges<00:02:15.830> from<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.159> was<00:02:16.459> going<00:02:16.760> like<00:02:16.909> this

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
the edges from this was going like this

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.880 
the edges from this was going like this
thought<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.690> would<00:02:17.810> get<00:02:18.049> caught<00:02:18.290> in<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
little tube right here and it would just

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.240 
little tube right here and it would just
slice<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.530> open<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.310> right<00:02:22.430> away<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:23.140> yeah
