00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320

colors so I figured I would paint three
different<00:00:16.710> ones<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.160> three<00:00:17.400> different<00:00:17.730> colors

clay<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.960> wet<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.920> gonna<00:00:47.129> have

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
clay if you get it wet it's gonna have

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.940 
clay if you get it wet it's gonna have
to<00:00:47.520> dry<00:00:47.730> again<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.660> don't<00:00:49.110> touch<00:00:49.620> let<00:00:49.890> me

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.700 
to dry again so just don't touch let me
too<00:00:50.100> much<00:00:50.370> once<00:00:50.640> you've<00:00:50.789> done<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.590> think

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.710 
gonna get a little bit onto your
paintbrush<00:01:16.560> would<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> new<00:01:17.939> paint<00:01:18.240> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
paintbrush would this be a new paint it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.749 
paintbrush would this be a new paint it
may<00:01:19.049> take<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> little<00:01:19.770> bit<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.979> wetting<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.640> get

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
may take a little bit of wetting to get

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.109 
may take a little bit of wetting to get
the<00:01:20.880> color<00:01:21.090> off<00:01:21.979> then<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.549> start<00:01:23.820> painting

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the color off then just start painting

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.109 
the color off then just start painting
it<00:01:24.479> onto<00:01:25.320> your<00:01:25.409> ornament<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.090> I

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
it onto your ornament as you can see I

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.929 
it onto your ornament as you can see I
need<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.509> lot<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:27.930> paint<00:01:28.500> than<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.909> I

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
need a lot more paint than that so I

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.420 
need a lot more paint than that so I
think<00:01:30.060> we'll<00:01:30.720> move<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.170> water<00:01:31.350> over<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.400> that

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
think we'll move the water over so that

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.149 
think we'll move the water over so that
I<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.850> get<00:01:33.090> quite<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> bit<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.350> paint<00:01:34.619> onto<00:01:34.860> my

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
I can get quite a bit of paint onto my

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.800 
I can get quite a bit of paint onto my
brush<00:01:39.229> that's<00:01:40.229> better<00:01:40.850> then<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.210> paint

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.110 

you<00:01:54.720> don't<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:55.050> continue<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.760> everywhere<00:01:56.760> to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
it two different colors or you could put

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.190 
it two different colors or you could put
like<00:02:09.900> a<00:02:09.960> darker<00:02:10.500> color<00:02:10.710> into<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.220> word<00:02:11.720> um<00:02:12.720> I'm

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
for this one but perhaps I'll change it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.120
