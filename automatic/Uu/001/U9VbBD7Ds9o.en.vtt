hi<00:00:00.510> everybody<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:01.469> logical<00:00:02.010> and<00:00:02.210> I've<00:00:03.210> got

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hi everybody so logical and I've got

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.410 
hi everybody so logical and I've got
another<00:00:03.570> video<00:00:04.020> that<00:00:04.850> incorporates<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.060> API

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
another video that incorporates the API

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.600 
another video that incorporates the API
of<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.930> different<00:00:07.500> set<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.830> software<00:00:08.370> with<00:00:08.490> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
of a different set of software with the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.810 
of a different set of software with the
Raspberry<00:00:09.000> Pi<00:00:09.260> so<00:00:10.260> if<00:00:10.710> you're<00:00:11.130> following<00:00:11.429> my

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
Raspberry Pi so if you're following my

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.169 
Raspberry Pi so if you're following my
blog<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.480> noticed<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.410> have<00:00:14.059> over<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
blog you noticed that I have over the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.240 
blog you noticed that I have over the
past<00:00:15.299> couple<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.780> months<00:00:15.839> been<00:00:16.320> working<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
past couple of months been working on a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.599 
past couple of months been working on a
way<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:18.420> automate<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.650> growth<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.920> tomatoes

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
way to automate the growth of tomatoes

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.689 
way to automate the growth of tomatoes
and<00:00:21.109> I'm<00:00:22.109> getting<00:00:22.380> pretty<00:00:22.560> close<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.949> finally

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
and I'm getting pretty close to finally

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.519 
and I'm getting pretty close to finally
installing<00:00:24.029> pumps<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.750> building<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.289> whole

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
installing pumps and building the whole

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.140 
installing pumps and building the whole
apparatus<00:00:25.949> because<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> software's<00:00:26.849> almost

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
apparatus because the software's almost

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.529 
apparatus because the software's almost
done

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
done

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.550 
done
but<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.050> needed<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.470> way<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:29.689> get<00:00:30.689> updates<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
but I needed a way to get updates on the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.150 
but I needed a way to get updates on the
plants<00:00:32.059> easily<00:00:33.140> so<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> could<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.710> gone<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
plants easily so I could have gone the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.850 
plants easily so I could have gone the
route<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:36.110> setting<00:00:37.110> up<00:00:37.200> some<00:00:37.410> sort<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.649> email

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
route of setting up some sort of email

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.610 
route of setting up some sort of email
thing<00:00:38.340> or<00:00:38.760> setting<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.540> whole<00:00:40.350> like

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
thing or setting up a whole like

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.840 
thing or setting up a whole like
building<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.160> whole<00:00:41.370> different

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
building a whole different

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.900 
building a whole different
infrastructure<00:00:42.480> around<00:00:43.309> sending<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
infrastructure around sending just a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.250 
infrastructure around sending just a
little<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.450> data<00:00:45.719> every<00:00:46.230> like<00:00:46.410> hour<00:00:46.680> or<00:00:46.920> so

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
little bit of data every like hour or so

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.520 
little bit of data every like hour or so
but<00:00:49.260> instead<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.010> doing<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.730> decided<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
but instead of doing that I decided to

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.240 
but instead of doing that I decided to
look<00:00:52.530> into<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.129> Twitter<00:00:53.489> developer<00:00:54.210> API<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
look into the Twitter developer API and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
look into the Twitter developer API and
see<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.399> get<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.760> working<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
see if I get it working with the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.000 
see if I get it working with the
Raspberry<00:00:57.660> Pi<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.140> turns<00:00:58.410> out<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.680> you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
Raspberry Pi and it turns out that you

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.389 
Raspberry Pi and it turns out that you
can<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.329> from<00:01:00.809> my<00:01:00.930> bench<00:01:01.170> test<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.160> have

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
can so from my bench test of this I have

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.990 
can so from my bench test of this I have
a<00:01:02.730> Raspberry<00:01:03.210> Pi<00:01:04.549> model<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:07.490> wires<00:01:08.490> taken

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
a Raspberry Pi model be and wires taken

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.080 
a Raspberry Pi model be and wires taken
to<00:01:09.150> an<00:01:09.600> ADC<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.409> post<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.979> how<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> wire<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.880> up

to an ADC the post on how to wire the up

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270 
to an ADC the post on how to wire the up
just<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.900> my<00:01:13.020> other<00:01:13.049> videos<00:01:13.280> there'll

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
just like all my other videos there'll

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.080 
just like all my other videos there'll
be<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.430> blog<00:01:14.700> post<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.180> description<00:01:17.090> with

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
be a blog post in the description with

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
be a blog post in the description with
all<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.659> wiring<00:01:19.049> diagrams<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.619> stuff<00:01:19.830> but

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
all of the wiring diagrams and stuff but

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.300 
all of the wiring diagrams and stuff but
this<00:01:20.369> wiring<00:01:20.610> diagram<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.360> pretty<00:01:21.659> old<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.770> came

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
this wiring diagram is pretty old I came

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.490 
this wiring diagram is pretty old I came
up<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.090> long<00:01:24.360> time<00:01:24.750> ago<00:01:25.020> back<00:01:25.259> when<00:01:25.320> I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
up with this a long time ago back when I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.020 
up with this a long time ago back when I
started<00:01:25.590> developing<00:01:26.100> analog<00:01:26.580> sensors<00:01:26.909> with

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
started developing analog sensors with

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.510 
started developing analog sensors with
Rosewood<00:01:27.360> PI<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:28.920> that's<00:01:29.040> not<00:01:29.280> really

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
Rosewood PI so but that's not really

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.200 
Rosewood PI so but that's not really
what's<00:01:29.700> important<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:32.250> code<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.939> in

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
what's important so the code will be in

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.649 
what's important so the code will be in
the<00:01:33.360> description<00:01:34.250> in<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.340> blog<00:01:35.579> post<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.329> feel

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the description in a blog post and feel

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.670 
the description in a blog post and feel
free<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> check<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.079> out<00:01:37.229> there<00:01:37.500> but

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
free to check it out there but

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.789 
free to check it out there but
essentially<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.340> does<00:01:39.439> here<00:01:40.439> now

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
essentially what it does here now

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.830 
essentially what it does here now
revealing<00:01:41.810> my<00:01:43.130> authentication<00:01:44.130> information

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
revealing my authentication information

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.889 
revealing my authentication information
basically<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.850> loop<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.060> function<00:01:48.570> which

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
basically the loop of the function which

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.319 
basically the loop of the function which
I'm<00:01:49.049> using<00:01:49.310> ap<00:01:50.310> scheduler<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.180> fire<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.350> every

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
I'm using ap scheduler to fire on every

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.819 
I'm using ap scheduler to fire on every
right<00:01:54.329> now<00:01:54.479> at<00:01:54.600> 30<00:01:54.840> seconds<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.619> demo

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
right now at 30 seconds is for the demo

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.580 
right now at 30 seconds is for the demo
so<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.189> show<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.640> happens<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.350> how

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
so I can show you it happens to like how

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.749 
so I can show you it happens to like how
it<00:01:58.710> see<00:01:58.890> me<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.189> it'll<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.700> every<00:02:00.030> hour

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
it see me but it'll be like every hour

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.749 
it see me but it'll be like every hour
basically<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.000> does<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.810> reads<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
basically what it does is it reads the

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.789 
basically what it does is it reads the
two<00:02:05.759> sensors<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> light<00:02:07.409> dependent

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
two sensors so I have a light dependent

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.889 
two sensors so I have a light dependent
resistor<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.429> there<00:02:08.580> temperature<00:02:09.030> sensor<00:02:09.330> so

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
resistor in there temperature sensor so

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.680 
resistor in there temperature sensor so
basically<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.440> formats<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.009> data<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.370> done

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
basically if formats the data is done

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.660 
basically if formats the data is done
can<00:02:11.840> used<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.770> in<00:02:12.860> this<00:02:12.950> case<00:02:13.190> it's<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.490> two

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
can used so in this case it's a two

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.600 
can used so in this case it's a two
decimal<00:02:14.090> place<00:02:14.330> for<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:15.040> temperature<00:02:16.040> its

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
decimal place for the temperature its

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.630 
decimal place for the temperature its
its<00:02:16.820> degree<00:02:17.330> in<00:02:19.570> Fahrenheit<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.980> two<00:02:22.190> decimal

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
its degree in Fahrenheit to two decimal

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.080 
its degree in Fahrenheit to two decimal
places<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.920> also<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.580> brightness

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
places and it's also the brightness

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.200 
places and it's also the brightness
percentage<00:02:26.720> out<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.170> its<00:02:27.410> maximum<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
percentage out of its maximum I the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.270 
percentage out of its maximum I the
maximum<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.660> sensor<00:02:29.930> can<00:02:30.080> read<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.680> that's

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
maximum the sensor can read and that's

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.560 
maximum the sensor can read and that's
not<00:02:31.430> really<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.760> useful<00:02:31.910> but<00:02:32.180> it's<00:02:32.300> hard<00:02:32.510> to

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
not really that useful but it's hard to

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.710 
not really that useful but it's hard to
convert<00:02:32.960> a<00:02:33.020> lot<00:02:33.350> LDRs<00:02:34.040> readout<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.330> something

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
convert a lot LDRs readout to something

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.400 
convert a lot LDRs readout to something
like<00:02:35.810> lumens<00:02:37.570> with<00:02:38.570> this<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.990> precision

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
like lumens with this the precision

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.090 
like lumens with this the precision
level<00:02:39.710> that<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:39.860> have<00:02:40.100> so<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.710> just<00:02:42.710> decided<00:02:42.980> to

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
level that I have so I just decided to

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.830 
level that I have so I just decided to
go<00:02:43.160> with<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.460> but<00:02:44.240> that's<00:02:44.480> not<00:02:44.570> really<00:02:44.720> what

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
go with that but that's not really what

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.020 
go with that but that's not really what
you<00:02:45.020> came<00:02:45.290> here<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.470> see<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.010> here<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.850> the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
you came here to see so here is the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.310 
you came here to see so here is the
Twitter<00:02:47.330> page<00:02:47.570> for<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:49.190> Raspberry<00:02:49.580> Pi<00:02:50.320> so

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
Twitter page for the Raspberry Pi so

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.880 
Twitter page for the Raspberry Pi so
right<00:02:51.530> now<00:02:51.740> I'm<00:02:52.130> going<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.790> run<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.510> program

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
right now I'm going to run the program

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.260 
right now I'm going to run the program
which<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.070> should<00:02:55.280> initially<00:02:55.640> tweet<00:02:57.490> so<00:02:58.490> the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
which it should initially tweet so the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.000 
which it should initially tweet so the
program<00:02:59.630> just<00:02:59.810> ran<00:02:59.990> so<00:03:00.170> refresh<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.770> Twitter

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
program just ran so refresh the Twitter

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.810 
program just ran so refresh the Twitter
page<00:03:01.160> over<00:03:01.430> here<00:03:01.460> and<00:03:01.880> there<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.540> go<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:03.820> the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
page over here and there you go so the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.580 
page over here and there you go so the
brightness<00:03:05.350> is<00:03:06.350> that<00:03:06.790> sixteen<00:03:07.930> point<00:03:08.930> or

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
brightness is that sixteen point or

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.380 
brightness is that sixteen point or
eighteen<00:03:10.010> point<00:03:10.370> five<00:03:10.520> five<00:03:10.730> percent<00:03:11.270> of

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
eighteen point five five percent of

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.910 
eighteen point five five percent of
temperature<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.900> sixty<00:03:12.230> three<00:03:12.410> point<00:03:12.650> two

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
temperature is sixty three point two

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.060 
temperature is sixty three point two
degrees<00:03:13.220> Fahrenheit<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:14.380> so<00:03:15.380> now<00:03:15.560> I'll<00:03:15.920> come

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
degrees Fahrenheit and so now I'll come

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.370 
degrees Fahrenheit and so now I'll come
over<00:03:16.100> here<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.300> can<00:03:17.420> see<00:03:17.600> me<00:03:17.750> covering

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
over here and you can see me covering

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.160 
over here and you can see me covering
the<00:03:18.560> LDR<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.820> we'll<00:03:19.970> wait<00:03:20.209> for<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.810> fire

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
the LDR so we'll wait for this to fire

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.229 
the LDR so we'll wait for this to fire
again<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.830> should<00:03:22.100> in<00:03:22.310> thirty<00:03:22.700> seconds<00:03:23.150> from

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
again it should in thirty seconds from

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.910 
again it should in thirty seconds from
that<00:03:23.300> last<00:03:23.570> tweet<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.140> then<00:03:24.350> will<00:03:24.470> refresh

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
that last tweet and then will refresh

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.590 
that last tweet and then will refresh
and<00:03:27.640> see<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.850> hopefully<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.330> brightness

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
and see that hopefully the brightness

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.790 
and see that hopefully the brightness
level<00:03:29.630> went<00:03:29.959> down<00:03:29.989> so<00:03:30.290> there<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:30.500> go<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.739> can

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
level went down so there you go you can

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.650 
level went down so there you go you can
see<00:03:31.010> over<00:03:31.100> there<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.340> brightness<00:03:31.610> level<00:03:31.660> the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
see over there the brightness level the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.110 
see over there the brightness level the
dialog<00:03:33.170> just<00:03:33.470> says<00:03:33.770> what<00:03:33.950> it's<00:03:34.070> tweeting<00:03:34.520> so

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
dialog just says what it's tweeting so

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.120 
dialog just says what it's tweeting so
in<00:03:35.300> this<00:03:35.390> case<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:36.709> tweeted<00:03:37.489> four<00:03:38.060> point<00:03:39.130> four

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
in this case a tweeted four point four

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.100 
in this case a tweeted four point four
point<00:03:40.310> six<00:03:40.670> nine<00:03:40.850> percent<00:03:41.540> out<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:41.870> its

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
point six nine percent out of its

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.660 
point six nine percent out of its
maximum<00:03:42.620> brightness<00:03:42.800> so<00:03:43.100> it's<00:03:43.220> pretty<00:03:43.430> dark

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
maximum brightness so it's pretty dark

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.830 
maximum brightness so it's pretty dark
so<00:03:44.360> I'll<00:03:44.480> refresh<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:46.600> there<00:03:47.600> you<00:03:47.720> go

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
so I'll refresh this and there you go

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.570 
so I'll refresh this and there you go
you<00:03:47.900> can<00:03:48.080> see<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.590> tweeted<00:03:48.950> four<00:03:49.370> point

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
you can see that it tweeted four point

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.430 
you can see that it tweeted four point
six<00:03:49.730> nine<00:03:49.850> percent<00:03:50.239> temperature<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:51.230> the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
six nine percent temperature is the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.770 
six nine percent temperature is the
exact<00:03:51.739> same<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:54.220> yeah<00:03:55.220> so<00:03:55.910> instead<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.540> having

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
exact same and yeah so instead of having

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.780 
exact same and yeah so instead of having
to<00:03:57.050> develop<00:03:57.290> spend<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.190> lot<00:03:58.459> of<00:03:58.489> time

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
to develop spend a lot of time

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.600 
to develop spend a lot of time
developing<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.920> whole<00:04:00.920> different<00:04:02.140> library<00:04:03.140> and

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
developing a whole different library and

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.920 
developing a whole different library and
get<00:04:04.610> all<00:04:04.730> get<00:04:05.330> a<00:04:05.360> whole<00:04:05.600> different

get all get a whole different
instruction<00:04:06.350> place<00:04:06.530> now<00:04:06.709> I<00:04:06.739> can<00:04:06.980> just<00:04:07.100> access

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
instruction place now I can just access

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.420 
instruction place now I can just access

access<00:04:20.090> that<00:04:20.210> data<00:04:20.450> from<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:20.989> new<00:04:21.109> from<00:04:21.530> there

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
access that data from the new from there

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.840 
access that data from the new from there
and<00:04:22.039> I'm<00:04:22.640> assuming

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
and I'm assuming

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.820 
and I'm assuming
probably<00:04:24.690> if<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:25.020> could<00:04:25.260> come<00:04:25.410> up<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.650> money

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
probably if I could come up the money

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.500 
probably if I could come up the money
for<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.160> I'll<00:04:26.250> get<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.460> Raspberry<00:04:26.880> Pi<00:04:26.910> camera

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
for it I'll get a Raspberry Pi camera

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.610 
for it I'll get a Raspberry Pi camera
and<00:04:27.720> have<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.470> somehow<00:04:28.800> tweet<00:04:30.170> pictures<00:04:31.170> or

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
and have it somehow tweet pictures or
something<00:04:31.860> I'll<00:04:31.980> try<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.160> do<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:32.460> because

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
something I'll try to do that because

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.700 
something I'll try to do that because
that<00:04:32.760> would<00:04:32.880> be<00:04:33.030> really<00:04:33.420> really<00:04:33.450> cool<00:04:33.710> but

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
that would be really really cool but

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.800
