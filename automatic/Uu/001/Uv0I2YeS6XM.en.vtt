00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 i 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.810
 if it would not be we are going to do two projects 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.820
 Christmas are super easy super 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.369
 economics are based on things that 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.380
 come of interest and we will use a 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.670
 paper that has a girlish impression 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.250
 that you like and I particularly 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.500
 I bought this that are some boxes that 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.050
 they come in the dollar store they have three 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.460
 boxes with different designs I bought this 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.670
 particularly because I liked the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.770
 design and I'm going to cut it to the size of 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.079
 picture that I have already had this frame of 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.940
 here some time ago we are going to use this 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.430
 ornament although I found it in the 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.990
 one dollar store a techno ball 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.990
 by the tacks 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.890
 without discs and a cutter and now we're going to 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.890
 start 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.630
 girls as they will realize and I cut the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.400
 paper I wanted the size of the box 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.970
 As I told you, you can look for you 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.360
 most beautiful designs on christmas bags 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.659
 or on wrapping paper like in this case 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.930
 in a Christmas box now what I'm going to 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.930
 do 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.510
 is to place it 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.680
 girls as you may have already realized with 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.710
 what paper the role of the box that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.800
 I liked it inside the box and now I'm going to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.940
 place the ornament out of the glass what 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.240
 what happens is that this frame is not 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.800
 allows you to put something that you have that has 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.080
 very thick because this one has a few 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.000
 details has some balls here then 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.890
 it does not allow me to put it and I do not want 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.860
 take this one out because if I like it so 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.229
 I'm going to put it over plan tail 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.479
 with the hundreds with waits do not work 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.460
 so what I'm going to do I'm going to use the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.280
 silicone gun and I'll put as 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.050
 about 4 about 4 droplets do not worry about 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.400
 spoil is glass because the gun 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:15.440
 like silicone with comes out quickly 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.440
 when the when the front 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.440
 then I will put 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.120
 4 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.790
 it has to cool a little 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.909
 ah 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.150
 It is the place where you want 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.150
 be 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.280
 and ready 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.180
 here girls this next project is 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.090
 very easy, let's just make a little ball 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.090
 of techno by tacks and a piece of 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.790
 here we are going to start putting the 8 in 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.790
 the 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.620
 we want them to be on top of each other 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.130
 if we go to a large part already finished 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.050
 I just need to place a hook 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.710
 america account is that using a 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:06.250
 tack to hold the tape was very 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:09.220
 difficult because the tack does not weigh much 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.950
 and the ornament is always quite like that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.840
 that there is not a good contact what 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.030
 I'm doing is to use a hook and 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.620
 It has a little silicone which does not 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.359
 It's completely hot so it does not 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.359
 remain the dt not for and I will apply 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.820
 Now I'm going to let it dry 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.080
 and what is this is the finished project 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.970
 I hope you liked it, I do not know 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.010
 forget to look for me on facebook review 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.780
 my website avanti morocha gives with 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.880
 have found more specific data 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.770
 about this project and we see each other very 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.770
 Nurture soon bye
