00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
ago so let's increase the amount of time

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.690 
ago so let's increase the amount of time
and<00:01:36.110> don't<00:01:39.560> this<00:01:40.560> also<00:01:40.770> works<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.430> like

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and don't this also works with like

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.350 
and don't this also works with like
chests<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:44.780> watch<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.869> chest<00:01:47.119> tells<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.240> who

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360

and<00:01:59.300> it's<00:01:59.870> pretty<00:02:00.140> simple<00:02:00.470> like<00:02:01.100> even<00:02:01.340> if<00:02:01.520> it's

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
and it's pretty simple like even if it's

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.210 
and it's pretty simple like even if it's
not<00:02:01.820> grieved<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:03.350> tells<00:02:03.620> you<00:02:03.770> who's<00:02:03.980> house

because<00:04:03.970> undoing<00:04:04.970> everything<00:04:07.090> sometimes<00:04:08.090> has

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
because undoing everything sometimes has

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.800 
because undoing everything sometimes has
weird<00:04:08.860> consequences<00:04:09.860> like<00:04:10.850> maybe<00:04:11.450> that

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
weird consequences like maybe that

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.400 
weird consequences like maybe that

person helped build someone's house and

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.140 
person helped build someone's house and
so<00:04:15.410> if<00:04:15.590> they<00:04:15.769> helped<00:04:16.040> build<00:04:16.310> that<00:04:16.400> house<00:04:16.760> and

so if they helped build that house and
then<00:04:18.109> griefed<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.829> you<00:04:18.950> undid<00:04:19.220> everything

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
then griefed and you undid everything

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.860 
then griefed and you undid everything
you<00:04:21.560> would<00:04:21.680> undo<00:04:22.010> that<00:04:22.160> griefing<00:04:22.669> but<00:04:23.330> you
