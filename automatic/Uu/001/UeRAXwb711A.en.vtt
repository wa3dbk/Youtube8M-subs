worst<00:01:48.350> internet<00:01:48.979> connection<00:01:49.490> we<00:01:49.609> were

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
worst internet connection we were

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.219 
worst internet connection we were
probably<00:01:49.880> asked<00:01:50.179> for<00:01:50.270> if<00:01:50.689> you<00:01:50.810> want<00:01:50.929> to<00:01:51.020> BTW

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
probably asked for if you want to BTW

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.959 
probably asked for if you want to BTW
and<00:01:51.529> ask<00:01:51.649> for<00:01:51.859> them<00:01:51.979> through<00:01:52.369> their<00:01:52.670> worst

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.699 
like to pound mega upload speed of light
that<00:01:55.759> is<00:01:55.909> probably<00:01:56.209> why<00:01:56.389> i<00:01:56.420> get<00:01:56.689> x<00:01:57.289> pay<00:01:57.529> like

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:59.169 
that is probably why i get x pay like
280<00:01:58.130> pound<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.399> month<00:01:58.429> so<00:01:58.819> it's<00:01:58.909> a<00:01:58.939> bit<00:01:59.090> like

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179
