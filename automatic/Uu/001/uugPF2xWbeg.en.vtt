that means I think is that we really

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.870 
that means I think is that we really
have<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.229> attend<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.100> our<00:01:59.130> emotions<00:01:59.729> we've

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
been talking about this a lot because

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.649 
been talking about this a lot because
we've<00:02:02.159> got<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.579> many<00:02:02.700> planets<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.390> water

we've got so many planets and water

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.780 
we've got so many planets and water
