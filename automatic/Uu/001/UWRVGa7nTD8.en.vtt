for<00:00:13.469> Minecraft<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.730> have<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> little<00:00:15.000> guests

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
for Minecraft so we have a little guests

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.660 
for Minecraft so we have a little guests
here<00:00:15.570> his<00:00:15.960> name<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.470> come<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:16.859> blogs<00:00:17.190> or<00:00:17.369> money

here his name is come on blogs or money

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.269 
here his name is come on blogs or money
codes<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.900> snapshots<00:00:19.410> pretty<00:00:19.619> small<00:00:19.949> has

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
codes so the snapshots pretty small has

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.179 
codes so the snapshots pretty small has
I<00:00:20.880> think<00:00:21.390> four<00:00:21.630> or<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.930> new<00:00:22.140> features<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.980> let's

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
I think four or so new features so let's

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.769 
I think four or so new features so let's
carry<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> minor<00:00:23.730> ones<00:00:24.000> before<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.480> go<00:00:24.600> into

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
carry the minor ones before we go into

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.599 
carry the minor ones before we go into
the<00:00:24.930> command<00:00:25.170> blocks<00:00:25.439> here<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.430> first

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
the command blocks here so the first

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.279 
the command blocks here so the first
feature<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> new<00:00:27.960> world

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
feature is that we have a new world

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.800 
feature is that we have a new world
generation<00:00:28.650> for<00:00:29.099> banks<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.580> biomes<00:00:29.880> allows<00:00:30.599> us

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
generation for banks of biomes allows us

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.930 
generation for banks of biomes allows us
to<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.109> Mesa<00:00:31.380> prices<00:00:31.980> or<00:00:32.250> Bryce<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.759> guess

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
to have Mesa prices or Bryce I guess

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.410 
to have Mesa prices or Bryce I guess
Bryce<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.809> go<00:00:33.840> soulless<00:00:34.640> now<00:00:35.640> these<00:00:36.210> things

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
Bryce to go soulless now these things

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.569 
Bryce to go soulless now these things
just<00:00:36.660> stick<00:00:36.809> out<00:00:36.989> pretty<00:00:37.860> little<00:00:38.010> cool<00:00:38.340> little

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
just stick out pretty little cool little

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.790 
just stick out pretty little cool little
designs<00:00:39.090> nothing<00:00:39.870> really<00:00:39.989> fancy<00:00:40.260> about<00:00:40.590> this

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
designs nothing really fancy about this

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.160 
designs nothing really fancy about this
but<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.370> makes<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> biomes<00:00:42.420> now<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.719> have<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
but it makes the biomes now we have a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.760 
but it makes the biomes now we have a
new<00:00:43.410> item<00:00:43.770> called<00:00:44.070> red<00:00:44.820> sand<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.960> red<00:00:46.260> San<00:00:46.530> is

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
new item called red sand so red San is

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.279 
new item called red sand so red San is
basically<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.340> sand<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:47.969> dyed<00:00:48.390> red<00:00:48.420> now

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
basically just sand just dyed red now

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.139 
basically just sand just dyed red now
currently<00:00:49.739> has<00:00:50.039> no<00:00:50.070> other<00:00:50.430> features<00:00:50.879> I

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
currently has no other features I

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.970 
currently has no other features I
believe<00:00:51.809> they're<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.379> implementing

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
believe they're going to be implementing

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.250 
believe they're going to be implementing
may<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.280> stained<00:00:53.699> glass<00:00:54.000> soon<00:00:54.270> who<00:00:54.449> knows<00:00:54.480> but

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
may be stained glass soon who knows but

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.410 
may be stained glass soon who knows but
when<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.469> smelt<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.699> gives<00:00:57.239> you

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
when you smelt it it just gives you

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.779 
when you smelt it it just gives you
regular<00:00:57.750> glass<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.620> can't<00:00:59.010> craft<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.730> into

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
regular glass you can't craft it into

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.180 
regular glass you can't craft it into
anything<00:01:00.210> else<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:02.010> there<00:01:02.160> for

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
anything else and it's just there for

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.250 
anything else and it's just there for
decoration<00:01:02.370> purposes<00:01:02.930> okay<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:03.960> think<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.229> just

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
decoration purposes okay I think I just

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.840 
decoration purposes okay I think I just
covered<00:01:04.710> three<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> minor<00:01:05.339> updates<00:01:05.729> in

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
covered three of the minor updates in

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.600 
covered three of the minor updates in
like<00:01:06.000> half<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.540> second<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.409> let's<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
like half a second so let's go on to the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.460 
like half a second so let's go on to the
command<00:01:08.909> blocks<00:01:09.119> right<00:01:09.330> now<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.170> our<00:01:10.320> last

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
command blocks right now so our last

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.109 
command blocks right now so our last
feature<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.670> command

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
feature here is that we have command

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.780 
feature here is that we have command
blocks<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.659> mine<00:01:12.930> cards<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:14.220> yeah<00:01:14.430> bear<00:01:14.640> saw

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
blocks on mine cards and I yeah bear saw

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.999 
blocks on mine cards and I yeah bear saw
the<00:01:14.850> voice<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.720> basically<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> command

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
the voice so we basically have a command

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.039 
the voice so we basically have a command
block<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.759> mine<00:01:18.000> cards<00:01:18.360> now<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
block here with mine cards now the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.530 
block here with mine cards now the
easiest<00:01:19.590> way<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.009> summon<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.090> do<00:01:21.299> /

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
easiest way to summon this is to do /

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
easiest way to summon this is to do /
summon<00:01:22.259> mine<00:01:23.420> cart<00:01:24.740> command<00:01:26.509> block<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.840> there

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
summon mine cart command block and there

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.289 
summon mine cart command block and there
you<00:01:28.829> go<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.369> minecart<00:01:29.790> command<00:01:30.119> block

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
you go you have a minecart command block

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.700 
you go you have a minecart command block
and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:30.840> once<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.650> you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and then once you have it like this you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.020 
and then once you have it like this you
could<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.040> middle<00:01:32.310> click<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:32.759> have

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
could just middle click it and then have

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.630 
could just middle click it and then have
it<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:33.390> inventory<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:35.040> now<00:01:35.189> have

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
it in your inventory so we can now have

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.300 
it in your inventory so we can now have
writable<00:01:36.630> command<00:01:36.960> blocks<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.439> when<00:01:38.189> they

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
writable command blocks and when they

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.190 
writable command blocks and when they
pass<00:01:38.549> over<00:01:38.729> an<00:01:39.060> activation<00:01:39.479> row<00:01:39.689> before<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.079> do

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
pass over an activation row before I do

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.330 
pass over an activation row before I do
that<00:01:40.320> let<00:01:40.470> me<00:01:40.650> show<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.070> command

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that let me show you what the command

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.660 
that let me show you what the command
here<00:01:41.579> he<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.899> i<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.500> /<00:01:43.829> summon<00:01:44.369> pig

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
here he is so i have here / summon pig

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
here he is so i have here / summon pig
and<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.119> coordinates<00:01:45.540> will<00:01:45.689> equal<00:01:46.170> that

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and the coordinates will equal that

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.109 
and the coordinates will equal that
little<00:01:47.159> space<00:01:47.520> right<00:01:47.640> there<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> they'll

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
little space right there and they'll

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.200 
little space right there and they'll
faltered<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:49.110> their<00:01:49.259> death<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.670> pigs<00:01:50.909> fall

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
faltered to their death so the pigs fall

a<00:02:12.360> player

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
a player

but<00:02:13.590> now<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.800> can<00:02:14.010> have<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.310> minecart<00:02:14.730> just

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
but now you can have the minecart just

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.880 
but now you can have the minecart just
move<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.270> an<00:02:15.660> activation<00:02:16.020> row<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.500> then

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
move to an activation row and then

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.010 
move to an activation row and then
activate<00:02:17.400> its<00:02:17.550> certain<00:02:18.000> command<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.930> I'm

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
activate its certain command so I'm

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.600 
activate its certain command so I'm
pretty<00:02:19.200> sure<00:02:19.380> works<00:02:19.620> with<00:02:19.800> any<00:02:19.980> command<00:02:20.430> for

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
pretty sure works with any command for

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.700 
pretty sure works with any command for
any<00:02:20.760> command<00:02:21.120> blocks<00:02:21.300> but<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.170> now<00:02:22.320> allows<00:02:22.650> us

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
any command blocks but it now allows us

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.580 
any command blocks but it now allows us
to<00:02:23.100> have<00:02:23.340> mine<00:02:24.180> carts<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.780> command<00:02:25.260> blogs<00:02:25.470> that

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
to have mine carts or command blogs that

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.890 
to have mine carts or command blogs that
move<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.190> process<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.790> then<00:02:27.420> activate

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
move in the process and then activate

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.930 
move in the process and then activate
when<00:02:28.170> going<00:02:28.410> over<00:02:28.770> an<00:02:28.860> activation<00:02:29.250> realm<00:02:29.580> and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
when going over an activation realm and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.270 
when going over an activation realm and
now<00:02:30.270> we<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:30.480> piggies<00:02:31.080> we<00:02:31.680> are<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.070> hub

of<00:02:47.220> had<00:02:48.120> some<00:02:48.270> prototypes<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:49.140> thought<00:02:49.410> this

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
of had some prototypes I thought this

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.470 
of had some prototypes I thought this
was<00:02:49.710> how<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.190> no<00:02:51.060> it's<00:02:51.240> just<00:02:51.360> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
was how you do it no it's just the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.690 
was how you do it no it's just the
identity<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.260> then<00:02:52.680> we<00:02:52.770> have<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.370> mario

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
identity and then we have this the mario

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.520 
identity and then we have this the mario
