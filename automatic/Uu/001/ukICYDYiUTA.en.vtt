00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.490
 a huge hello and welcome 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.529
 on my channel today will be another 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.269
 video oh my god it's from the fix store 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.599
 price if you are interested to stay with 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.219
 me 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.289
 I'll start the first wipe I bought 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.029
 Here are such wipes code and this wet 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.369
 universal wipes that fit 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.800
 for both hands and face and body 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.900
 at least as stated i buy already 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.750
 not the first time i use them when 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.269
 just need for example wipe your hands 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.160
 when I do makeup for example 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.130
 hands get dirty there with shadows and blush 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.920
 no matter cream foundation i wipe 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.219
 I do n't like skin like these wipes 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.270
 do not dry basically erase well what 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.850
 still need napkins not knowing the following is 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.550
 Here are these cotton pads this time there 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.500
 there were discs not firm claws like napkins 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.440
 which just showed and the other 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.379
 I haven't used aura yet, but 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.140
 they judge ditches for by touch they 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.890
 a little more dense such more 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.030
 pressed together 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.530
 Well, I think that there will be good cotton pads 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.080
 I also bought myself such 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.979
 manicure correction pencil 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.340
 I used to have such he was with a wet 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.049
 already soaked with liquid tip and 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.650
 good enough styralok this by the way 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.259
 here is the firm lavli this pencil has 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.030
 such a normal tip a little 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.299
 I push you a little bit I'm not here anymore 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.610
 erased the mind well, but the trick is that he 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.130
 dry ie they need to be on their own 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.380
 dunk it in a nail polish remover 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.280
 that is, it is just for convenience that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.579
 don't do this 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.500
 a cotton swab not a wand, but such 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.520
 form 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.649
 triangle tip that is in 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.390
 Basically special some practical 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.250
 values ​​he does not bear given that 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.630
 still need to buy liquid 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.520
 separately and dunk it 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.340
 but no less than in some cases 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.119
 up to once again not that there is too much 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.280
 do not erase 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.710
 rub your lead very very 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.880
 neatly tip me quite 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.130
 you can use it 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.110
 there is from the back 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.450
 three spare rods i.e. when this 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.160
 fluff will become worthless i think 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.290
 it will be pretty quickly possible 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.360
 use the spare principle for 43 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.800
 ruble is not a bad thing but you can 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.989
 do without her also this time I 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.950
 I bought this photo frame 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:30.810
 I put my embroidery there now 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.750
 frame 9 by 13 I liked that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.180
 I used to have yes and there are 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.580
 frames of such a glass type and 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.489
 They usually cost more I bought 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.380
 for 100 for 150 rubles earlier and for 43 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.090
 ruble somehow needed me seemed very 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.970
 even cool on so nickname style 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.620
 it looks like we are now dark walled she 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.239
 so it fits well into the interior 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.790
 in general, I really liked also that 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.660
 I want to say more 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.519
 bought just such a stand under 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.480
 office i'm at all this time when 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.400
 went fix price 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.110
 I had a goal to buy a stand under 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.569
 pens because i know he's there 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.540
 sold me just needed 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.400
 and others unfortunately I was not at all 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.459
 wanted another who also saw u 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.910
 different bloggers were just that kind 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.790
 here there are these three departments I already 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.500
 filled in and here is so small 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.350
 trick some kind of gum put or 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.630
 something like that they will be like this 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.049
 here they are removed that is boxes 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.380
 all disassembled and then we just 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:37.109
 put on here and so at each other, these 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.120
 parts and they cost me not very 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.609
 they liked quite fragile that is 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.230
 if a little bit somewhere hurt the approach and she 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.569
 falls off yes if something is there 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.930
 tilt if there 's something close 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.010
 put in the palette who is the boy and 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.690
 fell off ie either you need it 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.400
 glue straight super glue to 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.590
 lingered either endure in general so in 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.510
 Basically good but podstavochki 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.800
 again, I say I bought only because 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.420
 that there was no other and I need something 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:10.660
 it was most likely I'm still descendants 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:12.940
 let or other something else that i don't 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.640
 I can praise this one hundred percent 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.010
 such a bath set here is washing 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.410
 soap dish most ordinary with holes 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.570
 and here is such a glass supposedly for dental 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.820
 brushes for this purpose I bought it 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.770
 because we moved to a new new 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.900
 an apartment and it was necessary to put somewhere 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.080
 our accessories are a glass to me not 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.490
 I liked the fact that this little thing 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.350
 which kind of as for beauty yes with 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.890
 such grooves for toothbrushes 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.900
 it does not fit perfectly then 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.030
 there is here she is very shaky holding 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.680
 and when you get a toothbrush like 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.430
 rule she clings to this thing 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.070
 falls off 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.690
 in general, too , somehow not practical done 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.520
 if you remove it, it will be just normal 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.300
 the glass can of course and so be used 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.590
 but still with this thing a lot more 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.960
 pretty so pretty looks but 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.520
 She unfortunately does not hold at all if 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.530
 just stick it on super again 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:08.650
 glue also want to show shampoo 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.290
 this shampoo is my boyfriend 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.470
 anti-dandruff shampoo 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:17.320
 he has such a problem that from many 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.950
 dandruff does not pass his shampoos 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.419
 he was helped by a couple of shampoos but when 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.200
 started using other dandruff 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.820
 reappeared 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.510
 so we decided to try this one 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.190
 beauty dandruff shampoo with 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.980
 he is okay now she enjoys 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.960
 beta 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.570
 or 2 and so far so good nick 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.580
 copperhead does not appear that is quite 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.660
 I can recommend to those who have such 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.930
 problem once again we bought 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.160
 pomegranate juice from the bank is already empty 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.350
 cool here is pomegranate juice of course 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.890
 rather suspicious that he stands so 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.680
 cheap but in principle except pomegranate 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.760
 juice and sugar nothing in the composition is not there 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.160
 sugar here is a bit of course 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.280
 present but he is very like that 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.370
 saturated very sweetly then 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.990
 I mean, let's say I don't drink it 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.840
 I dilute it a little with water and 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.920
 it turns out that it lasts longer well 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.390
 and tasty sometimes you can eat and 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.710
 another one so unexpected probably 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:21.470
 buying it is such a seedling ground 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.120
 I just showed once bought for 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.600
 flower pot because i need 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.460
 there were two sits down and points here and then I 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.580
 how would understand that where it transplanted 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.830
 I still need primer and when it was me 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.810
 no need I never even thought never 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.510
 did not pay attention that he asked again 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.330
 for sale and this time I went in and me 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.640
 immediately struck such a huge 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.490
 there was a stand on which stood these here 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.680
 primer and he's so healthy here 10 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.930
 liters of course I need quite a bit 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.060
 I do not know when the rest of Lego will not 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.010
 probably just throw out 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.320
 but none the less so healthy 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.990
 43 rubles and I have a great deal for 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.720
 stick out very practical such a purchase 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.300
 it turned out well, that's basically all on 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.190
 this time now my store purchases 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.860
 fix price will occur much more often 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.560
 because now we literally live 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.170
 almost opposite this store 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.870
 and go there does not make 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.150
 no work it is very close hope 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.620
