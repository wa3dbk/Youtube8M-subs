00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.459
 95% of the engines in the world are 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.260
 combustion engines in 2020 they 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.509
 will still represent 90% 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.790
 only 10% will use energy 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.370
 alternative electric cars 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.960
 using hydrogen from corn or 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.060
 still some cooking oil have 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.760
 potential and we are also working on 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.350
 alternatives 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.640
 but our ambition goes further 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.560
 We want to propose solutions 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.260
 which offer more sensations than 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.079
 squirrel in his wheel and this without being 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.730
 overpriced to really affect 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.510
 global fuel consumption and 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.250
 shows 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.280
 you have to focus on something 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.800
 that the whole world use take a 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.449
 combustion engine improve the appointment 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.390
 the accessible to all and you will see a 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.489
 real difference 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.260
 what a difference if we consider that 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.149
 current engines is wasting 70% of 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.769
 the potential energy of the fuel that 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.839
 leaves a lot of room for improvement 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.449
 our goal was an economy of 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.460
 15% fuel and an improvement in 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.969
 torque of 15% on engines with 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.969
 conventional fuels 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.850
 the big gorilla etheth 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.590
 stand on our way 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.900
 the first was how to shoot 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.820
 the maximum fuel energy for there 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.530
 to arrive we had to increase the rate of 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.750
 compression which increases the power 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.400
 in the firebox plus the 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.900
 compression ratio is high and more 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.500
 the energy released by combustion is 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.270
 important but in general a rate of 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.100
 high compression produces jerks 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.930
 this happens when the air mixture 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.910
 fuel ignites too early because 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.100
 excessive heat from the room there 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.420
 had to cool everything thanks to 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.090
 a huge effort of a generic 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.619
 we found answers like 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.840
 the use of a high injector 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.190
 six-hole pressure that propels the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.380
 fuel gradually into the 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.300
 cylinder for a fuel air mixture 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.490
 more stable but also the use 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.290
 of a small pocket in the piston that 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.820
 captures the first part of the explosion 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.520
 to avoid heating the party 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.990
 top of the piston to evacuate all 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.700
 the excess heat without projecting it 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.740
 in the other cylinders we have 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.570
 added a longer evacuation system 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.670
 used in racing cars 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.380
 in general ordinary cars do not 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.269
 does not have this system because this 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.830
 produces CO2 emissions but thanks 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.239
 at our advanced injectors we have 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.890
 also solved this problem 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.810
 that's how we managed to 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.160
 pull more energy from the fuel the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.630
 second big problem was to 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.400
 make sure we do not lose anything 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.930
 this precious energy in the course 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.340
 up to the wheels so we reduced 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.900
 friction inside the engine 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.330
 30% 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.800
 how by shaping every detail we 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.620
 have improved the efficiency of the pump 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.320
 oil content of 74% and that of the pump 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.030
 water by 31% to reduce the friction of 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.640
 moving parts like the pistons the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.750
 rods and crankshaft 25% those of the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.950
 54% distribution system 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.410
 we even reduced the effort of 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.650
 engine cooling of 13% to 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.150
 final we realize the unachievable 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.430
 improve both the couple the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.320
 performance and efficiency thanks to 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.520
 skyactiv technologies the future of 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.440
 the car starts now 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.440
 mazda beyond the conventions
