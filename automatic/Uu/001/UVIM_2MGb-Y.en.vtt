00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.910
 greetings to all 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.470
 and today in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.740
 pass for class e chase group 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.529
 and I will do it like this 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.000
 wreck that also has its advantages 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:32.640
 expressed it is a good maximum 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.820
 speeds and this machine is heavy in 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.540
 frontal she can just nafig fold 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.430
 any cop well let's try 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.770
 pass because it seems to me that with 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.289
 my last race 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.860
 something has changed in time that is 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.940
 it became easier to pass class e and so here 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.940
 the race itself 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.640
 as expected sirocco bit 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:14.600
 faster we go but hit about 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:16.970
 corner that does not respect him first 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.270
 the cops we naturally go through with 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.960
 right side may be nuances but in 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:29.150
 In general, everything goes as planned here here 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.440
 it is necessary to minimize the player with us 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:40.340
 caught an ally experienced pretty 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:44.630
 know how to drive it makes us happy too 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:48.130
 misses and here it is fucked up yes I am 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.130
 also did not have time to slow down 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:04.710
 what I was talking about they no no what it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.000
 it was such oh god in general passage 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.140
 class is that still tin 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.670
 it especially scares me when they 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:19.110
 start jumping it's just general 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:23.340
 chic we drove to such a factory 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.010
 incomprehensible despite the fact that I 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.600
 slowed down very much and lagged behind 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.350
 opponent in principle, in principle, I have not 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.350
 lost everything 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.760
 but this car is generally terrible on it all 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.330
 terrible ride and I do not know who drives it 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:54.710
 in general who buys it at all and the most 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:56.270
 the main thing for which it is necessary for the first time in my life 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.490
 I heard a new phrase here everywhere 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.800
 fuel right here now after turning 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.390
 very interesting moment such newbies 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.460
 often go to the right right down there and 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.680
 the whole joke is that there is a dead end 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:14.120
 I also went there once in a clean 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.700
 by chance therefore it is not desirable to go there 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.780
 so here I am starting not to keep up 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.240
 principle to the chase 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.760
 that is, I have already encountered two times 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.620
 good and I can not manage to come to 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.620
 finish on time let's hope 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:36.280
 box here's a box for you some cop 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.660
 now 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:46.220
 pretentious guys that you don't give 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:49.660
 turn and ally us ours already 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.760
 far ahead not well what it was 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.220
 it's called perfect physics he's me 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.290
 pushed as if i am at all like 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.360
 if I do not have it here at once 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.160
 just shows that there is no for speedy physics 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.160
 well sucks 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:21.370
 so it remains a minute and a half to 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:23.860
 principle should be enough for more than 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.760
 in order to finish here we go around 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.800
 on the left side and go continue to go 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.540
 newcomers often go left along the way 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.580
 crashing into cars something trying there 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:42.820
 drive like the devil knows how to drive around 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:46.320
 lose speed as a result yes I am 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.320
 I made vain thorns 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.340
 but not without this principle there it was possible 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.330
 go round 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:01.540
 but in war, all methods are good therefore 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:05.350
 we are 30 seconds and I do not have time I do not 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:11.170
 I will have time for the reason that an ally could 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:13.480
 wait for me for a bit until now I will 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:18.010
 hurry will do a bunch of mistakes and in 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:27.190
 the result of the show is even better not have time though 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:31.600
 although 64 triad I did it I did it 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.880
 and that's actually the way it goes 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.650
 perched that i'm a little refueling at the end in 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.540
 late need to go there closer to the left side 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.280
 because there you can drive and spikes and 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.070
 go round Tajik which I 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.870
 crashed at the end here but the hardest 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.200
 it's in the tunnel because in the tunnel of these 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.750
 the police at the hell 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.669
