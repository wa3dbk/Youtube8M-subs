three<00:01:35.220> new<00:01:35.369> cards<00:01:36.079> that's<00:01:37.079> good<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.680> also

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
three new cards that's good but it also

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.620 
three new cards that's good but it also
tells<00:01:38.220> everybody<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> table<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.600> you

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
tells everybody at the table that you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.520 
tells everybody at the table that you
have<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> pair<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:41.689> better<00:01:42.689> way<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.930> do<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.470> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
have a pair a better way to do it is to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.889 
have a pair a better way to do it is to
only<00:01:44.130> discard<00:01:44.759> two<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> three<00:01:45.570> cards

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.499 
only discard two of the three cards
keeping<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.439> card<00:01:46.710> as<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> kicker<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.520> that

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
keeping one card as a kicker and that

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.270 
keeping one card as a kicker and that
will<00:01:48.780> kind<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.619> play<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> little<00:01:50.040> bit<00:01:50.189> of

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
will kind of play a little bit of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.620 
will kind of play a little bit of
psychology<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> people<00:01:51.270> at<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> table

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
psychology on the people at the table

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.319 
psychology on the people at the table
making<00:01:52.409> them<00:01:52.710> think<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.909> probably<00:01:54.119> have

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
making them think that you probably have

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.240 
making them think that you probably have
three<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.689> kind<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.259> you're<00:01:55.740> maybe<00:01:55.920> trying

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
three of a kind and you're maybe trying

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.480 
three of a kind and you're maybe trying
for<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> full<00:01:56.759> house<00:01:56.939> or<00:01:57.329> something<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.229> that

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
for a full house or something like that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.440 
for a full house or something like that
so<00:01:59.490> these<00:01:59.640> are<00:01:59.759> all<00:01:59.820> things<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.210> want<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
so these are all things you want to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.719 
so these are all things you want to
think<00:02:00.630> about<00:02:00.840> when<00:02:01.229> you're<00:02:01.320> playing<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> game

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
think about when you're playing the game

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.620 
think about when you're playing the game
strategies<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.000> little<00:02:03.210> things<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.570> that

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
strategies and little things like that

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.510 
strategies and little things like that
positioning<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.439> where<00:02:04.619> you're<00:02:04.740> sitting<00:02:04.979> that

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
positioning of where you're sitting that

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.620 
positioning of where you're sitting that
you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.790> mess<00:02:05.939> with<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> other<00:02:06.329> players

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
you can mess with the other players

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.600 
you can mess with the other players
because<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> game<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.590> skill<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:08.459> also

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
because it is a game of skill it's also

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.339 
because it is a game of skill it's also
a<00:02:08.759> game<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.119> psychology<00:02:09.720> though<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.110> mean<00:02:10.289> if

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
a game of psychology though I mean if

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.990 
a game of psychology though I mean if
you're<00:02:10.500> putting<00:02:10.619> fear<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.160> somebody<00:02:11.520> about

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
you're putting fear and somebody about

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.430 
you're putting fear and somebody about
placing<00:02:12.450> their<00:02:12.599> bet<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.080> money

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
placing their bet and the money

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.410 
placing their bet and the money
on<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.650> line<00:02:13.860> they<00:02:14.460> don't<00:02:14.640> want<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.910> lose<00:02:15.390> it

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
on the line they don't want to lose it

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.090 
on the line they don't want to lose it
the<00:02:15.750> risks<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.290> high<00:02:16.440> form<00:02:16.740> they're<00:02:16.890> going<00:02:17.040> to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
the risks to high form they're going to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.320 
the risks to high form they're going to
fold<00:02:17.310> you're<00:02:17.580> going<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.760> win<00:02:17.910> what's<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.210> the
