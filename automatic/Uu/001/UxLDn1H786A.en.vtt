these lines that line up set up before
the<00:00:20.400> series<00:00:20.789> starts<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.270> they<00:00:21.390> are<00:00:21.510> probably

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the series starts so they are probably

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.960 
the series starts so they are probably

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
thinking but basically they put up

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.260 
thinking but basically they put up
tempest<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:05.309> also<00:01:05.460> put<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.790> fire<00:01:06.000> fist

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
in the first four games and both of them

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.510 
in the first four games and both of them
suck<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.840> we're<00:01:10.409> gonna<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.680> saying<00:01:11.010> whether

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
suck so we're gonna be saying whether

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.420 
suck so we're gonna be saying whether
this<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.750> benefit<00:01:13.590> Air<00:01:14.070> Force<00:01:14.250> ace

this is going to benefit Air Force ace

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.359 
this is going to benefit Air Force ace
by<00:01:14.640> giving<00:01:14.939> him<00:01:15.030> win<00:01:15.810> very<00:01:16.380> early<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.100> this

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
by giving him win very early in this

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.420 
by giving him win very early in this
onine<00:01:18.030> series<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.840> season<00:01:19.500> rather<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.189> pro

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
onine series a season rather of the pro

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.609 
onine series a season rather of the pro
league<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.210> gotta<00:01:21.540> say<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.900> also<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.590> like

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
league and I gotta say I also do like

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.170 
league and I gotta say I also do like
the<00:01:22.950> pro<00:01:23.130> league<00:01:23.280> format<00:01:23.610> better<00:01:23.850> than<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the pro league format better than the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.109 
the pro league format better than the
winner's<00:01:24.420> league<00:01:25.159> one<00:01:26.159> way<00:01:26.369> actually<00:01:26.970> that

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
winner's league one way actually that

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.760 
winner's league one way actually that
you<00:01:27.420> guys<00:01:27.600> would<00:01:27.780> never<00:01:27.900> notice<00:01:28.140> probably<00:01:28.650> if

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you guys would never notice probably if

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.170 
you guys would never notice probably if
you<00:01:28.860> don't<00:01:29.009> cast<00:01:29.250> games<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
you don't cast games it's because it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.330 
you don't cast games it's because it
actually<00:01:30.689> makes<00:01:31.049> some<00:01:31.229> getting<00:01:31.710> spoiled<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
actually makes some getting spoiled a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.490 
actually makes some getting spoiled a
lot<00:01:32.520> harder<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.150> otherwise<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:34.290> we

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
lot harder because otherwise if we

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.800 
lot harder because otherwise if we
somehow<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:35.159> who's<00:01:35.369> playing<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.970> Game<00:01:36.780> two

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
somehow see who's playing in Game two

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.289 
somehow see who's playing in Game two
we'll<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.320> who's<00:01:37.470> player<00:01:37.770> 1<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.310> game<00:01:38.430> 1<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
we'll know who's player 1 in game 1 and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.480 
we'll know who's player 1 in game 1 and
it's<00:01:39.930> very<00:01:40.229> easy<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.799> get<00:01:40.860> spoiled<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.340> way

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
it's very easy to get spoiled that way

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.700 
it's very easy to get spoiled that way
so<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.810> slightly<00:01:42.960> easier<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.530> us<00:01:43.619> to

I was a little bit excited just a little
bit<00:04:03.209> that<00:04:03.390> reached<00:04:03.660> one<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.170> I<00:04:04.200> didn't

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
actually have my brain working at the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.539 
actually have my brain working at the

it's different for a whole lot of other

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.289 
it's different for a whole lot of other
reasons<00:04:16.890> but<00:04:17.190> right<00:04:17.310> now<00:04:17.520> what<00:04:17.910> matters<00:04:18.270> is

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
reasons but right now what matters is

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.630 
reasons but right now what matters is
Casey<00:04:18.900> has<00:04:19.140> gone<00:04:19.289> for<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.530> bunker<00:04:20.190> rush<00:04:20.370> and

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
Casey has gone for a bunker rush and

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.550 
Casey has gone for a bunker rush and
there's<00:04:21.060> ten<00:04:21.419> drones<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:21.870> think<00:04:22.080> blocking

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
there's ten drones I think blocking

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.180 
there's ten drones I think blocking
right<00:04:22.710> now<00:04:22.830> and

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
right now and

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.060 
right now and
I<00:04:23.220> think<00:04:23.400> it's<00:04:23.550> actually<00:04:23.730> gonna<00:04:23.970> work<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:25.070> this

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
I think it's actually gonna work so this

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.790 
I think it's actually gonna work so this
actually<00:04:26.550> has<00:04:26.580> worked<00:04:26.910> out<00:04:27.210> for<00:04:27.600> um<00:04:27.810> for<00:04:28.590> or

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
actually has worked out for um for or

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.560 
actually has worked out for um for or
for<00:04:28.920> fire<00:04:29.160> fists<00:04:29.670> he's<00:04:29.940> actually<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.450> think

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
for fire fists he's actually I think

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.780 
for fire fists he's actually I think
managing<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.590> hold<00:04:32.010> off<00:04:32.130> this<00:04:32.310> bunker<00:04:32.640> brush

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
managing to hold off this bunker brush

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.370 
managing to hold off this bunker brush
and<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.360> ease<00:04:33.540> gonna<00:04:33.780> be<00:04:33.900> okay

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
and the ease gonna be okay

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.380 
and the ease gonna be okay
I<00:04:34.410> don't<00:04:34.890> think<00:04:35.010> he<00:04:35.070> even<00:04:35.100> lost<00:04:35.340> a<00:04:35.640> drone<00:04:36.150> there

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
I don't think he even lost a drone there

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.680 
I don't think he even lost a drone there
that's<00:04:37.080> very<00:04:37.230> nice<00:04:37.620> for<00:04:37.680> him<00:04:38.130> but<00:04:38.970> oh<00:04:39.120> man<00:04:39.480> look

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
that's very nice for him but oh man look

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.370 
that's very nice for him but oh man look
at<00:04:39.780> this

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
at this

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.860 
at this
very<00:04:41.100> clever<00:04:41.400> from<00:04:41.730> Casey<00:04:42.000> putting<00:04:42.510> up<00:04:42.660> a

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
very clever from Casey putting up a

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.170 
very clever from Casey putting up a
factory<00:04:43.680> all<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.220> way<00:04:44.310> in<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.550> bottom<00:04:44.790> there

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
factory all the way in the bottom there

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.000 
factory all the way in the bottom there
there's<00:04:45.330> no<00:04:45.660> way<00:04:45.690> that<00:04:46.260> fire<00:04:46.530> fist<00:04:46.770> is<00:04:46.860> gonna

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
there's no way that fire fist is gonna

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.560 
there's no way that fire fist is gonna
spot<00:04:47.250> that<00:04:47.430> in<00:04:47.520> fact<00:04:47.730> it<00:04:47.940> might<00:04:48.180> even<00:04:48.240> get

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
spot that in fact it might even get

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.780 
spot that in fact it might even get
floated<00:04:48.990> into<00:04:49.410> his<00:04:49.710> base<00:04:50.010> now<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.730> I'm

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
floated into his base now that I'm

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.930

looking at a map here of this map there

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.690 
looking at a map here of this map there
is<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.120> very<00:04:54.450> large<00:04:54.720> you<00:04:55.530> know<00:04:55.650> area<00:04:56.160> behind

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
and it's far away from your ramp so you

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.520 
and it's far away from your ramp so you
know<00:05:05.220> we<00:05:05.340> could<00:05:05.520> be<00:05:05.640> seeing<00:05:05.910> a<00:05:06.330> possible<00:05:07.170> sneak

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
know we could be seeing a possible sneak

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.670 
know we could be seeing a possible sneak
of<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:08.100> of<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:09.110> factory<00:05:10.110> up<00:05:10.230> there<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:10.560> that

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
of the of the factory up there and that

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.890 
of the of the factory up there and that
would<00:05:10.770> be<00:05:10.890> just<00:05:11.190> devastating<00:05:11.790> if<00:05:12.510> he<00:05:12.660> doesn't

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
would be just devastating if he doesn't

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.140 
would be just devastating if he doesn't

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
by the way of course this is an app that

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.100 
by the way of course this is an app that
is<00:05:20.490> very<00:05:20.760> different<00:05:21.120> once<00:05:21.330> again<00:05:21.600> I'm<00:05:21.870> sorry

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
about having to explain that and your

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.740 
about having to explain that and your
natural<00:05:25.200> expansion<00:05:25.830> here<00:05:26.040> is<00:05:26.220> not<00:05:26.970> that<00:05:27.419> easy

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
natural expansion here is not that easy

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.500 
natural expansion here is not that easy
to<00:05:27.870> defend<00:05:28.440> because<00:05:29.340> I<00:05:29.610> believe<00:05:30.240> there's

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
to defend because I believe there's

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.570 
to defend because I believe there's
actually<00:05:30.660> no<00:05:31.110> direct<00:05:31.650> entrance<00:05:32.160> here<00:05:32.310> this<00:05:32.460> is

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
actually no direct entrance here this is

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.720 
actually no direct entrance here this is
actually<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.030> second<00:05:33.510> natural<00:05:33.690> for<00:05:34.620> for<00:05:35.400> for

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
actually the second natural for for for

barracks the factory landed at the back

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.570 
barracks the factory landed at the back
there<00:06:00.270> and<00:06:00.300> I<00:06:01.020> don't<00:06:01.950> know<00:06:02.130> if<00:06:02.280> this<00:06:02.400> is<00:06:02.520> the

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
there and I don't know if this is the

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.090 
there and I don't know if this is the
beginning<00:06:02.669> of<00:06:03.030> a<00:06:03.120> mech<00:06:03.360> build<00:06:03.600> or<00:06:03.870> of<00:06:04.200> just

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
beginning of a mech build or of just

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.400 
beginning of a mech build or of just
some<00:06:05.250> kind<00:06:05.460> of<00:06:05.550> strangeness<00:06:06.150> here<00:06:06.600> just<00:06:07.290> maybe

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
some kind of strangeness here just maybe

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.510 
some kind of strangeness here just maybe
a<00:06:07.730> vulture<00:06:08.730> harass<00:06:09.120> into<00:06:09.650> something<00:06:10.650> else<00:06:10.830> but

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
a vulture harass into something else but

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.190 
a vulture harass into something else but
I'm<00:06:12.120> actually<00:06:12.300> curious<00:06:12.630> of<00:06:12.870> how<00:06:12.930> he's<00:06:13.080> gonna

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
I'm actually curious of how he's gonna

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.420 
I'm actually curious of how he's gonna
get<00:06:13.380> this<00:06:13.470> vulture<00:06:13.680> in<00:06:13.890> I<00:06:14.010> guess<00:06:14.160> he's<00:06:14.310> gonna

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
get this vulture in I guess he's gonna

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.490 
get this vulture in I guess he's gonna
have<00:06:14.640> used<00:06:14.790> the<00:06:14.910> SCV<00:06:15.300> trick<00:06:15.780> to<00:06:15.930> get<00:06:16.050> in<00:06:16.230> here

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
have used the SCV trick to get in here

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.710 
have used the SCV trick to get in here
because<00:06:17.010> he<00:06:17.220> actually<00:06:17.730> has<00:06:17.880> not<00:06:18.180> gotten<00:06:18.480> into

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
because he actually has not gotten into

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.290 
because he actually has not gotten into
the<00:06:18.900> natural<00:06:19.050> expansion<00:06:19.760> this<00:06:20.760> is<00:06:20.880> actually

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
the natural expansion this is actually

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.210 
the natural expansion this is actually
uh<00:06:21.590> just<00:06:22.640> the<00:06:23.640> back<00:06:23.910> of<00:06:23.940> the<00:06:24.919> second<00:06:25.919> expansion

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
uh just the back of the second expansion

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.520 
uh just the back of the second expansion
oh<00:06:26.640> look<00:06:27.360> at<00:06:27.480> that

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
oh look at that

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.470 
oh look at that
fire<00:06:29.010> fist<00:06:29.340> I<00:06:29.370> think<00:06:29.580> knew<00:06:29.730> it<00:06:29.880> was<00:06:29.970> coming<00:06:30.360> and
