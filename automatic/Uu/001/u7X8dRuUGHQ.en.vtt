people in old car hoods and biggest

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.510 
people in old car hoods and biggest
problem<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.440> noticed<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.829> they<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:49.980> about<00:00:50.219> ten

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
problem we noticed is they do about ten

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.010 
problem we noticed is they do about ten
feet<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.090> jump<00:00:51.360> off<00:00:51.539> because<00:00:51.899> they

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
feet and have to jump off because they

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.660 
feet and have to jump off because they
keep<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.620> fast<00:00:52.890> they<00:00:53.129> couldn't<00:00:53.489> turn

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
keep going so fast they couldn't turn

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.240 
keep going so fast they couldn't turn
couldn't<00:00:54.270> control<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.829> figured<00:00:56.129> well

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
couldn't control it so we figured well

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.830 
couldn't control it so we figured well
there's<00:00:56.399> got<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.760> better<00:00:57.030> way<00:00:57.270> something

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
there's got to be a better way something

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.180 
there's got to be a better way something
to<00:00:57.930> make<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> walk<00:00:58.350> back<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:59.070> bit

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
to make the walk back up a little bit

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.340 
to make the walk back up a little bit
more<00:00:59.340> enjoyable<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.840> started<00:01:01.170> fooling

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
more enjoyable so we started fooling

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.750 
more enjoyable so we started fooling
around<00:01:01.590> some<00:01:01.770> different<00:01:02.039> designs<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.579> we

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
around some different designs and we

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
around some different designs and we
came<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.660> idea<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.170> had<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
came up with the idea that you had to

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.230 
came up with the idea that you had to
have<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> B<00:01:04.860> bottom<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> board<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.150> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
have a B bottom on the board so you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600 
have a B bottom on the board so you
could<00:01:06.360> switch<00:01:06.570> from<00:01:06.720> edge<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.900> edge<00:01:07.140> well<00:01:08.100> we

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
could switch from edge to edge well we

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.649 
could switch from edge to edge well we
came<00:01:08.790> up<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> only<00:01:09.420> way<00:01:09.510> you're<00:01:09.600> gonna

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
came up with the only way you're gonna

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.179 
came up with the only way you're gonna
get<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.049> design<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.439> snow<00:01:10.860> go<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
get that design and snow go to a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.190 
get that design and snow go to a
laminated<00:01:11.880> board<00:01:12.150> under<00:01:12.780> lots<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.140> pressure

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
laminated board under lots of pressure

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.080 
laminated board under lots of pressure
using<00:01:13.920> heat

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
using heat

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.420 
using heat
about<00:01:15.689> two<00:01:15.990> tons<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.350> pressure<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.770> get<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
about two tons of pressure to get the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.420 
about two tons of pressure to get the
bend<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.079> and<00:01:19.079> so<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.500> did<00:01:19.649> that<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.130> we

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
bend in it and so we did that and we

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.710 
bend in it and so we did that and we
brought<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.880> board<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.630> that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
brought the board out here and that

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.179 
brought the board out here and that
worked<00:01:22.259> really<00:01:22.350> good<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.829> down<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> hill

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
worked really good going down the hill

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.319 
worked really good going down the hill
we<00:01:23.310> could<00:01:23.460> turn<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.789> could<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:24.030> from<00:01:24.210> edge<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
we could turn we could go from edge to

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.270 
we could turn we could go from edge to
edge<00:01:24.680> for<00:01:25.680> me<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> greatest

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
edge for me it's just the greatest

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:55.770 
edge for me it's just the greatest
feeling<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.789> the<00:01:26.850> world

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.690 

once<00:01:56.780> we<00:01:56.900> we<00:01:57.350> had<00:01:57.500> turns<00:01:57.890> down<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:58.460> we<00:01:58.520> could

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
once we we had turns down and we could

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.060 
once we we had turns down and we could
carve<00:01:59.120> faces<00:01:59.390> fairly<00:01:59.990> well<00:02:00.140> we<00:02:00.740> started

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
carve faces fairly well we started

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.610 
carve faces fairly well we started
looking<00:02:01.190> at<00:02:01.550> jump<00:02:01.970> scenarios<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:03.320> do<00:02:03.440> this

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
looking at jump scenarios and to do this

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.200 
looking at jump scenarios and to do this
we<00:02:03.830> had<00:02:04.010> to<00:02:04.040> have<00:02:04.220> an<00:02:04.370> adequate<00:02:04.670> binding

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
we had to have an adequate binding

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.330 
we had to have an adequate binding
system<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:05.690> keeps<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.930> board<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.260> our<00:02:06.290> feet<00:02:06.560> so

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
system that keeps a board to our feet so

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.850 
system that keeps a board to our feet so
we<00:02:07.370> we<00:02:08.240> looked<00:02:08.450> around<00:02:08.570> at<00:02:09.350> different<00:02:09.380> things

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
we we looked around at different things

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.400 
we we looked around at different things
ropes<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.940> certain<00:02:11.420> bungee<00:02:11.780> cords<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.230> stuff

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
ropes and certain bungee cords and stuff

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.830 
ropes and certain bungee cords and stuff
leashes<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.209> nothing<00:02:14.209> seemed<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.420> work<00:02:14.660> too

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
leashes and nothing seemed to work too

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.960 
leashes and nothing seemed to work too
well<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.170> we<00:02:15.290> came<00:02:15.560> up<00:02:15.680> with<00:02:15.830> with<00:02:16.490> two<00:02:16.730> rubber

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
well and we came up with with two rubber

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.300 
well and we came up with with two rubber
straps<00:02:17.360> attached<00:02:18.170> laterally<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.040> board

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
straps attached laterally to the board

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.510 
straps attached laterally to the board
and<00:02:19.750> what<00:02:20.750> happens<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.290> they<00:02:21.650> go<00:02:21.830> over<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.220> over

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
and what happens is they go over it over

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.820 
and what happens is they go over it over
the<00:02:22.910> top<00:02:23.150> crown<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.660> your<00:02:23.810> foot<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:24.470> over<00:02:24.739> the

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
the top crown of your foot and over the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.220 
the top crown of your foot and over the
toes<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.520> when<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.030> jump<00:02:26.690> up<00:02:26.810> into<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.080> air

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
toes and when you jump up into the air

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.380 
toes and when you jump up into the air
these<00:02:27.440> secured<00:02:28.340> your<00:02:28.489> feet<00:02:28.670> really<00:02:28.940> well<00:02:29.180> to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390

these secured your feet really well to
the<00:02:29.480> board<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:30.380> found<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.830> also<00:02:31.250> these

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
the board we found that also these

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.449 
the board we found that also these
bindings<00:02:32.720> helped<00:02:32.959> us<00:02:33.080> control<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.130> board

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
bindings helped us control the board

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.970 
bindings helped us control the board
quite<00:02:34.820> well<00:02:35.060> under<00:02:35.720> really<00:02:36.500> radical
