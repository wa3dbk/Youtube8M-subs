00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.130
 and on it goes with my April Fool's joke meets and how are they without 

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:08.680
 our really multifunctional coloring can live on both sides 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.499
 forever 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:14.199
 also he can build loud and 4 the here should be a very disturbing entrance of the 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.960
 she looks beautiful 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.829
 Farmer that Norman is so 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.579
 it was we have already finished our small Slomka already one is 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.579
 the hammer and wood we need a bit of wood now 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.599
 PÃ¶lten wood is always good to build and 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.870
 Sor hammer enough wood today impoverished who customers now a bit the impoverished 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.569
 Surroundings and the one in Naples always flash good you were mushrooms 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.370
 everyone 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.280
 Mushrooms third places and I hope that diamonds on the surface 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.180
 because where else should I look for I know if I bio things 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.540
 so take a look this is a very interesting woodland Iceman yourself 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.890
 then continue to look at what they will probably soon rescued 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.680
 We are here October a god that's the hammer here, just click one 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.640
 its surface why is not it a diamond i hate this game like that 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.890
 so much and we keep trying with the ones here now 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.220
 so far not pay out so easy this evening we need it again 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.740
 we are just amazing things again 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.720
 much cooler 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.400
 such are more and more trees which percent demand percent in the after 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.710
 I want to say a tree house percent that they will still together 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.760
 get a dirty tree house 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.760
 who understands what I mean and percent we have to first now a sheep 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.910
 killing sharp sounds are always good 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.950
 Rise looks 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.200
 Persevered every year before% is not my thing yes 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.410
 and why now again our farm we would still have somewhere here 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.670
 have built 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.789
 and I just lost the orientation No No there are mushrooms and 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.680
 well, yes, I think she is 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.080
 is that meant means my bunker 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.080
 and percent even if I became a nation now 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.240
 worry there and marked that I would definitely find again if 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.779
 Bauer what should then 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.779
 but the way 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.779
 so the whole thing has a bit 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.829
 realistic food tree 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.259
 because then I can go in here and close the door 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.549
 that's a bit of space, there's still a function for me 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.189
 someone else who just looks a bit and has it right next door 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.309
 I fell the windows 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:37.099
 I'll go there again a bit the digger Sorger no there 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.459
 Diamond found I did my best then it is again 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.580
 go to my house because I'm still in Wallwitz doing in this game 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.580
 so give it back in and out and in and out 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.059
 then see us for the last time 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:53.429
