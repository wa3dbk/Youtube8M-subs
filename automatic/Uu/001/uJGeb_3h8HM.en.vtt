00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:02.370
 which hit 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.120
 after school right away 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.589
 after school set to serve at all 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.249
 Well, yes, in general 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:10.289
 why do you need your service 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:11.719
 uah 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.719
 the process goes mean youth on this 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.519
 Department of Prestige 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.089
 the other day round my communication 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.619
 they are ok 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.079
 in the civil service g unsurprisingly 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.819
 civilian machine 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.310
 ride 4 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.170
 as said with respect 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.770
 basically not at all 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.910
 meters 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.730
 Well, that is what you think in this 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.390
 process is not right 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.360
 according to their data for now I can not in this 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.630
 moment part 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.630
 cube 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.680
 Tarasiuk 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.280
 clearly the new region represented 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.510
 Commission complex conflicts were good 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.070
 all the guys seem to be gone he fell on the lawn 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.220
 conditions for research and 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.140
 worry 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.010
 its called it is well aware 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.340
 this 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.850
 let's say the same as in other parts 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.950
 most significant 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.480
 intentionally by the whole world 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.780
 but on the development of such 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.780
 can plant instantly that 2 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.130
 in Kiev 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.260
 but as soon as the form 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.570
 four 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.710
 the newspaper I set open for such 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.790
 how I was right 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.090
 after school that is going to serve 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.520
 at all 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.500
 I believe that the opening point 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.860
 need very often to young people young people 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.850
 saw no one 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.260
 we still shouldn't start anyone 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
 similar step 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.740
 man, that is, it will work there 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.920
 row of objects 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.850
 but what a very conditional relationship 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.290
 in general, here in normal people 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.350
 team of specialists 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.350
 mb 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.120
 no, he is nothing 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.210
 no problem because these tasks 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.019
 are solved and solved 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.050
 i.e 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.770
 Of course it's hard to get full 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.770
 the question of compliance is necessary 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.099
 as long as the nutrition work of the parliament would be 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.950
 normal country united Russia 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.120
 it will be a normal team ok 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.649
 everything is ok 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:27.700
 need to do something to the text 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.599
 mistake 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.289
 everything is ok 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:32.509
 I have not set yet 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:34.449
 this time staff 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:35.859
 then of course not enough 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.219
 teachers 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.219
 I expected the Hall of Fame 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:44.709
 but something said to those who have not served 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.039
 you can listen easier 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.349
 and if may 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.299
 this is a very small deficit size 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:49.930
 budget
