00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
an easy project especially a scarfin of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.380 
an easy project especially a scarfin of
these<00:00:46.739> planks<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.000> spring

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
these planks because you get to spring

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.650 
these planks because you get to spring
them<00:00:48.539> down<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:49.800> cut<00:00:50.550> them<00:00:50.640> off<00:00:50.910> where

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
them down and then cut them off where

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.180 
them down and then cut them off where
you<00:00:51.809> want<00:00:52.050> them<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.350> scarf<00:00:52.800> them<00:00:53.010> with

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
you want them and scarf them with

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.160 
you want them and scarf them with
electric<00:00:53.730> plane<00:00:54.000> right<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.420> position<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
electric plane right in position and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.470 
electric plane right in position and
then<00:00:55.770> push<00:00:56.039> them<00:00:56.190> back<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.640> into<00:00:56.850> place<00:00:57.180> and

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
then push them back up into place and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.849 
then push them back up into place and
then<00:00:57.539> obviously<00:00:58.050> I'm<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> fit<00:00:58.590> pieces

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
then obviously I'm going to fit pieces

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.830 
then obviously I'm going to fit pieces
that<00:00:59.520> are<00:00:59.609> scoffed<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.149> both<00:01:00.390> ends<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
that are scoffed on both ends and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.299 
that are scoffed on both ends and
that'll<00:01:01.140> take<00:01:01.289> care<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> project<00:01:02.070> all

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that'll take care of the project all

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.590 
that'll take care of the project all
right<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.609> want<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.149> tell<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.480> little

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
right I just want to tell you a little

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.390 
right I just want to tell you a little
bit<00:01:03.750> more<00:01:04.080> about<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.500> plastic<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.369> use

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
bit more about this plastic that we use

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.399 
bit more about this plastic that we use
in<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:05.939> sistah<00:01:06.270> frames<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.990> got<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> piece

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
in for sistah frames we got a piece

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 
in for sistah frames we got a piece
right<00:01:07.650> here<00:01:07.760> now<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.000> stuff<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.479> quite

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
right here now this stuff is quite

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.399 
right here now this stuff is quite
flexible<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.909> does<00:01:12.090> flex<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.900> Bend<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
flexible and it does flex and Bend a

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.140 
flexible and it does flex and Bend a
little<00:01:13.680> bit<00:01:13.830> more<00:01:14.070> if<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.250> heat<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.640> slightly

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
little bit more if you heat it slightly

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.270 
little bit more if you heat it slightly
or<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.689> warm<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.259> maybe<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> sunlight

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
or just warm it up maybe in the sunlight

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.450 
or just warm it up maybe in the sunlight
but<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.549> does<00:01:17.700> Bend<00:01:18.030> nice<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:19.159> ice-cold<00:01:20.159> it

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
but it does Bend nice and ice-cold it

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.120 
but it does Bend nice and ice-cold it
bends<00:01:20.700> quite<00:01:21.150> well<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:22.140> can't<00:01:22.409> strip<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.860> screw

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
bends quite well you can't strip a screw

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.600 
bends quite well you can't strip a screw
in<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:24.000> cannot<00:01:24.750> break<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:26.280> does<00:01:26.580> not

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
in it you cannot break it it does not

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.850 
in it you cannot break it it does not
conduct<00:01:27.210> electricity<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.320> fastenings

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
conduct electricity so the fastenings

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.740 
conduct electricity so the fastenings
don't<00:01:29.100> go<00:01:29.250> bad<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
don't go bad in it and it's just a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.830 
don't go bad in it and it's just a
fantastic<00:01:31.490> replacement<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:33.060> oak<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.540> this

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
fantastic replacement for oak in this

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.679 
fantastic replacement for oak in this
situation<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:35.070> plastic<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.060> probably

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
situation this plastic I probably

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.390 
situation this plastic I probably
wouldn't<00:01:37.049> use<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.409> floor<00:01:37.799> timbers<00:01:38.250> or

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
wouldn't use it for floor timbers or

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.160 
wouldn't use it for floor timbers or
something<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.820> wanted<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.270> stay<00:01:39.479> incredibly

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
something I wanted to stay incredibly

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.830 
something I wanted to stay incredibly
stiff<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.280> I'm<00:01:41.430> using<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
stiff but what I'm using it for is to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
these frames and build another boat out

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.740 
these frames and build another boat out
of<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.460> suspect<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:03.180> they'll<00:02:03.479> be<00:02:03.570> in

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
