00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360 

against<00:00:00.240> you<00:00:00.329> I<00:00:01.140> think<00:00:01.709> it's<00:00:01.890> better<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:04.370> three

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
against you I think it's better to three

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.760 
against you I think it's better to three
that<00:00:05.549> bigger<00:00:05.759> when<00:00:05.970> you're<00:00:06.060> out<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.210> position

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 
that bigger when you're out of position

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.480 
that bigger when you're out of position
but<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:08.660> mean<00:00:09.740> it's<00:00:10.740> not<00:00:10.860> making<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.250> big

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
but I mean it's not making a big

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.249 
but I mean it's not making a big
difference<00:00:11.670> but<00:00:12.090> if<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.330> do<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.599> math<00:00:12.630> if

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
difference but if you do the math if

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.200 
difference but if you do the math if
you've<00:00:13.710> done<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.070> math<00:00:14.219> before<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.820> figure

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
you've done the math before you figure

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.510 
you've done the math before you figure
out<00:00:15.240> why<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.560> big<00:00:16.770> blind<00:00:17.039> can<00:00:17.310> make<00:00:17.490> a

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
out why this one big blind can make a

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.160 
out why this one big blind can make a
big<00:00:17.760> difference<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.420> like<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:19.430> mean<00:00:21.109> let<00:00:22.109> me

call<00:02:28.299> pot<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.250> means<00:02:31.459> we<00:02:31.609> can<00:02:31.790> calculate

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
call pot so that means we can calculate

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.690 
call pot so that means we can calculate
the<00:02:32.180> pots<00:02:32.540> which<00:02:32.810> means<00:02:33.019> that<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.769> is<00:02:34.040> you

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
the pots which means that this is you

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.449 
the pots which means that this is you
know<00:02:34.850> two<00:02:35.269> to<00:02:35.390> one<00:02:35.540> would<00:02:35.690> be<00:02:35.810> 12<00:02:36.109> to<00:02:36.350> six<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.010> 13

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
know two to one would be 12 to six so 13

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.420 
know two to one would be 12 to six so 13
to<00:02:37.640> six<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.120> going<00:02:38.329> to<00:02:38.390> be<00:02:38.570> better<00:02:39.320> than<00:02:39.950> two<00:02:40.310> to

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
to six is going to be better than two to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.420 
to six is going to be better than two to
one<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.230> give<00:02:42.410> him<00:02:42.530> better<00:02:42.739> partisan<00:02:43.280> two

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
one so you give him better partisan two

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.650 
one so you give him better partisan two
to<00:02:43.549> one<00:02:43.730> which<00:02:44.030> means<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.450> he<00:02:45.200> needs<00:02:45.380> less

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
to one which means that he needs less

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.259 
to one which means that he needs less
than<00:02:47.660> thirty<00:02:48.109> three<00:02:48.410> percent<00:02:49.269> thirty-three

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
than thirty three percent thirty-three

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.140 
than thirty three percent thirty-three
percent<00:02:50.450> equity<00:02:51.100> right<00:02:52.100> if<00:02:52.340> he<00:02:52.640> needs<00:02:52.940> less

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
percent equity right if he needs less

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.000 
percent equity right if he needs less
than<00:02:53.329> thirty<00:02:53.540> three<00:02:53.720> percent<00:02:53.750> equity<00:02:54.170> he<00:02:54.799> can

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
than thirty three percent equity he can

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.520 
than thirty three percent equity he can
defend<00:02:55.340> some<00:02:55.910> very<00:02:56.630> speculative<00:02:57.170> hands

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
defend some very speculative hands

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.550 
defend some very speculative hands
profitably<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.310> he<00:02:58.489> also<00:02:58.640> has<00:02:58.790> position

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
profitably and he also has position

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.330 
profitably and he also has position
right<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:00.920> position<00:03:01.519> is<00:03:02.410> good<00:03:03.410> for<00:03:03.680> him<00:03:03.829> so

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
right so position is good for him so

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.170 
right so position is good for him so
position<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.239> less<00:03:05.690> than<00:03:05.930> 33<00:03:06.350> present

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
position and less than 33 present

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.920 
position and less than 33 present
needing<00:03:08.180> less<00:03:08.299> than<00:03:08.510> thirty<00:03:08.690> three<00:03:08.900> percent

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
needing less than thirty three percent

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.370 
needing less than thirty three percent
you<00:03:09.799> know<00:03:09.829> this<00:03:10.100> is<00:03:10.130> two<00:03:10.459> spots<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.870> make<00:03:12.140> him

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
you know this is two spots that make him

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.500 
you know this is two spots that make him
favorable<00:03:13.310> in<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.519> spot<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:13.940> it's<00:03:14.090> just<00:03:14.269> one

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
favorable in the spot and it's just one

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.420 
favorable in the spot and it's just one
big<00:03:14.540> blinds<00:03:15.079> just<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:15.500> one<00:03:15.739> big<00:03:15.980> blind<00:03:16.250> if

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
big blinds just this one big blind if

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.460 
big blinds just this one big blind if
you<00:03:16.880> make<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.180> part<00:03:17.450> if<00:03:17.569> you<00:03:17.630> make<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:17.989> if<00:03:18.170> you

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
you make it part if you make it if you

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.309 
you make it part if you make it if you
make<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.680> um<00:03:19.120> if<00:03:20.120> you<00:03:20.239> make<00:03:20.389> it<00:03:20.540> ten<00:03:20.870> big<00:03:21.079> blinds

make it um if you make it ten big blinds

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.729 
make it um if you make it ten big blinds
all<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.340> sudden<00:03:22.670> he<00:03:22.940> has<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.090> call<00:03:23.450> 74<00:03:24.079> 14<00:03:24.560> if

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
all of a sudden he has to call 74 14 if

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.960 
all of a sudden he has to call 74 14 if
you<00:03:25.220> make<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.400> 10

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.870 

if<00:03:28.540> you<00:03:28.660> make<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.930> 3<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.440> 10<00:03:29.650> if<00:03:30.190> you<00:03:30.340> make<00:03:30.520> it<00:03:30.640> 10

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
if you make it 3 to 10 if you make it 10

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.190 
if you make it 3 to 10 if you make it 10
then<00:03:31.390> all<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.690> sudden<00:03:31.990> this<00:03:32.910> changes<00:03:33.910> to<00:03:34.200> 14

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
then all of a sudden this changes to 14

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.050 
then all of a sudden this changes to 14
to<00:03:35.950> seven<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:36.760> then<00:03:37.510> he<00:03:38.050> gets<00:03:38.200> exactly<00:03:39.010> 2<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.850> 1

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
to seven and then he gets exactly 2 to 1

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.700 
to seven and then he gets exactly 2 to 1
which<00:03:40.300> means<00:03:40.330> that<00:03:40.600> he<00:03:40.840> needs<00:03:41.050> exactly<00:03:41.500> thirty

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
which means that he needs exactly thirty

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.290 
which means that he needs exactly thirty
three<00:03:41.920> percent<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.430> with<00:03:42.610> some<00:03:42.910> hands<00:03:43.180> he

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
three percent and with some hands he

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.150 
three percent and with some hands he
doesn't<00:03:43.600> have<00:03:43.690> thirty<00:03:43.870> three<00:03:44.080> percent<00:03:44.110> so<00:03:44.920> at

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
doesn't have thirty three percent so at

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.370 
doesn't have thirty three percent so at
least<00:03:45.400> you're<00:03:46.060> causing<00:03:46.600> him<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:47.200> make<00:03:47.350> a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
least you're causing him to make a

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.250 
least you're causing him to make a
mathematical<00:03:48.220> mistake<00:03:48.370> right<00:03:49.120> that's<00:03:50.110> what

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
mathematical mistake right that's what

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.660 
mathematical mistake right that's what
you're<00:03:50.410> looking<00:03:50.590> for<00:03:50.740> you<00:03:50.860> at<00:03:51.070> least<00:03:51.250> make<00:03:51.610> him

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
you're looking for you at least make him

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.730 
you're looking for you at least make him
make<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.930> cause<00:03:53.260> him<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.560> make<00:03:53.710> a

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
make you cause him to make a

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.470 
make you cause him to make a
mathematical<00:03:54.340> mistake<00:03:54.460> but<00:03:55.060> he<00:03:55.180> can<00:03:55.330> still

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
mathematical mistake but he can still

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.030 
mathematical mistake but he can still
utilize<00:03:55.780> his<00:03:56.140> position<00:03:56.590> that's<00:03:56.740> the<00:03:56.800> problem

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
utilize his position that's the problem

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.190 
utilize his position that's the problem
right<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:58.090> if<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.210> still<00:03:58.390> ask<00:03:58.510> position<00:03:59.020> oh

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
right so if you still ask position oh

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.150 
right so if you still ask position oh
this<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:01.350> want<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.410> do<00:04:02.500> this<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:02.770> red<00:04:02.950> this<00:04:03.100> is

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
this is I want to do this in red this is

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.699 
this is I want to do this in red this is
better<00:04:03.430> so<00:04:04.090> since<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:04.540> still<00:04:04.720> have<00:04:04.840> position

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
better so since you still have position

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:06.870 
better so since you still have position
he's<00:04:05.830> still<00:04:06.040> going<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.220> call<00:04:06.430> some<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.790> the

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
he's still going to call some of the

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.340 
he's still going to call some of the
time<00:04:07.090> but<00:04:07.120> at<00:04:07.540> least<00:04:07.690> he's<00:04:07.900> making<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.230> mistake

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
time but at least he's making a mistake

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.590 
time but at least he's making a mistake
right<00:04:08.620> you<00:04:09.070> just<00:04:09.250> want<00:04:09.490> to<00:04:09.520> get<00:04:10.060> below<00:04:10.450> this

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
right you just want to get below this

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.300 
right you just want to get below this
thirty<00:04:10.900> three<00:04:11.110> percent<00:04:11.140> mark<00:04:11.590> because<00:04:12.100> the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
thirty three percent mark because the

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.710 
thirty three percent mark because the
thing<00:04:12.490> is<00:04:12.520> some<00:04:12.850> of<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.060> hands<00:04:13.270> that<00:04:13.390> he<00:04:13.510> calls

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
thing is some of the hands that he calls

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.500 
thing is some of the hands that he calls
with<00:04:13.930> like<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.200> suited<00:04:14.440> connectors<00:04:14.470> like<00:04:15.510> you

with like the suited connectors like you

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.910 
with like the suited connectors like you
know<00:04:16.630> all<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:17.019> stuff<00:04:17.230> that<00:04:17.290> suited<00:04:17.799> and

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
know all the stuff that suited and

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.500 
know all the stuff that suited and
connected<00:04:18.340> in<00:04:18.430> some<00:04:18.640> way<00:04:18.670> and<00:04:19.030> isn't

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
dominated he at least we'll have even

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.980 
dominated he at least we'll have even
against<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.850> top<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.270> your<00:04:22.360> range<00:04:22.600> like<00:04:22.840> the

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
against the top of your range like the

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.200 
against the top of your range like the
top<00:04:23.230> hands<00:04:23.560> I<00:04:23.680> know<00:04:24.040> like<00:04:24.370> aces<00:04:24.669> kings<00:04:24.850> queens

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
top hands I know like aces kings queens

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.880 
top hands I know like aces kings queens
ace<00:04:25.510> king<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:25.870> all<00:04:25.960> that<00:04:26.110> kind<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.290> stuff<00:04:26.350> he

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
ace king and all that kind of stuff he

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.430 
ace king and all that kind of stuff he
will<00:04:27.010> still<00:04:27.220> have<00:04:27.490> like<00:04:27.810> around<00:04:28.810> thirty<00:04:29.140> three

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
will still have like around thirty three

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.620 
will still have like around thirty three
percent<00:04:29.610> so<00:04:30.610> if<00:04:30.880> you<00:04:30.970> cause<00:04:31.210> him<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.419> make<00:04:31.540> him

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
percent so if you cause him to make him

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.230 
percent so if you cause him to make him
as<00:04:31.750> mathematical<00:04:32.410> mistake<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:33.370> can<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:34.210> can

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
as mathematical mistake you can you can

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.659 
as mathematical mistake you can you can
be<00:04:34.600> sure<00:04:34.930> that<00:04:35.260> at<00:04:35.680> least<00:04:35.710> you've<00:04:36.100> caused<00:04:36.430> him

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
be sure that at least you've caused him

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.850 
be sure that at least you've caused him
to<00:04:36.700> make<00:04:37.000> one<00:04:37.450> mistake<00:04:37.630> but<00:04:38.140> he<00:04:38.440> still<00:04:38.620> has<00:04:38.740> the

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
to make one mistake but he still has the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.860 
to make one mistake but he still has the
position<00:04:39.040> so<00:04:39.340> he's<00:04:39.460> going<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.640> utilize<00:04:39.850> it<00:04:40.180> so

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
position so he's going to utilize it so

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.330 
position so he's going to utilize it so
really<00:04:41.290> something<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.770> think<00:04:41.830> about<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.220> mean

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
really something to think about I mean

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
call like even in the long run it's not

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.219 
call like even in the long run it's not
a<00:05:12.700> big<00:05:12.880> deal<00:05:12.910> but<00:05:13.060> in<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.390> long<00:05:13.540> run<00:05:13.570> it<00:05:13.990> might

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
you when you shoot a ball like somebody

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.310 
you when you shoot a ball like somebody
gave<00:05:21.640> me<00:05:21.669> this<00:05:21.850> golf<00:05:22.270> analogy<00:05:22.540> if<00:05:23.050> you<00:05:23.200> have

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
gave me this golf analogy if you have

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.340 
gave me this golf analogy if you have
this<00:05:23.440> golf<00:05:23.710> ball<00:05:23.950> and<00:05:24.600> you<00:05:25.600> you<00:05:25.810> hit<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.169> ball

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
this golf ball and you you hit the ball

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.400 
this golf ball and you you hit the ball
like<00:05:26.590> you<00:05:26.800> know<00:05:26.919> at<00:05:27.160> one<00:05:27.580> millimeter<00:05:28.350> at<00:05:29.350> a

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
like you know at one millimeter at a

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.960 
like you know at one millimeter at a
certain<00:05:29.590> point<00:05:29.830> like<00:05:30.040> just<00:05:30.400> one<00:05:30.580> millimeter

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
certain point like just one millimeter

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.450 
certain point like just one millimeter
short<00:05:31.330> of<00:05:31.479> some<00:05:31.750> other<00:05:31.930> way<00:05:32.860> you<00:05:32.919> could<00:05:33.160> hit<00:05:33.310> it

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
short of some other way you could hit it

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.040 
short of some other way you could hit it
it<00:05:33.610> just<00:05:34.150> goes<00:05:34.270> a<00:05:34.330> totally<00:05:34.720> different

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
it just goes a totally different

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.370 
it just goes a totally different
direction<00:05:35.140> and<00:05:35.650> this<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.520> same<00:05:36.729> happens<00:05:37.150> with

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
direction and this the same happens with

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.350 
direction and this the same happens with
with<00:05:38.380> with<00:05:38.710> this<00:05:38.890> if<00:05:39.580> you<00:05:39.700> just<00:05:39.880> make<00:05:40.090> it<00:05:40.120> like

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
with with this if you just make it like

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.430 
with with this if you just make it like
one

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
one

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.800 
one
more<00:05:41.650> big<00:05:41.830> blind<00:05:42.070> can<00:05:42.940> make<00:05:43.120> a<00:05:43.150> big<00:05:43.540> big

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
more big blind can make a big big

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.080 
more big blind can make a big big
difference<00:05:43.960> in<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.290> long<00:05:44.470> run<00:05:44.730> so<00:05:45.730> anyways

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
difference in the long run so anyways

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.790 
difference in the long run so anyways
out<00:05:46.300> this<00:05:46.510> wasn't<00:05:46.810> too<00:05:46.900> long<00:05:47.110> or<00:05:47.260> like<00:05:47.410> to

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
out this wasn't too long or like to

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.940 
out this wasn't too long or like to
whatever<00:05:48.370> but
