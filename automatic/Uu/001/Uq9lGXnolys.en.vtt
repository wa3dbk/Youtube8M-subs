00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.179
 the term no-tillage is originated from the concept of dairo act jairinho which 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.199
 means none of them 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.119
 dinner seeds or seedlings with 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.560
 the minimum of interference in the soil preserving the cover residues 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.849
 vegetable 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.210
 the British and Americans were the pioneers to mechanize the technique 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.690
 but unprepared agricultural production is as old as 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.690
 mom 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.350
 the modern no-tillage system 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.810
 only became reality from research with the chemical control of 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.700
 weed 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.370
 no-tillage today I understood a set of integrated techniques that have 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.570
 improve the environmental conditions to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.320
 possible the genetic potential of crop production 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.850
 three minimum requirements must be observed 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.120
 not soil tipping 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.990
 rotation of crops and use of hedge plants for the formation of 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 straw 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.700
 the adoption of no-tillage express perfect harmony of man with the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.210
 nature and trafficking in the significant to society as a 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.210
 all 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.690
 the use of sugarcane straw at least the retention of moisture in the soil, which 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.090
 reduces the effects of summer 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.240
 increases the amount of organic matter leaving saul richer in 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.820
 nutrients and without the need for constant fertilization since the whole 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.820
 organic matter decomposes on the surface 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.719
 Besides that 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.719
 hinders erosion by wind and rain 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:15.639
 maintaining the scientific and compact substrate firmness 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.899
 the consequences of this are the reduction of costs with and decide 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:22.899
 what is breaking of circles of pests and diseases 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.239
 Forage production for straw yields benefits for the 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.239
 producer who wishes to have a successful culture 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:45.219
 the most used pasture species are aspects and ariscos and science 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.219
 brizantha 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:57.089
 with the use of these forages the result is surprising besides low cost 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:03:01.389
 with implantation and conduction of the species the development of the cultivar 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.330
 and fast and within a few weeks 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.989
 coverage of the area and complete and uniform another benefit 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.889
 is the case of reduced forage desiccation and what is the best coverage 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.889
 after this process 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:23.009
 quality crops generate quality crops and the pasture 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:27.649
 specialized in generating this seed of success throughout the country. 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:32.759
 so in its processing units it can obtain seeds 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.609
 of guilt over this 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:35.869
 treated 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.739
 the uniform 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.909
 and the press 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:46.319
 all this makes possible the reduction of costs per unit produced from the 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.669
 increased productivity 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:49.799
 once again 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.730
 is geni paste in partnership with the best technology bringing satisfaction to the 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:56.419
 rural producer
