00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello my name is Masha and today 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.610
 next culinary blog today I will 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.530
 cook burgers out of the oven 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.710
 I really like this recipe because 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.170
 that he is simple does not need to stand at the stove 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.510
 fry these burgers look so they don't 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.960
 burned out we only need to prepare 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.670
 mince to form chops and shove 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.150
 everything in the oven that we for this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.670
 need of course stuffing with me 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.690
 beef plus pork half a kilo 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.030
 next we need two potatoes 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.610
 onion garlic but it's to taste but mine 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.120
 It turns out three big cloves and two 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.940
 small , we also need a loaf 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.300
 inside a slice well or any crumb 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.270
 you can soak his bread in milk 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.600
 water in general is not critical 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.559
 also salt pepper to put mince 4 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 tablespoons of mayonnaise and breading 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.160
 crackers so that later our burgers them 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.220
 have 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.610
 and let's get started for starters I'll take 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.610
 two potatoes and their friends on large 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:02:06.159
 add garlic and need to push through 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.159
 chesnokodavilku through on a fine grater 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:26.390
 also add to the stuffing further I took 3 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.420
 slices of loaf and I will cut them 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.140
 the crust as we need a start-up 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.380
 In principle, some do not cut off I leave 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.380
 only 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:03:04.099
 our crumb soaked with milk we 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:04.099
 squeeze and also add mince 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.040
 this mush 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:13.610
 further take mayonnaise and add 4 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.610
 tablespoons 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.980
 on the last step we salt and pepper 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:03.430
 ready and we will continue to form 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.550
 cutlets she must wet her hands 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:11.700
 so it will be easier to sculpt them let's 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.700
 fill the tint with a plate 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.380
 and roll in breadcrumbs 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.050
 so all the chops and are made 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:12.470
 and now send them to the oven and 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.470
 we set as evenings 200 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:29.120
 15-20 minutes and now I take the usual 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.960
 butter and on each patty 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:48.140
 I will put on a small piece to 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:52.690
 chops were more than a point put butter 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:56.180
 and send in the oven for another 15 minutes 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.550
 so it took another 15 minutes and so 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.640
 It looks burgers and they are Russian already 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:08.360
 small ones and i will now leave them in 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:13.160
 hot oven for another 5 minutes so our 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.770
 cutlets now put in a plate here 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.650
 such a plate of delicious meatballs 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.900
 It will definitely show you how 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.380
 it looks when cut 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.760
 to eat - since I do not like meat very much and 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.620
 cutlets, respectively, too 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:33.890
 but be sure to show you like this 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.870
 look burgers in the cut I tried 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.640
 a little piece is very bad 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.490
 delicious is no different from 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.040
 fried in a pan and and besides 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.140
 I think they are less fatty than 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.580
 traditional burgers here was such 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:51.070
 I hope you recipe was interesting 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.070
