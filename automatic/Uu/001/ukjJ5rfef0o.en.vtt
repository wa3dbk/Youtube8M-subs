brought reappear which in turn was

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.830 
brought reappear which in turn was
probably<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.570> bad<00:00:57.780> decision<00:00:58.379> no<00:00:59.329> it<00:01:00.329> really<00:01:00.629> hit

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
probably a bad decision no it really hit

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.270 
probably a bad decision no it really hit
a<00:01:00.870> lot<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> zeros<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.710> should<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:01.949> known<00:01:02.070> I

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
a lot of zeros and I should have known I

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.070 
a lot of zeros and I should have known I
should<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.640> known<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.940> CLS<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.690> better<00:01:03.899> at

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
should have known that CLS is better at

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.810 
should have known that CLS is better at
Sammy<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> didn't<00:01:05.100> really<00:01:05.129> realize<00:01:05.400> that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
Sammy but I didn't really realize that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.700 
Sammy but I didn't really realize that
rape<00:01:06.150> he<00:01:06.270> would<00:01:06.360> hit<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.540> many<00:01:06.780> zeros<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
rape he would hit this many zeros the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.109 
rape he would hit this many zeros the
main<00:01:07.890> reason<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.220> broad<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.970> I'm

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
main reason that broad is that I'm

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.520 
main reason that broad is that I'm
really<00:01:09.330> good<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.659> sauce<00:01:09.900> playing<00:01:10.229> or<00:01:10.380> three

really good of sauce playing or three

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.740 
really good of sauce playing or three
unless<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.830> mean<00:01:10.979> em<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.490> rip<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:11.909> CLS<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
unless I mean em with rip here CLS is a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.960 
unless I mean em with rip here CLS is a
little<00:01:13.020> slower<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.979> end<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.760> some

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
little slower and I end up but some

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.789 
little slower and I end up but some
serious<00:01:15.390> Arabia<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.930> end<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.259> still<00:01:16.500> splitting

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
serious Arabia I end up still splitting

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.800 
serious Arabia I end up still splitting
faster<00:01:17.340> than<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.580> meant<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:18.600> end<00:01:18.720> up

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
faster than I meant to and they end up

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.149 
faster than I meant to and they end up
