by squeezing it together and it'll just

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.240 
by squeezing it together and it'll just
pop<00:02:07.550> up<00:02:07.790> just<00:02:08.090> like<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:11.680> then<00:02:12.680> if<00:02:12.980> you're

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
to swirl it around you do not want to

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.130 
to swirl it around you do not want to
shake<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.459> because<00:02:34.970> if<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.480> shake<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.810> you're

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
shake it because if you shake it you're

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.440 
shake it because if you shake it you're
going<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.410> create<00:02:36.770> bubbles<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.670> if<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.300> have

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
going to create bubbles and if you have

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.960 
going to create bubbles and if you have
bubbles<00:02:38.900> inside<00:02:39.440> if<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.280> glitter<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.760> not

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
bubbles inside if the glitter is not

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.690 
bubbles inside if the glitter is not
going<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.420> adhere<00:02:41.570> wherever<00:02:42.320> those<00:02:43.130> bubbles

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
going to adhere wherever those bubbles

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.600 
going to adhere wherever those bubbles
are<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:45.080> why<00:02:45.230> I'm<00:02:45.500> rotating<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.370> like

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
are so this is why I'm rotating it like

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.690 
are so this is why I'm rotating it like
this<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.470> then<00:02:48.470> I'm<00:02:48.650> going<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:48.920> put<00:02:49.130> my<00:02:49.250> finger

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
this and then I'm going to put my finger

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.180 
this and then I'm going to put my finger
on<00:02:49.910> top<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.630> hole<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.770> way<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.040> can

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
on top of the hole and this way you can

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.820 
on top of the hole and this way you can
get<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.640> liquid<00:02:52.820> inside<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.570> actual<00:02:54.140> nozzle

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
get the liquid inside the actual nozzle

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.580 
get the liquid inside the actual nozzle
part<00:02:55.100> of<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.550> bulb<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.209> like<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.050> said<00:02:57.290> you

part of the bulb and like I said you
just<00:02:57.620> want<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.250> rotate<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.910> around<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.450> do<00:02:59.720> not

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750

just want to rotate it around you do not
want<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.620> shake<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:02.140> now<00:03:03.140> I'm<00:03:03.320> just<00:03:03.500> making

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890

rotate<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.620> bulb<00:05:09.830> around<00:05:10.040> because<00:05:10.760> some<00:05:11.450> of

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
rotate the bulb around because some of

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.390 
rotate the bulb around because some of
it<00:05:11.660> gets<00:05:11.780> stuck<00:05:12.110> on<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.470> edges<00:05:12.800> inside<00:05:13.190> the

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
gentle because it is glass now you can

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.020 
gentle because it is glass now you can
just<00:05:21.020> put<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:21.650> top<00:05:21.860> back<00:05:21.919> in<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.580> again<00:05:22.820> you

to fold it in half and cut at this is

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.800 
to fold it in half and cut at this is
our<00:05:45.320> length<00:05:45.560> you<00:05:45.800> think<00:05:46.040> you'd<00:05:46.190> like<00:05:46.810> if

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
like I am you have to kind of fold it

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.770 
like I am you have to kind of fold it
over<00:05:51.410> and<00:05:51.770> then<00:05:52.550> attach<00:05:53.000> it<00:05:53.030> through<00:05:53.450> the<00:05:53.570> loop

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
over and then attach it through the loop

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.469 
over and then attach it through the loop
you<00:05:54.320> can<00:05:54.560> do<00:05:54.800> this<00:05:54.979> step<00:05:55.220> before<00:05:55.430> you<00:05:55.820> attach

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
you can do this step before you attach

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.810 
you can do this step before you attach
the<00:05:56.750> hook<00:05:56.900> back<00:05:57.140> into<00:05:57.200> the<00:05:57.560> bulb<00:05:57.860> if<00:05:58.460> you<00:05:58.610> find

the hook back into the bulb if you find

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.190 
the hook back into the bulb if you find
that's<00:05:58.970> easier<00:05:59.419> it<00:05:59.540> doesn't<00:05:59.840> really<00:05:59.960> matter

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
that's easier it doesn't really matter

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.750 
that's easier it doesn't really matter
it's<00:06:00.470> whatever<00:06:00.620> personal<00:06:01.220> preference<00:06:01.580> you

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
want and now I'm just pulling it through

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.820 
want and now I'm just pulling it through
so<00:06:04.370> it<00:06:04.460> is<00:06:04.520> equally<00:06:05.240> on<00:06:05.600> both<00:06:05.960> sides<00:06:06.500> and<00:06:06.740> I'm

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
so it is equally on both sides and I'm

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.500
