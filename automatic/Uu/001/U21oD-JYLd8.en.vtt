00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:13.509
 Yes is a Hi moonlight this time 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:15.410
 I think that I want to be in the form of dubbing rather than the bo 2 play-by-play 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.730
 Thank you in advance 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:24.320
 This time 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:29.060
 It is a light singer named mk 48 that uses the weapon 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:33.590
 The latest edition corresponding to the latest so far 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:39.160
 For example , I have never used the previous version of bo 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.160
 It's about the first time I've really used it so far 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.420
 A little 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:48.430
 Well what would be what 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.350
 I've been very nervous since I've never had any post-recordings, so good 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.739
 I'm going to meet a woman 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.739
 So the introduction of the attachment that is attached time of Ettoko 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.530
 Double kill net this time 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.400
 Attachment of penguin to 8 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.790
 Finder fmj 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.170
 And it comes with a quick draw 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.920
 Here and here 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.920
 I was raised 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.770
 Well 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.770
 I'm wearing this depression 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.750
 Oh that I mean is fine 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:31.820
 Wide range of applications 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.600
 Me to display display anymore What square price Rutteyuu guy even with fmj is 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.810
 Eh 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.939
 Mr 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:43.800
 With this light machine gun, if you put on it because the power goes up a little 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:46.980
 To Kana through walls is told wall excl. 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:51.010
 Many enemies of Ugh be quite state of the wall 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:57.650
 You can cut quite a bit 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:02:03.670
 Politics and now of this hijacking even when the beating I started the car the place of the right-hand side 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.670
 Even if you can't beat, you will get some assistance . 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:20.689
 In disadvantage that light I wonder if that scene guard of the drawbacks of feel 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.689
 In quite a short distance by it says Mr. Uchida is slow 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:30.409
 When you meet foes at close range with enemies 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.219
 Because Uchida does, if it is a shotgun or a submachine gun, there is a good chance of losing 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.219
 Expensive 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.610
 Is that my ants? 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.280
 Hey this c also c 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.220
 If you can grab and have a tweet or everyone , eh 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.810
 eh 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.989
 In a 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.319
 Here too, a steel kill streak comes out twice 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.630
 Steel kill streak is 5 consecutive 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:01.230
 On this machine 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:04.810
 You will get a sealed streak if you do 5 consecutive 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.120
 This time the daytime streak 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:12.569
 uav and l strike and this machine 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.500
 I put it on l now it is a word to death machine 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:19.680
 It is a place 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.680
 I think that the core is likely to be that many 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.590
 How would 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.590
 Haa 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.670
 How about looking back at the game later in this game 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.670
 eh 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.320
 This is an ally 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.320
 Garden N 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.140
 I do not remember at all ne 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:58.300
 Is it all right if it is okay for allies? Is it three digits? 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.300
 I can not see it at all 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.260
 Depending I'd distance there was a 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.260
 It was hit 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.140
 Something to is very good What if I can not eat I felt fear on your own 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.540
 Oh behind 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.720
 In so that also left another scene 32 shot here 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.030
 Last 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.030
 Because there was an enemy here 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.800
 I forgot what to say 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:44.360
 Because the vertical person turned back back here 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.360
 And a wall-handed This is why I feel it is to say 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.070
 It hit now 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:56.600
 I am not appear hear together 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.600
 It is possible to exchange it and cut it because the power is rising occasionally 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.760
 The reload is late, and the light machine is 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:10.460
 I went to that I mean 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:10.460
 It was a game that I was able to play an active part by saying that it is 26 or 8 Zest 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:19.100
 So I think I've continued to upload audio dubbing videos in the future 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:22.840
 I am happy and enjoy somewhere original dating 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.840
 Thank you for watching until the end
