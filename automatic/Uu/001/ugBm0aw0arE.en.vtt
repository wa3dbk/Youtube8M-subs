00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello there says I always find saskia 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.640
 nice with this 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.640
 hello hello saskia 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.500
 I wonder what to do about it 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.299
 respect of my family and parents and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.619
 sister who is totally not in me 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.930
 to interest 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.640
 how do i deal with this should i put it next 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.199
 accept and accept me 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.359
 try to get a debate 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.730
 it costs so much energy and it is 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.779
 sin 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.699
 but if you have a good question 6 times 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.810
 I think there are people of many 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.030
 people along 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.829
 so talking about all ages yes and also 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.840
 very tricky because you want to follow 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.610
 single family candy first 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.770
 caring or would you like to be one 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.090
 other way do you want you just like that 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.000
 important for him to be loose with his 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.620
 being for you so that means that you can 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.320
 Imagine that sometimes you get there 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.329
 so suffering 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.539
 yes that they don't need no 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.219
 not 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.860
 but you can also be like me 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.460
 though he said what we say about it is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.500
 that you that you with your back to your family 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.030
 wants to stand instead of with your face 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.350
 my family that can sound a bit 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.119
 negative it is so say to manly 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.570
 negative and conceptual but this is one 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.220
 little things are many kids who 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.840
 of course like in the light of them 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.729
 parents and the approval wants there is with 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.590
 a drawing like that to mom or dad 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.090
 faster than questions that approval 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.549
 but look beautiful blanket look 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.990
 look more beautiful and as a metaphor and so stand 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.580
 you face the system 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.170
 to get or hear the approval there 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.580
 yes you see that people often do that than theirs 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.600
 continue to do so throughout life 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.009
 actually a whole life one 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.930
 confirmation to search with them 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.610
 parents of you look good choices 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.260
 making is not only not just me 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.910
 we put the parents afterwards 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.070
 represented by the teacher at school 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.320
 that it might be your employer someone 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.020
 it doesn't matter but there are 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.270
 number of characters number of people in you 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.670
 environment that then symbolize price 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.479
 and what you asked where you feed me a lot 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.820
 is because just that whole 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.220
 drawing this is no longer possible and 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.380
 and how to do is a goal by 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.340
 my parents never accept my 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.390
 will understand never visualize no 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.830
 it sometimes when I Aliette here 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.530
 You signed that as a species 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.540
 generations on each other's shoulder and 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.790
 you are at the top and you look 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.140
 so beyond that your parents can ever do 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.489
 look because your parents have one 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.690
 Certain guidelines can not be met with 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.670
 no more and you get up again 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.560
 their shoulders so you can look further 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.390
 and that last bit there often goes 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.320
 piece that you can see what they are not 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.550
 can see 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.260
 there often goes on the mutual it 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.370
 mutual fuss about because they understand 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.350
 not why the hell you do that 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.120
 does why you make that choice 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.260
 they don't understand you are inclined to it 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.930
 to explain because they are your parents 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.870
 so very much your approval and as long as 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.489
 you keep that construction 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.739
 hostage each other 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.840
 it is what I think parents 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.000
 especially like is that they see that 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.500
 you are doing well and that is you 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.390
 could travel back with your beautiful one 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.500
 stories so that you tell that you share 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.150
 what you have experienced 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.489
 what are your parents proud of 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.500
 and especially if you will go 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.660
 then where they 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.750
 where they can look but 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.420
 don't expect a destination in one 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.800
 gain or the only reaction or even 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.600
 which you'll have a basis for jokes 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.940
 ask your parents' friends how they are 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.040
 talking about you probably already 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.870
 a lot more grateful than that like 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.340
 I'd rather that was an order that than that 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.330
 she sent that to you 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.740
 And that is not at all because they have it 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.430
 wouldn't want it but it is much more 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.910
 one and I would say a natural one 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.740
 reaction 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.720
 you give yourself a bit the 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.480
 answer and I have to let it go 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.260
 well in a way yes but really me too 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.989
 you are not going to be through that yourself 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.520
 my best advice so late expectations 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.090
 that calm but expect of money or 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.489
 there 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.100
 tell that story but in which the 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.510
 job may no longer be on the response 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.130
 yes this continues to invest in the 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.260
 relationship and keep exploring and sharing 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.180
 what you do axum and totally expected 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.580
 nothing in return 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.500
 in fact, the more that is, the more 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.360
 That happens how maybe more you put on 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.340
 the right way because you are 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.590
 more in that area is what its in 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.320
 can see and we call that what 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.730
 complicated evolutionary perspective 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.350
 yes so you go beyond being true 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.940
 stayed 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.490
 and just goes from your generation 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.680
 has remained where your system implementation 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.020
 comes where it left off in that is that 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.250
 stations my beautiful yes yes so you want 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.170
 Don't pay attention to what's not 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.580
 is that they appreciate that 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.959
 also grant recognition but you want 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.910
 especially with what rebel there is something 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.640
 that you are exploring new grounds 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.080
 explore with discover with those out there 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.550
 have not yet come and that is 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.020
 exactly as it should be 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.720
 to be 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.720
 so could we do with motion 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.569
 there is more we have 13 videos 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.860
 made the 13 steps to 365 days 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.659
 successful 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.659
 you can register for it here
