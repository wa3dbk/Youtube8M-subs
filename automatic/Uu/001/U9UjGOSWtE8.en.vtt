back because when the puck is that off

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:01.260 
back because when the puck is that off
now<00:04:58.389> we're<00:04:58.569> starting<00:04:58.840> over<00:04:59.199> again<00:05:00.060> okay<00:05:01.060> if

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
now we're starting over again okay if

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.350 
now we're starting over again okay if
for<00:05:01.690> some<00:05:01.719> reason<00:05:02.349> this<00:05:02.500> time<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:05.789> 1/2<00:05:06.789> is<00:05:07.060> Rome

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
for some reason this time a 1/2 is Rome

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.249 
for some reason this time a 1/2 is Rome
so<00:05:08.259> a<00:05:08.289> three<00:05:08.909> it<00:05:09.909> could<00:05:10.030> also<00:05:10.210> be<00:05:10.389> those<00:05:10.810> snake

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
so a three it could also be those snake

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.480 
so a three it could also be those snake
eyes<00:05:12.060> one<00:05:13.060> two<00:05:13.719> or<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.469> double<00:05:14.860> twelve<00:05:15.190> is

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
eyes one two or the double twelve is

eyes one two or the double twelve is
rolled<00:05:15.789> you<00:05:16.360> would<00:05:16.479> actually<00:05:16.659> lose<00:05:17.110> this<00:05:17.430> so<00:05:18.430> a

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
rolled you would actually lose this so a
