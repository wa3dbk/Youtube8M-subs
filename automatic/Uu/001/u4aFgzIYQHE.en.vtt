00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
don't hit on them a lot unless you have

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.480 
don't hit on them a lot unless you have
higher<00:03:32.350> range<00:03:32.620> than<00:03:32.830> me<00:03:32.950> which<00:03:33.130> you<00:03:33.160> probably

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
higher range than me which you probably

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.090 
higher range than me which you probably
do<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.150> probably<00:03:34.810> don't<00:03:35.080> you're<00:03:35.740> watching<00:03:36.010> a

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
do you probably don't you're watching a

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.090 
do you probably don't you're watching a
guide<00:03:36.310> on<00:03:36.520> this<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:36.940> don't<00:03:37.300> know<00:03:37.570> but<00:03:38.100> pretty

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
guide on this I don't know but pretty

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.550 
guide on this I don't know but pretty
much<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.640> just<00:03:39.940> try<00:03:40.330> like<00:03:40.840> everything<00:03:41.410> in<00:03:41.500> my

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
much I just try like everything in my

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.980 
much I just try like everything in my
power<00:03:41.740> not<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.340> get<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:43.000> black<00:03:43.240> demon<00:03:43.660> they<00:03:43.780> hit

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
power not to get a black demon they hit

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.400 
power not to get a black demon they hit
me<00:03:44.580> stuff<00:03:45.580> so<00:03:45.940> that's<00:03:46.480> pretty<00:03:46.840> much<00:03:47.080> all<00:03:47.230> you

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
me stuff so that's pretty much all you

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.990 
me stuff so that's pretty much all you
have<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.650> do<00:03:47.770> just<00:03:48.100> stay<00:03:48.310> in<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.490> line<00:03:48.700> and

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
have to do just stay in a line and

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.600 
have to do just stay in a line and
hopefully<00:03:49.590> shoot<00:03:50.590> for<00:03:50.860> over<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> hundred

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
hopefully shoot for over a hundred

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.120 
hopefully shoot for over a hundred
thousand<00:03:52.270> points<00:03:52.660> a<00:03:52.780> match<00:03:53.320> because<00:03:53.890> then

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
thousand points a match because then

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.430 
thousand points a match because then
that<00:03:54.340> means<00:03:54.370> you'll<00:03:55.300> be<00:03:55.360> able<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.870> buy<00:03:56.050> all

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
that means you'll be able to buy all

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.070 
that means you'll be able to buy all
these<00:03:56.740> things<00:03:57.070> again<00:03:57.400> because<00:03:57.730> each<00:03:58.080> each

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
these things again because each each

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.370 
these things again because each each
absorb<00:03:59.950> potion<00:04:00.460> in<00:04:00.640> total<00:04:01.090> is<00:04:01.330> 4,000<00:04:02.170> points

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
absorb potion in total is 4,000 points

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.479 
absorb potion in total is 4,000 points
and<00:04:02.890> you'll<00:04:03.430> probably<00:04:03.670> be<00:04:04.120> using<00:04:04.150> up<00:04:04.900> to<00:04:05.170> 22<00:04:05.739> 23

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
and you'll probably be using up to 22 23

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.949 
and you'll probably be using up to 22 23
25<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:08.590> you'll<00:04:09.070> try<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.600> get<00:04:10.600> that<00:04:10.780> many

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
25 and so you'll try to get that many

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.410 
25 and so you'll try to get that many
points<00:04:11.320> and<00:04:11.470> also<00:04:11.650> super<00:04:12.520> ranging<00:04:13.060> potions

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
points and also super ranging potions

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.120 
points and also super ranging potions
they're<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:13.660> thousand<00:04:14.230> each<00:04:14.560> for<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:14.920> full

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
they're a thousand each for a full

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.150 
they're a thousand each for a full
bottle<00:04:15.459> so<00:04:15.910> it's<00:04:16.030> really<00:04:16.180> easy<00:04:16.919> alright<00:04:17.919> well

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
bottle so it's really easy alright well

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.080 
bottle so it's really easy alright well
