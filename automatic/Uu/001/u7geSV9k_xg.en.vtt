00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.960
 hey I thought about it today 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.819
 make a lag spinach roll 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.819
 For that you need four eggs first 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.030
 the four eggs skin is here in 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.760
 the shots and then we will be with 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.140
 stir a whisk and as long 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.970
 we open the eggs here 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.390
 Here I have you to our new channel 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.610
 pure at style cooking welcome from now 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.670
 and at regular intervals I will 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.510
 you can not imagine any of them 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.200
 imitate you 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.980
 in the kitchen or grill we prove 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.080
 cooking is not a witchcraft anyone can do 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.940
 we turn to our 1 as already 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.699
 mentions the connection with a cut 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.650
 Spinat comes to the left next 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.430
 exact quantities that you see on 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.430
 end of the video 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.890
 Here too the thing mix nicely 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.850
 Now we give something to gouda 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.020
 hear 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.190
 nice about not understanding everything and 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.920
 then of course the whole thing will be back 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.049
 spoiled 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.229
 Do not forget for a smile 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.860
 face have so now it is the 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.009
 whole thing 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.390
 We give some pageant with the case is 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.920
 We are now giving black pepper salt 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.710
 also added 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.210
 you proceed according to your taste 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.210
 you salt more others less 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.509
 the gal is part of the whole thing 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.229
 nutmeg 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:52.939
 It's really nice 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:56.500
 so clean when preparing not 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.500
 forget that grad has to go in there 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.240
 in the next step we will be the mass 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.659
 on a baking tray with baking paper part 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.399
 and then in the oven bank 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.119
 The crowds should be nice and even 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.729
 be distributed 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.980
 the oven neck before to 200 degrees 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.230
 raw gasoline and how the second ingredient in 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.110
 pretty big 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.290
 because then on top of that something 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.290
 Parmesan 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.780
 you should just finish grating 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.810
 I say parmesan 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.680
 chamber make fresh is grated 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.320
 simply best 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.980
 so now comes the team for about 10 to 15 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.980
 minutes in the oven 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.360
 when it is finished probably such 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.250
 tomorrow and leave it completely 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.510
 So it really has to be absolute 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:01.500
 to deliver it now you are separating it 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.600
 playful from the baking paper I call 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.360
 now plays plate with just contributes 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.360
 the top down from wobbly 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.459
 minute 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.110
 we have herbed cream cheese here 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.819
 can also take normal cream cheese 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.939
 but comes the cream cheese that still gives 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:26.189
 twice as nice as I say 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:27.540
 but loosely keeps the whole beautiful goofy 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.650
 and then with a spoon just 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.209
 distributed evenly throughout 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.220
 I'm after good cheese fan 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.109
 So the breakfast is nice for 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.720
 I'm fine for the founding myths 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.870
 salt pepper off and bread just 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.870
 ingenious 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.300
 but if we roll our playground 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.460
 too we have bombastic here 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.180
 Smoked salmon we now on top of the 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.570
 Cream cheese is only too sparingly distributed 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.500
 his 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.940
 the turns filled 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.480
 and a little more 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.700
 freshen up a drone 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.760
 stone fruit pieces and dribbles it up 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.520
 over it uni will remember or lemon 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.590
 it does not work 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.450
 so we are already almost at the end 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:18.670
 now the whole thing is granted only 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.670
 to catch up really tight 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.180
 So now we have ourselves 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.070
 a little wrapper and in the 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.610
 We now wrap this wrapping film 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.610
 roll in 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.080
 also here is really nice tight 1 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.639
 so 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.530
 on the sides too 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.870
 that's almost done 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.150
 now comes in for six hours 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.330
 fridge so long you have unfortunately 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.330
 waiting 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.719
 even if he is waiting a bit now 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.909
 but that was worth it 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:17.540
 We now cut finger-thick slices 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:19.220
 down and I have to say it's great 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.530
 These players alex role which is suitable 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.880
 wonderful for cold plates or it too 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.880
 a fantastic party away 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.969
 and what do you say i am sure that 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.039
 it tastes good 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.620
 need salmon roll for the game type 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:41.550
 we four eggs 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.919
 130 grams place the night about 250 grams 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.320
 smoked salmon a pack of herbs 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:50.030

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.940

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.460
 hope you liked it 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.600
 pity the next time again 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.600
