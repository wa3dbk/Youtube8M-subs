00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
looking for some way to get more

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.799 
looking for some way to get more
involved<00:00:46.040> in<00:00:46.129> art<00:00:46.460> contests<00:00:47.089> with<00:00:47.210> uni<00:00:47.479> and

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
involved in art contests with uni and

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.549 
involved in art contests with uni and
miss<00:00:48.530> Kramer<00:00:49.360> asked<00:00:50.360> us<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.540> work<00:00:51.260> on<00:00:51.470> the

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
miss Kramer asked us to work on the

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.380 
miss Kramer asked us to work on the
shoes<00:00:51.830> we<00:00:52.159> had<00:00:52.309> a<00:00:52.339> lot<00:00:52.549> of<00:00:52.580> ideas<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.089> the

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
shoes we had a lot of ideas and the

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.850 
shoes we had a lot of ideas and the
hardest<00:00:53.720> part<00:00:53.809> was<00:00:53.989> probably<00:00:54.170> learning<00:00:54.619> how

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
hardest part was probably learning how

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.289 
hardest part was probably learning how
to<00:00:54.890> figuring<00:00:55.519> out<00:00:55.640> how<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.850> put<00:00:56.150> it<00:00:56.239> all

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
to figuring out how to put it all

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.420 
to figuring out how to put it all
together<00:00:56.479> I<00:00:57.049> think<00:00:57.470> there's<00:00:57.619> a<00:00:57.680> lot<00:00:57.769> of<00:00:57.920> really

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
together I think there's a lot of really

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.369 
together I think there's a lot of really
special<00:00:59.089> things<00:00:59.269> about<00:00:59.360> Orange<00:00:59.689> County<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.350> I

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
special things about Orange County so I

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.189 
special things about Orange County so I

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
wanted to capture the history and

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.810 
wanted to capture the history and
surroundings<00:01:03.860> that<00:01:04.010> we<00:01:04.129> have<00:01:04.309> here<00:01:04.580> I'm

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
done yeah it's the satisfying because we

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.460 
done yeah it's the satisfying because we
don't<00:01:29.300> have<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.450> worry<00:01:29.630> about<00:01:29.780> like<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.320> late

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
don't have to worry about like the late

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.680 
don't have to worry about like the late
nights<00:01:30.680> that<00:01:30.830> we<00:01:30.950> had<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.580> didn't<00:01:32.210> know<00:01:32.420> that

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
nights that we had I didn't know that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.960 
nights that we had I didn't know that
such<00:01:33.140> small<00:01:33.440> shoes<00:01:33.860> could<00:01:34.220> take<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:34.790> much

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
such small shoes could take so much

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.600 
such small shoes could take so much
effort<00:01:35.180> okay<00:01:36.250> especially<00:01:37.250> since<00:01:37.460> there's

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
effort okay especially since there's

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.800 
effort okay especially since there's
three<00:01:37.790> of<00:01:37.880> us<00:01:38.000> working<00:01:38.210> on<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.480> I<00:01:38.540> thought<00:01:38.690> it

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
three of us working on it I thought it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.300 
three of us working on it I thought it
would<00:01:38.900> go<00:01:39.020> quickly<00:01:39.260> but<00:01:39.650> it<00:01:39.740> actually<00:01:39.860> did<00:01:40.159> it

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
would go quickly but it actually did it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.070 
would go quickly but it actually did it
and<00:01:40.520> one<00:01:41.060> thing<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:41.300> learned<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.659> that<00:01:41.690> we<00:01:41.930> all

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
and one thing I learned is that we all

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.170 
and one thing I learned is that we all
have<00:01:42.320> very<00:01:42.590> different<00:01:42.830> styles<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.729> we

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
have very different styles and we

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.580 
have very different styles and we
brought<00:01:44.420> each<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:44.840> our<00:01:44.960> styles<00:01:45.260> into<00:01:45.380> this

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
brought each of our styles into this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.410 
brought each of our styles into this
shoe<00:01:45.830> but<00:01:46.040> I<00:01:46.220> thought<00:01:46.400> it<00:01:46.550> would<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:46.940> didn't

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
shoe but I thought it would I didn't

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.350 
shoe but I thought it would I didn't
know<00:01:47.510> that<00:01:47.659> it<00:01:47.750> would<00:01:47.840> turn<00:01:47.960> out<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.320> well
