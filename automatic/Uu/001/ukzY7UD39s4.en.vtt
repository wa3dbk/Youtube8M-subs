and also i have a new rock picture that
I<00:02:03.420> kind<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.200> printed<00:02:04.680> off<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.860> internet

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
I kind of just printed off the internet

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.210 
I kind of just printed off the internet
and<00:02:05.930> I'm<00:02:06.930> testing<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.439> out<00:02:07.590> right<00:02:07.649> now<00:02:08.009> I'm

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
and I'm testing it out right now I'm

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.010 
and I'm testing it out right now I'm
probably<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.879> actually<00:02:09.239> fill<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
probably going to actually fill the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.260 
probably going to actually fill the
entire<00:02:10.140> bottom<00:02:10.860> with<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.310> rock<00:02:11.580> picture<00:02:12.090> like

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
entire bottom with the rock picture like

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.490 
entire bottom with the rock picture like
that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.610 
that
and<00:02:13.590> then<00:02:14.690> get<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:17.540> just<00:02:18.540> look<00:02:18.960> like<00:02:19.320> it's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
and then get it to just look like it's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.740 
and then get it to just look like it's
rock<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.460> entire<00:02:20.820> way<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.150> don't<00:02:21.420> know<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:21.660> you

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
basically and i have some wood or some

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.830 
basically and i have some wood or some
bark<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.860> i<00:02:37.920> pulled<00:02:38.340> off<00:02:38.580> just<00:02:39.420> put<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.630> up

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
bark that i pulled off just put it up

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.890 
bark that i pulled off just put it up
there<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.350> it's<00:02:40.530> some<00:02:41.310> climbing<00:02:41.760> area<00:02:42.060> then

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
there so it's some climbing area then

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.350 
there so it's some climbing area then
just<00:02:43.170> one<00:02:43.440> piece<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.160> bark<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.790> leads<00:02:45.090> up<00:02:45.330> to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
just one piece of bark that leads up to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.610 
just one piece of bark that leads up to
it<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.900> i<00:02:46.650> think<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:48.150> should<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.510> good<00:02:48.959> I'm

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620
