00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
settings that I'm concerned about

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.190 
settings that I'm concerned about
another<00:01:39.120> feature<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.630> gets<00:01:39.990> me<00:01:40.110> excited

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
another feature that gets me excited

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.170 
another feature that gets me excited
about<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.890> meter<00:01:41.160> is<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.640> ability<00:01:42.150> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
about this meter is the ability to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.260 
about this meter is the ability to
create<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.080> store<00:01:43.380> custom<00:01:43.950> filter<00:01:44.250> packs<00:01:44.490> so

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
create and store custom filter packs so

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.460 
create and store custom filter packs so
if<00:01:45.570> I'm<00:01:45.720> pulling<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.110> some<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.410> the
