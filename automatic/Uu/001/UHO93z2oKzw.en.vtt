00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.660 

very<00:03:53.880> satisfying<00:03:54.710> every<00:03:55.710> bit<00:03:56.070> as<00:03:56.160> much<00:03:56.310> fun<00:03:56.550> as

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
very satisfying every bit as much fun as

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:04.080

you<00:03:56.700> think

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.850 

well<00:04:05.090> we<00:04:05.299> pretty<00:04:05.510> much<00:04:05.629> nailed<00:04:05.989> that<00:04:06.500> but<00:04:06.650> I

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
well we pretty much nailed that but I

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.220 
well we pretty much nailed that but I
gotta<00:04:07.580> say<00:04:07.670> most<00:04:08.510> of<00:04:08.659> the<00:04:08.780> stuff<00:04:09.019> we're

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
gotta say most of the stuff we're

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.080 
gotta say most of the stuff we're
testing<00:04:09.650> here<00:04:09.829> has<00:04:09.950> been<00:04:10.129> pretty<00:04:10.430> borderline

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
testing here has been pretty borderline

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.640 
testing here has been pretty borderline
hearing<00:04:12.049> another<00:04:12.290> person<00:04:13.629> life-and-death

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
situation sure but it's all pretty dodgy

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.629 
situation sure but it's all pretty dodgy

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889
