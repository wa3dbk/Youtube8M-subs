00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello with you again mens health and 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.120
 fitness online and today we will analyze 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.190
 major mistakes that many make 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.049
 when performing such a defeat to all 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.549
 known as deadlift and so the first 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.010
 a mistake is too broad setting 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.350
 stop for the sake of the foot so that between 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.350
 two feet on we right now, only one foot 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.650
 the second point is the correct width of the grip 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.630
 you need to select the strain in such a way that 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.600
 your hands were a little wider than your hips but 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.120
 not already and not too wide in position 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.260
 already when doing the exercise you will 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.050
 cling to 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.550
 with your fingers on your knees and with too wide 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.190
 the position of the rod will come render 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.900
 jerking how is amplitude here 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.910
 Mortgage increase that significantly 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.260
 complicate the exercise itself next 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.300
 misuse error 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.800
 it is advisable not to do this at all 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.540
 have training use grip 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.040
 on top of this position the bar to hold 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.589
 undoubtedly difficult if you are very 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.900
 hard you can use the straps is not 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.720
 scary scared that got used to capture 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.390
 you can get either problems with 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.710
 poor posture 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.420
 either injuries to this arm from 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.950
 turned forward and so with 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.500
 using a multi-grab draw 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.299
 attention to a different position to lie in 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.070
 the right sleeve frequency will not rip on 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.080
 Russian left 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.810
 in such that have armored close 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.950
 normal position in this position 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.310
 muscle responsibility for maintaining 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.130
 normal posture normal panel 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.630
 spine they are in different 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.880
 mode so that life is reduced 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.040
 part of the community is more some less 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.310
 it keeps you from being kept normal 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.170
 back and basically tradition 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.110
 enough before such injuries when 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.740
 besides this as i said 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.890
 different grip threatens 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.210
 muscles surrounding elbow joint 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.079
 unfolded souvenir pens in this 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.210
 case right hand 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.600
 to avoid it avoid avoid breaks 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.729
 avoid these empty joints in the morning . 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.860
 better still avoid and pull all 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.180
 time right to the next mistake then often 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.710
 can meet this not complete in 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.690
 revelation of the hands that is accordingly 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.649
 bicep strain promotion do this 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.690
 do not need hands to be maximally 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.700
 stretched like ropes as much as possible 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.700
 stretched down as straight as possible 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.480
 the following error is typical for so 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.099
 called a sieve with technique performing 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.620
 breech this is distinct and mixing 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.060
 blades at all points of motion here 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.790
 it is not necessary to do this in order to 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.439
 reduce the amplitude of the movement of the rod 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.049
 reduce the load on the lower back of the scapula 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.480
 not even divorced it allows hands 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.340
 pull below 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.230
 more dropping the neck already in 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:52.459
 the initial position of the floor is limited 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:54.230
 cultures in the initial position of this 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.250
 mixing blades should not be shovels 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.500
 runs divorced 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.150
 shoulders relaxed trapeze stretched 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.099
 down arms extended down 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.500
 only in this position letting go 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.599
 the thoracic department perform deadlifts in 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.129
 certain if safe when 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.079
 observance of course some more conditions 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.480
 the next mistake is excessive 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:18.769
 neck extension concrete 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:20.660
 Mortgage very often this 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.280
 dropping head back tension 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.940
 spinal extensors up to 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.590
 the nape is justified even by trainers as 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.970
 usually people talk about such targets 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.709
 that is, the reflex that is supposedly hi 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.750
 again glorification spine extensors 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.210
 at the top 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.670
 as a gift to the neck section will follow and 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.200
 easing welcome to native books 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.570
 poetic is actually wrong for 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.840
 besides being in a position with measles 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.790
 open neck can also 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.710
 happen injuries and besides that 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.120
 increase the amplitude it is in principle not 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.500
 very comfortable position for quite 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.470
 breech and in order to do 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.000
 correctly good coaches long ago 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.190
 I use a ball that is clamped 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.750
 especially between the chin and the chest 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.000
 cells in that position that is when 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.500
 bowed head forward with slightly 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.280
 bent at the neck you perform 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.800
 become in this position if 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.580
 you notice the attention of athletes focused 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.380
 not somewhere in front or above on the ceiling 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.299
 approximately in points located in 2 2 2 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.430
 meters from your feet 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:24.440
 this is the correct position for the cervical 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.210
 Department in addition to all this it is the most 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.370
 the main mistake in the deadlift is 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.020
 that I more often perform just from the top 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.060
 provisions as we showed the covenant 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.050
 correct position to perform 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.500
 deadlift this traction skull 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.500
 now we will explain why 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.909
 so what is dangerous and doing the camp 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.900
 barge without top point when you 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:50.379
 going down 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.610
 already weighing up taking your rod 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:54.039
 lumbar and thoracic 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.110
 stabilizes as lowering than 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.270
 you are less so it is more stable 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.680
 yes and you actually catch the maximum 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.689
 fixed the position of the back only 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.399
 down below 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:05.469
 performing the same barbell from the floor before 

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:07.389
 start you will start moving your back already 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.889
 fixed as quickly as possible 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.330
 bending spine fixed 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.779
 maximum you can safe 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.759
 way 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.009
 start lifting something heavy 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.289
 lift something heavy with the right 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:21.819
 back position is much safer 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.379
 what is it heavy to lower precisely for 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.139
 about lowering due to the fact that 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.610
 lowering we are the most dangerous 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.469
 Movement in this regard, sports and frag 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.889
 barbell taken to drop almost on 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:34.479
 bridge and not lower it under control 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.309
 control is carried out movement only 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.249
 up the only moment 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:40.659
 be careful when throwing the barbell on 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:42.550
 helped anyway the position of the back needed 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.139
 keep true if it is not done 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.479
 know how to easily get hurt 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:49.240
 sports equipment sports practice 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.610
 better without supervision from the good 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.949
 coach yourself books about last 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.209
 a mistake for today is a wrong start at 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.089
 stalling the bar 

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:58.659
 most people at the beginning of the journey or in 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.029
 the middle 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.469
 not fully aware of all the right 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.889
 breathing cats movement begins to move 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:08.969
 with lifting the pelvis like here that is first 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.969
 Tass starts business 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.830
 so with proper execution 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.170
 thrust note especially 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.310
 make a stop 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:22.030
 mid-motion you have to start 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.920
 kicks up your shoulders barbell and tass 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.930
 must move simultaneously up 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.400
 only after the bar reaches 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.100
 your hookah cups you can start 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.800
 unbend the casing and engage in such 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.300
 tass way that is with the right 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.300
 paired deadlocks floor feature 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.600
 task minimizes back movement 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.190
 spinal flexure analyzers 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.330
 to maximize the focus on movement 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.250
 deer so today Astana pulled 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.350
 more often so all this avoid these basic 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.790
 errors do deadlifts be 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.280
 healthy we'll talk Russian fitness 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.360
 group and network and access forclaz for help 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.360
 in organizing these filming
