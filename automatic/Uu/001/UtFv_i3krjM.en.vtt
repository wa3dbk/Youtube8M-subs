 polartec developing all the products 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.269
 innovative company in this case 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.040
 we have a complete complete silhouette 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.620
 formed by shell however with the new 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.320
 polartec neoshell already presented in 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.269
 summer and then then proposed in the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.360
 winter version to which it goes 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.210
 add a new product with the 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.360
 polartec alpha which is the latest find 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.500
 in the field of padding concerning 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.290
 polartec polartec alfa which has le 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.689
 characteristics of being one 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.860
 padding very suitable for use 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:23.159
 intensive so not just one 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.880
 heat protection padding 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.750
 but a leader given to much activity 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.500
 intense 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.860
 this is because of the characteristics of the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.920
 of the padding are such as to allow 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.350
 large thermal capacity both for what 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 you are still but also during the activity 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.350
 relativity because it allows 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.790
 breathe a lot and therefore not 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.220
 creates excessive sweating inside 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.440
 of the jacket but allows so much the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:03.200
 breathability and air 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:07.230
 has copied the portec alfa to 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.910
 inside which recommends polartec for 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.120
 make sure to leave them all unchanged 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.980
 the characteristics of the padding 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.430
 some features of this jacket 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.920
 they are the extreme compatibility therefore the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.340
 garment can be folded inside 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.870
 of the jacket with a small footprint for 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.710
 then be positioned if necessary 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:32.640
 even in the backpack and was given a 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.350
 cut also very comfortable a lot 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.190
 alpine to make sure that the cap 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.890
 can used both 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.430
 in a mountain environment but also for use 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.430
 daily
