 A called pulling off center 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.879
 Broken car etc 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.320
 It seems like a place where you are hitting parts 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.090
 Oh 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.480
 It's like a demolition shop maybe 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.390
 I do not know the idea 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:35.120
 It seems so interesting that I stopped by 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.120
 I would like to see a little bit more 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:50.120
 There is a place you do not know sometimes where is the good collapse in the core class 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.120
 I was really stuck what both key while ago 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.550
 It is piled up 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.930
 There is such a thing, but it is a little scary to jump off at night but 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.580
 Wow-a-sa 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.580

 That the people uncle like a of this shop is Otchan'nan this by detaching yourself 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.700
 However, it seems that you can bargain with the person and let me know 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.930
 This is the reflection type machine 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.440
 Of course this is 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.440
 Because I'm already a loser 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.000
 License plate is not attached 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.000

 I'm with key here 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:18.940
 But I think some people thought that there was no air bag, but something is riding here 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.210
 Yes What is this about tipping 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.870

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:43.519
 In a nutshell I can not but look at the photos but I have a book shift 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.519

 I wondered if I would use a shaft etc. to remodel that 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.560
 Certainly this is interesting 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.560
 If you do something like this you will want more 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.550
