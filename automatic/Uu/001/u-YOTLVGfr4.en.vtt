a knife it was a really good day for the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
offense we would imagine that a Curt

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.060 
offense we would imagine that a Curt
Roper<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.809> probably<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.260> good<00:00:52.440> mood<00:00:52.620> after<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
Roper is probably a good mood after this

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.029 
Roper is probably a good mood after this
one<00:00:54.020> falling<00:00:55.020> backwards<00:00:55.469> down<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> middle<00:00:55.949> of
