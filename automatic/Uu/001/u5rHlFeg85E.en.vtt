00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.647
Around 1625, Rubens received

00:00:12.847 --> 00:00:14.907
one of the most important commissions of his career

00:00:15.107 --> 00:00:18.368
at a time when he was probably the most famous painter in Europe.

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:20.250
This project consisted in designing

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.849
in designing twenty large tapestries, to be made in wool,

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:24.778
for the convent of the Descalzas Reales

00:00:24.978 --> 00:00:28.090
in Madrid, next to the Plaza de San Martín.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.451
The commission came from Isabel Clara Eugenia,

00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:33.444
Governor of the Southern Low Countries or Spanish Netherlands

00:00:33.644 --> 00:00:36.341
(modern-day Belgium). She was the daughter of Philip II,

00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:40.095
the sister of Philip III and in 1622, the aunt of the monarch

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:42.969
who occupied the Spanish throne at that date, Philip IV.

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:45.605
Of the twenty tapestries designed by Rubens

00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:48.101
and sent to the Descalzas Reales in Madrid,

00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:50.293
four are now included in this exhibition.

00:00:50.493 --> 00:00:54.342
It is the first time that they have been shown together with some of the paintings

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:57.228
that Rubens produced as part of the design process for that series.

00:00:57.428 --> 00:01:00.350
Designing a series of tapestries is a complex process.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.454
The painter first had to design small scenes that he termed "bozzetti",

00:01:04.654 --> 00:01:06.183
which would probably have functioned to show

00:01:06.383 --> 00:01:09.824
the person who commissioned the tapestries how they would look when finished.

00:01:10.024 --> 00:01:13.168
This initial phase was followed by a second stage

00:01:13.368 --> 00:01:16.257
in which the artist produced the so-called "modelli",

00:01:16.457 --> 00:01:22.178
which were larger and more highly finished preliminary studies

00:01:22.378 --> 00:01:24.000
with a large amount of detail.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.000
The third step was the realisation of large “cartoons”,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.000
as they were termed, which are the scenes, in life size,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.000
to be reproduced on the tapestries.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.000
These were generally painted in the artist’s studio by his assistants

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.000
and not by his own hand and it was these cartoons

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.000
that the weavers used to make the tapestries.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.908
The Prado has six of the "modelli" (the second phase),

00:01:42.108 --> 00:01:45.731
which are relatively large sketches painted

00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:47.787
in considerable detail and with a lot of colour,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.412
showing the moment when the artist was making the final decisions.

00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:54.184
In the late 17th century, six of what must have originally been

00:01:54.384 --> 00:01:58.405
at least twenty "modelli" entered the Spanish royal collections,

00:01:58.605 --> 00:02:01.030
and these six are the ones now on display in the Museo del Prado.

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:03.000
The "modelli" for the Eucharist series

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.812
are considered particularly important.

00:02:06.012 --> 00:02:10.142
They have recently been restored in a long

00:02:10.342 --> 00:02:12.000
and complex process lasting around three years.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.000
This has basically consisted

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.000
in removing old additions to each side the panels

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.582
and in undertaking the necessary restoration after they were removed.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.169
The exhibition pays considerable attention

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:27.000
to the restoration process of the paintings

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.000
but we should bear in mind that ultimately

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.185
we are here in the service of the paintings, to enjoy them,

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.685
learn about them and understand them.

00:02:34.885 --> 00:02:37.010
So what we see here is that the exhibition brings together

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.000
a number of the issues that makes Rubens a great painter.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.000
When we see the Eucharist series, the "modelli" from the series

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.000
alongside the tapestries, we are seeing Rubens’s

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.000
enormous skills in various fields.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.000
Firstly, as a painter: his manual skill,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.000
the lightness and freedom of his technique and his ability

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.200
to make us feel the immediacy of what he is painting.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.200
In addition, the sensation we have

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.000
when looking at Rubens is that we are

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.000
in the presence of a learned, highly educated,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.000
well-read and intellectual painter with a great knowledge of Renaissance culture,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.661
and that what he is doing is using the knowledge he acquired

00:03:09.861 --> 00:03:12.645
during his years in Italy and from his sizeable library

00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:15.973
in order to weave a type of vision of what he wants to recount,

00:03:16.173 --> 00:03:18.110
the figures that he selects, how he paints them, and so on.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.091
Rubens was nourished by an enormous intellectual culture;

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:24.043
a culture that involves a profound knowledge of Christianity

00:03:24.243 --> 00:03:26.089
and also of the pagan and classical worlds,

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.555
which was a fundamental part of the Renaissance and early Baroque.

00:03:29.755 --> 00:03:33.423
We thus see how in these scenes he recounts Christian doctrine,

00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:36.366
for example, through scenes derived from the Roman triumphs

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:40.935
which decorated the reliefs of Trajan’s column in the Forum in Rome.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.548
Rubens paints with the feeling that there is a lot involved,

00:03:45.748 --> 00:03:47.000
that what he paints is extremely morally important,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.200
and therefore the art of painting, the idea of representing,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.000
is something in which we are all deeply involved

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.000
and which is done with great faith.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.613
We get the feeling that we are

00:03:56.813 --> 00:03:58.613
in front of a very tenacious painter and that this tenacity,

00:03:58.813 --> 00:04:04.602
this idea of guiding painting has consequences for the history of art.
