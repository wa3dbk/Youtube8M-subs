00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.700
 hi guys this is a game how could you 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.870
 understand 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.590
 called true skate that is, put two 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.199
 finger socks and in this way 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.269
 we turn around and skate 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:28.170
 can various tricks push off there 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:30.630
 we twist the board here but actually I 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.940
 this game did not work at all 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.190
 really I could skate the pier 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.960
 wrap it up 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.180
 I have some cool tricks 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.149
 completely failed I do not know why 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.170
 maybe I did something wrong 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.440
 really although I wanted tried and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.890
 it piles the floor there for everyone and we change 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.140
 nothing really worked out right now 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.350
 here is the type of something you see see reading 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.230
 there somehow jumped incomprehensibly at all 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.940
 certainly I do not know that's there is a similar 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.860
 toy great I have it on 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.590
 channel in playlist 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:14.010
 sports games are not there either 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.450
 cyclist and in this game you are yours 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:23.280
 fingers play the role of this 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:25.409
 cyclist well, generally according to the schedule 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.229
 the graphics game is just great and very 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.920
 all cool adv-1 done so 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.140
 you know realistically beautiful just for the sake of 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.280
 This I give you this game in principle and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.710
 I advise for the fact that she is so 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.770
 realistic cool here for all of this a 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.490
 as if the pixels are all lovers 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.729
 Board pixels are sure to swing and 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.820
 play and try to protect some 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.710
 cool trick to your gamer 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.439

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.439
