were<00:00:58.090> cooking<00:00:58.660> your<00:00:58.780> blanching<00:00:59.140> vegetables

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
were cooking your blanching vegetables

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.340 
were cooking your blanching vegetables
for<00:01:00.190> me<00:01:00.370> it's<00:01:00.520> quite<00:01:00.670> simple<00:01:01.090> if<00:01:01.840> you<00:01:02.020> live<00:01:02.230> in

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
for me it's quite simple if you live in

for me it's quite simple if you live in
a<00:01:02.440> hard<00:01:02.890> water<00:01:03.309> area<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:04.150> addition<00:01:04.540> of<00:01:04.659> salt

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
a hard water area the addition of salt

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.650 
a hard water area the addition of salt
will<00:01:05.560> soften<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.130> water<00:01:06.280> slightly<00:01:06.910> and<00:01:07.119> aid

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
will soften the water slightly and aid

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.180 
will soften the water slightly and aid
in<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.990> cooking<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.410> rear<00:01:08.650> vegetables

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
in the cooking of rear vegetables

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.640 
in the cooking of rear vegetables
however<00:01:09.610> if<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:10.119> live<00:01:10.330> in<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.509> soft<00:01:10.869> water<00:01:11.140> area

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
however if you live in a soft water area

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.230 
however if you live in a soft water area
there's<00:01:12.340> no<00:01:12.520> need<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:12.759> add<00:01:13.030> salt<00:01:13.300> when

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
there's no need to add salt when
