the<00:01:22.290> only<00:01:22.320> thing<00:01:22.590> I'm<00:01:22.680> concerned<00:01:22.710> about<00:01:23.159> its

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the only thing I'm concerned about its

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.410 
the only thing I'm concerned about its
since<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.210> licensed<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:24.960> 10<00:01:25.200> episodes<00:01:26.420> I'm

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
since it's licensed for 10 episodes I'm

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.789 
since it's licensed for 10 episodes I'm
a<00:01:27.689> little<00:01:27.930> skeptical<00:01:28.320> about<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.530> because

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
a little skeptical about that because

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.010 
a little skeptical about that because
thing<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.250> gonna<00:01:29.400> feel<00:01:29.610> rushed<00:01:30.000> unless<00:01:30.840> they

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
thing is gonna feel rushed unless they

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.200 
thing is gonna feel rushed unless they
make<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> episodes<00:01:31.770> longer<00:01:32.369> excuse<00:01:32.939> me<00:01:33.060> stop

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
make the episodes longer excuse me stop

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.359 
make the episodes longer excuse me stop
about<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> phone<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.590> wrong<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:35.220> they're

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
about the phone that's wrong but they're

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.710 
about the phone that's wrong but they're
gonna<00:01:35.460> make<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> episodes<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.420> gotta<00:01:36.570> make

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
gonna make the episodes they gotta make

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.330 
gonna make the episodes they gotta make
the<00:01:36.810> episodes<00:01:37.140> longer<00:01:37.560> because<00:01:37.770> 10<00:01:37.950> episodes

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
the episodes longer because 10 episodes

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.899 
the episodes longer because 10 episodes
just<00:01:38.640> not<00:01:39.650> good<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.950> whole<00:01:41.159> season<00:01:41.729> but

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
just not good for a whole season but

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.319 
just not good for a whole season but
probably<00:01:42.780> due<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.869> budget<00:01:43.320> cuts<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:45.210> know

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
probably due to budget cuts and you know

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.670 
probably due to budget cuts and you know
bringing<00:01:45.659> some<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> voice<00:01:46.140> actors<00:01:46.380> back

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
bringing some of the voice actors back

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
bringing some of the voice actors back
and<00:01:46.829> then<00:01:46.920> maybe<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.310> probably<00:01:47.729> demanding

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
and then maybe it probably demanding

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.670 
and then maybe it probably demanding
more<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.720> little<00:01:49.170> bit<00:01:49.290> because<00:01:49.380> they're

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
more a little bit because they're

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.530 
more a little bit because they're
bringing<00:01:50.189> other<00:01:50.520> celebrities<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.479> I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
bringing other celebrities and like I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.850 
bringing other celebrities and like I
know<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:51.750> had<00:01:51.930> Snoop<00:01:52.259> Dogg<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.680> they<00:01:52.740> had<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
know they had Snoop Dogg and they had a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.200 
know they had Snoop Dogg and they had a
couple<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.189> other<00:01:53.340> rep<00:01:53.549> appearances<00:01:54.060> there

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
couple of other rep appearances there

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.940 
couple of other rep appearances there
and<00:01:54.390> they<00:01:54.479> cost<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.110> lot<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.560> money<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.829> get

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and they cost a lot of money to get

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.709 
and they cost a lot of money to get
those<00:01:56.070> types<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.399> celebrities<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.030> they<00:01:57.450> could

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
those types of celebrities so they could

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.630 
those types of celebrities so they could
be<00:01:57.840> bringing<00:01:58.140> more<00:01:58.259> celebrities<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.310> if

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
be bringing more celebrities in and if

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.639 
be bringing more celebrities in and if
that<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.060> case<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.719> could<00:02:01.079> definitely<00:02:01.350> see

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
that is the case I could definitely see

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.249 
that is the case I could definitely see
a<00:02:01.680> reason<00:02:02.009> why<00:02:02.040> they<00:02:02.880> would<00:02:03.060> cut<00:02:03.570> back<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
a reason why they would cut back on the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.050 
a reason why they would cut back on the
episodes<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.040> another<00:02:05.219> particular<00:02:05.700> series

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
episodes of another particular series

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.270 
episodes of another particular series
but<00:02:06.780> nonetheless<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.129> good

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
but nonetheless this is a good

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.339 
but nonetheless this is a good

because it's just a copy of boondocks
which<00:04:55.260> if<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:55.590> looked<00:04:55.860> at<00:04:56.040> it<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.610> had<00:04:56.850> some

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
which if you looked at it it had some

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.620 
which if you looked at it it had some
things<00:04:58.290> or<00:04:58.560> some<00:04:58.760> similarities<00:04:59.760> of<00:04:59.790> the

things or some similarities of the

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.360 
things or some similarities of the
boondocks<00:05:00.990> but<00:05:01.290> overall<00:05:01.560> it<00:05:01.860> was<00:05:01.950> so<00:05:02.100> a<00:05:02.130> whole

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
boondocks but overall it was so a whole

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.410 
boondocks but overall it was so a whole
different<00:05:02.760> concept<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.450> was<00:05:03.510> very<00:05:03.810> good<00:05:04.110> so

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
different concept it was very good so
