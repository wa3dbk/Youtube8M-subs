we're<00:01:00.510> using<00:01:00.540> on<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.020> house<00:01:01.200> is<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> be

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
we're using on this house is going to be

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.639 
we're using on this house is going to be
empty<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.630> which<00:01:03.630> is<00:01:03.660> excellent<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> way

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
empty one which is excellent of the way

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.230 
empty one which is excellent of the way
the<00:01:04.979> way<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.129> sealant<00:01:05.579> works<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.969> that<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the way that sealant works is that it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.999 
the way that sealant works is that it
doesn't<00:01:06.810> doesn't<00:01:07.200> crack<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.860> stays

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
doesn't doesn't crack it just stays

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:34.240 
doesn't doesn't crack it just stays
flexible<00:01:08.310> like<00:01:08.759> that<00:01:08.939> Tommy<00:01:09.719> hands

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.060 

a<00:01:34.840> lot<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:35.870> people<00:01:35.960> on<00:01:36.260> these<00:01:36.410> and<00:01:36.740> these<00:01:36.830> walls

a lot of people on these and these walls

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.500 
a lot of people on these and these walls
like<00:01:37.220> this<00:01:37.370> they<00:01:37.520> just<00:01:37.730> have<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.880> 90-degree

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
like this they just have a 90-degree

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.510 
like this they just have a 90-degree
angle<00:01:38.540> on<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.110> stucco<00:01:39.500> but<00:01:40.010> what<00:01:40.160> we<00:01:40.280> have<00:01:40.430> it

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
be repainted and that's what leads would

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.460 
be repainted and that's what leads would
take<00:01:49.160> effect<00:01:49.280> that's<00:01:49.850> able<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.180> drain<00:01:50.470> these
