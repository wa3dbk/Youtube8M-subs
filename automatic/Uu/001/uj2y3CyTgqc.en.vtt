self-explanatory to some but it's really

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.459 
self-explanatory to some but it's really
in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> beginning<00:00:57.660> when<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.140> no<00:00:58.260> idea

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
voice so for a hook I usually use a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.450 
voice so for a hook I usually use a
really<00:01:11.670> cheap<00:01:11.909> tyree<00:01:12.330> key<00:01:12.540> hook<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:12.990> these

use some flies some hooks I'm trying to
get<00:01:32.430> rid<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:34.250> we're<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> do<00:01:35.700> is

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
get rid of so we're going to do is

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.480 
get rid of so we're going to do is
basically<00:01:36.930> there's<00:01:37.439> only<00:01:37.590> couple<00:01:38.009> steps<00:01:38.310> in

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
basically there's only couple steps in

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.660 
basically there's only couple steps in
this<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.689> probably<00:01:40.200> crank<00:01:40.470> out<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.009> ton

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
this and I can probably crank out a ton

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.230 
this and I can probably crank out a ton
in<00:01:42.170> 10<00:01:43.170> minutes<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:44.310> you'll<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.790> how<00:01:44.850> easy

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
in 10 minutes so you'll see how easy

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.560 
in 10 minutes so you'll see how easy
this<00:01:45.540> fly<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:47.130> time<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.180> put<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> hook

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
this fly is to time so we put the hook

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.350 
this fly is to time so we put the hook
in<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> vise<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:49.460> clamp<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.549> down<00:01:50.610> i'm

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
in the vise there clamp it down i'm

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.929 
in the vise there clamp it down i'm

seems to work

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.100 
seems to work
really<00:02:01.770> well<00:02:02.040> that's<00:02:02.880> my<00:02:03.630> opinion<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.050> most
