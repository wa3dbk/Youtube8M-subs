know doctor who was at the cutting edge

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.220 
know doctor who was at the cutting edge
of<00:00:36.410> it<00:00:36.559> really<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.250> it<00:00:38.090> was<00:00:38.239> money<00:00:38.539> more<00:00:39.079> than

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
of it really and it was money more than

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.479 
of it really and it was money more than
anything<00:00:39.379> else<00:00:39.590> that<00:00:39.710> stopped<00:00:40.070> it<00:00:40.250> being

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
anything else that stopped it being

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.029 
anything else that stopped it being
clever<00:00:40.730> I<00:00:41.090> thought<00:00:41.660> to<00:00:42.050> be<00:00:42.170> honest<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.679> doctor

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
clever I thought to be honest the doctor

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:44.889 
clever I thought to be honest the doctor
who<00:00:43.129> would<00:00:43.250> have<00:00:43.399> died<00:00:43.640> when<00:00:44.390> Star<00:00:44.660> Trek

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
who would have died when Star Trek

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.720 
who would have died when Star Trek
started<00:00:45.440> because<00:00:46.070> suddenly<00:00:46.309> there<00:00:46.609> was<00:00:46.670> a

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
started because suddenly there was a

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.689 
started because suddenly there was a
show<00:00:47.030> which<00:00:47.690> was<00:00:47.899> a<00:00:47.929> long<00:00:48.260> similar<00:00:48.829> lines<00:00:49.100> at

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
show which was a long similar lines at

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.060 
show which was a long similar lines at
least<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.059> was<00:00:50.149> sci-fi<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.780> everything<00:00:51.079> that

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
least it was sci-fi and everything that

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.799 
least it was sci-fi and everything that
had<00:00:52.280> a<00:00:52.309> huge<00:00:52.699> amount<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.089> money<00:00:53.179> pumped<00:00:53.629> into

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
had a huge amount of money pumped into

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.599 
had a huge amount of money pumped into
it<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.230> doctor<00:00:54.920> who<00:00:55.010> was<00:00:55.129> being<00:00:55.309> made<00:00:55.489> for

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
it and doctor who was being made for

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.750 
it and doctor who was being made for
threatens<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.469> somehow<00:00:57.469> it<00:00:57.800> survived<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.670> I

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
threatens and somehow it survived and I

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.950 
threatens and somehow it survived and I
reckon<00:00:59.030> it<00:00:59.089> was<00:00:59.179> the<00:00:59.269> quality<00:00:59.420> of<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.780> writing

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
reckon it was the quality of the writing

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.069 
reckon it was the quality of the writing
and<00:01:00.469> possibly<00:01:01.339> one<00:01:02.120> could<00:01:02.269> even<00:01:02.390> say<00:01:02.570> was<00:01:02.870> it

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
and possibly one could even say was it

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.630 
and possibly one could even say was it
was<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.350> quality<00:01:03.530> of<00:01:03.769> Bill<00:01:04.220> Hartnell's

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
was the quality of Bill Hartnell's

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.430 
was the quality of Bill Hartnell's
acting<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:05.150> know<00:01:05.180> he<00:01:05.390> created<00:01:06.170> something

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
acting you know he created something

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.000 
acting you know he created something
which<00:01:07.130> really<00:01:07.550> has<00:01:08.150> this<00:01:08.450> on<00:01:08.690> Garrety<00:01:09.140> now

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
which really has this on Garrety now

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.160 
which really has this on Garrety now
when<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:10.610> look<00:01:10.790> back<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.510> you<00:01:11.600> think<00:01:11.660> gosh<00:01:11.990> I

stories I thought were great

doesn't really exist though that was
more<00:02:27.180> sci-fi<00:02:27.660> than<00:02:27.690> historical<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.940> it's

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
more sci-fi than historical so it's

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.960 
more sci-fi than historical so it's

medal<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.480> only<00:02:33.630> one<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:33.989> has<00:02:34.140> a

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
medal is the only one that has a

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.590 
medal is the only one that has a
historical<00:02:34.860> edge<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.640> does<00:02:36.030> survive<00:02:36.390> but

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
historical edge that does survive but

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.280 
historical edge that does survive but
that<00:02:36.750> was<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> real<00:02:37.200> mix<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.420> time<00:02:39.420> travel<00:02:39.930> plus

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
that was a real mix of time travel plus

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.610 
that was a real mix of time travel plus
the<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.910> history<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.720> Saxon<00:02:43.380> times

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
of the doctor I think he's a great

of the doctor I think he's a great
brother<00:05:02.030> casting<00:05:02.539> funnily<00:05:02.990> enough<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.320> know

he's<00:05:03.800> older<00:05:04.250> now<00:05:04.280> I<00:05:04.430> think<00:05:04.789> the<00:05:04.880> bill<00:05:05.090> Hartnell

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
he's older now I think the bill Hartnell

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.800 
he's older now I think the bill Hartnell
was<00:05:05.660> when<00:05:05.870> he<00:05:05.990> played<00:05:06.229> the<00:05:06.440> doctor<00:05:06.680> originally

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
was when he played the doctor originally

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.990 
was when he played the doctor originally
don't<00:05:08.810> think<00:05:08.960> he<00:05:09.020> looks<00:05:09.139> at<00:05:09.440> mine<00:05:09.650> I<00:05:09.979> think<00:05:10.880> he

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
don't think he looks at mine I think he

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.300 
don't think he looks at mine I think he
can<00:05:11.150> bring<00:05:11.300> a<00:05:11.419> lot<00:05:11.600> to<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:11.960> I<00:05:12.560> don't<00:05:13.070> think

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
can bring a lot to it I don't think

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.279 
can bring a lot to it I don't think
you'll<00:05:13.400> swear<00:05:13.669> much<00:05:13.940> I<00:05:14.090> hope<00:05:14.240> not<00:05:14.479> if<00:05:15.110> I'm

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
you'll swear much I hope not if I'm

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.180 
you'll swear much I hope not if I'm
certainly<00:05:15.650> way<00:05:16.600> but<00:05:17.600> I<00:05:17.840> like<00:05:18.229> his<00:05:18.620> acting<00:05:19.070> I

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190
