00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.730
 today we are going to learn how a 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.730
 rear derailleur 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.480
 or the pose of the necessary change when you have 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.250
 changed a stain on the handle the 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.990
 chain does not change its mind it does not 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.119
 changing two of ordes in a very 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.439
 abruptly normally when this happens it 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.210
 produces a constant noise the 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.560
 transmission and we will move 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.560
 and something to follow this meeting 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.370
 You see how it changes two pinions at a time 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.370
 because it costs a lot to change one alone 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.230
 most of the rear changes are 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.580
 indexed this means that at each 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.140
 opinion corresponds a march 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.239
 different in the suitcase so at 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.250
 adjust the rear what we will be 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.290
 doing is to associate with each pinion its 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.550
 corresponding gear in the handle what 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.620
 first thing we're going to do now is 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.330
 change to the small opinion that in this 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.330
 case is already on the graphic plate 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.980
 once we have it what we are going to 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.379
 do 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.370
 the key of the 8 open the prisoner of 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.370
 cable to leave it free 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.250
 the cable is loose in case 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.700
 was in poor condition would be changed by 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.700
 a new one 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.200
 once we got here 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.820
 we will tighten or loosen the cylinder 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.520
 adjustment to leave it towards the middle of its 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.619
 travel this adjustment cylinder when 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.640
 we turn it counterclockwise 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.560
 we have the metal piece that is in 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.650
 your interior is coming out getting like this 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 the tension of the cable 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.050
 if we turn it clockwise it happens 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.960
 otherwise the metal piece is going 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.840
 getting more and so the cable loosens 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.740
 we are going to leave aligned both 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.740
 this would be the correct position 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.750
 just like the deviant itself in the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.090
 way we have also doing adjustment 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.320
 of control of the tension of the change this 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.870
 adjustment balance works from the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.580
 same way if we turn it in direction 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.100
 counter-clockwise the metallic piece that is in 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.240
 its interior is coming out little by little 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.330
 getting like this 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.729
 the tension of the cable 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.940
 whereas if we turn it upside down in 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.310
 clockwise the piece as they put it 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.650
 getting it to loosen 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.810
 we are going to leave them aligned 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.540
 both the plastic part and the metal part 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.730
 what is inside 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.110
 these elements of tension control 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.120
 of the cable what they allow us is a 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.010
 optimal adjustment at the end of the process 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.040
 all the rear servers carry two 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.840
 screws with an ax and a l hai and 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.640
 then in English that limit the route 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.849
 of the derailleur by the pinion to avoid 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.319
 that the chain goes out the screw h limits 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.880
 the child in little while the l 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.990
 does the same with the big 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.030
 Now what we have to do is 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.050
 tighten a screw h to match 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.050
 the small pinion with rounds 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.560
 we have the measure that we move the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.540
 screw the set of rolland to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.170
 move then it has to be aligned with 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.170
 the small pinion 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.480
 thus 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.290
 if we have correctly aligned the 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.100
 sheave on the small pinion the 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.530
 dissent 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.940
 of the rear wheel would this we're going to 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.800
 re-tighten the press of the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.230
 cable checking before all the 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.200
 shirts 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.319
 they go into the holes through which 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.170
 they must go 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:28.319
 we thought a little 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.010
 and with the same as 8 before 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.010
 we leave fixed 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.860
 once arrived at this point what 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.580
 we're going to do is go up 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.780
 checking that every click 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.780
 corresponds a different 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.030
 in this way once we have the chain 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.069
 in the big pinion what we're going to do 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.959
 is to adjust the screw marked with a 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.170
 to limit the route of the 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.180
 chain is that pinion 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.260
 To do this, we will squeeze 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.260
 function of what you need 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.420
 and just like we left before the 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.280
 small pinion aligned with the chain in 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.269
 this case we will leave it in the pinion 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.639
 big 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.870
 if we have performed this operation 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.759
 correctly we can check how 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.949
 the derailleur wheels are aligned 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.949
 perfectly with the large pinion 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.259
 finally we realize again that all 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.400
 the changes in the march are made 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:40.320
 correctly according to the controllers 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.550
 and following each click of the hand in 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.530
 if he needed a little bit 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.080
 more than tension we would use the 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.729
 Lieutenants adjusting both derailleur 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.270
 the one on the handle to adjust it 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.270
 totally 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.580
 with this simple videotutorial we have 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.900
 I learned how to be like that you already know 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.090
 Take the bike out of the storage room and start 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.510
 pedaling is repairing up to you 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.510
 the next
