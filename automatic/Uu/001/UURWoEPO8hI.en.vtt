 little fashion app does it all 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.879
 simply 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.550
 and I really like this application 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.289
 because there are a few ideas according to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.450
 according to the seasons of the fashion ideas of the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.400
 effects needed novelties 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.540
 and it helps me for me when I have not 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.460
 too much inspiration I look a little 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.260
 morning j will get in the lead with that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.970

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.700
 that it's super well ranked and it's 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.550
 original savary he loves cinema so

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.780

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.270
 times I'm really I'm the news of the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.680
 select as much as in ten cribs or kate 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.090
 picture a word four images weapons or 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.500

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.360
 can dig the meninges I like 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.620
 yeah but I wanted me to tell myself 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.080
 often I leave that it's you who 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.440
 I'm sure it's a bit we're going 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.729
 to say that 's a little smarter 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:37.340
 facebook or twitter twitter whatsapp or 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:42.830
 vibrate whatsapp morandini or pure media 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:45.000
 on melzer and ratified or under ratp 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.240
 risk to grain or snapshot 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.649
 I hate this match at instagram I 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.540
 stay at the old old I arrive 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.300
 not slapshot I find it tired in is 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.200
 besides vincent of steam sees all 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.920
 the days a snapshot 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.330
 so that at a given moment 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 I do not understand these men you do a 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.090
 smile you're a picture I think it's ok 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.550
 I have trouble and I do not hang at all 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.470
 no it's not my delusion adopts a guy 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.789
 or victim at the time I was 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.649
 single I was not doing TV I'm 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.420
 am registered he will lie and I believe 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.430
 that it was adopting a loft style to 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.930
 the time yeah but here I am more 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.700
 messages there follow them in spite of me this is at 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.709
 to say it's not me but apparently 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.580
 I am there it is very well ie 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.520
 that at some point I think she 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.230
 is connected to his phone which his 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.310
 phone the effluent she is absent at 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.630
 lecce in the process of not like it is 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.560
 That's crazy 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.569
 she is still loading 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.819
 always it's never been seen that actually 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.280
 grafted in fact so I believe that 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.130
 the one I watch at 24 TV this is at 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.780
 to say that I am never at home so I 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.170
 look at replays of a lot of things 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.170
 TV series or replays of 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.790
 ch'tis sees the bastille where I like 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.830
 watch replays of cristina cordula 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.830
 the reins of shopping or whatever goes 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.349
 with a halo sweetheart in my hand 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.610
 am a fan of fashion when in 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.930
 filming is not that the phone and 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.060
 honestly it feels good 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.050
 cut and arrive there anyway 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.980
 get into a bubble when we're in 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.880
 filming so we get to it 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.040
 get rid of 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.760
 clearly it makes me feel good I like 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.049
 well what suddenly I feel 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.829
 to be on holiday clearly because 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.550
 otherwise every day we are here we 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.040
 works and 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.510
 and even when we recover the myth we 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.500
 know more than target finally it lasts it takes 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.890
 less than 15 minutes to find 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.600
 its benchmarks 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.690
 so no I think that's good not the 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.690
 see
