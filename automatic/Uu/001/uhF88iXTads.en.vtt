00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.000
 the galera is more a rope brazil people 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.929
 I was analyzing this issue of 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.610
 Here starts the problem of stf 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.349
 What happens is the following celso 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.139
 mello minister celso de mello followed 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.180
 according to the Regulation of the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.680
 supreme court to federal court 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.869
 supreme federal court 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.510
 and this regulation says that if 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.300
 the convicted person has his or her 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.640
 his conviction was very tight as 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.470
 was the case of these 12 members of the monthly 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.130
 who were convicted but start to think 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.540
 said, but these people will be entitled to 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.440
 review 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.210
 this judgment is in the law 91 some 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.820
 thing I remember exactly the date the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.399
 president fernando collor sent to the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.980
 congress a bill that would 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.489
 rule is concerned and the proposal is as follows: 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.170
 to end it simply after 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.180
 these procedures 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.879
 our prize has received any damage that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.479
 Down to you credits the final result. 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.580
 only that this modification in the law 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.510
 proposal to change the law came 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.210
 congress and the deputies rejected 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.400
 Now it is very clear that animal because 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.380
 they rejected because it is not interest 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.310
 they always want one more 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.320
 The opportunity for this is that it leaves me 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.720
 whole life because the guys want to have 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.479
 privileged forum and they still want to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.570
 above if you want to design them case 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.079
 the result is contrary to what they 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.780
 expect 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.930
 they want the possibility to review 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.270
 this nation to modify the result in 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.189
 yes it 's absurd the guy I want 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.399
 Sailing photo has already been given to them 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.280
 so fuck it if it's euros 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.259
 &lt; Previous Next&gt; 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.689
 You have to end this business only 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.899
 politicians, how do they do the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.060
 laws and they once again through this 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.570
 demonstrate what they do laws 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.770
 to firstly benefit them 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.280
 own 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.110
 they rejected this proposal of change 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.660
 in the law that was made in the Fernando 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.540
 henrique cardoso and reminds me a lot 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.280
 recent video that our baby lucio 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.930
 of white and white nulos 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.050
 sells very good he comments news 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.970
 absurd in this formative plan 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.610
 I advise you a lot if you have not seen 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.500
 see I'll even put the name of this 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.200
 video in this video of mine today 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.209
 but finally he brings a story of 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.170
 councilors of a city that I do not 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.599
 remember more now define country city 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.450
 that these councilors passed a law 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:46.739
 in the city council chamber of 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.110
 that a municipality's budget means the 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.720
 sky money you who lives in this city 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.450
 there is taken from your taxes to 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.500
 pay the salary of a councilor who is 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.099
 stuck 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.180
 This is absurd and then makes absurd still 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.700
 is to justify 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.950
 shiva who will be councilman 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.439
 of the chamber placed two at the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.829
 reasons today and tomorrow can come out either 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:14.549
 To say this already makes it extremely clear 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:17.719
 what kind of there is that kind of change 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.069
 What kind of bums do we have? 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:23.310
 representing the Brazilian people 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.989
 now is regrettable because while 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.049
 people of our country give more value 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.930
 videos of women swaying in the butt in the 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.049
 wind funk of people clashing 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.989
 taking fall making and leaving videos 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.329
 who talk about subjects that 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.530
 They concern the lives of themselves to 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.980
 there they do not want to know 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.120
 as long as this reality is maintained 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:52.139
 we will not see this country be a country 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.950
 seriously will continue being a little country of 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:58.340
 Shit, a banana republiqueta. 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.250
 although we have men than women 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.370
 serious in this country decent people but 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.699
 the vast majority of the population is not 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.099
 interested in politics is not 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:14.099
 interested in the destinies of their lives 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.370
 they are more concerned about watching 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:21.299
 to the last chapter of the nine 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:25.320
 hours of the night and this is unfortunate 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:30.020
 This explains why we live in this 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.020
 widespread mess in that country 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.029
 I'll tell you to explain something. 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.849
 also received by you 

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:40.599
 yesterday in the video of yesterday that I said that 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:43.589
 there was a spark that could 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:47.919
 To live in Brazil, this is something very remote. 

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:50.979
 It would be if Brazil really is from Cidh 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:54.279
 only a 180-degree turn in your 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.930
 direction and change if the direction of 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.119
 start walking in the direction of 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.759
 make a really decent country country 

00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:03.789
 serious country uneasiness with quality 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:06.999
 life thing that unfortunately is not 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.610
 happening and then my friend, a hug does not 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:11.889
 I'll go, but I will never live in this 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.169
 Brazil is not 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.909
 here you can see that the arm to you and the 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.909
 people see in the next video of the galley
