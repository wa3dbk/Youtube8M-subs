00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
if the light bulbs just getting old but

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.540 
if the light bulbs just getting old but
I<00:00:59.879> want<00:01:00.149> them<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> both<00:01:00.600> look<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.899> same<00:01:01.550> it's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
I want them to both look the same it's

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.240 
I want them to both look the same it's
just<00:01:02.850> me<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.899> I'm<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> replace<00:01:04.979> both<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
just me so I'm going to replace both the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.090 
just me so I'm going to replace both the
light<00:01:05.549> bulbs<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.530> this<00:01:07.530> light<00:01:07.740> bulb<00:01:07.890> I'll

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
light bulbs and this light bulb I'll

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.640 
light bulbs and this light bulb I'll
just<00:01:08.280> keep<00:01:08.400> around<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> spare<00:01:09.270> um<00:01:11.780> but<00:01:12.780> it's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
just keep around for a spare um but it's

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.410 
just keep around for a spare um but it's
brought<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.100> mean<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.430> probably<00:01:14.670> old<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.270> dim

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
brought I mean it's probably old and dim

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.060 
brought I mean it's probably old and dim
I<00:01:15.570> guess<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.110> what<00:01:16.350> happens<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
I guess that's just what happens to it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.200 
I guess that's just what happens to it
but<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:18.210> kind<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.570> wild<00:01:18.920> one<00:01:19.920> thing<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:21.030> new

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
but it's kind of wild one thing the new

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.120 
but it's kind of wild one thing the new

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
light bulb the glass on the new light

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.330

the<00:01:26.820> old<00:01:27.030> light<00:01:27.390> bulb<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.500> when<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> turn<00:01:28.979> on

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
higher quality than the replacement

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.520 
higher quality than the replacement

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
but I never noticed that with light

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.980 
but I never noticed that with light
bulbs<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:58.310> it's<00:01:59.310> pretty<00:01:59.670> wild<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.390> class<00:02:00.719> is

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
bulbs and it's pretty wild this class is

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080 
bulbs and it's pretty wild this class is
so<00:02:01.020> clear<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:02.009> see<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> filament<00:02:02.969> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
so clear you can see the filament you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.270 
so clear you can see the filament you
know<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:03.630> easily<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.799> one<00:02:05.009> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
know really easily and this one I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.389 
know really easily and this one I
noticed<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:07.409> glass<00:02:07.649> surrounding

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
noticed that the the glass surrounding

the<00:04:12.480> lens<00:04:12.690> already<00:04:13.019> but<00:04:13.260> these<00:04:13.920> these<00:04:14.280> are

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
the lens already but these these are

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.460 
the lens already but these these are
kind<00:04:14.730> of<00:04:14.790> yellow<00:04:14.970> yellowing<00:04:15.840> just<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.260> little

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
kind of yellow yellowing just a little

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.110 
kind of yellow yellowing just a little
bit<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.650> guess<00:04:16.739> because<00:04:17.280> they<00:04:17.400> got<00:04:17.549> like<00:04:17.729> 12

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
bit I guess because they got like 12

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.090 
bit I guess because they got like 12
years<00:04:18.359> on<00:04:18.510> them<00:04:18.690> or<00:04:18.750> whatever<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:19.290> don't<00:04:20.040> know

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
years on them or whatever I don't know

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.520 
years on them or whatever I don't know
if<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.250> can<00:04:20.400> see<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.760> yellowing<00:04:21.269> at<00:04:22.169> all<00:04:22.260> this

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
if you can see the yellowing at all this

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.360 
if you can see the yellowing at all this
one<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.010> passenger-side<00:04:23.610> one

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.000 

so<00:04:27.270> one<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:27.690> them<00:04:27.780> had<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.020> little<00:04:28.530> bit<00:04:28.800> more

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
so one of them had a little bit more

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.440 
so one of them had a little bit more
yellowing<00:04:29.580> on<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:29.880> than<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.150> other<00:04:30.180> one

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
yellowing on it than the other one

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.760 
yellowing on it than the other one
because<00:04:30.630> obviously<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:31.110> driver<00:04:31.350> said<00:04:31.620> when

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
because obviously the driver said when

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.740 
because obviously the driver said when
you're<00:04:32.010> going<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.190> use<00:04:32.370> all<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.700> time<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.720> I

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
you're going to use all the time so I

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.450 
you're going to use all the time so I
put<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.110> cleanest<00:04:34.530> one<00:04:34.740> on<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.010> driver's

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
put the cleanest one on the driver's

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.800 
put the cleanest one on the driver's
side<00:04:35.490> because<00:04:35.880> this<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.240> one<00:04:36.390> that<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:36.540> want

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
side because this is the one that I want

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.460 
side because this is the one that I want
to<00:04:36.870> use<00:04:37.140> all<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.100> time<00:04:38.390> so<00:04:39.390> but<00:04:40.200> they're<00:04:40.380> not

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
to use all the time so but they're not

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.190 
to use all the time so but they're not
bad<00:04:40.680> they're<00:04:40.740> not<00:04:41.400> bad<00:04:41.820> at<00:04:41.940> all<00:04:42.030> for<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.630> clean

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
bad they're not bad at all for I clean

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.220 
bad they're not bad at all for I clean
them<00:04:43.350> up<00:04:43.410> with<00:04:43.710> some<00:04:43.740> 409<00:04:44.340> -<00:04:44.550> and<00:04:44.790> rags<00:04:45.230> just

this whole thing and I had broke a

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.020 
this whole thing and I had broke a

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
switch on this side so I repaired it

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.950 
switch on this side so I repaired it
with<00:04:54.210> j-b<00:04:54.840> weld<00:04:55.020> anyways<00:04:56.390> those<00:04:57.390> pretty<00:04:57.690> cool

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
with j-b weld anyways those pretty cool

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.690 
with j-b weld anyways those pretty cool
the<00:04:58.890> switch<00:04:59.100> right<00:04:59.910> here<00:05:01.160> comes<00:05:02.160> apart<00:05:02.520> and

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
the switch right here comes apart and

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.810 
the switch right here comes apart and
like<00:05:02.910> three<00:05:03.330> pieces<00:05:03.540> and<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.290> back<00:05:04.500> and<00:05:04.830> it's

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
like three pieces and the back and it's

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.730 
like three pieces and the back and it's
quite<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.090> job<00:05:06.360> it's<00:05:06.780> quite<00:05:06.960> an<00:05:07.110> effort<00:05:07.260> I<00:05:07.560> mean
