00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.310
 Olympic medal winner trust 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.310
 for years on slip of passy 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.290
 she is one of the first to ride one 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.490
 world novelty the sirius dressage saddle with 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.500
 frt system 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.380
 i've been training christina for a while now 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.340
 2009 except a substantial portion 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.810
 talent it is obviously important that 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.740
 Horse and rider perfect to each other 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.060
 fit and work hard 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.990
 otherwise, successes are at this level 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.350
 not possible 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.369
 christina is now world class 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.119
 Of course she needs one for that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.119
 appropriate equipment 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.109
 the special the mrt system of sirius 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.670
 the new shape of the head ensures that 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.469
 that the scapula cartilage of the 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.350
 horses is no longer restricted 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.789
 and the shoulder can freely rotate that 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.780
 horse can work in all grades 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.780
 move freely 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.500
 It is important that I am in the saddle 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.810
 I feel and do that only when I know 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.219
 that is a breast possible 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.090
 has freedom of movement and is free 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.039
 can unfold 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.060
 because only then can we work together 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.060
 bring good performance 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.980
 the training with the new series was 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.290
 pretty interesting it is direct 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.629
 positively noticed that the saddle one 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.220
 is has exceptionally good passform 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.069
 really the feeling that the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.510
 Move horses with the serious freer 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.970
 that is for the whole 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.430
 Letting go of the horse for a 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.040
 optimal workout and of course 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.700
 long term for the successes of the tournament 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.700
 very important 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.230
 It is important to me that I am one 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.270
 manufacturer's thoughts on how to do it 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.440
 you have the side fences and accessories yet 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.440
 make horses friendlier 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.440
 I am happy about the partnerships 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.160
 the goal is on my horses 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.990
 really good 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.990
