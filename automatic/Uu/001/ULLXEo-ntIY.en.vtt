whole bunch of people on it and USB

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.580 
whole bunch of people on it and USB
tethering<00:01:14.760> me<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.540> tether<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.080> via<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
tethering me and you tether it via the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.429 
tethering me and you tether it via the
Apple<00:01:16.920> wire<00:01:17.509> which<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.689> actually<00:01:18.840> recommend

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
Apple wire which I actually recommend

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.980 
Apple wire which I actually recommend
because<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.830> charges<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> same<00:01:20.759> time<00:01:21.000> ok

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
because it charges at the same time ok

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.190 
because it charges at the same time ok
so<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.920> use<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.400> wireless<00:01:23.970> hotspot<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.900> have

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
so to use the wireless hotspot we have

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.980 
so to use the wireless hotspot we have
right<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.790> our<00:01:27.000> menu<00:01:27.330> where<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.689> can

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
right here we have our menu where we can

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.420 
right here we have our menu where we can
pick<00:01:28.140> our<00:01:28.320> name<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.860> name<00:01:29.189> it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
pick our name I just name it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.429 
pick our name I just name it
iPhone<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.090> comes<00:01:30.270> as<00:01:30.450> PDA<00:01:30.840> net<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.350> know

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
iPhone it comes as PDA net you know

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.410 
iPhone it comes as PDA net you know
standard<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.610> essa'<00:01:32.820> name<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.119> comes<00:01:33.270> with

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
standard that essa' name it comes with

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.870 
standard that essa' name it comes with
you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:33.930> pick<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> password<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.070> WEP<00:01:35.670> so

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
you can pick a password it's a WEP so

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.450 
you can pick a password it's a WEP so
it's<00:01:36.030> really<00:01:36.299> easy<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.780> hack<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.680> don't

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
it's really easy that hack so I don't

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.830 
it's really easy that hack so I don't
choose<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.700> password<00:01:38.909> because<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.810> think

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
choose a password because I don't think

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.240 
choose a password because I don't think
anyone's<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.439> join<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.009> I'm

okay<00:01:59.009> now<00:01:59.159> we're<00:01:59.340> looking<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.670> my<00:01:59.790> computer

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
okay now we're looking at my computer

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.080 
okay now we're looking at my computer
desktop<00:02:00.540> right<00:02:00.899> here<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.920> my<00:02:02.219> wireless

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
desktop right here I have my wireless

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.330 
desktop right here I have my wireless
hotspot<00:02:03.750> all<00:02:04.049> set<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.740> gives<00:02:04.860> me<00:02:05.040> all<00:02:05.070> this

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
hotspot all set up it gives me all this

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.389 
hotspot all set up it gives me all this
information<00:02:06.119> here<00:02:06.360> tells<00:02:06.750> me<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.890> guess

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
information here tells me like I guess

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.729 
information here tells me like I guess
that's<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.789> web<00:02:09.149> address<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:10.259> bytes<00:02:10.500> I'm

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that's the web address the bytes I'm

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.800 
that's the web address the bytes I'm
using<00:02:10.950> activities<00:02:11.910> going<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.300> and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
using activities going on and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.660 
using activities going on and
a<00:02:12.840> percentage<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.010> all<00:02:14.130> that's<00:02:14.280> actually

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
a percentage so all that's actually

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.430 
a percentage so all that's actually
pretty<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:15.360> know<00:02:15.390> useful<00:02:15.810> know<00:02:15.989> by<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.260> ways

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
pretty you know useful know by the ways

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.500 
pretty you know useful know by the ways

refresh it mind you this is not going to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.259 
refresh it mind you this is not going to
be<00:02:39.599> blazing<00:02:40.349> fast<00:02:40.620> because<00:02:41.610> first<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.209> all

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
be blazing fast because first of all

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.330 
be blazing fast because first of all
it's<00:02:42.510> taking<00:02:42.900> your<00:02:43.019> 3G<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.680> converting<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.310> to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
it's taking your 3G and converting it to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.759 
it's taking your 3G and converting it to
Wi-Fi<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.239> it's<00:02:45.780> definitely<00:02:46.140> not<00:02:46.230> as<00:02:46.380> fast<00:02:46.590> as

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
Wi-Fi and it's definitely not as fast as

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.150 
Wi-Fi and it's definitely not as fast as
my<00:02:46.950> Phi<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.700> if<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.630> want<00:02:48.810> speed<00:02:49.110> my<00:02:49.350> fan<00:02:49.620> my

see right down here that it's loading
much<00:04:49.920> faster<00:04:50.430> than<00:04:50.670> you<00:04:51.240> know<00:04:51.500> without<00:04:52.500> thethe

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
much faster than you know without thethe

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.310 
much faster than you know without thethe
without<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.370> wired<00:04:53.580> connection<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.780> it's<00:04:55.170> all

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
without the wired connection so it's all

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.930 
without the wired connection so it's all
around<00:04:55.590> just<00:04:55.890> better<00:04:56.160> than<00:04:56.490> Wireless

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
around just better than Wireless

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.410 
around just better than Wireless
obviously<00:04:57.860> all<00:04:58.860> right<00:04:59.010> so<00:04:59.250> it's<00:04:59.790> called<00:05:00.030> PDA
