00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.970
 the violent start of a wild boar in a crash of bronze 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:11.729
 it's exploding the adrenaline rate of ordinary mortals 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.500
 nature has endowed this animal with savage force and when one breaks the million 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.260
 it's at the speed of light ap 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.490
 once launched 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.029
 a week ago the chances of continuing I'm a little too big 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.460
 dog against 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.380
 the boar is able to make points of more than 40 km 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.850
 without breaking the 50 mark, unless otherwise 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.790
 it's not a sprint somewhere else rather a runner 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.970
 we know that his race has an incredible sense of power 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.110
 tough 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.160
 he can not maintain a high speed too long 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.640
 not sweating his temperature rises quickly he needs 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.640
 imperatively find water to cool off 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.150
 for the chance to see running wild boars for a long time 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.260
 the responsible hunter must be interested in his management 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.480
 in the matter franÃ§ois magne 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.860
 who manages the purchase on the forest of ice is a 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.910
 precursor 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.740
 and remains a reference 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.770
 that's very special 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.320
 a site that owes its name 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.280
 in history more than meet the 14 pm-6 pm 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.380
 this villager is completely destroyed all territories every 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.470
 farmers are hit hard 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.789
 to test stuff we saw the garage fire brother 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.290
 this is the result of this state 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.740
 decided to buy the land 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.820
 and two levers a letter of attribution today forest of the time 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.680
 further west whether it's forests 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.680
 to manage a forest on this site 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.780
 then at 25 or 30 years to take stock and it became apparent that 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.590
 base or what completely damn where it came to maturity it was necessary 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.890
 replace them 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.670
 and this to the state chose the goal of remaking this forest of 9500 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.510
 hectares destroyed by war 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.090
 a magnificent hardwood forest essentially 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.450
 at the base of letters 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.789
 on this site stone
