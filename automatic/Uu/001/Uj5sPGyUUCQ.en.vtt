three gun streak with this pistol I

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.609 
three gun streak with this pistol I
think<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> fury<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.170> frenzied

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
think it's like a fury and a frenzied

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.140 
think it's like a fury and a frenzied
kill<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:22.980> there<00:00:23.130> somewhere<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:23.580> well<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.119> I

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
kill in there somewhere as well so I

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.310 
kill in there somewhere as well so I
hope<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.480> enjoy<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.810> gameplay<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
background so right let's get back into

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.480 
background so right let's get back into
this<00:00:27.240> class<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.320> my<00:00:28.410> primary<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
this class so for my primary I have the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.630 
this class so for my primary I have the
type<00:00:29.760> 45<00:00:30.320> now<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.529> pistol<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.099> an<00:00:32.219> absolute

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
type 45 now this pistol is an absolute

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.110 
type 45 now this pistol is an absolute
monster

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
monster

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.510 
monster
it<00:00:33.600> does<00:00:33.750> 55<00:00:34.200> damage<00:00:34.590> per<00:00:34.829> bullet<00:00:34.860> which<00:00:35.309> means

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it does 55 damage per bullet which means

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.799 
it does 55 damage per bullet which means
it<00:00:35.610> takes<00:00:35.730> two<00:00:35.969> bullets<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> bring<00:00:36.510> people

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it takes two bullets to bring people

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.110 
it takes two bullets to bring people
down<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.980> two<00:00:38.160> bullet<00:00:38.399> kill<00:00:38.610> range<00:00:38.850> is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
down and the two bullet kill range is

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.490 
down and the two bullet kill range is
quite<00:00:39.450> fast<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.140> find<00:00:40.379> yourself

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
quite fast so you do find yourself

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.680 
quite fast so you do find yourself
consistently<00:00:41.219> getting<00:00:41.399> two<00:00:41.640> hit<00:00:41.820> kills<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.629> I

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
consistently getting two hit kills and I

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.880 
consistently getting two hit kills and I
just<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:43.050> using<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.410> pistol<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
just think using this pistol as a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
just think using this pistol as a
primary<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:44.730> good<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.969> use<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.329> not

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
primary it's really good to use if not

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.900 
primary it's really good to use if not
the<00:00:45.690> best<00:00:45.870> pistol<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.469> use<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.829> now<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.579> will<00:00:47.789> go

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the best pistol to use and now I will go

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.310 
the best pistol to use and now I will go
into<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.180> attachment<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> use<00:00:49.200> on

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
into my attachment that I like to use on

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.369 
into my attachment that I like to use on
a<00:00:49.379> check<00:00:49.530> 45<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.610> fast<00:00:50.820> mag<00:00:51.320> now<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
a check 45 and that is fast mag now the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.049 
a check 45 and that is fast mag now the
reason<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.710> like<00:00:52.920> using<00:00:53.070> fast<00:00:53.340> mag<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.730> because

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
reason I like using fast mag is because

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.549 
reason I like using fast mag is because
the<00:00:54.239> extended<00:00:54.600> mags<00:00:54.809> only<00:00:55.079> gives<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.320> three

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the extended mags only gives you three

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.410 
the extended mags only gives you three
extra<00:00:55.590> bullets<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.670> think<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.180> prefer

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
extra bullets and I think I just prefer

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.849 
extra bullets and I think I just prefer
those<00:00:57.570> ten<00:00:57.840> bullets<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> lot<00:00:58.350> quicker<00:00:58.530> than

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
those ten bullets a lot quicker than

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.099 
those ten bullets a lot quicker than
having<00:00:59.190> 13<00:00:59.579> bullets<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.940> total<00:01:00.300> don't<00:01:00.960> ask

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
having 13 bullets in total don't ask

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.869 
having 13 bullets in total don't ask
just<00:01:01.230> me<00:01:01.469> if<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.710> prefer<00:01:02.010> extended<00:01:02.489> mags<00:01:02.670> then

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
just me if you prefer extended mags then

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.490 
just me if you prefer extended mags then
go<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.170> wanted<00:01:04.379> another

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
go for it but if I wanted another

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.230 
go for it but if I wanted another
attachment<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.220> my<00:01:05.309> pistol<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.880> use<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
attachment on my pistol and use the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.030 
attachment on my pistol and use the
secondary<00:01:06.630> gunfighter<00:01:06.869> then<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.530> guess<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
secondary gunfighter then I guess the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.560 
secondary gunfighter then I guess the
other<00:01:08.070> attachment<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.820> probably<00:01:09.119> uses<00:01:09.390> long

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
other attachment I probably uses long

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.300 
other attachment I probably uses long
barrel<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> increase<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.890> two<00:01:11.100> shot

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
barrel just to increase that two shot

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.710 
barrel just to increase that two shot
kill<00:01:11.520> range<00:01:11.549> which<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.090> everything<00:01:12.570> when

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
kill range which is everything when

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.929 
kill range which is everything when
using<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.110> gun<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.860> that's<00:01:14.100> my<00:01:14.280> primary<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
using this gun so that's my primary and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.399 
using this gun so that's my primary and
my<00:01:15.119> attachment<00:01:15.630> out<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> way<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.380> let's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
my attachment out of the way now let's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.789 
my attachment out of the way now let's
get<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.830> my<00:01:17.040> lethal<00:01:17.250> which<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.090> c4<00:01:18.479> and

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
get on to my lethal which is the c4 and

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
get on to my lethal which is the c4 and
I<00:01:19.799> think<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.490> far<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.000> class<00:01:21.210> is

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
I think you can see far on this class is

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.149 
I think you can see far on this class is
probably<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.990> lot<00:01:22.140> more<00:01:22.170> crucial<00:01:22.740> than<00:01:22.770> any

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
probably a lot more crucial than any

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.620 
probably a lot more crucial than any
other<00:01:23.430> class<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.820> I've<00:01:23.909> used<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.240> before

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
other class that I've used it on before

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.660 
other class that I've used it on before
mainly<00:01:25.259> because<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.009> run<00:01:26.250> out<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.490> ten

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
mainly because if I do run out of ten

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.280 
mainly because if I do run out of ten
bullets<00:01:26.970> then<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.360> ability<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.990> flicka

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
bullets then that ability just to flicka

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
bullets then that ability just to flicka
see<00:01:28.500> far<00:01:28.740> out<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.340> get<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.670> kill<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.150> then

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
see far out and get that kill and then

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
see far out and get that kill and then
move<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.630> safety<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.140> finally<00:01:31.470> reload<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.250> I

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
move to safety and finally reload and I

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130 
move to safety and finally reload and I
think<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> C<00:01:32.759> far<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.150> helps<00:01:33.450> me<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.780> much<00:01:33.810> in

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
think the C far just helps me so much in

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.510 
think the C far just helps me so much in
this<00:01:34.229> class<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> think<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.159> definitely

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
this class that I think it's definitely

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.670 
this class that I think it's definitely
needed<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.000> pictum<00:01:36.360> loadout<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.439> right

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
perk is light weight now when you have

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.460

so<00:02:32.680> scavengers<00:02:33.100> much<00:02:33.280> needed<00:02:33.490> in<00:02:33.730> replacing

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
so scavengers much needed in replacing

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.460 
so scavengers much needed in replacing
you<00:02:34.270> rammer<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.690> not<00:02:35.080> only<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.380> it

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
you rammer and not only that it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.560 
you rammer and not only that it
replenishes<00:02:35.710> you<00:02:36.160> see<00:02:36.400> far<00:02:36.610> ng<00:02:36.940> tacticals<00:02:37.420> as

replenishes you see far ng tacticals as

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.860 
replenishes you see far ng tacticals as

so<00:02:38.200> yes<00:02:38.440> gamma<00:02:38.770> G<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.040> definitely<00:02:39.460> needed<00:02:39.730> in

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
so yes gamma G is definitely needed in

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.880 
so yes gamma G is definitely needed in

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
when an enemy is affected by the EMP it

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.890 
when an enemy is affected by the EMP it
disables<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.790> radar<00:03:28.120> which<00:03:28.450> ties<00:03:28.660> nicely

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
disables the radar which ties nicely

disables the radar which ties nicely
into<00:03:29.380> this<00:03:29.500> class<00:03:29.739> because<00:03:30.070> I'm<00:03:30.190> using<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.550> non

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
into this class because I'm using a non

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.790 
into this class because I'm using a non
silenced<00:03:31.030> weapon<00:03:31.330> so<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.720> really<00:03:32.110> do<00:03:32.200> think<00:03:32.230> EMP

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
silenced weapon so I really do think EMP

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.229 
silenced weapon so I really do think EMP
to<00:03:32.860> a<00:03:32.950> nice<00:03:33.160> addition<00:03:33.520> to<00:03:33.550> this<00:03:33.730> class<00:03:33.970> and

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
to a nice addition to this class and

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.180 
to a nice addition to this class and
they<00:03:34.300> really<00:03:34.570> do<00:03:34.660> help<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:35.020> out<00:03:35.170> so<00:03:35.739> that's<00:03:36.070> it

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
guys after the EMP s this class loadout

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.199 
guys after the EMP s this class loadout
is<00:03:38.290> complete<00:03:38.830> and<00:03:39.040> this<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.520> what<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.700> think<00:03:39.850> is

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
is complete and this is what I think is

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.330 
is complete and this is what I think is
the<00:03:40.360> best<00:03:40.600> pistol<00:03:40.989> class<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.530> this<00:03:42.070> is<00:03:42.220> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
the best pistol class and this is the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.560 
the best pistol class and this is the
point<00:03:42.519> where<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.730> die<00:03:42.910> in<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.090> streak<00:03:43.330> now<00:03:43.540> I

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
point where I die in the streak now I

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.570 
point where I die in the streak now I
think<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:43.930> get<00:03:44.050> spawn<00:03:44.380> nated<00:03:44.769> but<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.130> was<00:03:45.430> on<00:03:45.550> a

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
think I get spawn nated but I was on a

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.340 
think I get spawn nated but I was on a
23<00:03:45.970> streak<00:03:46.330> and<00:03:46.540> there<00:03:46.630> was<00:03:46.720> only<00:03:46.810> six<00:03:47.110> tags

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
23 streak and there was only six tags

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.870 
23 streak and there was only six tags
left<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.680> go<00:03:47.830> so<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.070> don't<00:03:48.130> know<00:03:48.550> if<00:03:48.610> I'd<00:03:48.760> have

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
left to go so I don't know if I'd have

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.390 
left to go so I don't know if I'd have
made<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.209> time<00:03:49.420> who<00:03:49.840> knows<00:03:50.050> but<00:03:50.769> if<00:03:51.130> I<00:03:51.280> got

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
made it in time who knows but if I got
