uploading<00:05:24.340> whenever<00:05:24.940> in<00:05:25.270> their<00:05:25.449> families<00:05:25.930> at

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
uploading whenever in their families at

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.270 
uploading whenever in their families at
the<00:05:26.440> end<00:05:26.909> it's<00:05:27.909> really<00:05:28.270> slows<00:05:28.659> down<00:05:28.870> there<00:05:29.280> for

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
the end it's really slows down there for

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.999 
the end it's really slows down there for
everybody<00:05:30.550> so<00:05:30.940> that's<00:05:31.180> why<00:05:31.560> kind<00:05:32.560> of<00:05:32.680> take<00:05:32.860> it

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
everybody so that's why kind of take it

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.850 
everybody so that's why kind of take it
a<00:05:33.070> little<00:05:33.190> bit<00:05:33.400> over<00:05:35.039> but<00:05:36.210> anyway<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.740> guess<00:05:38.740> it

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
a little bit over but anyway I guess it

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.350 
a little bit over but anyway I guess it
is<00:05:38.979> part<00:05:39.280> raise<00:05:39.430> a<00:05:39.460> team<00:05:39.729> that<00:05:39.940> runs<00:05:40.090> through

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
is part raise a team that runs through

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.879 
is part raise a team that runs through
and<00:05:40.960> it<00:05:41.139> just<00:05:41.320> stay<00:05:41.469> tuned<00:05:41.680> to<00:05:41.710> my<00:05:41.860> channel
