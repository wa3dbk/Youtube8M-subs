your mouth or doing something at all

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.390 
your mouth or doing something at all
times<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.620> when<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:32.040> doing<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
times so when you're doing the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.100 
times so when you're doing the
fruitarian<00:01:32.700> cleanse<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.600> eat<00:01:33.720> fruit<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.580 

second<00:01:38.150> reason<00:01:38.360> is<00:01:38.570> because<00:01:40.180> um<00:01:41.380> throat<00:01:42.380> has

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
second reason is because um throat has

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.500 
second reason is because um throat has
sugar<00:01:42.860> in<00:01:43.010> it<00:01:43.220> fruit<00:01:43.610> has<00:01:43.790> a<00:01:43.820> lot<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.120> sugar<00:01:44.360> in

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
sugar in it fruit has a lot of sugar in

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.450 
sugar in it fruit has a lot of sugar in
it<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:44.960> that's<00:01:45.530> some<00:01:45.800> reason<00:01:46.190> that<00:01:46.280> people

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
it and that's some reason that people

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.610 
it and that's some reason that people
and<00:01:47.030> that's<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.750> reason<00:01:47.870> that<00:01:48.050> people<00:01:48.290> get

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
and that's the reason that people get

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.520 
and that's the reason that people get
confused<00:01:48.860> thinking<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:50.080> fruit<00:01:51.080> isn't<00:01:51.290> that

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530

confused thinking that fruit isn't that
healthy<00:01:51.860> for<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.250> because<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:52.550> has<00:01:52.850> a<00:01:52.880> lot<00:01:53.150> of
