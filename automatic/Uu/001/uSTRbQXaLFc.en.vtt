speakers<00:00:54.410> for<00:00:54.949> my<00:00:54.980> computer<00:00:55.489> um<00:00:55.670> but<00:00:56.629> yeah

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.549 
speakers for my computer um but yeah
we'll<00:00:57.109> see<00:00:57.289> so<00:00:57.829> basically<00:00:58.609> I<00:00:59.000> think<00:00:59.600> that

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
we'll see so basically I think that

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:08.370 
we'll see so basically I think that
comes<00:01:00.859> off<00:01:01.039> like<00:01:01.280> that<00:01:02.440> these<00:01:03.440> fold<00:01:03.980> down<00:01:05.590> um

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
comes off like that these fold down um

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.690 
comes off like that these fold down um
that<00:01:09.380> goes<00:01:09.770> there<00:01:10.390> okay<00:01:12.250> that's<00:01:13.250> them<00:01:13.490> and

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
that goes there okay that's them and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.450 
that goes there okay that's them and
then<00:01:13.820> your<00:01:13.970> ipod<00:01:14.390> fits<00:01:14.750> right<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.229> here<00:01:15.470> now

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
then your ipod fits right in here now

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.450 
then your ipod fits right in here now
