00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:25.416
 Mature opinions, arrogant opinions 

00:00:26.457 --> 00:00:29.319
 about our country. 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.903
 Day and night they drive 

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:37.689
 about our country. 

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:42.039
 I would also like to 

00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:46.791
 Have such great certitudes. 

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:51.225
 But that's the way things are, 

00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:56.559
 the accounts do not work out well. 

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:02.799
 How lucky 

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:08.178
 the one of those who are everywhere. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.151
 They fly over the weed. 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.159
 Nobody told me 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:26.895
 how complicated it is to be Basque. 

00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:30.663
 nobody told me it was better 

00:01:31.743 --> 00:01:36.543
 choose to be a citizen of the world. 

00:01:37.887 --> 00:01:43.560
 I would like to sing soft songs. 

00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:50.457
 Ground 

00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:54.168
 to that which is in shady terrain. 

00:01:57.208 --> 00:02:00.729
 Take care of what you want. 

00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:23.415
 And they tell me this way: 

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:29.031
 What are these love stories? 

00:02:30.273 --> 00:02:32.913
 Coexistence is in danger 

00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:37.938
 and you with your songs. 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:46.449
 I would like to sing soft songs. 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.873
 Ground 

00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:56.712
 to that which is in shady terrain. 

00:02:58.623 --> 00:03:02.529
 Take care of what you want. 

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:10.650
 I would like to sing soft songs. 

00:03:13.108 --> 00:03:16.876
 Ground 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.631
 to that which is in shady terrain. 

00:03:23.463 --> 00:03:27.567
 Take care of what you want. 

00:03:28.752 --> 00:03:32.097
 Take care of what you hate. 

00:03:32.538 --> 00:03:37.287
 Take care of what you want.
