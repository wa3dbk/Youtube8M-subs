00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.340
 everyone can use the utility vehicle from the 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.180
 Cabin circumferentially to the chassis 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.239
 support 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.160
 that means we can develop concepts 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.739
 we can validate this means 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.110
 calculate we can create variants 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.239
 We can also get these components in the end 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.100
 finish developing to prototypes 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.720
 We deliver the manufacturer to you 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.450
 to take the test 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.010
 In addition, we can always do that 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.680
 stronger electronic 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.170
 components of the commercial vehicle also 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.090
 develop with the oem with the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.670
 Manufacturer together in the vehicle 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.619
 integrate 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.830
 a topological optimized chassis 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.509
 with an ecologically optimized cabin 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.820
 that means we have here from nature 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.440
 we have learned a cabin and a 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.000
 chassis as developed as nature 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.990
 would have done if this vehicle 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.710
 would have grown 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.060
 We have a technology for that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.710
 imputed where we are convinced that 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.869
 you in the next few years enormously 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.420
 will gain potential and that the 3 d 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.869
 troupes 3d printing is yes today 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.550
 already possible in the private sector 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.410
 can already buy the first devices 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.630
 It can also steel materials 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.819
 print the aircraft industry sets 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.130
 already printed parts and we are 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.509
 the conviction that there where varianz 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.950
 plays a role and that is the case 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.780
 commercial vehicle so this 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.000
 manufacturing processes have a future 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.560
 becomes 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.899
 the advantages of this new bionic 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.860
 concept I can best directly on 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.380
 explain the framework 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.630
 one of the advantages of a cage structure 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.190
 is it better to get the axles 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.869
 you can not connect 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.880
 additional components like one 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.039
 ladder frame around the axle below 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.110
 to lead 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.569
 second advantage in the introduction of a 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.160
 independent suspension front axle where we 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.180
 the opinion is that of long term 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.980
 the trend will be different 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.980
 you also have the here 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.830
 possibility the visions so the ax 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.870
 handlebar directly to the structure 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.250
 you do not need a fall stool like you 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.920
 If you had it on now 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.989
 a ladder frame concept sets up 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.940
 Another advantage is the outside 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.250
 let that be very heavy and those with 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.490
 the consoles on a very narrow 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.480
 connection area tend to frame 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.459
 muster 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.379
 we would not have that twist anymore if 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.420
 we attach the parts directly to the side 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.330
 we can do that with one 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.700
 frame also many variants 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.640
 represent production order-related 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.140
 when you get that far you get 3d 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.970
 Printing process in steel too 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.950
 can produce economic costs 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.040
 here the development is incredible 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.150
 dynamic the idea would be that you knot 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.660
 prints similar to one 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.069
 bicycle frame and connects with pipes 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.590
 glued or welded 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.140
 you can with such a topological 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.970
 frame the whole packaging in the vehicle 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.040
 You can revolutionize all components 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.810
 with much more degrees of freedom very much 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.230
 arrange more sensibly than you do today 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.670
 can 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:25.660
 we believe that after the frame cage 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.650
 calculated from ecological points of view 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.629
 and construct a whole new impact 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.390
 will have a whole new impulse to 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:37.290
 the commercial vehicle in view of the 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.989
 topic engineering and production 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.000
 We have two messages for you 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.090
 manufacturer of commercial vehicles the one 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.220
 Message can be from the cabin to 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.400
 to the chassis the complete world of 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.319
 develop commercial vehicle design 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.569
 calculate validate integrate 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.880
 that is a competence you do not want 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.500
 Every street corner we find has one 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.840
 decades of experience with 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.910
 commercial vehicles and know us with the 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.419
 market environment and the variants in the best way 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.370
 a second message is edag 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.590
 not just a pure developer is the 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.019
 but it is edag is 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.970
 also an innovation partner of yourself 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.099
 thoughts about the future of 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.630
 commercial vehicle and its environment and 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.450
 also the driver and also the megatrends 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.669
 and we understand each other for the developers 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.130
 as a sparring partner as a partner 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.750
 Eyesight that develop ideas together 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.430
 I think you will from the 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.349
 development service provider in the future 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.360
 expect more than that he only cad 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.550
 You create the geometries you want 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.970
 development service providers have as 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.639
 partners to wallow ideas around concepts 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.820
 discuss about partnerships 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.140
 enter into 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.970
 also to develop topics perhaps 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.570
 only come on the market in five years 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.240
 can 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.370
 another message is that we 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.100
 start thinking now 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.660
 The truck frame has proven itself but the 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.950
 ford the disadvantages I just 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.330
 have described or much different to 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.580
 the advantages that I just described 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.980
 have that concept and so serious that 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.050
 one would have to think now how 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.960
 look like trucks in five or ten years 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.160
 and there are already concrete ones 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.710
 application cases there is a weight 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.150
 sensitive segment in tank silo traffic 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.070
 where to ask with such question 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.940
 that could actually start 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.940
 our messages
