00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.939
 yes 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.340
 this cheesecake and raspberries is very 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.299
 easy to make and has a very flavor 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.520
 rich 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.139
 you can prepare it at any time 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.600
 and sure that everyone is going to 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.169
 I'm going to tell you how I do it 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.980
 We are going to need cheese spread 3 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:27.800
 eggs sugar a little bit of flour a 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.499
 little sugar glas some raspberries 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.230
 lemon zest a pinch of sugar 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.989
 vanilla and laminated almonds for 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.990
 decorate we start throwing in a bowl 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.780
 large and the cheese spread add the 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.050
 sugar and with the help of some rods 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.120
 We beat very well until we get a cream 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.370
 on the other hand we throw in a bowl the 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.310
 three eggs and we beat them well with a 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.710
 fork now add the eggs to 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.740
 cheese with the sugar and beat it for 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.570
 integrate everything well we throw the flour to 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.940
 through a colander tapping 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.150
 in order to sift the and that is the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.280
 much softer cake 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.700
 add the lemon zest 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.520
 vanilla sugar and with a spatula what 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.009
 we mix 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.979
 we now incorporate a good handful of 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.799
 fresh raspberries or if you prefer you can 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.679
 use blueberries or blackberries and what 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.409
 we mix a little bit we are going to use a 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:29.110
 18 cm small mold 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.840
 diameter and with a little bit of butter 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.549
 we greased it inside these molds of 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.590
 silicone in theory is not necessary 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.289
 grease the but I like to do it 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.539
 we toss a little flour and shake 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.569
 very good to distribute it for the background 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.750
 and eliminate the excess so the cakes are 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.720
 unmold perfectly pour the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.149
 prepared from the cake and with the help of a 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.610
 spoon we can move a little bit the 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.950
 raspberries to make them look good 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.079
 distributed and we 're going to put it in the oven 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.979
 that we will have preheated with heat 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.120
 up and down at 180 degrees for 40 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.000
 minutes 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.940
 Finally in a pan without adding anything 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.520
 more we throw the laminated almonds already 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.070
 medium fire stirring with a spoon 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.350
 we're going to toast them when they're golden 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.560
 we remove from the fire and with them we go to 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.260
 decorate the cake and we have our 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.810
 rich homemade cheese cake with 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.910
 raspberries as you see I have decorated it with 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.610
 the toasted rolled almond and with a 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.520
 little bit of icing sugar you can prepare it 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.710
 as a dessert to a special meal or as 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.960
 a rich snack that there is nothing better 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.170
 now in winter that a cafetÃ­n 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.360
 hot and a piece of homemade cake 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.580
 I also leave a photo of the cut for 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.100
 that you see how beautiful it is and with this 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.140
 you already feel safe doing it because nothing 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.090
 more I hope you share it with your 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.370
 friends and family and that you like 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.370
