treats<00:00:23.279> are<00:00:23.430> going<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> be<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.090> season<00:00:24.560> so

right now I had my first battle ground
for<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.039> last<00:00:29.220> three<00:00:29.429> months<00:00:29.460> because<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.210> hit

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
for the last three months because I hit

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.549 
for the last three months because I hit
actually<00:00:30.720> quit<00:00:31.109> well<00:00:31.289> for<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> while<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:33.559> yeah

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
actually quit well for a while and yeah

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.780 
actually quit well for a while and yeah
it<00:00:35.070> sucked<00:00:35.460> real<00:00:35.910> bad<00:00:37.040> but<00:00:38.040> yeah<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.430> ok<00:00:38.700> it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
it sucked real bad but yeah it's ok it

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.560 
it sucked real bad but yeah it's ok it
sucks<00:00:39.000> sometimes<00:00:39.270> right<00:00:40.520> now<00:00:41.520> about<00:00:42.329> what<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
sucks sometimes right now about what I

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.420 
sucks sometimes right now about what I
think<00:00:42.899> about<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.320> season<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.950> wrestled

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
think about this season and wrestled

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.209 
think about this season and wrestled
rates<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.230> think<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.350> wrestled<00:00:46.770> rates<00:00:47.010> are

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
rates I think that wrestled rates are

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.220 
rates I think that wrestled rates are
going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.789> about<00:00:47.879> fifty<00:00:48.539> percent<00:00:48.570> worse

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
going to be about fifty percent worse

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.830 
going to be about fifty percent worse
than<00:00:49.649> they<00:00:49.920> used<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.250> last<00:00:50.489> season<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
than they used to be last season the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410 
than they used to be last season the
reason<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.559> because<00:00:53.059> melee<00:00:54.059> classes

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
reason for that is because melee classes

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.029 
reason for that is because melee classes
got<00:00:54.809> twenty-five<00:00:55.350> percent<00:00:55.559> Hillary

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
got twenty-five percent Hillary

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.279 
got twenty-five percent Hillary
reduction<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.670> their<00:00:57.030> morale<00:00:57.600> strike<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.079> one

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
reduction on their morale strike in one

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.130 
reduction on their morale strike in one
poisoned<00:00:58.530> all<00:00:58.980> these<00:00:59.160> kind<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> effects<00:00:59.940> on

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
poisoned all these kind of effects on

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
poisoned all these kind of effects on
top<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.649> got<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> wild<00:01:02.250> road<00:01:02.399> nerve<00:01:02.670> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
top of that we got a wild road nerve and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.200 
top of that we got a wild road nerve and
then<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.170> biggest<00:01:04.409> threat<00:01:05.210> legendary

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
then the biggest threat legendary

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.810 
then the biggest threat legendary

going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.750> change<00:01:30.930> nothing's<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
going to change nothing's going to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950 
going to change nothing's going to
change<00:01:31.979> all<00:01:32.640> these<00:01:33.000> are<00:01:33.150> cares<00:01:33.390> about<00:01:33.689> right

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
change all these are cares about right

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.340 
change all these are cares about right
now<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.380> there<00:01:35.220> PvE<00:01:35.670> content<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.420> mean<00:01:37.049> they

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
now is there PvE content I mean they

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.050 
now is there PvE content I mean they
don't<00:01:37.409> care<00:01:37.650> about<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.890> P<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> some<00:01:38.640> extent

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
don't care about the P to some extent

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.420 
don't care about the P to some extent
and<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.810> know<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.439> extremely<00:01:40.829> hard<00:01:41.159> to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and I know that is extremely hard to

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.730 
and I know that is extremely hard to
balance<00:01:41.790> ten<00:01:42.509> different<00:01:42.750> classes<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:43.500> three

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
balance ten different classes with three

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.149 
balance ten different classes with three
different<00:01:43.920> specs<00:01:44.369> each<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:46.590> this

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
different specs each but right now this

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.039 
different specs each but right now this
is<00:01:47.340> completely<00:01:47.820> retarded<00:01:48.210> because<00:01:48.570> it

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
is completely retarded because it

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.380 
is completely retarded because it
doesn't<00:01:49.409> take<00:01:49.530> much<00:01:49.710> effort<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.369> give<00:01:51.119> us<00:01:51.210> some

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
doesn't take much effort to give us some

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.600 
doesn't take much effort to give us some
more<00:01:51.420> survivability<00:01:52.409> some<00:01:53.100> more<00:01:53.280> healing

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
more survivability some more healing

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.050 
more survivability some more healing
right<00:01:54.110> okay<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.770> would<00:01:55.920> make<00:01:56.100> our<00:01:56.369> paths<00:01:56.700> way

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
right okay this would make our paths way

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060 
right okay this would make our paths way
to<00:01:57.119> overpower<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> PV<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
to overpower the PV and this is the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.630 
to overpower the PV and this is the
reason<00:01:59.219> why<00:01:59.430> dinner<00:01:59.790> for<00:02:00.090> growth<00:02:00.360> although<00:02:01.200> we

reason why dinner for growth although we

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.569 
reason why dinner for growth although we
