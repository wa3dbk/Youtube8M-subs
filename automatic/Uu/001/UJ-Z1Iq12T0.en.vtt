hi my name's Chris and today we're going
to<00:00:06.810> be<00:00:06.870> looking<00:00:07.109> at<00:00:07.229> one<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.379> our

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
to be looking at one of our

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.340 
to be looking at one of our
voice-activated<00:00:08.250> spy<00:00:08.790> cameras<00:00:09.240> now<00:00:10.170> this

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
voice-activated spy cameras now this

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.080 
voice-activated spy cameras now this
little<00:00:10.680> device<00:00:10.800> runs<00:00:11.580> off<00:00:11.670> its<00:00:11.820> own<00:00:11.910> little

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
little device runs off its own little

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.910 
little device runs off its own little
battery<00:00:12.510> so<00:00:13.020> you<00:00:13.110> can<00:00:13.260> pretty<00:00:13.470> much<00:00:13.560> put<00:00:13.800> it

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
battery so you can pretty much put it

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.800 
battery so you can pretty much put it
anywhere<00:00:14.100> one<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.880> biggest<00:00:15.240> benefits<00:00:15.630> is

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:15.810 
anywhere one of the biggest benefits is

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.870 
anywhere one of the biggest benefits is
that<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.199> stands<00:00:16.740> by<00:00:16.890> for<00:00:17.040> an<00:00:17.340> awfully<00:00:17.850> long

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
that it stands by for an awfully long

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.600 
that it stands by for an awfully long
time<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.900> it's<00:00:19.290> activated<00:00:19.920> by<00:00:19.950> sound<00:00:20.370> which

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
time so it's activated by sound which

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.340 
time so it's activated by sound which
means<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> goes<00:00:21.060> into<00:00:21.120> a<00:00:21.390> dormant<00:00:21.840> States

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
means it goes into a dormant States

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.440 
means it goes into a dormant States
sleeps<00:00:22.860> and<00:00:23.220> then<00:00:23.670> when<00:00:23.789> someone's<00:00:24.090> chatting

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
sleeps and then when someone's chatting

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.000 
sleeps and then when someone's chatting
in<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.600> room<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.050> will<00:00:25.170> wake<00:00:25.320> up<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.619> record

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
in the room it will wake up and record

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.010 
in the room it will wake up and record
so<00:00:26.610> sorts<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.090> locations<00:00:27.360> where<00:00:27.780> that<00:00:27.900> would

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
so sorts of locations where that would

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.930 
so sorts of locations where that would
be<00:00:28.110> really<00:00:28.410> helpful<00:00:28.560> if<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.610> were<00:00:29.730> say

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
be really helpful if you were say

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
a duplicate key then you could pop this

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.160 
a duplicate key then you could pop this
little<00:00:35.730> device<00:00:35.819> in<00:00:36.149> there<00:00:36.359> as<00:00:36.780> long<00:00:36.929> as<00:00:37.050> when

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
little device in there as long as when

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.860

they open the door the door squeaked or
they<00:00:39.870> talked<00:00:40.229> then<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.649> would<00:00:40.739> activate<00:00:41.069> and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
they talked then it would activate and

normal SD card you just slide it in on

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:01.989 
normal SD card you just slide it in on
the<00:01:00.209> top<00:01:00.389> here<00:01:00.600> we've<00:01:00.780> got<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.229> voice

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
the top here we've got the voice

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.329 
the top here we've got the voice

chatting at a normal volume so say the
sort<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.130> volume<00:01:08.310> I'm<00:01:08.520> talking<00:01:08.939> at<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.509> in<00:01:09.899> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
sort of volume I'm talking at now in a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.050 
sort of volume I'm talking at now in a
room<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.740> will<00:01:10.979> triggered<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> device<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
room that will triggered the device to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.179 
room that will triggered the device to
wake<00:01:12.210> up<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.659> start<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.200> record<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.009> that's

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
wake up and start to record so that's

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.740 
wake up and start to record so that's
the<00:01:14.310> microphone<00:01:14.460> essentially<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.630> back

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the microphone essentially on the back

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.779 
the microphone essentially on the back
here<00:01:15.990> we've<00:01:16.140> got<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.500> on/off<00:01:17.280> switch<00:01:17.310> this

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
here we've got the on/off switch this

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.849 
here we've got the on/off switch this
helps<00:01:18.149> you<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.570> turn<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.140> device<00:01:19.289> on<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.680> off

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859 
helps you to turn the device on and off

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:21.529 
helps you to turn the device on and off
like<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> little<00:01:20.460> video<00:01:20.579> camera<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
like a little video camera so if you

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.840 
like a little video camera so if you
wanted<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> override<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.409> settings<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.979> just

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
wanted to override the settings and just

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.219 
wanted to override the settings and just
record<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:24.750> you've<00:01:24.869> got<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.079> in<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229

along you can just press the button that

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.609 
along you can just press the button that
start<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.640> record<00:01:29.939> we've<00:01:30.450> got<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.719> voice<00:01:31.320> on

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
