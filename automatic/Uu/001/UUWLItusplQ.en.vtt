00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.600 
there they don't need that long time to
cook<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.020> be<00:02:14.620> careful<00:02:14.890> because<00:02:15.190> if<00:02:15.370> you

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
cook and be careful because if you

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.000 
cook and be careful because if you
overcook<00:02:15.970> these<00:02:16.420> they<00:02:17.140> will<00:02:17.410> become<00:02:17.770> very

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
overcook these they will become very

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.470 
overcook these they will become very
soft<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.520> mushy<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.000> then<00:02:19.180> they<00:02:19.330> will

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
soft and mushy and then they will

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.050 
soft and mushy and then they will
eventually<00:02:19.660> end<00:02:20.050> up<00:02:20.319> opening<00:02:20.560> up<00:02:21.069> all<00:02:21.849> right
