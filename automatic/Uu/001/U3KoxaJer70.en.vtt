00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.080 

welcome<00:00:01.740> back<00:00:01.890> we're<00:00:02.610> gonna<00:00:02.730> look<00:00:02.909> at<00:00:03.060> another

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
welcome back we're gonna look at another

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.260 
welcome back we're gonna look at another
example<00:00:03.570> about<00:00:04.310> dividing<00:00:05.310> whole<00:00:05.490> numbers<00:00:05.549> and

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
example about dividing whole numbers and

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.600 
example about dividing whole numbers and
this<00:00:06.450> one's<00:00:06.660> kind<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:06.899> special<00:00:07.370> it's<00:00:08.370> going<00:00:08.550> to

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
this one's kind of special it's going to

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.820 
this one's kind of special it's going to
be<00:00:08.700> special<00:00:09.090> because<00:00:09.420> five<00:00:09.960> will<00:00:10.260> not<00:00:10.440> divide

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
be special because five will not divide

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.209 
be special because five will not divide
into<00:00:11.330> 783<00:00:12.330> evenly<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.710> we're<00:00:13.830> gonna<00:00:13.920> have<00:00:14.099> to

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
into 783 evenly so we're gonna have to

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.810 
into 783 evenly so we're gonna have to
deal<00:00:14.370> with<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.790> remainder<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.480> end<00:00:15.740> alright

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
deal with a remainder in the end alright

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.519 
deal with a remainder in the end alright
so<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.060> want<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.359> do<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.600> problem<00:00:18.869> much<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
so I want to do this problem much the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.679 
so I want to do this problem much the
same<00:00:19.740> way<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.490> explained<00:00:21.029> dividing<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.570> my

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
same way that I explained dividing in my

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.920 
same way that I explained dividing in my
last<00:00:21.930> video<00:00:22.260> we're<00:00:23.010> gonna<00:00:23.160> take<00:00:23.340> 5<00:00:23.609> into<00:00:23.939> 783

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
last video we're gonna take 5 into 783

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.790 
last video we're gonna take 5 into 783
one<00:00:25.529> at<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> time<00:00:27.170> so<00:00:28.170> as<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.410> go<00:00:28.500> through<00:00:28.680> this

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
one at a time so as we go through this

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.460 
one at a time so as we go through this
process<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.340> think<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.730> myself<00:00:29.910> five<00:00:30.480> goes<00:00:31.199> into

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
process I think to myself five goes into

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.520 
process I think to myself five goes into
seven<00:00:31.769> how<00:00:32.040> many<00:00:32.279> times<00:00:33.079> well<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.260> largest

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
seven how many times well the largest

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.709 
seven how many times well the largest
that<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.860> go<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.100> there<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.399> just<00:00:35.730> once<00:00:36.030> so

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
that can go in there is just once so

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.920 
that can go in there is just once so
I'll<00:00:36.809> write<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.200> number<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.590> top<00:00:38.930> multiply

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
I'll write that number up top multiply

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.420 
I'll write that number up top multiply
one<00:00:40.200> times<00:00:40.440> five<00:00:41.239> get<00:00:42.239> my<00:00:42.360> answer<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.710> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
one times five get my answer and of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.000 
one times five get my answer and of
course<00:00:44.489> subtract<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.329> away<00:00:45.800> once<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.920> have

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
course subtract this away once I have

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.029 
course subtract this away once I have
found<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> 7<00:00:49.020> minus<00:00:49.500> 5<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.489> 2

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
found it so 7 minus 5 is 2

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.860 
found it so 7 minus 5 is 2
yeah<00:00:53.039> we're<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.399> pretty<00:00:53.550> good<00:00:53.640> shape<00:00:54.030> alright

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
yeah we're in pretty good shape alright

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.139 
yeah we're in pretty good shape alright
5<00:00:55.050> doesn't<00:00:55.410> go<00:00:55.469> into<00:00:55.590> 2<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:56.370> bring<00:00:56.610> down<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> 8

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
5 doesn't go into 2 we bring down the 8

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.510 
5 doesn't go into 2 we bring down the 8
to<00:00:57.809> help<00:00:57.989> us<00:00:58.109> out<00:00:59.840> looks<00:01:00.840> pretty<00:01:01.020> good<00:01:01.489> now<00:01:02.489> I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
to help us out looks pretty good now I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.780 
to help us out looks pretty good now I
think<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.879> ourselves<00:01:02.969> 5<00:01:03.629> goes<00:01:04.379> into<00:01:04.409> 28<00:01:05.040> how

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
think to ourselves 5 goes into 28 how

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.469 
think to ourselves 5 goes into 28 how
many<00:01:06.060> times<00:01:06.860> well<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> know<00:01:08.010> 5<00:01:08.369> times<00:01:08.670> 5<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.150> 25

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
many times well I know 5 times 5 is 25

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
many times well I know 5 times 5 is 25
and<00:01:09.720> that's<00:01:10.020> pretty<00:01:10.290> good<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> 5<00:01:11.490> times<00:01:11.790> 6

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and that's pretty good and and 5 times 6

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.690 
and that's pretty good and and 5 times 6
is<00:01:12.240> 30<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.439> too<00:01:13.680> big<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.159> we're<00:01:14.610> gonna

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
is 30 and that's too big so we're gonna

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:23.170 
is 30 and that's too big so we're gonna
use<00:01:14.790> 5<00:01:15.030> times<00:01:15.330> 5<00:01:17.330> 5<00:01:18.330> times<00:01:18.659> 5<00:01:18.869> 25<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.979> again

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
use 5 times 5 5 times 5 25 and again

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.780 
use 5 times 5 5 times 5 25 and again
subtract<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.299> away

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.630 

let's<00:01:28.790> borrow<00:01:29.060> this<00:01:29.330> three<00:01:30.400> so<00:01:31.400> we<00:01:31.520> can

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
let's borrow this three so we can

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.630 
let's borrow this three so we can
continue<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.150> process<00:01:32.180> one<00:01:32.869> more<00:01:32.900> time<00:01:33.640> so

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
continue the process one more time so

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.330 
continue the process one more time so
how<00:01:34.820> many<00:01:34.880> times<00:01:35.300> does<00:01:35.600> 5<00:01:35.930> go<00:01:35.960> into<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.070> number

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
how many times does 5 go into the number

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.660 
how many times does 5 go into the number
33<00:01:38.619> well<00:01:39.619> if<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:39.860> think<00:01:40.009> about<00:01:40.280> it<00:01:40.400> for<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.610> bit

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
33 well if you think about it for a bit

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.090 
33 well if you think about it for a bit
you<00:01:41.479> will<00:01:41.600> discover<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.200> goes<00:01:42.440> in<00:01:42.650> 6

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
you will discover that it goes in 6

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.920 
you will discover that it goes in 6
times<00:01:43.400> 6<00:01:44.360> times<00:01:44.509> 5<00:01:44.659> is<00:01:44.869> 30<00:01:46.570> we<00:01:47.570> will<00:01:47.690> write<00:01:47.899> that

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
times 6 times 5 is 30 we will write that

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.820 
times 6 times 5 is 30 we will write that
on<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.290> bottom<00:01:48.590> here<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.750> finally<00:01:51.350> subtract

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
on the bottom here and finally subtract

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.050 
on the bottom here and finally subtract
that<00:01:52.040> away<00:01:54.040> now<00:01:55.040> as<00:01:55.190> you<00:01:55.310> can<00:01:55.430> see<00:01:55.640> I'm<00:01:55.820> left

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
that away now as you can see I'm left

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.790 
that away now as you can see I'm left
with<00:01:56.240> this<00:01:56.420> 3<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.159> 5<00:01:58.159> doesn't<00:01:58.550> go<00:01:58.640> into<00:01:58.820> 3<00:01:59.800> and

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
with this 3 and 5 doesn't go into 3 and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.150 
with this 3 and 5 doesn't go into 3 and
I've<00:02:00.979> kind<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.399> run<00:02:01.550> out<00:02:01.729> of<00:02:01.759> numbers<00:02:02.000> here<00:02:03.160> now

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
I've kind of run out of numbers here now

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.410 
I've kind of run out of numbers here now
since<00:02:04.399> we're<00:02:04.580> dealing<00:02:04.910> with<00:02:04.940> just<00:02:05.240> whole

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
since we're dealing with just whole

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.480 
since we're dealing with just whole
numbers<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:06.350> might<00:02:06.590> seem<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:06.890> I'm<00:02:07.190> kind<00:02:07.399> of

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
numbers it might seem that I'm kind of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.029 
numbers it might seem that I'm kind of
stuck<00:02:07.729> no<00:02:08.330> worries<00:02:08.690> when<00:02:09.530> we<00:02:09.649> get<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.920> this

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
stuck no worries when we get to this

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.800 
stuck no worries when we get to this
point<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.580> we<00:02:10.670> have<00:02:10.820> no<00:02:11.150> more<00:02:11.360> numbers<00:02:11.600> to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
point and we have no more numbers to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.320 
point and we have no more numbers to
bring<00:02:11.989> down<00:02:12.250> we're<00:02:13.250> gonna<00:02:13.489> call<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:13.970> number

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
bring down we're gonna call this number

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:22.240 
bring down we're gonna call this number
the<00:02:14.570> remainder<00:02:20.350> ok<00:02:21.350> so<00:02:21.410> now<00:02:21.709> what<00:02:21.830> this<00:02:22.040> says
