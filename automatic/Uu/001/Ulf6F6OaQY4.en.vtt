00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.589 
we start building this car we just went
after<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.429> in<00:01:50.640> our<00:01:50.759> own<00:01:50.880> little<00:01:51.090> way<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.569> a

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
after it in our own little way and a

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.559 
after it in our own little way and a
little<00:01:51.810> garage<00:01:51.959> and<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:53.569> locked

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
little garage and we just locked

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:55.850 
little garage and we just locked
ourselves<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> garage<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.679> said

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
ourselves in the garage and we said

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.260 
ourselves in the garage and we said
that's<00:01:56.039> what<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.549> do<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.819> different<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that's what we do it's different you

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.359 
that's what we do it's different you
know<00:01:57.390> else<00:01:57.659> make<00:01:57.929> a<00:01:57.959> hood<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.799> power<00:01:59.009> window

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
know else make a hood on power window

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.149 
know else make a hood on power window
motors<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.849> let's<00:02:00.630> make<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> smooth<00:02:01.709> headliner

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
motors and let's make a smooth headliner

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.830 
motors and let's make a smooth headliner
and<00:02:02.459> let's<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.729> things<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> was

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and let's do things like that so it was

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.510 
and let's do things like that so it was
a<00:02:03.899> basically<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.799> lot<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.130> Street<00:02:05.340> rod

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
a basically a lot of Street rod

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.580 
a basically a lot of Street rod
involvement<00:02:06.420> from<00:02:06.689> back<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.110> day<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.500> we

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
involvement from back in the day that we

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.559 
involvement from back in the day that we
incorporated<00:02:08.130> into<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.369> car<00:02:08.579> focus<00:02:09.390> and

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
incorporated into this car focus and

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.930 
incorporated into this car focus and
hide<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.959> peel<00:02:10.079> the<00:02:10.170> nose<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:11.250> nose<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.730> based
