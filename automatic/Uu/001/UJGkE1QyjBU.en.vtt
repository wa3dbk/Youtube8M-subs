00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
make effing sure and there's a cool-down

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.190 
make effing sure and there's a cool-down
period<00:03:44.340> of<00:03:44.670> 30<00:03:44.880> minutes<00:03:45.240> so<00:03:45.390> I'm<00:03:45.720> thinking

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
period of 30 minutes so I'm thinking

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.160 
period of 30 minutes so I'm thinking
it's<00:03:46.380> gotta<00:03:46.620> do<00:03:46.890> something<00:03:47.550> surely<00:03:48.170> would

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
it's gotta do something surely would

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.540 
it's gotta do something surely would
make<00:03:49.380> sense<00:03:49.680> wouldn't<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.130> if<00:03:50.250> it's<00:03:50.400> got<00:03:50.520> a

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
make sense wouldn't it if it's got a

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.130 
make sense wouldn't it if it's got a
cool<00:03:50.700> down<00:03:50.910> period<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.450> you've<00:03:51.540> got<00:03:51.690> three<00:03:52.020> of

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
cool down period and you've got three of

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.350 
cool down period and you've got three of
them<00:03:52.170> as<00:03:52.350> well<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:52.860> I<00:03:53.100> guess<00:03:53.640> use<00:03:53.910> them<00:03:54.150> wisely

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
them as well so I guess use them wisely

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.190 
them as well so I guess use them wisely
but<00:03:55.350> um<00:03:55.590> this<00:03:56.310> seems<00:03:56.550> to<00:03:56.670> be<00:03:56.700> Maya<00:03:57.540> hand<00:03:57.900> cannon
