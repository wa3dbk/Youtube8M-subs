00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
it's supposed to be the best let's see

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.960 
it's supposed to be the best let's see
if<00:04:48.050> it<00:04:48.170> is<00:04:53.320> so<00:04:54.320> it<00:04:54.830> doesn't<00:04:55.550> really<00:04:55.670> look<00:04:55.910> like

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
if it is so it doesn't really look like

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.010 
if it is so it doesn't really look like
the<00:04:56.210> picture<00:04:56.630> I<00:04:56.660> guess<00:04:57.020> a<00:04:58.600> lot<00:04:59.600> of<00:04:59.660> tartar

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
the picture I guess a lot of tartar

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.580 
the picture I guess a lot of tartar
sauce

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:14.770 
no cheese no pickles just lettuce tartar
sauce<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.410> fish<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:08.300> regular<00:05:08.660> button<00:05:13.780> my

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
sauce and fish and a regular button my

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.650 
sauce and fish and a regular button my
first<00:05:15.020> reaction<00:05:15.200> to<00:05:15.590> this<00:05:15.740> is<00:05:16.570> why<00:05:17.570> is<00:05:17.630> this<00:05:18.040> $4

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
first reaction to this is why is this $4

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.340 
first reaction to this is why is this $4
it<00:05:21.460> almost<00:05:22.460> tastes<00:05:22.910> exactly<00:05:23.030> like<00:05:23.660> all<00:05:24.140> the

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.730 
and I the fish looks like it's better
quality<00:05:34.130> maybe<00:05:34.730> it's<00:05:35.660> just<00:05:35.840> more<00:05:36.050> flaky<00:05:36.560> than

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
quality maybe it's just more flaky than

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.900 
quality maybe it's just more flaky than
the<00:05:36.860> other<00:05:36.980> ones<00:05:37.220> but<00:05:38.830> to<00:05:39.830> me<00:05:39.980> there's<00:05:40.730> not

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
the other ones but to me there's not

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.820 
the other ones but to me there's not
enough<00:05:41.180> difference<00:05:41.570> between<00:05:41.900> all<00:05:42.080> these<00:05:42.380> to

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
enough difference between all these to

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.070 
enough difference between all these to
really<00:05:43.120> make<00:05:44.120> me<00:05:44.270> want<00:05:44.450> to<00:05:44.510> pay<00:05:44.720> more<00:05:45.020> for

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
really make me want to pay more for

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.830 
really make me want to pay more for
another<00:05:45.500> one<00:05:45.740> than<00:05:45.950> the<00:05:46.070> others<00:05:49.540> the<00:05:50.540> tartar

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840
