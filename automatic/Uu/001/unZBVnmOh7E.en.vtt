00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
back of the controller will just pop off

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.700 
back of the controller will just pop off
be<00:01:33.609> careful<00:01:33.969> sometimes<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.780> vibrating<00:01:35.500> packs

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
be careful sometimes the vibrating packs

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.279 
be careful sometimes the vibrating packs
gonna<00:01:35.950> fly<00:01:36.369> out<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:36.759> whatnot<00:01:37.119> but<00:01:37.450> if<00:01:38.110> you

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
gonna fly out and whatnot but if you

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:39.899 
gonna fly out and whatnot but if you
should<00:01:38.500> be<00:01:38.649> okay<00:01:38.950> that<00:01:39.159> are<00:01:39.250> usually<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.640> pretty

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
good you'll want to remove them it's

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.859 
good you'll want to remove them it's
just<00:01:42.039> easier<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.579> work<00:01:42.759> with<00:01:42.819> when<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.539> remove

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
just easier to work with when you remove

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.020 
just easier to work with when you remove
them<00:01:44.079> do<00:01:44.350> not<00:01:44.560> pull<00:01:44.920> by<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.219> cables<00:01:45.729> you<00:01:45.880> want

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
them do not pull by the cables you want

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.899 
them do not pull by the cables you want
to<00:01:46.090> pull<00:01:46.240> by<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.450> actual<00:01:46.929> connector<00:01:47.740> it<00:01:48.459> just

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
to pull by the actual connector it just

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.880 
to pull by the actual connector it just
causes<00:01:49.360> extra<00:01:49.869> work<00:01:50.079> you<00:01:50.110> repelled<00:01:50.740> those

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
causes extra work you repelled those

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.340 
causes extra work you repelled those
cords<00:01:51.369> from<00:01:52.329> here<00:01:52.630> you<00:01:52.810> can<00:01:52.840> actually<00:01:53.079> take

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
cords from here you can actually take

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.980 
cords from here you can actually take
out<00:01:53.530> their<00:01:53.740> board<00:01:54.039> you<00:01:54.969> do<00:01:55.179> not<00:01:55.360> want<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.869> touch

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
out their board you do not want to touch

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.300 
out their board you do not want to touch
the<00:01:56.229> board<00:01:56.469> itself<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:56.950> don't<00:01:57.100> get

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
the board itself you don't get

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.399 
the board itself you don't get
fingerprints<00:01:57.939> or<00:01:58.119> oil<00:01:58.360> or<00:01:58.600> anything<00:01:58.780> on<00:01:59.079> it<00:01:59.229> so

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
fingerprints or oil or anything on it so

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.399 
fingerprints or oil or anything on it so
try<00:02:00.399> not<00:02:00.429> to<00:02:00.849> touch<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.030> carefully<00:02:01.840> just<00:02:02.289> take

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
try not to touch it carefully just take

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.949 
try not to touch it carefully just take
a<00:02:02.439> board<00:02:02.920> they're<00:02:03.880> not<00:02:04.179> in<00:02:04.360> know<00:02:04.479> that<00:02:04.689> tightly

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
a board they're not in know that tightly

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.539 
a board they're not in know that tightly
but<00:02:05.319> it<00:02:05.380> will<00:02:05.500> take<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.709> little<00:02:05.979> bit<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.280> force

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
but it will take a little bit of force

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.639 
but it will take a little bit of force
to<00:02:06.610> pull<00:02:06.880> but<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.119> won't<00:02:07.239> break<00:02:07.420> anything<00:02:07.689> an

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
to pull but you won't break anything an

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.499 
to pull but you won't break anything an
analog<00:02:09.160> stick<00:02:09.429> might<00:02:09.640> come<00:02:09.819> off<00:02:09.880> but<00:02:10.209> that's

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
analog stick might come off but that's

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.180 
analog stick might come off but that's
okay<00:02:10.899> they're<00:02:11.200> not<00:02:11.470> actually<00:02:11.650> really<00:02:11.950> on

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
okay they're not actually really on

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.620 
okay they're not actually really on

buttons will just fall out just flip
them<00:02:30.519> out<00:02:30.670> you'll<00:02:31.000> get<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.180> handful<00:02:31.569> of<00:02:31.630> buttons

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
them out you'll get a handful of buttons

they<00:02:43.930> come<00:02:44.139> out<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.440> had<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.560> little<00:02:44.680> piece<00:02:44.889> of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
they come out you had a little piece of

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.259 
they come out you had a little piece of
trim<00:02:45.220> there<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.549> got<00:02:45.670> your<00:02:45.760> bumpers<00:02:46.090> as

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
trim there and you got your bumpers as

trim there and you got your bumpers as
well<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.630> can<00:02:46.780> separate<00:02:47.200> them<00:02:47.410> paint<00:02:47.829> them

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
well you can separate them paint them

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.550

the<00:02:48.519> sync<00:02:48.819> button<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.690> little<00:02:49.959> bit<00:02:50.109> trickier

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
the sync button is a little bit trickier

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.379 
the sync button is a little bit trickier
if<00:02:50.709> you're<00:02:50.829> gonna<00:02:50.980> paint<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.730> shell<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.090> it

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
if you're gonna paint the shell of it

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.140 
if you're gonna paint the shell of it
sometimes<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.799> can<00:02:53.980> get<00:02:54.100> mocked<00:02:54.280> up<00:02:54.519> so<00:02:54.940> be

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
sometimes you can get mocked up so be

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.629 
sometimes you can get mocked up so be
careful<00:02:55.510> with<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.560> trim<00:02:57.160> on<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.340> bottom

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
careful with it the trim on the bottom

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.490 
careful with it the trim on the bottom
it<00:02:57.910> also<00:02:58.060> just<00:02:58.359> pops<00:02:58.660> off<00:02:58.840> it's<00:02:59.109> not<00:02:59.260> attached

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
it also just pops off it's not attached

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.789 
it also just pops off it's not attached
to<00:02:59.530> anything<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:01.060> d-pad<00:03:01.930> on<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.500> other<00:03:02.650> hand

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
to anything the d-pad on the other hand

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.860 
to anything the d-pad on the other hand
is<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.400> hardest<00:03:03.670> part<00:03:03.760> probably<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.540> I'd<00:03:04.840> say

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
is the hardest part probably it I'd say

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.620 
is the hardest part probably it I'd say
just<00:03:05.530> because<00:03:05.709> it's<00:03:06.280> screwed<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.329> clamped

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
just because it's screwed in and clamped

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.210 
just because it's screwed in and clamped
in<00:03:07.720> but<00:03:07.959> all<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.349> want<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.530> do<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:08.889> there's

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
in but all you want to do is there's

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.949 
in but all you want to do is there's
going<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.459> be<00:03:09.519> two<00:03:09.700> small<00:03:10.120> Phillips<00:03:10.630> in<00:03:10.780> there

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
going to be two small Phillips in there

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.170 
going to be two small Phillips in there
just<00:03:11.380> remove<00:03:11.859> them<00:03:12.130> make<00:03:12.760> sure<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:13.000> don't

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
just remove them make sure you don't

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.670 
just remove them make sure you don't
strip<00:03:13.450> them<00:03:13.630> they're<00:03:13.750> quite<00:03:13.989> easy<00:03:14.169> to<00:03:14.290> strip

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
strip them they're quite easy to strip

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.140 
strip them they're quite easy to strip
that's<00:03:15.250> going<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.579> cause<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.000> lot<00:03:16.090> of

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
that's going to cause you a lot of

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.720 
that's going to cause you a lot of
problems<00:03:16.480> if<00:03:16.599> you<00:03:16.720> do<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:17.049> so<00:03:17.859> remove<00:03:18.579> the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
problems if you do that so remove the

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.560 
problems if you do that so remove the
screws

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.640 

once<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.720> get<00:03:22.870> them<00:03:22.990> removed<00:03:23.170> though<00:03:23.470> you'll

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
once you get them removed though you'll

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.620 
once you get them removed though you'll
notice<00:03:23.980> that<00:03:24.010> there's<00:03:24.310> still<00:03:24.520> a<00:03:24.730> clamp<00:03:25.240> fling

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
notice that there's still a clamp fling

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.570 
notice that there's still a clamp fling
it<00:03:25.720> in<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.440> take<00:03:26.800> your<00:03:26.890> needle<00:03:27.040> nose<00:03:27.280> pliers

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
it in so take your needle nose pliers

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.390 
it in so take your needle nose pliers
and<00:03:27.970> just<00:03:28.000> pinch<00:03:28.600> them<00:03:28.750> together<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.350> it<00:03:30.190> will

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
and just pinch them together and it will

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.800 
and just pinch them together and it will
release<00:03:30.760> you'll<00:03:31.030> have<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.330> a<00:03:31.360> little<00:03:31.600> bit<00:03:31.720> of

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
release you'll have to a little bit of

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.360 
release you'll have to a little bit of
pulling<00:03:32.050> and<00:03:32.290> prying<00:03:32.530> on<00:03:32.740> it<00:03:32.860> though<00:03:32.980> just<00:03:33.280> to

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
pulling and prying on it though just to

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.270 
pulling and prying on it though just to
actually<00:03:34.000> get<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.300> out<00:03:34.540> but<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.590> doesn't<00:03:35.920> take

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
actually get it out but it doesn't take

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.100 
actually get it out but it doesn't take
too<00:03:36.490> much<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:36.940> your<00:03:37.150> d-pad<00:03:37.480> will<00:03:37.660> just<00:03:37.840> pop

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
too much and your d-pad will just pop

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.840 
too much and your d-pad will just pop
off<00:03:39.960> so<00:03:40.960> you're<00:03:41.470> d-pads<00:03:41.830> off<00:03:42.040> your<00:03:42.400> shell<00:03:42.700> is

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
off so you're d-pads off your shell is

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.620 
off so you're d-pads off your shell is

completely empty triggers analog stick
like<00:03:47.230> I<00:03:47.350> said<00:03:47.410> they<00:03:47.740> just<00:03:47.800> kind<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.040> pop<00:03:48.220> off

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
like I said they just kind of pop off

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.400 
like I said they just kind of pop off
you<00:03:48.580> can<00:03:48.730> change<00:03:48.940> them<00:03:49.120> whatever<00:03:49.420> triggers

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
you can change them whatever triggers

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.130 
easiest way I have found is just there's
a<00:03:57.370> leg<00:03:57.580> on<00:03:57.700> them<00:03:57.910> just<00:03:57.940> kind<00:03:58.330> of<00:03:58.390> push<00:03:58.660> on<00:03:58.930> the

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
a leg on them just kind of push on the

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.840 
a leg on them just kind of push on the
leg<00:03:59.320> and<00:03:59.500> pull<00:03:59.710> it<00:04:00.010> will<00:04:00.310> take<00:04:00.460> a<00:04:00.490> little<00:04:00.670> bit

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
leg and pull it will take a little bit

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.030 
leg and pull it will take a little bit
of<00:04:00.910> force<00:04:01.180> here<00:04:01.270> once<00:04:02.110> again<00:04:02.230> don't<00:04:02.740> try<00:04:03.010> to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
of force here once again don't try to

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.440 
of force here once again don't try to
get<00:04:03.370> fingerprints<00:04:03.880> or<00:04:03.970> anything<00:04:04.210> on<00:04:04.360> the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
get fingerprints or anything on the

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.540 
get fingerprints or anything on the
board<00:04:04.630> but<00:04:04.930> just<00:04:05.620> pop<00:04:05.800> them<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.220> they<00:04:06.400> will

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
board but just pop them and they will

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.380 
board but just pop them and they will
pop<00:04:06.760> out<00:04:06.850> of<00:04:06.910> place<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.530> then<00:04:08.730> for<00:04:09.730> getting

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
pop out of place and then for getting

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.820 
pop out of place and then for getting
the<00:04:10.510> actual<00:04:10.900> trigger<00:04:11.080> out<00:04:11.290> there's<00:04:11.650> going<00:04:11.770> to

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
the actual trigger out there's going to

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.440 
the actual trigger out there's going to
be<00:04:11.860> two<00:04:12.040> little<00:04:12.250> tabs<00:04:12.400> on<00:04:12.790> either<00:04:12.940> side<00:04:13.240> of<00:04:13.270> the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
be two little tabs on either side of the

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.930 
be two little tabs on either side of the
trigger<00:04:13.860> separate<00:04:14.860> them<00:04:15.070> and<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.760> trigger

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
trigger separate them and the trigger

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.060 
trigger separate them and the trigger
will<00:04:16.239> just<00:04:16.420> pop<00:04:16.630> out<00:04:16.780> of<00:04:16.840> place<00:04:16.930> there's<00:04:17.799> going

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
will just pop out of place there's going

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.770 
will just pop out of place there's going
to<00:04:18.130> be<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.250> spring<00:04:18.850> inside<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.570> trigger

to be a spring inside of the trigger

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.510 
to be a spring inside of the trigger
don't<00:04:20.200> poke<00:04:20.440> yourself<00:04:20.560> me<00:04:20.890> out<00:04:21.040> with<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.310> or

at this point you have taken off every
component<00:04:35.840> on<00:04:36.199> your<00:04:36.650> board<00:04:36.979> every<00:04:37.400> part<00:04:37.639> on

the shell you have just a blank board
you<00:04:40.460> can<00:04:40.729> order<00:04:41.000> custom<00:04:41.419> parts<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:42.409> can

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
you can order custom parts you can

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.010 
you can order custom parts you can
replace<00:04:42.949> them<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.819> can<00:04:44.000> paint<00:04:44.210> them<00:04:44.479> you<00:04:44.780> can

replace them you can paint them you can

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.119 
replace them you can paint them you can
do<00:04:45.169> pretty<00:04:45.319> much<00:04:45.469> anything<00:04:45.830> at<00:04:46.009> this<00:04:46.069> point

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
do pretty much anything at this point

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.429 
do pretty much anything at this point
you<00:04:46.610> can<00:04:46.819> do<00:04:47.150> electrical<00:04:47.780> work<00:04:47.840> on<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.229> board

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:48.439

controller and customizing it putting it
back<00:04:54.319> together<00:04:54.469> is<00:04:54.949> pretty<00:04:55.520> much<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:55.849> exact

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
back together is pretty much the exact
