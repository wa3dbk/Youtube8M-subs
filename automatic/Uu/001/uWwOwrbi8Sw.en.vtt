your world it's a pretty neat figure I
could<00:00:32.790> use<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> little<00:00:33.480> bit<00:00:33.630> more<00:00:33.770> articulation

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
could use a little bit more articulation

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
top of the base see even with a base

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.779 
top of the base see even with a base
assuming<00:01:00.149> he<00:01:00.270> had<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> base<00:01:00.750> head<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.920> toe<00:01:02.129> he's

assuming he had a base head to toe he's

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.490 
assuming he had a base head to toe he's
still<00:01:03.059> shorter<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.660> miss<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.170> makes<00:01:04.350> him

all morning and unlike the voyager
voyager<00:04:48.130> class<00:04:48.190> version<00:04:48.640> of<00:04:48.880> him<00:04:49.000> he<00:04:49.090> does<00:04:49.270> not

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
voyager class version of him he does not

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.210

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
which is strange that the cyberverse

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.630 
which is strange that the cyberverse
figures<00:04:56.650> are<00:04:56.800> more<00:04:56.950> accurate<00:04:57.130> than<00:04:57.400> the

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
figures are more accurate than the

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.070 
figures are more accurate than the
voyager<00:04:58.030> class<00:04:58.060> baited<00:04:58.510> with<00:04:58.540> any<00:04:58.870> what<00:04:59.020> the

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
heck you can mount the guns here or here

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.760 
heck you can mount the guns here or here
whichever<00:05:04.390> you<00:05:04.750> prefer<00:05:04.900> it<00:05:05.290> actually<00:05:05.590> looks

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
whichever you prefer it actually looks

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.040 
whichever you prefer it actually looks
nice<00:05:05.950> this<00:05:06.160> way<00:05:06.510> rather<00:05:07.510> than<00:05:07.780> this<00:05:07.990> way

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
nice this way rather than this way

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.580 
nice this way rather than this way
officially<00:05:08.650> it's<00:05:08.860> supposed<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.340> be<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:09.760> way

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
officially it's supposed to be this way

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.610
