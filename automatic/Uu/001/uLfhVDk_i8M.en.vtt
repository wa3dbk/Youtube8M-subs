00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.830 
place it right in the box so yeah a
detector<00:02:22.040> from<00:02:22.340> season<00:02:22.819> 2<00:02:23.090> which<00:02:23.390> is<00:02:23.510> actually

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
detector from season 2 which is actually

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.140 
detector from season 2 which is actually
kind<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.049> cool<00:02:24.200> it's<00:02:24.500> kind<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.310> like<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.459> pokedex

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
kind of cool it's kind of like a pokedex

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.050 
kind of cool it's kind of like a pokedex
I<00:02:26.420> guess<00:02:26.719> and<00:02:27.409> the<00:02:27.470> d3<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:28.159> guess<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.579> is<00:02:28.700> Davis

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
I guess and the d3 I guess this is Davis

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.500 
I guess and the d3 I guess this is Davis
this<00:02:29.269> device<00:02:29.769> is<00:02:30.769> a<00:02:30.829> DNA<00:02:31.250> headsets<00:02:32.180> actually

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
this device is a DNA headsets actually

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.619 
this device is a DNA headsets actually
Biman<00:02:33.290> version<00:02:33.859> so<00:02:34.220> it's<00:02:34.459> Davis<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.329> yeah<00:02:35.450> once

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
Biman version so it's Davis so yeah once

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.899 
Biman version so it's Davis so yeah once

again the Japanese device I like them
actually<00:02:38.299> more<00:02:38.480> because<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.019> screens<00:02:39.290> are

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
larger and they're actually more

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.479 
larger and they're actually more

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
yeah I've played with this one a lot and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.559 
yeah I've played with this one a lot and
here<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.299> have<00:02:47.450> de<00:02:47.599> carros<00:02:47.930> golden<00:02:48.680> device

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
here you have de carros golden device

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.289 
here you have de carros golden device
after<00:02:50.569> it<00:02:50.900> broke<00:02:51.049> is<00:02:51.319> yeah<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:52.280> device<00:02:52.519> trying

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
after it broke is yeah the device trying

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.750 
after it broke is yeah the device trying
to<00:02:53.450> digivolve<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.650> Oman<00:02:54.919> and<00:02:55.129> not<00:02:55.430> being<00:02:55.609> able

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
to digivolve the Oman and not being able

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.470 
to digivolve the Oman and not being able
to<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.299> yeah<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:57.530> don't<00:02:58.099> want<00:02:58.819> to<00:02:58.879> use<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.239> much

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
to so yeah I don't want to use that much

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.179 
to so yeah I don't want to use that much
because<00:02:59.780> when<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.319> use<00:03:00.470> card<00:03:00.829> slots<00:03:01.099> and

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189 
because when you use card slots and

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.920 
because when you use card slots and
stuff<00:03:01.400> like<00:03:01.519> that<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:01.849> scratches<00:03:02.239> up<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.659> card

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
stuff like that it scratches up the card

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.460 
stuff like that it scratches up the card
so<00:03:03.409> yeah<00:03:04.129> it<00:03:04.310> has<00:03:04.489> pretty<00:03:04.939> sharp<00:03:05.419> edges<00:03:06.079> there

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
so yeah it has pretty sharp edges there

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.569 
so yeah it has pretty sharp edges there
so<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.129> more<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.669> display<00:03:08.150> use<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:10.250> here<00:03:10.459> you

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
so it's more to display use and here you

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.610 
so it's more to display use and here you
have<00:03:10.760> Tucanos<00:03:11.329> red<00:03:11.569> device<00:03:11.930> before<00:03:12.379> I<00:03:12.409> broke

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
have Tucanos red device before I broke

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.440 
have Tucanos red device before I broke
it<00:03:12.799> this<00:03:13.040> is<00:03:13.189> the<00:03:13.310> American<00:03:13.609> version<00:03:13.639> I

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.589 
didn't arrive at my house before two
months<00:03:20.389> so<00:03:21.109> I<00:03:21.139> had<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.590> import<00:03:21.829> it<00:03:22.010> but<00:03:22.599> usually

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
months so I had to import it but usually

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.689 
months so I had to import it but usually
it<00:03:23.659> doesn't<00:03:23.959> take<00:03:24.079> that<00:03:24.319> long<00:03:24.590> but<00:03:25.280> two<00:03:25.549> months

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:25.699 
it doesn't take that long but two months

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.849 
it doesn't take that long but two months
yeah<00:03:26.030> but<00:03:26.629> I<00:03:26.659> finally<00:03:26.959> got<00:03:27.079> it<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.440> I<00:03:27.590> was<00:03:27.709> so

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
yeah but I finally got it and I was so

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.860 
yeah but I finally got it and I was so
happy<00:03:27.979> this<00:03:28.669> yeah<00:03:29.060> I've<00:03:29.299> already<00:03:29.569> used<00:03:29.750> to

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
happy this yeah I've already used to

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.830 
happy this yeah I've already used to
card<00:03:30.139> because<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.889> card<00:03:31.609> was<00:03:31.790> more<00:03:32.269> like

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
card because that card was more like

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.960 
card because that card was more like
solid<00:03:33.319> so<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:33.590> could<00:03:34.040> use<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.220> harder<00:03:34.669> and

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
solid so you could use it harder and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.759 
solid so you could use it harder and
there<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.269> have<00:03:35.329> Davis<00:03:35.959> device<00:03:36.349> once<00:03:36.590> again

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
there you have Davis device once again

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.229 
there you have Davis device once again
the<00:03:36.919> American<00:03:37.010> version<00:03:37.340> there's<00:03:37.970> one<00:03:38.120> I've

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
the American version there's one I've

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.020 
the American version there's one I've
completed<00:03:38.629> so<00:03:39.440> govern<00:03:40.040> everything<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.579> can<00:03:40.790> I

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
completed so govern everything you can I

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.939 
completed so govern everything you can I
guess<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:41.510> now<00:03:42.079> it's<00:03:42.260> just<00:03:42.470> lying<00:03:42.829> there

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
guess and now it's just lying there

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.259 
guess and now it's just lying there
