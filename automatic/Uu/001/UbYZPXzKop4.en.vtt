00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
insane so that is probably why now

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.729

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
goes into the back of the net now when

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.979 
goes into the back of the net now when
it<00:02:59.700> comes<00:02:59.880> down<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.060> shooting<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.870> will

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
it comes down to shooting you will

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.930 
it comes down to shooting you will
definitely<00:03:01.320> be<00:03:01.620> able<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:02.130> score<00:03:02.400> some<00:03:02.670> nice

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
definitely be able to score some nice

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.670 
definitely be able to score some nice
long<00:03:03.330> shots<00:03:03.600> with<00:03:03.780> him<00:03:03.959> but<00:03:04.440> you're<00:03:04.560> gonna

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
long shots with him but you're gonna

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.290 
long shots with him but you're gonna
have<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:04.890> try<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> bit<00:03:05.550> harder<00:03:05.580> than<00:03:06.090> other

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
have to try a bit harder than other

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.090 
have to try a bit harder than other
players<00:03:06.630> because<00:03:07.050> his<00:03:07.260> shop<00:03:07.440> power<00:03:07.650> isn't<00:03:07.890> the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
players because his shop power isn't the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.150 
players because his shop power isn't the
greatest<00:03:08.220> yeah<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.000> think<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.330> has<00:03:09.390> 80<00:03:09.720> or<00:03:09.959> 81<00:03:10.380> so

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
greatest yeah I think it has 80 or 81 so

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.490
