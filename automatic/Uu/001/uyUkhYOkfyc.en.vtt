00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:24.130
 hello everyone guys just for those who don't 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.740
 know I'm the wife of a youtube 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.279
 he was very very famous in these in 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.650
 this period and it is luke 43 16 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.710
 yes yes boys I am Mrs. 43 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.040
 16 and you will wonder why I am 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.710
 here then I am here because seeing 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:47.020
 my husband every time on the internet 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.180
 he plays and says his things, he came to me 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.550
 also want me to start doing 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.320
 some videos and let's say I don't 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.750
 I will definitely resign on minecraft 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.149
 because anyway they are not their own 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.250
 expert but expert as me 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:07.350
 like adventure games and 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.720
 however, whether they have a history 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.899
 I will begin to want to show you between 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.140
 quotation marks fable iii then fable iii is 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.880
 a game 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.850
 as I said before the adventure he has 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.220
 many quests are done at the quest and so yes 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.890
 can choose a character to be a man 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.229
 woman 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:39.440
 or let's say we have to do various things 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:45.220
 missions to get various points as 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:49.240
 you can also choose various let's say 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.040
 various fighting styles such as 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.869
 firefighting as combat 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.800
 melee like magic 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.960
 so I decided yes as I like of 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.289
 Do this 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:08.920
 this game so I'll let you know 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:12.769
 a little for those who did not know him sorry 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.170
 today, however, I will simply show you 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.030
 how to create a character too 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.480
 because the time available to me a lot 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.690
 restricted and therefore unfortunately we could 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.800
 to begin like this then I will accept to 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.540
 game 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:35.319
 this is loading so it starts 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:38.069
 but I'm obviously but who will be 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.069
 and that will drive 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.120
 then guys see these 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.360
 practically they are the two characters that 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.020
 you can choose in this game that 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:58.110
 they are practically what i say 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.960
 protagonists of a city that you 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.660
 you will have to say conquer save 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.820
 help and I will decide to be 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.470
 obviously the little woman then the 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.470
 princess and crush 2 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.700
 obviously there will be difficulties 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.350
 normal challenge and blah blah blah I will do 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:28.370
 normal then I will accept with the stone 1 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.370
 and here I am the princess as it is 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.439
 here's the guys loading 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.090
 guys do the good in the comments because 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.040
 view with the straight lines of the well today 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.239
 these girls my husband obviously 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.670
 here is where the game obviously begins 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.129
 I won't start it. It's arrived 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.579
 so here is this city that you 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:55.040
 you will still have to govern or for whom 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:04:03.650
 tria see what to do but call it e 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:05.689
 of oppression and obviously he explains 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.439
 will explain it works I will join 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:11.540
 unfairly the game found in the 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.340
 I'm the best city, guys, but I'm here 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.540
 obviously I will speak sofas I hope I will 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.930
 feel 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.900
 shady though, put your thumbs up if 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.550
 you want me to start this adventure 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:31.250
 together with dying and as he says liuc e 43 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.250
 16 give everything and anyone uses incorrectly
