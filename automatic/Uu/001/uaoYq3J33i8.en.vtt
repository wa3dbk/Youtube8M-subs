hello everybody in this video image DJ

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.079 
hello everybody in this video image DJ
which<00:00:02.700> make<00:00:02.939> this<00:00:03.570> origami<00:00:04.140> box<00:00:04.680> here<00:00:05.069> it's<00:00:06.029> a

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
which make this origami box here it's a

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.070 
which make this origami box here it's a
very<00:00:06.240> easy<00:00:06.450> area

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
very easy area

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.820 
very easy area
so<00:00:08.069> let's<00:00:08.280> start<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:10.790> use<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:12.780> square<00:00:13.530> sheet<00:00:13.769> of

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
so let's start I use a square sheet of

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.910 
so let's start I use a square sheet of
paper<00:00:15.770> so<00:00:16.770> first<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.550> all<00:00:18.410> fold<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> paper<00:00:19.859> in

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
paper so first of all fold the paper in

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:30.970 
paper so first of all fold the paper in
half

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.950 

the<00:00:31.980> model

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
the model

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:49.029 
the model
holding<00:00:33.960> out<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.710> other<00:00:34.829> direction<00:00:45.079> right<00:00:46.079> so

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:57.470 

then<00:00:50.039> put<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:54.620> edges<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> paper<00:00:56.480> to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
then put here the edges of the paper to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.229 
then put here the edges of the paper to
the<00:00:57.510> middle<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.500> paper

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:34.730 

like<00:01:04.239> this

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.420 

now<00:01:35.280> turn<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.700> model<00:01:35.850> over<00:01:39.350> make<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.920> valley

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
now turn the model over make a valley

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.810 
now turn the model over make a valley
fold<00:01:41.760> in<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.060> middle<00:01:43.190> fold<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.310> model<00:01:44.580> in

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
fold in the middle fold the model in

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.370 
fold in the middle fold the model in
half<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.630> this

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.680 

now<00:01:52.070> fold<00:01:52.580> here<00:01:52.730> in<00:01:53.630> half<00:01:53.960> again<00:01:54.650> on<00:01:55.430> this<00:01:56.390> line

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
now fold here in half again on this line

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:05.859 
now fold here in half again on this line
here<00:01:57.050> and<00:02:01.930> take<00:02:02.930> this<00:02:03.200> flap<00:02:03.560> here<00:02:04.600> one<00:02:05.600> flap

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
okay turn the model over and do the same

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.140 
okay turn the model over and do the same
thing<00:02:25.370> here<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:26.299> this<00:02:26.480> flap<00:02:26.810> here<00:02:27.940> open<00:02:28.940> this
