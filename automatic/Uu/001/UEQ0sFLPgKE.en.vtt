00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.850
 we are going to do an exercise of 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:16.250
 recovery of objects to the sea from 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:18.200
 with a pace of almost we start with 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.119
 slow down the boat to calm the game by 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.960
 slightly facing the wind and we 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.960
 roll up the young being 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.790
 then we shoot down to go down under 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.830
 wind of the object in order to recover it to 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.250
 a close pace to be able to stop 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.250
 the boat 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.940
 it's good we turn on the engine for us 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.940
 help in the maneuver 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.200
 once we're pretty down to lov 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.680
 and we turn in stride to return 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.680
 to the object 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.950
 the engine can help make the transfer 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.820
 we aim the object at a pace of almost 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.909
 can help the engine to get more 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.909
 quick 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.780
 this day 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.100
 hang on 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:33.160
 when we are close enough the shock the gv and 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.459
 that we rattle in pulling we put the engine at 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.459
 dead point 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.260
 nearly 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.269
 the boat is not completely stopped 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.470
 at the moment of recovery it is necessary 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.790
 train to find the right one 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.790
 compromise on the approaching habitat
