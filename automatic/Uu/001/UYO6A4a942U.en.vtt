have<00:06:25.530> come<00:06:26.070> many<00:06:26.250> i<00:06:26.520> think<00:06:27.150> that's<00:06:27.300> how<00:06:27.360> you

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
have come many i think that's how you

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.730 
have come many i think that's how you
say<00:06:27.660> it<00:06:27.690> six<00:06:27.930> hundred<00:06:28.169> coins<00:06:28.289> for<00:06:28.590> him

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
say it six hundred coins for him

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.339 
say it six hundred coins for him
obviously<00:06:29.220> just<00:06:29.460> a<00:06:29.610> apps<00:06:29.910> Aleut<00:06:30.270> beast<00:06:30.990> for

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349 
obviously just a apps Aleut beast for

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.610 
obviously just a apps Aleut beast for
six<00:06:31.680> hundred<00:06:31.770> coins<00:06:32.180> 87<00:06:33.180> diving<00:06:33.510> 92<00:06:34.020> reflexes

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
six hundred coins 87 diving 92 reflexes

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.070 
six hundred coins 87 diving 92 reflexes
as<00:06:34.740> you<00:06:34.830> can<00:06:34.979> see<00:06:35.160> there<00:06:35.340> so<00:06:35.639> I<00:06:35.910> mean<00:06:36.389> reflexes

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
as you can see there so I mean reflexes

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.230 
as you can see there so I mean reflexes
is<00:06:37.229> mostly<00:06:37.800> what<00:06:37.979> I<00:06:38.010> look<00:06:38.220> for<00:06:38.250> in<00:06:38.460> fifa<00:06:38.940> 12<00:06:39.120> it

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
is mostly what I look for in fifa 12 it

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.969 
is mostly what I look for in fifa 12 it
seems<00:06:39.389> like<00:06:39.539> reflex<00:06:40.200> saves<00:06:40.410> are<00:06:40.620> the<00:06:40.740> biggest

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
seems like reflex saves are the biggest

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.520 
seems like reflex saves are the biggest
factor<00:06:41.789> to<00:06:42.450> whether<00:06:42.690> or<00:06:42.840> not<00:06:42.960> your<00:06:43.139> keeper<00:06:43.289> is

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
factor to whether or not your keeper is

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.250 
factor to whether or not your keeper is
a<00:06:43.560> beast<00:06:43.800> and<00:06:44.130> he<00:06:44.580> obviously<00:06:44.760> has<00:06:45.240> some<00:06:46.020> crazy

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
a beast and he obviously has some crazy

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.830 
a beast and he obviously has some crazy
reflexes<00:06:47.099> 92<00:06:47.580> for<00:06:48.060> six<00:06:48.330> hundred<00:06:48.390> coins<00:06:48.630> as
