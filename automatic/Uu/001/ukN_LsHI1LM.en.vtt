00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hi girls today video unpacking 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.450
 from the dress link website yes this year a 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.200
 libellus Chinese sites that do not put 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.700
 never their name in Italian on packages 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.519
 so every time you have to go for it 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.029
 an idea however east of a link is a site 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.010
 Chinese with shipping costs unfortunately 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.960
 not free but based on weight 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.550
 so you for each product alongside 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.590
 you have to put simit shipping to fine that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.320
 then calculates the shipping costs 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.989
 for each product, however, they are not are not 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.230
 high then text put it all together and 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.809
 we have nothing we start from this these 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.750
 guys these go well you know that i love 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.329
 I'm a brush fetishist 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.030
 i love nail art brushes when i have 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.140
 having seen these said no I want the point 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.190
 because you look at how particular they are 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.469
 here now this is an unpacking 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 live so I didn't try anything 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.699
 I can't tell you anything so let's see 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.079
 together 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.769
 then clearly you will see them at work 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.170
 in surely there is also in the art 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.530
 they are not good just for beauty I know 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.150
 too beautiful and there is therefore a small brush 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.920
 pretty tight for makeup and ounces 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.650
 I must say that I needed this between 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.990
 the other is beautiful also because the one 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.630
 whites and oh well 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.640
 you know that I have always used i 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.549
 Chinese brushes and I feel good too 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.100
 with those there are some good ones 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.829
 not good if you are lucky 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.540
 the good ones and us at home usually there 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.930
 always cut a little at least those 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.270
 by precision then these others are 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.869
 all of them are all long in the sector 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.729
 from the shortest to the longest 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.350
 these are all to do this can 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.159
 accuracy also be used because 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.290
 if not talking it is subtle we could 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.750
 go seems very interesting a lot 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.129
 interesting you are beautiful and interesting 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:11.730
 this is longer to do the lines and 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:16.590
 this very long to make other lines 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:22.230
 I see them a lot on a bit stiff 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:25.920
 I don't know how to try they are just synthetic 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.129
 who knows we'll see we'll see 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.660
 I will let you know then look here that 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.140
 wonder 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.140
 focus 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.760
 that is, the camera from development 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.019
 he didn't focus on these anymore 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.579
 girls 20,000 glitter strass not with 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.700
 the stars simple silvery whites 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:56.450
 the simple ones I don't know when ever 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.590
 I will use the ss5 measure 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.150
 if I 'm not mistaken because they are enough 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.540
 great 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.819
 and there will definitely put them in 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.530
 jars and then see I will give away giveaway 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.000
 contest for those who don't know when but there 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.459
 I will also use it because when I do 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.680
 a reconstruction is not these but use 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.319
 free skinny though when he puts it on 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.000
 use these enamel because it tends to 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.569
 sgarristi then with the reconstruction 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.120
 it's not worth it though, they are so many 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.239
 that is, imagine how many things you can 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.639
 do even if you have to decorate it is known 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.799
 anything to the lamp anything 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:35.500
 another thousand glitters a 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:42.709
 then another very useful thing 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:48.199
 and this thing is the kind that you 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:50.120
 move help are the ones who 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.629
 move do not do it property I do a 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.889
 slaughterhouse 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.359
 anyway if not what i am 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:56.560
 using lately to do the 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:59.440
 tutorial I find it good because 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.590
 just the stem, so go and go 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.060
 better to hold the tip and then 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.190
 very important thing that yes 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.770
 they can move so I want them 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.319
 use to make right happens gelli 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.599
 so as to put them as they move 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.970
 to always put in a gradual way of 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.769
 color so if I take a new rose it 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.090
 can easily insert on the 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.070
 retina no 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.230
 and these have us channel nail not 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.450
 they have the circle to close them blue 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.570
 I had it with the circle I don't know how me 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.350
 I find the nail are many 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.889
 maybe they are 25 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.680
 maybe something more than fifty 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.570
 however yes these are very useful for 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.700
 for all the prices I don't remember them 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.680
 I put the link under the budget anyway 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:50.710
 it was 20 euros for 20 dollars 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.729
 it seems that not everyone cannot 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.260
 much 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:59.680
 last thing supercar in these panels 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:04.060
 which by now has been eyeing everyone for centuries 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.460
 will mean difficult are two time 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.390
 they practically don't make the mayor will be 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.450
 one complete sex 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.330
 these are the fake practically of rial 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.810
 test match and follow us both in version 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.190
 big than in small version of these 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.919
 it is always heard very well 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:25.240
 so already on the safe side I knew that 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:27.130
 They were good and there were handles 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.020
 looking for different colors for sure 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.099
 I have pink interviews none 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:37.840
 wonderful soft kids we have to 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:45.160
 that is wonderful mentally there is this 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:47.410
 however the blush then this for for 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.729
 both liquid and especially foundation 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.610
 Puglia and girls of the blue and 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.910
 very soft it is identical to that of snow 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:59.110
 cosmetics that I have is also that of di 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.110
 essence really are not great 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.460
 even stink I still wash it 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.650
 however, before use, of course 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.270
 I wanted to make you understand I don't know how to make you 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:12.460
 understand the softness are wonderful then 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.130
 this one that I miss I never had 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.699
 a brush so chubby rollers for 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:22.509
 always to put the liquid foundation 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:27.870
 I have to try this too 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:30.550
 super soft and finally amazing this 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:37.300
 I always think of something kobe 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:40.870
 lush is not very wide or there 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:44.169
 these are a smaller mark is 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.419
 so much in a few long and this a little more 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.800
 indecipherable functions sincerely 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:53.080
 I don't know this I think it's for 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.849
 corrector help help me write me a 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.199
 comment if you know what they are for 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:07:00.870
 I think it's mostly the concealer 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:08.979
 all to the eye sockets 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:09.909
 ditto this help I already knew I was 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:12.969
 I would be found in this situation 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:15.870
 because he wanted to take them but not 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:18.550
 he knew what they were for otherwise this one 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.880
 something then contouring something 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.880
 such 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.050
 so i think they are all davis o 

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:29.080
 probably can also be used for 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:33.380
 the eyes, however, are somewhat brandi 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:39.590
 this very soft and then you buy 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:44.270
 similar to the first a little smaller than the 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:47.960
 first I will find a function for everyone 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.820
 in short, these are definitely girls 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.920
 was very impressed this month because 

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.230
 you really know that I am objective 

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.540
 on things at least if you trust me 

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:59.570
 this month everything is very much found 

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.250
 very nice super satisfied so there 

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.020
 leave link if you want to go and give 

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.840
 look, therefore, are things you find 

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.770
 also on other sites 

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.770
 probably even at lower prices 

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.250
 and I hope nothing has been useful to you 

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.960
 help me with the brushes I recommend 

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.960
