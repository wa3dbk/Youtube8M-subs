I'm just not satisfied with the sound
Vance<00:00:27.880> and<00:00:28.119> Hines<00:00:28.239> pipes<00:00:28.750> for<00:00:29.050> this<00:00:29.230> or<00:00:29.559> about

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
Vance and Hines pipes for this or about

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.729 
Vance and Hines pipes for this or about
500<00:00:30.550> bucks

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
500 bucks

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.370 
500 bucks
there<00:00:32.739> are<00:00:32.890> various<00:00:33.520> slip-on<00:00:34.000> mufflers<00:00:34.540> with

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
there are various slip-on mufflers with

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.270 
there are various slip-on mufflers with
extremely<00:00:35.920> difficult<00:00:36.130> find<00:00:36.880> and<00:00:38.070> really<00:00:39.070> I

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
extremely difficult find and really I

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.940 
extremely difficult find and really I
don't<00:00:39.880> think<00:00:40.240> there's<00:00:40.450> any<00:00:40.660> set<00:00:41.620> of<00:00:41.650> pipes

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
don't think there's any set of pipes

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.990 
don't think there's any set of pipes
that<00:00:42.250> look<00:00:42.460> quite<00:00:42.700> as<00:00:42.850> good<00:00:42.910> as<00:00:43.270> the<00:00:43.750> stock

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
that look quite as good as the stock

that look quite as good as the stock
dual<00:00:46.000> exhaust<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:49.090> this<00:00:49.930> bike<00:00:50.170> so<00:00:50.560> what<00:00:51.220> I

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
dual exhaust on this bike so what I

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.450 
dual exhaust on this bike so what I
decided<00:00:51.610> to<00:00:51.790> do<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:54.430> little<00:00:54.790> modification

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
decided to do is a little modification

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.440 
decided to do is a little modification
to<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.579> end<00:00:57.730> of<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.910> exhaust<00:01:00.060> give<00:01:01.060> this<00:01:01.180> bike

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
to the end of the exhaust give this bike

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.960 
to the end of the exhaust give this bike
a<00:01:01.480> little<00:01:01.810> better<00:01:01.960> sound<00:01:02.430> will<00:01:03.430> be<00:01:03.520> taken<00:01:03.880> out

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
a little better sound will be taken out

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.890 
a little better sound will be taken out
that<00:01:04.869> right<00:01:05.170> there<00:01:05.470> which<00:01:05.680> is<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:05.890> resonator<00:01:06.520> I

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that right there which is a resonator I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.290 
that right there which is a resonator I
guess<00:01:07.900> that's<00:01:08.350> what<00:01:08.500> they<00:01:08.620> call<00:01:08.830> it<00:01:09.300> not

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
guess that's what they call it not

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.790 
guess that's what they call it not
exactly<00:01:10.630> sure<00:01:10.870> what<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.140> does<00:01:11.170> but<00:01:11.590> it's<00:01:11.710> true

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
exactly sure what it does but it's true

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.130 
exactly sure what it does but it's true
doesn't<00:01:12.070> resonate<00:01:12.220> very<00:01:12.490> much<00:01:12.970> it's<00:01:13.870> a<00:01:13.900> bit<00:01:14.050> of

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
doesn't resonate very much it's a bit of

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.540 
doesn't resonate very much it's a bit of
a<00:01:14.200> silencer<00:01:14.710> but<00:01:14.740> first<00:01:15.070> we're<00:01:15.310> going<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.460> have

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
a silencer but first we're going to have

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.300 
a silencer but first we're going to have
to<00:01:15.700> get<00:01:15.820> those<00:01:15.970> bags<00:01:16.210> off<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.860> order<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.159> get

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
to get those bags off in order to get

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.300 
to get those bags off in order to get
this<00:01:18.490> tip<00:01:18.790> off<00:01:19.260> to<00:01:20.260> cut<00:01:20.470> that<00:01:20.590> resonator<00:01:21.100> so

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
this tip off to cut that resonator so

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.010 
this tip off to cut that resonator so
let's<00:01:21.490> go<00:01:21.610> ahead<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:21.880> start<00:01:22.060> that

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.810 

so<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.140> can<00:01:26.290> see<00:01:26.470> with<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.650> bag<00:01:26.799> off<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.490> the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
so you can see with the bag off and the

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.120 
so you can see with the bag off and the
heat<00:01:28.000> shield<00:01:28.030> underneath<00:01:28.770> that's<00:01:29.770> going<00:01:30.070> to

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
heat shield underneath that's going to

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.499 
heat shield underneath that's going to
give<00:01:30.250> us<00:01:30.369> access<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.939> these<00:01:32.790> three<00:01:33.790> screws<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
give us access to these three screws to

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.310 
give us access to these three screws to
get<00:01:37.630> this<00:01:37.780> chrome<00:01:38.049> exhaust<00:01:38.229> tip<00:01:38.770> off<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:40.320> to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
get this chrome exhaust tip off but to

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.310 
get this chrome exhaust tip off but to
actually<00:01:41.470> start<00:01:41.950> sawing<00:01:42.250> it<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.610> may<00:01:42.850> need<00:01:43.320> undo

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
actually start sawing it I may need undo

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.889 
actually start sawing it I may need undo
these<00:01:44.500> bolts<00:01:45.039> and<00:01:45.220> get<00:01:45.909> this<00:01:46.060> crossbar<00:01:46.690> the

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
these bolts and get this crossbar the

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.130 
these bolts and get this crossbar the
supports<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.640> other<00:01:48.789> bag<00:01:49.060> rack<00:01:49.360> off<00:01:49.690> we'll

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
supports the other bag rack off we'll

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.719 
supports the other bag rack off we'll
see<00:01:50.409> as<00:01:50.560> we<00:01:50.590> go<00:01:50.830> along<00:01:50.860> but<00:01:51.130> let's<00:01:51.430> get<00:01:51.610> that

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
see as we go along but let's get that

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.219 
see as we go along but let's get that
exhaust<00:01:52.149> tip<00:01:52.390> off<00:01:52.570> so<00:01:52.780> we<00:01:52.899> know<00:01:53.020> what<00:01:53.110> we're

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
exhaust tip off so we know what we're

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.539 
exhaust tip off so we know what we're
looking<00:01:53.500> at<00:01:53.590> in<00:01:53.740> here<00:01:53.890> with<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.130> resonator

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
looking at in here with the resonator

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.680 
looking at in here with the resonator
first<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:57.009> after<00:01:57.369> a<00:01:57.399> couple<00:01:57.940> very<00:01:58.179> stubborn

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
first so after a couple very stubborn

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.950 
first so after a couple very stubborn
screws<00:01:59.819> that<00:02:00.819> the<00:02:00.970> Ellen<00:02:01.240> head<00:02:01.420> stripped<00:02:01.780> out

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
screws that the Ellen head stripped out

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.719 
screws that the Ellen head stripped out
of<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.350> I<00:02:02.409> had<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.710> use<00:02:02.800> an<00:02:02.950> easy-out<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.610> get

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
of and I had to use an easy-out to get

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.210 
of and I had to use an easy-out to get
them<00:02:03.850> out<00:02:03.970> this<00:02:04.270> is<00:02:04.420> what<00:02:04.509> we're<00:02:04.630> looking<00:02:04.659> at

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
them out this is what we're looking at

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.889 
them out this is what we're looking at
once<00:02:06.220> we<00:02:06.369> get<00:02:06.460> this<00:02:06.640> chrome<00:02:06.970> exhaust<00:02:07.119> tip<00:02:07.659> off

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
once we get this chrome exhaust tip off

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.740 
once we get this chrome exhaust tip off
here<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.920> resonator<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:13.690> I'm

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
here this is the resonator and what I'm

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.509 
here this is the resonator and what I'm
going<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.930> do<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:14.260> use<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> hacksaw<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:15.010> cut<00:02:15.220> in

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
going to do is use a hacksaw to cut in

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.479 
going to do is use a hacksaw to cut in
front<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.880> these<00:02:16.030> bolt<00:02:16.390> holes<00:02:17.040> straight<00:02:18.040> down

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
front of these bolt holes straight down

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.380 
front of these bolt holes straight down
and<00:02:18.930> just<00:02:19.930> cut<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.350> right<00:02:20.560> off<00:02:20.769> leaving<00:02:21.069> one

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
and just cut this right off leaving one

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:33.710 
and just cut this right off leaving one
big<00:02:22.390> pipe<00:02:23.430> -<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.549> resonator

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:46.740 

and<00:02:34.720> there<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:34.989> is<00:02:35.400> one<00:02:36.400> resonator<00:02:45.750> much

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
and there it is one resonator much

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.100 
and there it is one resonator much
throat<00:02:47.140> here<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:48.269> have<00:02:49.269> done<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.660> other<00:02:49.690> pipe

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
throat here I have done the other pipe

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.699
