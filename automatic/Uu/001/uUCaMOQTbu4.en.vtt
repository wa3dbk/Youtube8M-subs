00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.910 

let's<00:01:01.350> choose<00:01:01.680> sherbert<00:01:02.460> towers<00:01:02.879> shall<00:01:03.120> we

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.679 

okay<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> best<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:11.689> think

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
okay so the best way to do this I think

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.920 
okay so the best way to do this I think
it's<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.409> drop<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> couple<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.040> spells<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.930> then

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it's to drop a couple of spells and then

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.249 
it's to drop a couple of spells and then
hammer<00:01:16.350> them<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:17.130> our<00:01:17.310> wall<00:01:17.820> breakers

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
hammer them with with our wall breakers

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.219 
hammer them with with our wall breakers
okay<00:01:19.259> here<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.560> go

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
okay here we go

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.180 
okay here we go
there<00:01:23.330> they're<00:01:25.549> gonna<00:01:26.549> go

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
there they're gonna go

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:45.910 
there they're gonna go
mad<00:01:29.190> with<00:01:29.580> these<00:01:29.790> wall<00:01:30.060> breakers<00:01:30.540> here<00:01:37.130> there

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.980 

so<00:01:46.920> by<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.400> way<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:49.160> 500,000<00:01:50.160> Alexia
