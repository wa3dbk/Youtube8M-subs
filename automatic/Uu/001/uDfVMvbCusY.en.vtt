natural and scientific phenomenon you
might<00:00:34.840> think<00:00:35.110> art<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:35.920> science<00:00:36.790> what<00:00:37.510> do<00:00:37.660> they

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
might think art and science what do they

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.130 
might think art and science what do they
have<00:00:38.020> to<00:00:38.200> do<00:00:38.320> with<00:00:38.500> each<00:00:38.680> other<00:00:38.829> but<00:00:39.220> to<00:00:40.090> me<00:00:40.450> art

have to do with each other but to me art
and<00:00:41.590> science<00:00:42.400> are<00:00:42.640> very<00:00:43.090> similar<00:00:43.450> in<00:00:43.870> that

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
and science are very similar in that

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.040 
and science are very similar in that
they're<00:00:44.739> both<00:00:44.890> extremely<00:00:45.670> creative<00:00:46.270> fields

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
they're both extremely creative fields

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.740 
they're both extremely creative fields
that<00:00:47.560> explore<00:00:48.070> new<00:00:48.400> ideas<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:49.390> break

boundaries<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.940> my<00:00:52.210> university<00:00:52.930> lab<00:00:53.140> I

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
boundaries in my university lab I

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.430 
boundaries in my university lab I
studied<00:00:53.890> biology<00:00:54.310> and<00:00:54.970> chemistry<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:56.140> I<00:00:56.260> was

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
studied biology and chemistry and I was

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.710 
studied biology and chemistry and I was
fascinated<00:00:56.800> by<00:00:57.280> all<00:00:57.700> the<00:00:58.000> scientific

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
fascinated by all the scientific

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.710 
fascinated by all the scientific
principles<00:00:59.500> and<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.100> beautiful<00:01:00.700> forms<00:01:01.420> and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
principles and the beautiful forms and

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.910 
principles and the beautiful forms and
shapes<00:01:01.990> of<00:01:02.320> nature<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:03.640> thought<00:01:04.269> wow<00:01:05.140> how

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
shapes of nature and thought wow how

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.510 
shapes of nature and thought wow how
cool<00:01:06.280> would<00:01:06.549> it<00:01:06.610> be<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:07.240> use<00:01:07.840> all<00:01:08.140> of<00:01:08.590> this<00:01:08.799> to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
cool would it be to use all of this to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.800 
cool would it be to use all of this to
create<00:01:09.549> art<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:12.070> timeless<00:01:12.670> laws<00:01:12.970> of<00:01:13.330> nature

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
create art the timeless laws of nature

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.340 
create art the timeless laws of nature
that<00:01:14.549> existed<00:01:15.549> and<00:01:15.759> that<00:01:15.820> will<00:01:16.509> continue<00:01:17.110> to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
that existed and that will continue to

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.800 
that existed and that will continue to
exist<00:01:17.860> before<00:01:18.189> and<00:01:18.880> after<00:01:19.479> our<00:01:19.749> time<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.570> many

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
exist before and after our time but many

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.840 
exist before and after our time but many
of<00:01:22.990> these<00:01:23.170> scientific<00:01:23.829> principles<00:01:24.609> and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
of these scientific principles and

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.989 
of these scientific principles and
natural<00:01:25.270> phenomenon<00:01:25.840> cannot<00:01:26.350> be<00:01:26.560> seen<00:01:26.859> so<00:01:27.820> the

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:27.999 
natural phenomenon cannot be seen so the

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:32.300 
natural phenomenon cannot be seen so the
key<00:01:28.270> is<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:29.049> visualize<00:01:29.649> the<00:01:30.070> invisible<00:01:31.200> by

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
key is to visualize the invisible by

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.249 
key is to visualize the invisible by
visualization<00:01:33.310> we<00:01:33.939> can<00:01:34.119> experience<00:01:34.929> all<00:01:35.200> of

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
visualization we can experience all of

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.919 
visualization we can experience all of
these<00:01:35.920> beautiful<00:01:36.520> things<00:01:36.549> as<00:01:37.289> art<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:40.299> today<00:01:40.659> I

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
these beautiful things as art so today I

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.739 
these beautiful things as art so today I
brought<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.560> couple<00:01:41.859> of<00:01:42.069> parts<00:01:42.549> that<00:01:42.759> I<00:01:43.060> use<00:01:43.390> for

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:43.749 
brought a couple of parts that I use for

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.349 
brought a couple of parts that I use for
my<00:01:43.869> installations<00:01:44.649> they're<00:01:45.639> produced<00:01:46.090> in

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
my installations they're produced in

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.779 
my installations they're produced in
large<00:01:46.659> volumes<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.649> create<00:01:48.039> large-scale

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
large volumes to create large-scale

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.029 
large volumes to create large-scale
installations<00:01:49.659> depending<00:01:50.289> on<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.499> size<00:01:50.710> of

installations depending on the size of
the<00:01:51.189> exhibition<00:01:51.729> hall<00:01:52.859> so<00:01:53.859> let's<00:01:54.130> take<00:01:54.429> a<00:01:54.460> look

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
the exhibition hall so let's take a look

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.529 
the exhibition hall so let's take a look
at<00:01:54.969> this<00:01:55.359> one<00:01:55.600> this<00:01:56.530> one<00:01:56.829> is<00:01:57.100> called<00:01:57.700> defying

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
at this one this one is called defying

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.550 
at this one this one is called defying
gravity<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.939> is<00:02:01.149> a<00:02:01.179> chandelier<00:02:01.840> of<00:02:02.139> test

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
gravity this is a chandelier of test

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.249 
gravity this is a chandelier of test
tubes<00:02:02.889> hanging<00:02:03.729> upside<00:02:04.329> down<00:02:04.359> with<00:02:04.899> water

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
tubes hanging upside down with water

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.300 
tubes hanging upside down with water
inside<00:02:05.889> without<00:02:06.429> a<00:02:06.459> lid<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:08.380> water<00:02:08.649> stays<00:02:09.280> in

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
inside without a lid the water stays in

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.120 
inside without a lid the water stays in
place<00:02:10.030> without<00:02:10.420> pouring<00:02:10.990> with<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.650> help<00:02:11.890> of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
place without pouring with the help of

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.520 
place without pouring with the help of
surface<00:02:12.760> tension<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.540> atmospheric<00:02:14.500> pressure

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
surface tension and atmospheric pressure

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.380 
surface tension and atmospheric pressure
of<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.400> air<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.990> let's<00:02:17.230> try<00:02:17.560> with<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:18.610> test

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
of the air so let's try with this test

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.750 
of the air so let's try with this test
tube

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.559 

you<00:02:24.760> first<00:02:25.120> put<00:02:25.599> water<00:02:25.959> inside<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.920> today<00:02:27.609> I

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
you first put water inside so today I

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.949 
you first put water inside so today I
put<00:02:29.349> a<00:02:29.530> little<00:02:29.799> bit<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.159> ink<00:02:30.489> in<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:31.120> water<00:02:31.359> so

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
put a little bit of ink in the water so

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.899 
put a little bit of ink in the water so
that<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.379> can<00:02:32.590> see<00:02:32.890> from<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.430> distance<00:02:35.909> you

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
that you can see from the distance you

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:43.490 
that you can see from the distance you
put<00:02:37.150> water<00:02:37.450> inside<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.849> then<00:02:39.849> you<00:02:40.599> flip<00:02:41.019> it

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.490 

and<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.840> water<00:02:47.049> stays<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.829> place<00:02:48.219> and<00:02:49.500> once

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
and the water stays in place and once

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.539 
and the water stays in place and once
it's<00:02:50.739> balanced<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.900> stays<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:53.109> place<00:02:53.379> until<00:02:53.829> it

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
it's balanced it stays in place until it

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:02.099 
it's balanced it stays in place until it
evaporates<00:02:54.939> and<00:02:55.689> becomes<00:02:56.230> empty<00:02:58.319> and<00:03:00.659> in<00:03:01.659> the

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
evaporates and becomes empty and in the

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.559 
evaporates and becomes empty and in the
exhibition<00:03:02.680> halls<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.310> usually<00:03:03.879> hang<00:03:04.209> them<00:03:04.419> up

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
exhibition halls I usually hang them up

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.289 
exhibition halls I usually hang them up
in<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.870> ceiling<00:03:05.139> and<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:06.220> can<00:03:06.430> actually<00:03:07.030> look

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
in the ceiling and you can actually look

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.349 
in the ceiling and you can actually look
up<00:03:07.540> into<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.319> surface<00:03:08.919> of<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.159> water<00:03:09.549> which

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
up into the surface of the water which

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.720 
up into the surface of the water which
is<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.569> very<00:03:11.019> interesting<00:03:11.590> view<00:03:12.099> that<00:03:12.519> you

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
is a very interesting view that you

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.500 
is a very interesting view that you
don't<00:03:12.909> get<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.209> see<00:03:13.389> every<00:03:13.659> day<00:03:14.969> so<00:03:15.969> the<00:03:16.150> second

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
don't get to see every day so the second

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.990 
don't get to see every day so the second
one<00:03:16.629> in<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.139> middle<00:03:17.439> is<00:03:17.680> called<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.730> soap

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
one in the middle is called the soap

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.020 
one in the middle is called the soap
bubble<00:03:19.569> geometry<00:03:20.519> when<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.609> think<00:03:21.879> of

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
bubble geometry when you think of

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.589 
bubble geometry when you think of
bubbles<00:03:22.569> you<00:03:23.200> think<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.889> sphere<00:03:24.579> and<00:03:24.819> the

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
bubbles you think of a sphere and the

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.930 
bubbles you think of a sphere and the
reason<00:03:26.049> why<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.799> becomes<00:03:27.129> a<00:03:27.310> sphere<00:03:27.459> is

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
reason why it becomes a sphere is

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.319 
reason why it becomes a sphere is
because<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:29.250> because<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.760> smallest

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
because of because it is the smallest

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.149 
because of because it is the smallest
surface<00:03:32.169> area<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:34.540> what<00:03:34.810> would<00:03:35.049> happen<00:03:35.319> if<00:03:35.829> we

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
surface area but what would happen if we

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:41.509 
surface area but what would happen if we
use<00:03:36.400> geometric<00:03:37.389> shapes<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:38.379> create<00:03:38.669> bubbles

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
use geometric shapes to create bubbles

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.740 
use geometric shapes to create bubbles
so<00:03:42.519> let's<00:03:43.109> try<00:03:44.109> with<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:44.949> shape<00:03:45.669> this<00:03:46.269> one<00:03:46.540> is

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
so let's try with this shape this one is

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.929 
so let's try with this shape this one is
a<00:03:47.189> tetrahedron<00:03:49.409> you<00:03:50.409> dip<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:50.889> in<00:03:51.189> the<00:03:51.609> soap

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
a tetrahedron you dip this in the soap

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:58.140 
a tetrahedron you dip this in the soap
water<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:55.169> you<00:03:56.169> get<00:03:56.379> sharp<00:03:57.189> triangles

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
water and you get sharp triangles

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.689 
water and you get sharp triangles
towards<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.049> center<00:04:00.150> which<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.299> very<00:04:01.689> pretty

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
towards the center which is very pretty

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.420 
towards the center which is very pretty
with<00:04:03.699> the<00:04:03.849> sunlight<00:04:04.299> you<00:04:04.629> can<00:04:05.620> see<00:04:05.889> the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
with the sunlight you can see the

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.059 
with the sunlight you can see the
rainbow<00:04:06.849> colors<00:04:07.329> and<00:04:08.549> then<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:11.290> pop<00:04:11.590> a<00:04:11.799> little

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
rainbow colors and then you pop a little

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:19.069 
rainbow colors and then you pop a little
bit<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.430> air<00:04:12.699> inside

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.309 

and<00:04:19.759> you<00:04:20.759> get<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.150> miniature<00:04:21.810> tetrahedron

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:24.319 
and you get a miniature tetrahedron

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:30.379 
and you get a miniature tetrahedron
inside<00:04:26.569> and<00:04:27.860> this<00:04:28.860> one's<00:04:29.129> also<00:04:29.520> very<00:04:30.030> pretty

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
inside and this one's also very pretty

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.490 
inside and this one's also very pretty
with<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.990> natural<00:04:31.409> sunlight<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:33.169> it<00:04:34.169> stays

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
with the natural sunlight and it stays

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.270 
with the natural sunlight and it stays
in<00:04:34.530> place<00:04:34.800> for<00:04:35.460> quite<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.789> long<00:04:36.030> time<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:37.280> this

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
in place for quite a long time and this

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.899 
in place for quite a long time and this
is<00:04:38.460> actually<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:40.080> smallest<00:04:40.280> surface<00:04:41.280> area

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
is actually the smallest surface area

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:48.770 
is actually the smallest surface area
with<00:04:42.509> this<00:04:42.960> shape<00:04:44.750> so<00:04:47.360> depending<00:04:48.360> on<00:04:48.479> the

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
with this shape so depending on the

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.140 
with this shape so depending on the
shape<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:50.780> geometry<00:04:51.780> of<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:52.229> frames<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:53.150> can

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
shape of geometry of the frames you can

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.790 
shape of geometry of the frames you can
make<00:04:54.479> all<00:04:54.750> sorts<00:04:55.440> of<00:04:55.590> geometric<00:04:56.520> bubbles<00:04:57.180> and

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
make all sorts of geometric bubbles and

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.740 
make all sorts of geometric bubbles and
the<00:04:58.800> possibilities<00:04:59.639> are<00:04:59.940> infinite<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:02.750> I'm

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
the possibilities are infinite and I'm

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.010 
the possibilities are infinite and I'm
always<00:05:04.110> fascinated<00:05:04.409> by<00:05:05.069> how<00:05:05.400> nature<00:05:06.020> manages

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
always fascinated by how nature manages

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.200 
always fascinated by how nature manages
to<00:05:07.319> create<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.889> most<00:05:08.069> accurate<00:05:08.370> and

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
to create the most accurate and

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.779 
to create the most accurate and
beautiful<00:05:09.509> shapes<00:05:10.080> instantly<00:05:11.039> without<00:05:11.400> any

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
beautiful shapes instantly without any

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:18.649 
beautiful shapes instantly without any
calculation<00:05:16.069> so<00:05:17.069> this<00:05:17.310> one<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:18.000> last<00:05:18.210> one<00:05:18.449> is

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
calculation so this one the last one is

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:22.459 
calculation so this one the last one is
called<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.110> aqua<00:05:19.650> sonic<00:05:20.099> remix<00:05:21.110> this<00:05:22.110> is<00:05:22.319> an

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:22.469 
called the aqua sonic remix this is an

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:25.129 
called the aqua sonic remix this is an
audio<00:05:22.949> installation<00:05:23.909> that<00:05:24.270> actually

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
audio installation that actually

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.559 
audio installation that actually
converts<00:05:25.529> sound<00:05:26.370> waves<00:05:26.819> to<00:05:27.479> water<00:05:28.229> waves

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569 
converts sound waves to water waves

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.680 
converts sound waves to water waves
let's<00:05:30.569> think<00:05:30.870> about<00:05:31.279> what<00:05:32.279> is<00:05:32.639> sound

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
let's think about what is sound

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.089 
let's think about what is sound
what<00:05:34.080> is<00:05:34.199> sound<00:05:34.789> sound<00:05:35.789> is<00:05:36.529> vibration<00:05:37.529> of<00:05:37.770> air

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
what is sound sound is vibration of air

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.269 
what is sound sound is vibration of air
the<00:05:38.969> voice<00:05:39.270> that<00:05:40.050> I'm<00:05:40.169> speaking<00:05:40.409> right<00:05:40.740> now<00:05:40.770> is

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279 
the voice that I'm speaking right now is

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.700 
the voice that I'm speaking right now is
actually<00:05:41.669> creating<00:05:42.360> vibration<00:05:42.990> of<00:05:43.139> air<00:05:43.409> right

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
actually creating vibration of air right

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.219 
actually creating vibration of air right
now<00:05:43.740> and<00:05:44.250> it<00:05:45.150> eventually<00:05:45.360> reaches<00:05:46.080> the

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
now and it eventually reaches the

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.100 
now and it eventually reaches the
eardrums<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.130> that<00:05:47.849> sends<00:05:48.330> a<00:05:48.389> signal<00:05:48.569> to<00:05:48.810> the

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
eardrums and that sends a signal to the

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.510 
eardrums and that sends a signal to the
brain<00:05:49.259> that<00:05:50.009> there's<00:05:50.219> sound<00:05:52.039> but<00:05:53.039> we<00:05:53.219> can't

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
brain that there's sound but we can't

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.930 
brain that there's sound but we can't
see<00:05:53.940> air<00:05:54.330> or<00:05:54.719> its<00:05:55.169> vibration<00:05:55.409> but<00:05:56.370> we<00:05:56.550> can<00:05:56.729> see

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
see air or its vibration but we can see

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.730 
see air or its vibration but we can see
water<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:58.710> when<00:05:59.190> we<00:05:59.310> apply<00:05:59.460> sound<00:06:00.120> to<00:06:00.930> water<00:06:01.169> it

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
water so when we apply sound to water it

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:09.059 
water so when we apply sound to water it
creates<00:06:02.550> beautiful<00:06:03.240> waves

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:09.069 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:14.170 

can<00:06:09.639> you<00:06:09.759> see<00:06:09.999> the<00:06:10.300> waves

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.020 

and<00:06:14.270> then<00:06:14.930> the<00:06:15.139> water<00:06:15.380> sometimes<00:06:16.340> jumps<00:06:16.850> up

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
and then the water sometimes jumps up

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.879 
and then the water sometimes jumps up
and<00:06:17.680> the<00:06:18.680> waves<00:06:18.949> change<00:06:19.550> shape<00:06:20.120> as<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:21.500> sound

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
and the waves change shape as the sound

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:33.230 
and the waves change shape as the sound
and<00:06:22.310> the<00:06:22.490> frequency<00:06:23.090> changes

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.570 

with<00:06:34.240> the<00:06:34.539> higher<00:06:35.259> pitch<00:06:35.619> sound<00:06:35.979> you<00:06:36.249> can<00:06:36.430> see

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
with the higher pitch sound you can see

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:44.719 
with the higher pitch sound you can see
really<00:06:36.939> small<00:06:37.569> waves<00:06:37.990> that<00:06:38.830> look<00:06:39.129> like<00:06:39.339> a<00:06:39.400> star
