hey welcome to flitetest I'm Josh mark

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.299 
hey welcome to flitetest I'm Josh mark
I'm<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.309> Peter<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.240> we<00:00:10.050> are<00:00:10.139> here<00:00:10.380> at<00:00:10.559> Joe<00:00:11.070> Nall

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
I'm so Peter and we are here at Joe Nall

I'm so Peter and we are here at Joe Nall
triple<00:00:11.700> tree<00:00:11.910> 2015<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.559> are<00:00:13.590> seeing<00:00:13.950> in

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
triple tree 2015 and we are seeing in

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:39.310 
triple tree 2015 and we are seeing in
front<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:15.000> 20-foot

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.139 

this<00:00:39.770> project<00:00:40.160> has<00:00:40.250> been<00:00:40.309> going<00:00:40.430> on<00:00:40.790> for<00:00:41.030> eight

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
this project has been going on for eight

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.350 
this project has been going on for eight
years

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.890 

we<00:00:43.690> only<00:00:43.810> work<00:00:44.050> on<00:00:44.260> it<00:00:44.380> during<00:00:44.590> the<00:00:44.710> event<00:00:45.160> and

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
we only work on it during the event and

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.120 
we only work on it during the event and
everybody<00:00:46.900> comes<00:00:47.110> out<00:00:47.320> to<00:00:47.440> be<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.560> part<00:00:47.830> of<00:00:47.950> it

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
everybody comes out to be a part of it

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.800 
everybody comes out to be a part of it
puts<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.460> part<00:00:48.700> in<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:49.060> actually<00:00:49.180> signs<00:00:49.570> their

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
puts a part in and actually signs their

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.680 
puts a part in and actually signs their
name<00:00:49.840> on<00:00:50.170> their<00:00:50.290> part<00:00:50.530> I<00:00:54.330> think<00:00:55.330> one<00:00:55.510> of<00:00:55.540> the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
name on their part I think one of the

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.440 
name on their part I think one of the
wheels<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.980> wheels<00:00:57.010> we're<00:00:57.820> something<00:00:58.239> we

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
wheels the wheels we're something we

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.119 
wheels the wheels we're something we
needed<00:00:58.660> we<00:00:58.840> needed<00:00:59.020> 15<00:00:59.470> pounds<00:00:59.860> of<00:00:59.920> nose

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
needed we needed 15 pounds of nose

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.650 
needed we needed 15 pounds of nose
weight<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:00.730> we<00:01:00.910> figured<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.300> wheels<00:01:01.510> were

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
weight so we figured the wheels were

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.720 
weight so we figured the wheels were
further<00:01:01.840> out<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.320> we've<00:01:02.470> made<00:01:02.620> two<00:01:02.950> six<00:01:03.370> pound

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
further out so we've made two six pound

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.120 
further out so we've made two six pound
steel<00:01:04.089> wheels<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:05.050> put<00:01:05.229> on<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.500> aircraft<00:01:05.950> to

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
steel wheels to put on the aircraft to

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.240 
steel wheels to put on the aircraft to
balance<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.550> plane<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:08.110> you<00:01:08.200> guys<00:01:08.350> had<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.860> cut

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
balance the plane so you guys had to cut

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.700 
balance the plane so you guys had to cut
out<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.490> wheel<00:01:09.640> yeah<00:01:10.479> we<00:01:10.810> got<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.200> wheels<00:01:11.380> off

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
out the wheel yeah we got the wheels off

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.560 
out the wheel yeah we got the wheels off
put<00:01:12.070> them<00:01:12.160> on<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.310> lathe<00:01:12.490> spaced<00:01:13.090> up<00:01:13.360> and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
put them on the lathe spaced up and

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.120 
put them on the lathe spaced up and
drill<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.869> holes<00:01:14.080> in<00:01:14.290> them<00:01:14.410> for<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.650> axles

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
drill the holes in them for the axles

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.560 
drill the holes in them for the axles
and<00:01:15.400> how<00:01:15.550> many<00:01:15.729> men's<00:01:15.940> before<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.390> plate

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
and how many men's before the plate

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.180 
and how many men's before the plate
about<00:01:17.020> 40<00:01:17.380> minutes<00:01:17.619> before<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.950> flight

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
about 40 minutes before the flight

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:36.359 
about 40 minutes before the flight
all<00:01:18.550> right<00:01:18.729> that's<00:01:18.910> like<00:01:19.210> this

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.380 

the<00:01:36.790> four<00:01:37.060> colors

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:54.060 

although

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:03:47.700 

Wow

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.620 

design<00:03:48.710> because<00:03:49.010> of<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.160> engines<00:03:49.460> in<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:50.000> 37

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
design because of the engines in the 37

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.210 
design because of the engines in the 37
and<00:03:50.990> had<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.230> power<00:03:51.380> that<00:03:51.590> we<00:03:51.680> has<00:03:51.830> today<00:03:52.070> now

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
and had the power that we has today now

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.940 
and had the power that we has today now
so<00:03:52.460> the<00:03:52.580> wing<00:03:52.730> had<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.360> high<00:03:53.690> lift<00:03:54.050> that<00:03:54.770> had

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
so the wing had the high lift that had

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.020 
so the wing had the high lift that had
to<00:03:55.040> have<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.190> 10-minute<00:03:55.490> amount<00:03:55.790> of<00:03:55.880> stability

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
to have a 10-minute amount of stability

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.270 
to have a 10-minute amount of stability
because<00:03:56.450> it's<00:03:56.600> marketed<00:03:57.050> as<00:03:57.110> mentioned<00:03:57.560> it's

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
because it's marketed as mentioned it's

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.340 
because it's marketed as mentioned it's
a<00:03:58.490> free<00:03:58.670> flight<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.510> original<00:04:00.140> one<00:04:00.230> was<00:04:00.290> a

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
a free flight the original one was a

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.810 
a free flight the original one was a
free<00:04:00.530> flight<00:04:00.740> with<00:04:00.860> a<00:04:00.890> 10<00:04:01.070> foot<00:04:01.100> span<00:04:01.460> so<00:04:01.640> mark

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
free flight with a 10 foot span so mark

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.640 
free flight with a 10 foot span so mark
went<00:04:01.970> ahead<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.210> double<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.510> size<00:04:02.690> yeah<00:04:03.110> yeah

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
went ahead and double the size yeah yeah

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.410 
went ahead and double the size yeah yeah
now<00:04:04.130> what<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:04.430> they<00:04:04.610> call<00:04:04.760> us<00:04:04.850> what<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:05.090> in<00:04:05.330> the

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
now what so they call us what is in the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.630 
now what so they call us what is in the
pedestal<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:05.900> pile<00:04:06.110> on<00:04:06.260> pile<00:04:06.680> on<00:04:06.890> pile<00:04:07.280> on<00:04:07.490> and

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
pedestal a pile on pile on pile on and

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.490 
pedestal a pile on pile on pile on and
define<00:04:07.940> what<00:04:07.970> that<00:04:08.210> is<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.930> pylon<00:04:09.350> is

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
define what that is the the pylon is

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.170 
define what that is the the pylon is
what<00:04:09.680> mounts<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.100> wing<00:04:10.250> up<00:04:10.460> high<00:04:10.640> and<00:04:10.880> gives

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
what mounts to wing up high and gives

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.610 
what mounts to wing up high and gives
the<00:04:11.360> plane<00:04:11.570> a<00:04:11.600> little<00:04:11.810> bit<00:04:12.080> of<00:04:12.170> a<00:04:12.230> pendulum

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
the plane a little bit of a pendulum

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.800 
the plane a little bit of a pendulum
effect<00:04:12.770> now<00:04:13.490> create<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.940> stability<00:04:14.090> because

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
effect now create the stability because

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.810 
effect now create the stability because
there<00:04:14.990> was<00:04:15.110> no<00:04:15.230> RC<00:04:15.650> control<00:04:16.070> off<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.549> left<00:04:16.760> a

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
there was no RC control off the left a

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.490 
there was no RC control off the left a
lot<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.180> thrust<00:04:17.510> pass<00:04:17.780> over<00:04:18.140> and<00:04:18.260> not<00:04:18.380> get

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
lot of the thrust pass over and not get

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.020 
lot of the thrust pass over and not get
blocked<00:04:18.680> by<00:04:18.830> the<00:04:18.920> piece<00:04:19.100> of<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.310> tree<00:04:19.580> cause

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
blocked by the piece of a tree cause

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.030 
blocked by the piece of a tree cause
somewhat<00:04:20.540> yes<00:04:20.720> I'm<00:04:20.930> like<00:04:21.110> wow<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:21.530> guys<00:04:21.830> have

somewhat yes I'm like wow you guys have
an<00:04:22.160> amazing<00:04:22.220> lifting<00:04:22.850> tail<00:04:23.030> surface<00:04:23.390> back

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
an amazing lifting tail surface back

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.690 
an amazing lifting tail surface back
here<00:04:23.810> too<00:04:24.020> same<00:04:24.530> principle<00:04:25.040> regs<00:04:25.220> build<00:04:25.580> up

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
here too same principle regs build up

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.940 
here too same principle regs build up
rip<00:04:25.910> yeah<00:04:26.330> back<00:04:27.020> then<00:04:27.230> when<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:27.530> was<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.680> free

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950

would<00:04:40.610> run<00:04:40.730> a<00:04:40.760> really<00:04:41.030> app<00:04:41.210> CG<00:04:41.720> with<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.930> lifting

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290
