on so Cubase le 4 QB cell e5 you should

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.839 
on so Cubase le 4 QB cell e5 you should
have<00:00:25.800> no<00:00:25.949> problems<00:00:26.369> falling<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.730> this

for the sake of not having to look at
this<00:00:32.790> screen<00:00:33.059> I'm<00:00:33.390> gonna<00:00:33.570> start<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.469> new

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
this screen I'm gonna start a new

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.799 
this screen I'm gonna start a new
project<00:00:35.090> leave<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> empty<00:00:38.210> when<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.329> says<00:00:39.510> set

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
project leave it empty when it says set

project leave it empty when it says set
project<00:00:40.050> folder<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.860> where<00:00:41.040> your<00:00:41.160> audio

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
project folder this is where your audio

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.209 
project folder this is where your audio
files<00:00:42.390> get<00:00:42.719> recorded<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.770> you're<00:00:44.010> using

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
files get recorded to if you're using

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.819 
files get recorded to if you're using
this<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.670> first<00:00:44.789> time<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:46.379> want<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> make

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
this for the first time you want to make

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.400 
this for the first time you want to make
a<00:00:46.860> you're<00:00:47.460> gonna<00:00:47.579> want<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.879> make<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.450> project

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
a you're gonna want to make a project

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.279 
a you're gonna want to make a project
folder<00:00:50.149> it's<00:00:51.149> easier<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.510> keeping<00:00:51.989> audio

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
folder it's easier for keeping audio

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.380 
folder it's easier for keeping audio
files<00:00:52.590> together<00:00:53.460> don't<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.210> stick

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
files together don't just stick

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
files together don't just stick
everything<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.140> parent<00:00:55.829> file<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.370> gets

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
everything in one parent file it gets

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.650 
everything in one parent file it gets
messy<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.840> we're<00:00:58.079> gonna<00:00:58.199> stick<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.559> there

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
messy so we're gonna stick it there

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.090 
messy so we're gonna stick it there
let's<00:01:00.660> take<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.320> did<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:01.680> mean<00:01:01.890> to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
let's take of this and I did not mean to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.690 
let's take of this and I did not mean to
do<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.989> first<00:01:03.989> thing<00:01:04.080> we're<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.470> do

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
do that first thing we're going to do

already installed your audio drivers and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.810 
already installed your audio drivers and
everything's<00:01:10.439> working<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.430> your

can hear it but what sound flower
actually<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:37.890> tone<00:01:38.189> port<00:01:39.439> it'll<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
actually is is my tone port it'll be the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.740 
actually is is my tone port it'll be the
same<00:01:40.890> thing<00:01:40.920> that'll<00:01:41.460> make<00:01:41.610> sense<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.180> promise

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.680 
however the less it taxes your computer
that<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.170> how<00:02:31.590> much<00:02:31.769> CPU<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.640> have<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:33.090> commit

lower and the latency goes down

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.660 
lower and the latency goes down
dramatically<00:02:40.620> however<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:43.709> will<00:02:43.860> be<00:02:44.280> using<00:02:44.610> a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
lot more CPU power so that's the way

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.650 
lot more CPU power so that's the way
that<00:02:47.430> works<00:02:48.140> in<00:02:49.220> general<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.239> have<00:02:51.390> to

that works in general if you have to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.610 
that works in general if you have to

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
you'll understand what that means

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.180 
you'll understand what that means
alright<00:03:23.970> when<00:03:24.090> you're<00:03:24.209> all<00:03:24.299> done<00:03:24.419> hit<00:03:24.630> OK<00:03:25.190> and

alright when you're all done hit OK and

with<00:03:30.120> your<00:03:30.269> inputs<00:03:30.690> what<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.560> want<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.829> do<00:03:31.950> is

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
with your inputs what you want to do is

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.659 
with your inputs what you want to do is
remove<00:03:35.010> anything<00:03:35.400> that's<00:03:35.609> there<00:03:36.060> now<00:03:37.579> in<00:03:38.579> the

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
remove anything that's there now in the

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.849 
remove anything that's there now in the
case<00:03:38.849> of<00:03:39.060> what<00:03:39.180> I'm<00:03:39.299> using<00:03:39.569> today<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:40.410> just<00:03:40.470> has

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
case of what I'm using today it just has

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.430 
case of what I'm using today it just has
two<00:03:41.099> inputs<00:03:42.060> available<00:03:42.599> that<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.810> know<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.260> so

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
two inputs available that I know of so

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.490 
two inputs available that I know of so
we're<00:03:43.560> going<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.709> create<00:03:43.859> two<00:03:44.220> mono<00:03:44.700> inputs

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
we're going to create two mono inputs

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.569 
we're going to create two mono inputs
and<00:03:47.599> then<00:03:48.599> we're<00:03:48.750> gonna<00:03:48.989> have<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.680> preset<00:03:50.250> and

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
and then we're gonna have a preset and

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.250 
and then we're gonna have a preset and
we'll<00:03:51.030> call<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.329> sound<00:03:51.690> flower<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:54.060> hit<00:03:54.900> OK

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
we'll call this sound flower and hit OK

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.869 
we'll call this sound flower and hit OK
the<00:03:55.620> reason<00:03:55.829> we're<00:03:56.129> going<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.310> make<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.430> preset

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
the reason we're going to make a preset

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.670 
the reason we're going to make a preset
is<00:03:57.030> because<00:03:57.389> if<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.660> ever<00:03:57.840> gets<00:03:58.049> messed<00:03:58.410> up

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
is because if this ever gets messed up

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.940 
is because if this ever gets messed up
you<00:03:59.519> can<00:03:59.609> go<00:03:59.730> back<00:03:59.879> to<00:03:59.910> this<00:04:00.120> window<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.950> just

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
you can go back to this window and just

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.190 
you can go back to this window and just
recall<00:04:02.310> your<00:04:02.459> preset<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.540> will<00:04:03.690> do

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
recall your preset and it will do

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.990 
recall your preset and it will do
everything<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.620> did<00:04:04.799> if<00:04:05.489> you<00:04:05.549> have<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.790> bigger

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
everything you did if you have a bigger

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.140 
everything you did if you have a bigger
audio<00:04:06.629> interface<00:04:07.230> like<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.530> pro<00:04:07.799> fire<00:04:08.150> 26:26

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
audio interface like a pro fire 26:26

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.170 
audio interface like a pro fire 26:26
for<00:04:09.359> example<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.379> would<00:04:10.620> have<00:04:10.889> under<00:04:11.669> this

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
for example you would have under this

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.390 
for example you would have under this
device<00:04:12.419> port<00:04:12.930> you'd<00:04:13.079> have<00:04:13.230> 26<00:04:13.739> options<00:04:14.190> over

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
device port you'd have 26 options over

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.569 
device port you'd have 26 options over
here<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.840> would<00:04:15.959> want<00:04:16.139> to<00:04:16.289> create<00:04:16.560> like<00:04:17.459> I

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
here and you would want to create like I

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.110 
here and you would want to create like I
only<00:04:17.760> created<00:04:18.060> two<00:04:18.799> mono<00:04:19.799> inputs<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:21.000> would

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
only created two mono inputs you would

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.820 
only created two mono inputs you would
want<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.419> create<00:04:21.570> 26

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
want to create 26

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.550 
want to create 26
so<00:04:24.310> a<00:04:24.580> little<00:04:24.879> different<00:04:25.360> there<00:04:25.569> with<00:04:26.439> the

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
so a little different there with the

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.399 
so a little different there with the
outputs<00:04:27.090> most<00:04:28.090> small<00:04:28.389> interfaces<00:04:28.990> just<00:04:29.229> have

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
outputs most small interfaces just have

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.240 
outputs most small interfaces just have
two<00:04:29.620> outputs<00:04:30.280> just<00:04:30.849> a<00:04:30.939> stereo<00:04:31.330> out<00:04:31.509> so<00:04:32.439> you

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
two outputs just a stereo out so you

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.459 
two outputs just a stereo out so you
just<00:04:33.430> go<00:04:33.580> stereo<00:04:34.000> out<00:04:34.180> left<00:04:34.539> stereo<00:04:34.960> out<00:04:35.139> right

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:35.469
