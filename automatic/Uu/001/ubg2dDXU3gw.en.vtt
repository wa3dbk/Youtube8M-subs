 very special competition the atmosphere that is here it's really 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.210
 different from the month I progress in the sport the fact that we are with always 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.369
 the best riders in the world stop progressing and we help each other a little 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.600
 each other and then at home how to qualify what I do in life you 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600

 I had a lot of rotations there is a second what happened 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.540
 not enough of these illegal rallies by axa and from 1960 to sabam 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.210

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.580
 we arrive on the last month and there he sole agents arabic body 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.840

 fun at a time the bad at all 83 'lagoon 50 points to the world jaskol key

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.359
 but it's going to be hard to dislodge him 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.879
 behind there is this boot all the time to house Canadian colleges in 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.139
 English it's a Quebecois road is a lot when you're in the 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.139
 square 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:38.409

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.099
 he arrived 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.649
 for the sick on the second naked man 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:07.039
 the 80 duplicates believe it replaces 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.180
 for that he hurt 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.780
 270 points to 9 278 3 times on their backs 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:20.609
 not bad at all the Canadian strikes all the time for 1 85 to 2 83 points 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.689
 it was with such a score or and the goods on the Quebecois settled at 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.450
 orders for these finals this time alas for the big hunts that the 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.440

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:59.169
 specialty and yet passed them without problem 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.319
 he was coming on the first job not 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.439
 they get there very casual he chose instead the central way 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.499
 even more people this line to scramble a wish this quarter mile 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:14.209
 not unfortunate plated of the turn it happens there also all the contracts that on the 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.930
 second volume that is even bigger 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.150

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.659
 m orma puzzles 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.759
 I went there on my solo fashion 360 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.789
 the senior note to the halal offer was huge on the cardinal was perfect 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.359
 after a double flip at the back at 83 yards from 8 83 points 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.730

 steps from the podium to world hunting the american is still time 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.059
 norman is tomorrow 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:48.059
 the 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:58.669
 we're lucky with a younger and cooler derailleur from 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.550
 circuit here a week is almost equal with johnny like that it gives a 

00:05:02.549 --> 00:05:04.669
 benefit others what 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.570
 your head with the girls of joy because if not why 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.240
 diop no i say that because really you ride yard is still in the process 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.780
 to push the limits then is it the Norwegian school that makes 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.100
 we are used to being a little bit everywhere 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.080
 International 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.330
 but the agreement in tunisia think that the world circuit is evolving 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.289
 according to you then why already a month and all the hostile groups acted there 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.379
 just to have a good time I want to settle people to 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.180
 white for me that's what I like to do iphone sales for me it's 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.750
 that's the important thing it's not the competition is clearly announced at 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.020
 the end 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.349
 however shown 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:42.749
 it's a parka 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:46.949
 the Norwegian mickael vendetta may be the difference there is 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.819
 already reproduced man who is en route but that one 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:52.419
 friendly with many surprises 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.789
 1,270 hours on the first bar not bad at all 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.819
 its shares on the part of the rails that will really hardboard we come directly 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:02.189
 on the big big jump 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.789
 mitchell said he's reserving something special to the public 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.789

 surrendered 2 173 impressive my role it's very very good at the ferry is very 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:23.660
 technical and very fluid afp 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.970
 not at 360 hours sometimes ensures the party is ugly or mac 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.870
 really something impressive is especially his style and his 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.180
 relaxation that made the difference 91 years earns 5 points according to 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.599
 the judges 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:37.620
 the new leader 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.090
 and very far ahead of Canadians if you also see that you have 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.090
 this request would be that 4th for the asse 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.409
 woerth 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.020

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.340
 mickaël bankers on the highest step of the podium followed by seven all the

 time in fact the object in wood and higuain

 we were at the edge of a canal in the fall of 2009 the competition is 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.729
 finish after alpha and you have some truth about the fate of his arrival at 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:15.370
 taza cemetery in seeing the death of his mother diana to this kind of tourism 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.120
