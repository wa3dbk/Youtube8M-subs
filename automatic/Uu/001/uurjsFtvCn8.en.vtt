00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
teaspoon and the bread crumbs so the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:47.290 
teaspoon and the bread crumbs so the
first<00:00:31.830> step<00:00:32.070> we're<00:00:32.279> gonna<00:00:32.430> blend<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.149> room

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.579 

so<00:00:48.589> what<00:00:49.589> is<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.949> texture<00:00:50.609> is<00:00:50.850> about<00:00:51.719> this

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
so what is the texture is about this

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:58.869 
so what is the texture is about this
smooth<00:00:53.179> we're<00:00:54.179> gonna<00:00:54.329> put<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.969> salt<00:00:56.969> sugar
