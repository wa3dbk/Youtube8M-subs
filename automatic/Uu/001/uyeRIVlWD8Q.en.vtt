00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.030
 wired optical gaming mouse 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.629
 the mouse body is made of black plastic 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.660
 with original non-slip coating 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.879
 craquelure as if you see 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.309
 time cracked cover well and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.290
 thanks to this coating, it is not 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 absolute slip in her hand, she probably 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.689
 more pleasant to feel than even a mouse 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.939
 which have soft-touch coverage here on 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.560
 side surfaces 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.900
 arranged in blue 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.570
 line that gives an additional 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.240
 originality that's the design of this case 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.479
 mouse well, again , the backlight is not particularly 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.430
 distracting but not turning off in hand 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.640
 the mouse lies like a poured enclosure shape 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.320
 very convenient and basic two buttons 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.829
 pressed quite gently 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 practically effortless and triggering 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.689

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.640
 rubber wheel is located here 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.009

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.480
 back and forth and court hull form and 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.480
 the design of the mouse is such that it will be comfortable 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.070

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.610
 man is left handed and will be comfortable 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:35.100

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.980
 on any surface it doesnâ€™t matter 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.510
 it's either it's just a computer desk 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.700

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.450

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.640
 absolutely not required in case you 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.320
 you need to assign there some 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.380
 own actions for buttons or 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.760

 for them to have something to write macros yes there 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.540

 multiple profiles for assigning buttons 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.220
 but when you close the program or when 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.360
 connecting the mouse to another computer 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.840
