first few days of October but everything
has<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.560> reason<00:02:22.680> for<00:02:23.580> why<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.030> washi<00:02:24.330> tape<00:02:24.720> is

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
section and I think I'm just going to

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.340 
section and I think I'm just going to
look<00:03:00.209> for<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:01.370> purple<00:03:02.370> color<00:03:02.670> if<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.540> can<00:03:03.750> find<00:03:04.020> it

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
look for a purple color if I can find it

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.220 
look for a purple color if I can find it
but<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.680> also<00:03:04.950> do<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.640> actually<00:03:05.970> might<00:03:06.450> use<00:03:06.630> this

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
but I also do I actually might use this

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.820 
but I also do I actually might use this
tape<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.800> this<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> die-cut<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.990> sort<00:03:10.770> of

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
tape and this is a die-cut of a sort of

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.690 
tape and this is a die-cut of a sort of
like<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.100> banner<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.630> may<00:03:13.070> see<00:03:14.070> if<00:03:14.400> that

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
like a banner and I may see if that

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.490 
like a banner and I may see if that
works<00:03:15.120> across<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.690> top<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:15.930> then<00:03:16.200> put<00:03:16.410> the

too dark to be writing in black or
another<00:04:10.890> color<00:04:11.190> so<00:04:11.630> it's<00:04:12.630> going<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.260> need<00:04:13.470> to

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
another color so it's going to need to

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.759 
another color so it's going to need to
be<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.769> white<00:04:14.250> pen<00:04:14.580> or<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:14.970> silver<00:04:15.690> pen<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.230> that's

be a white pen or a silver pen so that's

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.199
