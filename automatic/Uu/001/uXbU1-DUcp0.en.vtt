other volunteers to make this course way
better<00:00:36.940> than<00:00:37.390> years<00:00:37.690> past<00:00:37.720> for<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.500> reason

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
better than years past for the reason

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.189 
better than years past for the reason
that<00:00:38.860> it's<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.760> great<00:00:40.059> area<00:00:40.329> but<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.869> trails

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
that it's a great area but the trails

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.140 
that it's a great area but the trails
are<00:00:41.379> really<00:00:41.680> tough<00:00:41.920> through<00:00:42.280> and<00:00:42.519> we<00:00:42.820> want<00:00:43.030> to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
are really tough through and we want to

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.670 
are really tough through and we want to
actually<00:00:43.210> make<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.629> trails<00:00:43.839> so<00:00:44.199> they're<00:00:44.379> fast

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
actually make the trails so they're fast

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.369 
actually make the trails so they're fast
and<00:00:44.979> fun<00:00:45.400> and<00:00:45.640> flowy<00:00:46.210> which<00:00:46.960> deed<00:00:47.199> has<00:00:47.350> been

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
and fun and flowy which deed has been

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.810 
and fun and flowy which deed has been
doing<00:00:47.769> so<00:00:47.890> you<00:00:48.070> tell<00:00:48.250> us<00:00:48.339> a<00:00:48.400> little<00:00:48.489> bit<00:00:48.610> about

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
doing so you tell us a little bit about

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.490 
doing so you tell us a little bit about
what<00:00:48.970> you've<00:00:49.089> been<00:00:49.180> doing<00:00:49.449> well<00:00:50.080> most<00:00:50.290> of<00:00:50.379> the

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
what you've been doing well most of the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.079 
what you've been doing well most of the
work<00:00:50.650> we've<00:00:50.830> been<00:00:50.860> doing<00:00:51.100> is<00:00:51.339> on<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.670> B<00:00:51.850> loop

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
work we've been doing is on the B loop

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.820 
work we've been doing is on the B loop
and<00:00:52.420> just<00:00:52.839> getting<00:00:53.080> that<00:00:53.199> into<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.650> right

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
and just getting that into the right

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.700 
and just getting that into the right
condition<00:00:54.339> to<00:00:54.839> satisfy<00:00:55.839> be<00:00:56.019> rider<00:00:56.320> so<00:00:56.589> they

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
condition to satisfy be rider so they

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.320 
condition to satisfy be rider so they
can<00:00:56.830> go<00:00:56.949> around<00:00:57.189> and<00:00:57.400> have<00:00:57.610> a<00:00:57.640> good<00:00:57.939> time<00:00:58.119> while

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
can go around and have a good time while

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.689 
can go around and have a good time while
they're<00:00:58.510> here<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:59.140> loops<00:00:59.350> a<00:00:59.500> bit<00:00:59.650> shorter<00:01:00.129> so

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
they're here the loops a bit shorter so

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.759 
they're here the loops a bit shorter so
they'll<00:01:01.269> be<00:01:01.449> done<00:01:01.629> in<00:01:01.809> about<00:01:01.869> 30<00:01:02.290> minutes<00:01:02.589> for

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
they'll be done in about 30 minutes for

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.649 
they'll be done in about 30 minutes for
the<00:01:02.830> faster<00:01:03.220> people<00:01:03.580> and<00:01:03.879> they'll<00:01:04.360> be<00:01:04.510> doing

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
the faster people and they'll be doing

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.200 
the faster people and they'll be doing
about<00:01:05.560> four<00:01:05.950> or<00:01:05.979> five<00:01:06.100> laps<00:01:06.549> within<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.030> two

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
about four or five laps within the two

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.270 
about four or five laps within the two
hours<00:01:07.600> and<00:01:07.810> then<00:01:07.869> after<00:01:08.680> that<00:01:08.710> they<00:01:08.950> do<00:01:09.100> one

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
hours and then after that they do one

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.910 
hours and then after that they do one
more<00:01:09.520> in<00:01:09.790> their<00:01:10.509> time<00:01:10.720> allotment<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.619> loop

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
more in their time allotment the a loop

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.270 
more in their time allotment the a loop
is<00:01:12.250> as<00:01:12.400> hard<00:01:12.610> as<00:01:13.050> it<00:01:14.050> can<00:01:14.080> be<00:01:14.530> pretty<00:01:14.800> much<00:01:15.010> we

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
is as hard as it can be pretty much we

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.070 
is as hard as it can be pretty much we
took<00:01:15.400> out<00:01:15.580> one<00:01:15.760> section<00:01:16.120> that<00:01:16.270> was<00:01:16.360> extremely

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
took out one section that was extremely

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.770 
took out one section that was extremely
difficult<00:01:17.260> for<00:01:17.710> people<00:01:17.980> to<00:01:18.010> manage<00:01:18.220> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
difficult for people to manage and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.930 
difficult for people to manage and
because<00:01:19.780> too<00:01:19.930> many<00:01:20.050> guys<00:01:20.290> were<00:01:20.500> crying<00:01:20.860> on<00:01:21.760> it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
because too many guys were crying on it

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.840 
because too many guys were crying on it
yeah<00:01:22.510> we<00:01:22.750> had<00:01:22.930> you<00:01:23.470> know<00:01:23.500> who<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:23.980> are<00:01:24.159> up<00:01:24.520> guys

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
yeah we had you know who you are up guys

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.260 
yeah we had you know who you are up guys
turn<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.360> cry<00:01:25.600> babies<00:01:26.460> yeah<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.700> there<00:01:28.150> are<00:01:28.180> a

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
turn to cry babies yeah and there are a

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.430 
turn to cry babies yeah and there are a
few<00:01:28.360> people<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:28.659> were<00:01:28.810> sad<00:01:29.020> we<00:01:29.140> took<00:01:29.290> that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
few people that were sad we took that

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.700 
few people that were sad we took that
part<00:01:29.680> out<00:01:29.800> but<00:01:30.130> they'll<00:01:30.820> do<00:01:30.970> just<00:01:31.030> fine<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
part out but they'll do just fine the

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.530 
part out but they'll do just fine the
it's<00:01:33.190> been<00:01:33.340> shortened<00:01:33.640> by<00:01:33.760> a<00:01:33.790> few<00:01:34.030> kilometers

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
it's been shortened by a few kilometers

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.120 
it's been shortened by a few kilometers
so<00:01:34.750> some<00:01:35.080> of<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.230> top<00:01:35.409> guys<00:01:35.440> will<00:01:35.800> probably<00:01:35.860> do

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
so some of the top guys will probably do

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.880 
so some of the top guys will probably do
six<00:01:36.400> laps<00:01:36.610> within<00:01:37.000> three<00:01:37.270> hours<00:01:37.300> and<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.710> the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
six laps within three hours and so the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.649 
six laps within three hours and so the
spectator<00:01:39.340> area<00:01:39.550> will<00:01:39.820> be<00:01:39.940> amazing<00:01:40.360> you'd<00:01:40.540> be

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
spectator area will be amazing you'd be

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:51.410 
spectator area will be amazing you'd be
able<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.930> see<00:01:41.080> people<00:01:41.380> who<00:01:41.500> live

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.190 

one<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.570> things<00:01:52.690> when<00:01:52.900> we're<00:01:53.050> building

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
one of the things when we're building

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.870 
one of the things when we're building
trail<00:01:53.680> is<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.100> make<00:01:54.250> sure<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.670> corners

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
trail is to make sure that the corners

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.240 
trail is to make sure that the corners
are<00:01:55.210> wide<00:01:55.450> enough<00:01:55.630> for<00:01:56.020> whatever<00:01:56.740> machine<00:01:57.130> it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
are wide enough for whatever machine it

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.830 
are wide enough for whatever machine it
is<00:01:57.370> that<00:01:57.550> you<00:01:57.610> have<00:01:57.790> going<00:01:57.970> through<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:58.600> then

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
is that you have going through and then

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.270 
is that you have going through and then
some<00:01:59.140> because<00:01:59.500> if<00:01:59.620> you<00:01:59.710> think<00:01:59.740> about<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.100> guy

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
some because if you think about a guy

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
this log right here you could get your

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.340 
this log right here you could get your
hand<00:02:16.120> guard<00:02:16.360> on<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.750> if<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:16.960> laid<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.170> over

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
hand guard on that if you laid it over

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.980 
hand guard on that if you laid it over
far<00:02:17.740> enough<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:18.550> other<00:02:18.700> thing<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.570> stuff

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
far enough the other thing is this stuff

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.960 
far enough the other thing is this stuff
that<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.560> can't<00:02:20.800> even<00:02:20.950> see<00:02:21.310> from<00:02:21.550> over<00:02:21.820> there

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
that you can't even see from over there

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.300 
that you can't even see from over there
is<00:02:22.840> right<00:02:23.020> on<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.350> inside<00:02:23.740> and<00:02:23.890> if<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.070> look

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
is right on the inside and if you look

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.560 
is right on the inside and if you look
you<00:02:24.459> can<00:02:24.580> actually<00:02:24.730> see<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.240> people<00:02:25.480> have

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
you can actually see that people have

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.020 
you can actually see that people have
hit<00:02:25.690> their<00:02:25.810> pegs<00:02:26.080> on<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:26.980> one<00:02:27.700> other<00:02:27.790> thing

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
hit their pegs on it so one other thing

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.000 
hit their pegs on it so one other thing
to<00:02:28.150> do<00:02:28.270> is<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.540> take<00:02:28.900> these<00:02:29.110> things<00:02:29.350> out<00:02:29.590> it

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
to do is to take these things out it

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.040 
to do is to take these things out it
makes<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.280> trail<00:02:30.490> fun<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.060> safe<00:02:31.330> that's
