really<00:00:07.180> weary<00:00:07.419> of<00:00:07.569> boilies<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:12.580> this<00:00:13.090> rig<00:00:13.389> will

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
really weary of boilies so this rig will

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.480 
really weary of boilies so this rig will
enable<00:00:13.809> us<00:00:14.080> to<00:00:14.110> use<00:00:14.440> a<00:00:14.679> pellet<00:00:15.040> like<00:00:15.309> this

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490

really small 810 mil pellet as a as a
hook<00:00:19.030> bait<00:00:19.270> clearly<00:00:19.900> you<00:00:19.960> can't<00:00:20.260> reel<00:00:20.590> that

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
hook bait clearly you can't reel that

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.620 
hook bait clearly you can't reel that
because<00:00:21.220> it<00:00:21.340> would<00:00:21.460> just<00:00:21.640> keep<00:00:21.790> crumbling<00:00:22.510> and

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
because it would just keep crumbling and

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.940 
because it would just keep crumbling and
falling<00:00:22.690> apart<00:00:23.110> so<00:00:23.380> I'm<00:00:23.560> going<00:00:23.710> to<00:00:23.770> show<00:00:23.920> you

hooklink

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.210 
hooklink
and<00:01:00.370> just<00:01:00.730> pull<00:01:00.970> it<00:01:01.060> up<00:01:01.239> into<00:01:01.810> this<00:01:02.739> pinch<00:01:03.040> that

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
and just pull it up into this pinch that

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.890 
and just pull it up into this pinch that
I've<00:01:03.340> got<00:01:03.520> between<00:01:03.850> my<00:01:03.970> thumb<00:01:04.149> and<00:01:04.210> forefinger

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
I've got between my thumb and forefinger

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.870 
I've got between my thumb and forefinger
now<00:01:05.800> we're<00:01:05.920> going<00:01:06.010> to<00:01:06.070> take<00:01:06.280> this<00:01:06.430> tag<00:01:06.700> in

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
now we're going to take this tag in

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.000 
now we're going to take this tag in
round<00:01:07.240> three<00:01:07.600> times<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:08.409> create<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.710> Grinner

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
round three times to create a Grinner

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:16.170 
round three times to create a Grinner
searchingly<00:01:09.850> one<00:01:11.670> two<00:01:14.130> three<00:01:15.130> turns<00:01:15.400> now<00:01:16.120> the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
searchingly one two three turns now the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.910 
searchingly one two three turns now the
reason<00:01:16.450> we<00:01:16.540> don't<00:01:16.659> do<00:01:16.840> any<00:01:16.960> more<00:01:17.170> is<00:01:17.350> there's

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
reason we don't do any more is there's

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.399 
reason we don't do any more is there's
no<00:01:18.070> strength<00:01:18.490> in<00:01:18.700> this<00:01:18.850> it's<00:01:19.090> simply<00:01:19.299> so<00:01:20.260> that

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
no strength in this it's simply so that

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.440 
no strength in this it's simply so that
we<00:01:20.500> can<00:01:20.710> lasso<00:01:21.190> our<00:01:21.640> pellet<00:01:22.210> on

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
we can lasso our pellet on

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.120 
we can lasso our pellet on
so<00:01:22.630> I've<00:01:22.720> just<00:01:22.750> pulled<00:01:23.110> that<00:01:23.200> down<00:01:23.500> nice<00:01:24.100> and

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
so I've just pulled that down nice and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.539 
so I've just pulled that down nice and
tight<00:01:24.340> now<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:26.409> I'll<00:01:26.560> leave<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.799> little<00:01:27.159> bit

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
tight now here I'll leave a little bit

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.850 
tight now here I'll leave a little bit
of<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.760> tag<00:01:28.000> end<00:01:28.380> because<00:01:29.380> we're<00:01:29.530> going<00:01:29.650> to<00:01:29.770> be

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
of a tag end because we're going to be

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.830 
of a tag end because we're going to be
able<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.040> open<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:30.610> close<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:31.119> knot<00:01:31.390> up<00:01:31.570> and

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
able to open and close this knot up and

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.680 
able to open and close this knot up and
if<00:01:32.200> we<00:01:32.320> cut<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.740> bit<00:01:32.920> too<00:01:33.100> short<00:01:33.690> then

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
if we cut it a bit too short then

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.480 
if we cut it a bit too short then
sometimes<00:01:35.290> are<00:01:35.470> not<00:01:35.500> can<00:01:35.799> come<00:01:35.979> undone<00:01:36.250> so

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
sometimes are not can come undone so

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.980 
sometimes are not can come undone so
leave<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.909> little<00:01:37.090> tag<00:01:37.330> in<00:01:37.360> probably<00:01:37.780> only<00:01:37.900> a

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
leave a little tag in probably only a

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.940 
leave a little tag in probably only a
couple<00:01:38.229> of<00:01:38.380> mil<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:40.540> can<00:01:40.750> help<00:01:40.930> now<00:01:41.440> you

of<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.250> pellet<00:01:51.549> like<00:01:51.729> so<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.540> you<00:01:52.630> just<00:01:52.810> pull

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
of the pellet like so and you just pull

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.320 
of the pellet like so and you just pull
it<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.439> down<00:01:54.400> and<00:01:54.640> they<00:01:55.540> have<00:01:56.909> nice<00:01:57.909> and<00:01:58.150> neatly

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
it on down and they have nice and neatly

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.719 
it on down and they have nice and neatly
a<00:01:58.720> pellet<00:02:00.420> mounted<00:02:01.420> on<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.720> end<00:02:01.869> so<00:02:02.619> so<00:02:03.280> create

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
a pellet mounted on the end so so create

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.359 
a pellet mounted on the end so so create
a<00:02:03.759> hair<00:02:04.150> if<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.479> like<00:02:04.689> okay<00:02:05.680> that<00:02:05.710> can<00:02:06.220> be

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
a hair if you like okay that can be

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.070 
a hair if you like okay that can be
opened<00:02:06.729> up<00:02:08.159> like<00:02:09.159> so

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
opened up like so

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.290 
opened up like so
and<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:11.040> just<00:02:11.190> change<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.520> bait<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
and you can just change the bait as you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.200 
and you can just change the bait as you
need<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:13.280> put<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> new<00:02:14.490> one<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.970> low<00:02:17.970> beta

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
need to put a new one in so on low beta

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.950 
need to put a new one in so on low beta
needles<00:02:18.890> nothing<00:02:20.000> nice<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.210> simple<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.840> can

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
needles nothing nice and simple you can

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.270 
needles nothing nice and simple you can
see<00:02:22.140> there<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.380> I've<00:02:22.620> rubbed<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.040> round

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
see there that I've rubbed that round

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.590 
see there that I've rubbed that round
the<00:02:23.370> pellet<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.850> couple<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.150> times<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
the pellet a couple of times and the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.540 
the pellet a couple of times and the
oils<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.080> absorbed<00:02:25.590> into<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.950> hooklink<00:02:26.130> and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
oils have absorbed into the hooklink and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.910 
oils have absorbed into the hooklink and
almost<00:02:27.120> disappear<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.440> pretty<00:02:28.680> good

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
almost disappear this is pretty good

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.810 
almost disappear this is pretty good
okay<00:02:29.850> we<00:02:30.480> now<00:02:30.600> need<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.100> add<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> small<00:02:32.460> piece<00:02:32.490> of

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
okay we now need to add a small piece of

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.740 
okay we now need to add a small piece of
silicon<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.390> I'm<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.780> use<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:35.750> make

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
silicon that I'm going to use to make

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.300 
silicon that I'm going to use to make
sure<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.230> hair<00:02:37.440> leaves<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.890> shank<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
sure the hair leaves the shank of the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.250 
sure the hair leaves the shank of the
hook<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> right<00:02:39.270> place<00:02:39.600> now<00:02:40.080> with

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
a supple piece of braid so what I do is

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.950 
a supple piece of braid so what I do is
I<00:02:49.050> cut<00:02:49.950> my<00:02:50.070> silicon<00:02:50.520> piece<00:02:51.210> of<00:02:51.360> silicon<00:02:51.780> like

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
I cut my silicon piece of silicon like

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.290 
I cut my silicon piece of silicon like
so<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.740> I<00:02:52.830> cut<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.070> short<00:02:53.370> length<00:02:53.550> off<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.030> I

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
so and I cut a short length off and I

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.080 
so and I cut a short length off and I
slide<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:55.380> small<00:02:55.800> splicing<00:02:56.790> needle

I've got a nice small size 10 hook and
be<00:03:22.290> really<00:03:22.560> careful<00:03:22.770> here<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.489> make<00:03:24.300> sure<00:03:24.510> that

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
be really careful here to make sure that

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.590 
be really careful here to make sure that
you<00:03:24.840> pull<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.320> braid<00:03:25.590> over<00:03:25.920> your<00:03:26.070> finger<00:03:26.600> so

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
you pull the braid over your finger so

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.020 
you pull the braid over your finger so
that<00:03:27.840> you'll<00:03:28.110> put<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.770> you're<00:03:29.010> exposing<00:03:29.730> as

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
that you'll put so you're exposing as

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.910 
that you'll put so you're exposing as
big<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.270> hole<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:30.989> silicon<00:03:31.410> as<00:03:31.530> possible

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
big a hole in this silicon as possible

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.290 
big a hole in this silicon as possible
because<00:03:32.100> remember<00:03:32.310> when<00:03:32.520> you<00:03:32.550> push<00:03:32.880> this<00:03:33.090> hook

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
because remember when you push this hook

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.060 
because remember when you push this hook
through<00:03:33.630> push<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.320> hook<00:03:34.440> point<00:03:34.709> through<00:03:34.920> you

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
through push the hook point through you

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.680 
through push the hook point through you
don't<00:03:35.220> want<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.520> be<00:03:35.610> catching<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:36.239> braid<00:03:36.480> in

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
don't want to be catching that braid in

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.990 
don't want to be catching that braid in
any<00:03:36.840> way<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:37.770> a<00:03:38.160> little<00:03:38.550> bit<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.790> practice

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
any way so a little bit of practice

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.210 
any way so a little bit of practice
you'll<00:03:39.720> be<00:03:39.870> able<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.110> simply<00:03:40.530> slide<00:03:40.739> your<00:03:41.100> hook

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
you'll be able to simply slide your hook

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.729 
you'll be able to simply slide your hook
point<00:03:41.520> through<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.880> silicon<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:42.540> turn<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.590> on

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
point through the silicon and turn it on

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.280 
point through the silicon and turn it on

roles of the knotless knot and it's

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.830 
roles of the knotless knot and it's
going<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.390> stick<00:05:40.630> out<00:05:40.979> past<00:05:41.979> the<00:05:42.250> eye<00:05:42.539> like<00:05:43.539> so

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
going to stick out past the eye like so

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.390 
going to stick out past the eye like so
we're<00:05:44.320> then<00:05:44.440> going<00:05:44.590> to<00:05:44.680> take<00:05:44.890> that<00:05:45.130> to<00:05:45.370> the

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
we're then going to take that to the

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.190 
we're then going to take that to the
kettle<00:05:46.050> and<00:05:47.050> steam<00:05:47.440> it<00:05:47.650> over<00:05:47.950> there<00:05:48.100> over<00:05:48.760> the

kettle and steam it over there over the
the<00:05:50.200> nozzle<00:05:50.530> of<00:05:50.650> a<00:05:50.740> kettle<00:05:51.130> making<00:05:51.700> sure<00:05:51.910> that

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
the nozzle of a kettle making sure that

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.210 
the nozzle of a kettle making sure that
none<00:05:52.750> of<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:52.960> flames<00:05:53.229> licking<00:05:53.560> up<00:05:53.800> from<00:05:54.070> the

none of the flames licking up from the
stove<00:05:54.490> or<00:05:54.850> so<00:05:55.090> on<00:05:55.240> touch<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:56.200> hook<00:05:56.650> link

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
stove or so on touch the hook link

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.219 
stove or so on touch the hook link
material<00:05:57.220> and<00:05:57.310> can<00:05:57.460> damage<00:05:57.789> it<00:05:57.940> and<00:05:58.229> we're

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
material and can damage it and we're

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.110 
material and can damage it and we're
going<00:05:59.350> to<00:05:59.440> shrink<00:05:59.890> shrink<00:06:00.010> that<00:06:00.490> into<00:06:00.789> a<00:06:00.820> shape

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
going to shrink shrink that into a shape

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.719 
going to shrink shrink that into a shape
like<00:06:01.750> so<00:06:02.050> that<00:06:02.229> that's<00:06:02.770> creating<00:06:03.340> the<00:06:03.460> perfect

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
like so that that's creating the perfect

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.260 
like so that that's creating the perfect
angle<00:06:04.150> for<00:06:04.840> helping<00:06:05.169> turn<00:06:05.440> that<00:06:05.650> hook<00:06:06.270> when

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
angle for helping turn that hook when

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.189 
angle for helping turn that hook when
it's<00:06:07.450> picked<00:06:07.930> up<00:06:08.140> by<00:06:08.350> a<00:06:08.380> fish

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
it's picked up by a fish

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.269 
it's picked up by a fish
okay<00:06:10.919> so<00:06:11.479> over<00:06:12.479> the<00:06:12.569> steam<00:06:12.870> of<00:06:13.050> a<00:06:13.139> kettle<00:06:13.529> we're

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:14.279 
okay so over the steam of a kettle we're
