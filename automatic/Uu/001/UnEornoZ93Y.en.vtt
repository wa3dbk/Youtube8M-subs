00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:10.769
 hello my name is still this 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.230
 day we continue our video predictions 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.630
 on the bookmakers fish website 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.230
 we are on the agenda next league matches 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.269
 champions 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.699
 just a step left before the final 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:25.380
 semi-final game with a crazy sign 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.779
 Excellent chips and real bavaria let's go 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.580
 order by analogy the first to play on 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.239
 vicente calderon athletics madrid studied 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.579
 and here is surely the first thing that comes 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.559
 to mind is somebody u less than two with 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.100
 half but bookmakers are not fools too 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.350
 They also believe that the heads of ladies are not 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.110
 will be clogged and the coefficient is very modest 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.670
 only 1 and 5 worth it you can play 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.500
 It may be for express and maybe someone 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.090
 wants a powerful bet 1 as well as 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.489
 it seems to me to bake heads not 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.149
 must have deprived him chelsea gave the go-ahead to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.850
 to 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.370
 tibo kurtua played the match against the team 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.850
 which he belongs know give this 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.579
 the story of how she resolved me 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.499
 it seems that the game will be waiting 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.630
 I hope to certainly try to rush 

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:12.679
 Immediately start with and new teams 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.880
 mourinho where sat there if immediately 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:18.090
 the conversation is short and i think that he 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.069
 studied ready because the first aid kit will pass 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.560
 from the first minutes to attack the gates of Peter 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:24.560
 check and I think 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.780
 goal in this meeting should not come immediately 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.360
 so my proposal I will make two 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.140
 proposals for this meeting and you yourself 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.540
 choose 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.370
 I think that the first goal of the match on 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.190
 weighing the frame it was different will be scored 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.160
 after 31 minutes it is very good 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.520
 factor 2 and 1 I offer you this 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.500
 option 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.770
 consider that first goal in this match 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.380
 will be david after the first half hour of the game and 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.910
 the second option he just might 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.990
 coming out of the lens 1 is that the second half 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.780
 will be more than 1. 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.700
 not bad 215 seems to me that the first 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.619
 in general, you can finish a draw 0 0 here 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.810
 all major events if we talk will 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.810
 turn around in the second half 2 no more 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.180
 1 with a coefficient of 215 that's what 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.100
 concerns a canopy match over calderon 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.709
 second match will also be held in madrid 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.900
 but the next day on the legendary 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.790
 santiago bernabéu real bavaria up 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.739
 ancelotti vs guardiola 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.980
 in the vestibule better come up for this 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.840
 final agile and on here the opposite 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.330
 it seems yes real bavaria both teams 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.549
 play very effectively plays a 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.830
 those here seem to be put 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.709
 both score but without flies as if 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.680
 trite and coefficient 153 us 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.660
 lynnfield is quite modest for me 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.970
 it seems on this game here I am definitely 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.850
 I will risk because of such matches 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.709
 it is very hard to give a forecast 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.120
 based on the fact that most likely Elizabeth 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.430
 because bavaria was not full either 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.080
 one match in the Champions League in this 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.260
 the season so she didn't score 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.489
 and it seems to me that 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.510
 option both score and a draw looks 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.980
 quite good 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.110
 here I am primarily repelled 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.700
 the odds don't both score and draw 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.379
 it's a factor of 4 will play to 100 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.269
 dollars if you bet you can win 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.280
 400 why not risk the more 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.290
 the balance of power is approximately equal in those or 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.170
 other great chances great players 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.510
 urial I do not know there will not play ronaldo 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.569
 will play and most likely will not play but 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.849
 my we are without him we understand the semi-finals 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.620
 Spanish Cup has someone to forget the suit 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:37.000
 sea ​​steps for city ​​2 b here it seems to me 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.970
 knocks in this game there is no draw 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.609
 it looks it also looks with a gala 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.220
 both will not fill the time with cassettes 4 as a bonus 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.109
 maybe you can consider the option 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.639
 the series will score first I like 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:53.920
 the proposal that on the border these houses and 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.480
 walked and a chance for a veteran especially as 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.780
 we saw in the quarterfinal match 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.079
 Manchester for this cube times from bavaria 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.579
 character first but i do the same 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.200
 real 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.900
 that real calls first coefficient 191 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.269
 Abel Helly is also quite playable 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.489
 such predictions 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.319
 first semi-final league matches 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.329
 Champions watch football and not scores 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.760
 do not forget to subscribe to youtube 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.599
 Good luck bookmaker rating channel 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.599
