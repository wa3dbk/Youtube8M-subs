00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:09.020
 Hello everyone 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:13.910
 It is good if you become charged just in a tactical mobile game 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:17.770
 So we have very public Let's go write from everyone and York thought Now 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.770
 I would like to start the engine 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.519
 I would like to steam the engine 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.460
 I think that the engine's blowing up is also in good shape 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.300
 Then I would like to do this check next time 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:50.660
 First lower the temperature to the bottom 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.660
 Yes followed by even more of the wind and to fully open Yay 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:10.970
 Yes, very cold air comes out of the air conditioner too 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:16.580
 The wind is also very strong, so I think I'm worried about anything 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:21.590
 It is the smell of the last pet that I put on air-conditioner, and after riding a cigarette, I am riding before 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.409
 Rest assured that there is no particular concern about the smell of the air freshener etc. 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.140
 If you can 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:31.420
 think 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.420
 Yes Continued Here It is a genuine dvd navigation 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:40.460
 Yesterday I am here 4 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.350
 When listening to music , cd and letter mg are more playable. 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.750
 I think there is no inconvenience 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.990
 Yes you are after in conjunction with the here back gear so we are also equipped with a back camera 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.100
 In fact nicely camera 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.100
 I would like to 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:04.289
 Yes It looks like this is because the back camera is also quite easy to see 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.289
 I think it may not be very convenient when being injected 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:14.069
 May I continue to see above 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:21.130
 It is this car every year with a sunroof 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:23.880
 Align the something your cigarette so you can have and the number theory Yes open this way 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:30.510
 I think it might be good 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.510
 Yes I'm continuing , I want to open the back too 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:55.280
 Yes, because it can be opened and closed like this 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:03:00.740
 I think that I think we very nice Nante your family there are something virtual your child's the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:03.770
 It is this car that follows yes It is accompanied by painful thing on both sides 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.319
 Open with slide video of the passenger side 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.370
 Auslide Vanga is 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.420
 Well then 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.420
 I want to open it 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.980
 I'm not this Yes 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:35.240
 As we can open and close freely from the driver's seat with one button 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:39.310
 I think it's also very useful when you are cooking 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.310
 I would appreciate your favor those who consider
