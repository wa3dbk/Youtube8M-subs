00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.309
 Hello dear sports fans in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.750
 features lovers bench press 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.559
 This video is another review of one 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.870
 from my workouts 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.240
 this training is messy to solve a lot 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.430
 wines and stocking tasks that were described 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.150
 to you as a previous review because of the problem 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.070
 derives directly from the shadow of the scientific plan 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.410
 at first glance, everything is corny in essence 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.830
 I review every press order 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.960
 lying down 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.809
 as a separate exercise deciding 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 interesting training tasks 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.690
 Naturally training begins with 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.360
 total workout duration of about 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.790
 20 minutes should pay special attention 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.040
 so training the way does not imply 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.829
 use of maximum forests but 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.570
 still quite volume remember that on 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.539
 background of pre-fatigue too 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.640
 can get serious injuries 1 bench press 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.570
 lying down is intended to provide warming up your 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.910
 muscles and ligaments 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.160
 and prepare them coming soon 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.530
 first precedes his work 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.300
 two or three approaches with an empty neck 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.250
 performed slowly style after which 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.770
 are the main approaches i'm not 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.150
 recorded the video kept however i will note that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.740
 they should try to do 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.890
 we will return the maximum style 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.570
 he was 4 approaches I gradually by 20 30 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.070
 kilograms increase for the bar 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.600
 until they reach the next working weight 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.400
 as you move to the competition 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.939
 decreases the number of repetitions in 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.130
 approach 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.750
 work on wine old age gradually 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.770
 replaced by training for the purpose of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.590
 increase in strength 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.170
 topic 6 to 6 seemed to be mixed 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.090
 mode that is not purely forceful 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.460
 and is called upon to perfect as vanity 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.280
 stamina if you watched my video 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.140
 bench press review of the training period then 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.420
 probably remember that then the king was 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.220
 only enhance we have it 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.509
 caused an appropriate amount 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.509
 reps in the approach 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.270
 if 12 stamina is great 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.250
 foundation and hung it up that's why on 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.380
 my opinion is more success always 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.720
 reach someone fraction training 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.730
 process for periods 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:08.540
 they constantly train mixed 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:10.910
 people all approaches to 190 are performed 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.980
 substantial stock should not be allowed 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.740
 strong yearning in since after 6 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.740
 Approaches in 190 will be performed 10 more 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.510
 such more weight to exactly 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.880
 calculate kandinsky best 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.200
 use on a crucifer that is 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.750
 initially do work with 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.910
 understated themselves telly week raises 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.040
 need this will give the opportunity not 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.930
 only progress faster but also 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.800
 study your balance of power and 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.260
 endurance 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.510
 detect problem sides 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.090
 also identify weaknesses across the field 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.209
 observations since I managed 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.190
 eliminate the dead center I did not 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.510
 include day heavy noise various 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.000
 helper exercises 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.640
 but nevertheless they are performed in the lungs 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.110
 days with moderate 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.240
 the main focus is on power 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.520
 fusion keep so how exactly are these 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.030
 qualities in my opinion determine 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.920
 bench press to do shooting 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.720
 I tried to change my perspective 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.519
 to give an opportunity to make sure 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.760
 that i keep all technical 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.650
 logic operation requirements 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.870
 especially experienced experts who undoubtedly 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.030
 have more significant sports 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.060
 the achievements of the public me in the squad 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.519
 species completely incomprehensible how can they 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.340
 diagnose from arrest for not seeing 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.290
 This is most likely to tear down these people 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.810
 thanks to all the abilities that 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.720
 give opportunity or made where 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.940
 they cannot be seen in principle jim 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.060
 two hundred and five approaches three times with him 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.170
 start with you sent work wore 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.360
 of course as the date approaches 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.760
 competition from the service will be more 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.739
 to shift sides of the characters and works not 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.989
 it’s possible that it’s two three four 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.090
 repetition is greatest you 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.549
 brought back a month before the competition 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.830
 before departure there is a task at the exit to 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.670
 pixels 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.610
 however, it is already necessary 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.840
 take direct action 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.989
 directly affecting 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.459
 limit maximum ears bilena jim two hundred 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.180
 five sets three times 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.700
 as 210 5 approaches twice 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.099
 this is one such measure is buy 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.049
 an example of a classic work on the power of these 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.509
 exercise is the best for 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.370
 improve bench press results if 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.269
 analyze programs on one of 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.240
 top coaches 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.400
 I can boris Ivanovich chic line 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.750
 we can conclude that the main work 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.479
 in basic exercises 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.000
 fall on the approaches 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.810
 calculated for two three repetitions 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.449
 original confirmation 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.610
 effectiveness of just such an approach was 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.949
 obtained from the works of Soviet theorists 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.380
 weightlifting for example arc sake 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.650
 Vorobiev in his opinion approaches 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.330
 performed in a small number of repetitions 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.830
 best contributes to the development 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.210
 speed on power qualities and 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.400
 athletes and so behind 11 workers 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.780
 approaches from the bar nevertheless 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.060
 have to increase 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.410
 despite this approach is still 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.840
 look light 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.090
 I think the girl climb overhang 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.000
 only meaningless but harmful therefore 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.699
 built part of the nero important process with 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.400
 using weights less than 80 percent 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.320
 so was this approach not allowed 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.240
 to overload the ligaments fully 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.039
 recover as well as completely 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.900
 exclude are equal from training 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.010
 process 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.169
 the latter can usually be 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.380
 obtained by using 7 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.120
 maximum weights either during 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.729
 co-founder when used 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.260
 significant sardic sensations failure on 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.349
 my mind is very dangerous 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.080
 the term caste shows from show speed people 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:40.180
 which is not focused on chinese 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.729
 new indicators she's building 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.430
 massive muscle volumes and maintaining 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.620
 optimal proportions of this should 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.320
 that the weight of the projectile is not an end in itself 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.479
 your money like harry just this 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.370
 insert the goal of maximum development 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.720
 speed-strength qualities of an athlete 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.120
 back to the issue of technology like 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.699
 would repeat i perform the counter 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.220
 bar movement in me tolerances and care 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.770
 when I reach the dead center I do not 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.840
 took out in this text exactly the same 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.870
 honey famous american athlete 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.719
 Aryan cinema and also it happens your 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.360
 amounted to about 12 ep but it is this 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:21.279
 figure they are the weight of the projectile in my opinion 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.279
 is decisive if evaluated 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:25.870
 training loads and naturally what 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:28.090
 after such unloading any 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.610
 auxiliary exercise until just 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.860
 because of the resulting languor can only 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.419
 slow recovery but not 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.180
 have a significant impact on 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:40.389
 the amount of strength and endurance 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.449
 either technical specifications please 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:46.080
 forgiveness if it was too much 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.080
 Thanks for attention
