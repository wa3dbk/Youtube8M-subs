well<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:01.070> was<00:02:01.250> clinging<00:02:01.850> is<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.180> fun<00:02:02.360> part

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
well that was clinging is the fun part

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.810

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.000 
but now we I don't know if you guys
thought<00:02:08.000> this<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.330> with<00:02:08.509> sandpaper<00:02:09.020> this<00:02:09.860> is

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
thought this is with sandpaper this is

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.479 
thought this is with sandpaper this is
the<00:02:10.070> funnest<00:02:10.280> part<00:02:11.890> might<00:02:12.890> even<00:02:13.160> more<00:02:13.310> fun

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
the funnest part might even more fun

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:21.810 
the funnest part might even more fun
than<00:02:13.610> cleaning<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:16.060> here's<00:02:18.160> saying<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.580> guess

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
than cleaning so here's saying I guess

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.600 
than cleaning so here's saying I guess
they<00:02:22.820> don't<00:02:22.940> miss<00:02:23.180> anything<00:02:24.160> we'll<00:02:25.160> be<00:02:25.280> seeing

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
they don't miss anything we'll be seeing

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.300 
they don't miss anything we'll be seeing
my<00:02:25.880> logos<00:02:26.480> side<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.500> that<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.500> probably<00:02:30.769> saw

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
my logos side of that so I probably saw

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:41.140 
my logos side of that so I probably saw
that<00:02:31.340> again<00:02:38.590> okay<00:02:39.590> this<00:02:40.160> is<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.519> hard<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.850> film

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
that again okay this is so hard to film

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.650 
that again okay this is so hard to film
like<00:02:41.360> this<00:02:41.540> I'm<00:02:42.040> sand<00:02:43.040> like<00:02:43.250> this<00:02:43.489> I'll<00:02:44.360> show

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
like this I'm sand like this I'll show

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.430 
like this I'm sand like this I'll show
you<00:02:45.040> just<00:02:46.040> not<00:02:46.250> standing<00:02:46.840> not<00:02:47.840> too<00:02:48.110> big<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.380> a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
you just not standing not too big of a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.259 
you just not standing not too big of a
deal<00:02:48.590> sand<00:02:49.459> but<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:51.549> personally<00:02:52.549> sand<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:53.000> it

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
deal sand but I personally sand it it

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.620 
deal sand but I personally sand it it
helps<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.690> paint<00:02:53.930> stick<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.530> better<00:02:54.650> and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
helps the paint stick to it better and

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.500 
helps the paint stick to it better and
use<00:02:56.630> do<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:58.030> don't<00:02:59.030> think<00:02:59.150> it'll<00:02:59.329> make<00:02:59.450> a

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
use do it I don't think it'll make a

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.820 
use do it I don't think it'll make a
difference<00:02:59.720> that<00:03:00.140> I'm<00:03:00.230> pretty<00:03:00.500> service

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.110 

so<00:03:05.830> that's<00:03:06.040> even<00:03:06.310> if<00:03:06.400> you're<00:03:06.520> going<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.670> st.<00:03:06.910> it

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
so that's even if you're going to st. it

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.030 
so that's even if you're going to st. it
so<00:03:07.360> if<00:03:08.110> you're<00:03:08.260> not<00:03:08.380> going<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.620> sand<00:03:08.860> it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
so if you're not going to sand it

know whether to sand this also i'm just
going<00:03:39.550> to<00:03:39.580> do<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:39.850> just<00:03:40.120> because<00:03:40.270> it's<00:03:40.750> not

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
going to do it just because it's not

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.870 
going to do it just because it's not
like<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.290> guide<00:03:41.590> button<00:03:41.860> that's<00:03:42.100> not<00:03:42.370> really

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
like a guide button that's not really

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.150 
like a guide button that's not really
going<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.060> affect<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.390> too<00:03:43.510> much<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:45.130> don't

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:55.190 
going to affect it too much and I don't
know<00:03:45.340> if<00:03:45.880> I<00:03:45.970> make<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.270> paint<00:03:46.450> stick<00:03:46.690> better

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.420 

this<00:03:56.200> is<00:03:56.410> probably<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.710> best<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:57.280> you'll

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
this is probably the best that you'll

best of everything I will see the
standing<00:04:09.160> on<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.430> but<00:04:10.330> now<00:04:10.630> we're<00:04:10.840> done<00:04:10.959> with

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
standing on it but now we're done with

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.370 
standing on it but now we're done with
sanding<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:12.270> yeah<00:04:13.270> so<00:04:13.870> next<00:04:14.320> part<00:04:14.650> is<00:04:16.380> paint
