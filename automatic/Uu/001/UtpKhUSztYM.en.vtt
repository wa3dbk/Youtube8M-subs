00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
water to act as a glue and be sure that

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.610 
water to act as a glue and be sure that
you<00:01:57.610> know<00:01:57.940> where<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.690> want<00:01:58.960> this<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.410> go<00:01:59.440> on

your cake because once you've glued that
down<00:02:02.170> it's<00:02:03.160> pretty<00:02:03.490> difficult<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.420> get<00:02:04.780> them

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
down it's pretty difficult to get them

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:14.760
