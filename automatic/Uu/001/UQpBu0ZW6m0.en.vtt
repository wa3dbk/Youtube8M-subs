00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.190
 We trained in rain, we started there today. 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.130
 a disc enjoyment 8 was waiting for new 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.189
 very muddy rain the last crisis were 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.019
 very slippery we left a lot of mud 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.480
 very flat on the floor and the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.070
 staff at a very strong pace since the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.859
 beginning and in the middle of the course of a 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.899
 part of forest closed with much silt 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.210
 so I said again it was coming up 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.710
 doing a lot of things by doing 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.030
 a lot of things to go down here take a lot 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.250
 be careful because it was slippery 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.250
 cause of the mud was tempted 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.940
 with the proof some mud hard proof 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.280
 such as this part of the plane that 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.050
 he was always an athlete who played a lot 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.050
 well this part flat and today also 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.840
 was going up very well so I had 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.970
 what to think about where I'm going to attack and I found 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.619
 the single drec it for the most part 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.390
 technique could attack and succeeded 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.410
 good we open an escape 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.240
 in the last 15 kilometers it opened a 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.940
 a small difference in bit 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.899
 track left on the road again there was 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.899
 still within 100 meters 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.760
 funny here all the tests my ne 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.400
 and this gives one degree more in the na 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.590
 Difficulty of you is taking the test. 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.320
 even running in the sport category 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.330
 the degree of difficulty is very high and the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.250
 technical level has gone up quite the same 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.830
 being sport but it was the whole circuit 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.540
 with the tracks on the road long ago 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.820
 was technically selective technical and the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.300
 old so far had step the water is that 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.300
 the other steps 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.810
 It was nice, it was an ox, it's harder, right? 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.560
 because it is technically with mud 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:29.410
 it gets more dangerous but in the end it's over 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:34.030
 Everything going fine, characteristic of ours. 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.070
 of this circuit will not change people 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.450
 will try so but got enough of 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.019
 one step to another 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.420
 I'll put more track one step or 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.480
 try to place the magistrate in another 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.310
 kind of balancing a more top to 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.310
 The other tries to do more 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.910
 I think he made contact with Pedro 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.640
 when there was rain at dawn no 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.590
 I thought it was a test with lots of rain 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.990
 It's good that it did not rain during the race. 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.310
 Gaucho searched a little because he did not 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.850
 I think it would have hurt much more 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.330
 resource that was already difficult my ego 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.830
 this is it here is mato so the mecca a lot 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.410
 cool the course he did is 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.770
 Sensational, I really liked your 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.770
 life right
