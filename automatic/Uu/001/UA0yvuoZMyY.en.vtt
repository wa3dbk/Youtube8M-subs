00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.810
 in time the students of 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.579
 electronic engineering and 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.800
 telecommunications from the University of 

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:11.960
 Cauca have become pioneers in 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.730
 applications for cell phones and 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.950
 have participated in creations for 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.760
 state-of-the-art equipment from Nokia 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.830
 samsung and ericsson 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.230
 the university of cauca with the 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.090
 semillero wat colombia is consolidated as 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.920
 one of the training spaces of 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.450
 new talents in the development of 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.150
 applications for mobile devices 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.730
 in Latin America 'today we 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.350
 the formation of near or more than 200 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.300
 people who are in that semester have been 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.430
 been forming in this area and also 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.590
 we have three spin-off training is 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.059
 say three companies three ventures 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.280
 that have been forged through 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.080
 seedbed thanks to an agreement with 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.120
 nokia students have created a 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.720
 countless applications that range from 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.460
 games up to a peak and interactive board 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.659
 entertainment applications 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.460
 very regional applications for example 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.780
 'pico y placa' for colombia every time 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.059
 develop applications of that type 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.440
 and applications for radio stations 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.440
 an application to learn to dance 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.330
 sauce for example follows something very 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.190
 native for example an application 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.080
 for the U-20 World Cup when we had it 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.090
 at the time in the country the 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.340
 developed applications have achieved 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.649
 from the virtual shop of nokia more than 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.080
 70 thousand downloads both in Colombia and 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.369
 internationally, specifically a 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.140
 contest that has been made inside 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.479
 what we call nokia store challenge ' 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.210
 Students are encouraged to 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.040
 test your abilities and obviously to 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.690
 who achieve that challenge the challenge 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.340
 basically is to achieve a number of 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.289
 particular downloads in the store 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.690
 applications because obviously it achieves a 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.520
 recognition by the manufacturer 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.690
 the developments in mobile computing 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.450
 they have also been acquired by 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.510
 companies like ericsson samsung and others 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.160
 cell phone manufacturers 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.050
 at this time the main 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.900
 The students' concern is to create 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.010
 applications for tablet and smartphone 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.420
 let's see some of the developments 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.600
 made at the University of Cauca 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.909
 a search engine for news in 72 languages 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.159
 ready to use just by touching the 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.020
 cell phone screen corresponds to a 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.729
 of the applications developed by 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.760
 students of the University of Cauca 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.440
 It is a news application because 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.989
 will allow you to download the news more 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.560
 Recent worldwide on your phone 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.560
 mobile and see them filtering the according 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.170
 to the language or according to the country or a 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.940
 personalized search another creation of the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.980
 cauca for colombia es station 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.560
 connection an application to search 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.200
 online stations was thought with a 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.530
 end of people very travelers of people 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.810
 let's say they left their hometown to 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.860
 another city like in my case or that 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.239
 they went from the country 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.610
 they would like to continue listening to music 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.400
 because they liked or were aware 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.700
 of the news that was happening and 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.720
 To that end, what we did was to look 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.910
 connections with some pages of 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.160
 Internet that they already had online stations 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.989
 Juan Camilo Ospina is also part of 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.030
 of the restless youth group of the 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.280
 mobile computing he created two 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.290
 very useful applications one that includes 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.090
 a database 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.849
 formulas and another one that allows the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.430
 user to schedule their activities is a 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.019
 application that includes a database 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.819
 of formulas that are useful for 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.260
 engineering students because the idea 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.879
 is that people do not have to remove 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.489
 photocopies of all the formulas that 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.230
 they need for each country for their 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.299
 materials but have them all in the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.879
 palm of fish in the palm of your hand in 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.980
 the cell phone these applications can be 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.319
 downloaded in the virtual stores of 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.250
 the manufacturers who supported mentioned 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.900
 developments 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.850
 nowadays one of the headaches 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.550
 of the users of the devices 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.320
 mobile phones are non-conformist batteries 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.850
 because they are downloaded very fast 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.590
 just to solve this 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.570
 inconvenient two youngsters of cauca 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.310
 designed a tool that allows 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.510
 know what cell phone apps 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.700
 consume more energy 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.189
 these two engineering students 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.890
 electronics and telecommunications created 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.510
 a device that allows you to identify 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.010
 the energy levels consumed by a 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.590
 cell according to applications 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.090
 which has practically installed 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.220
 that we have is a tool that 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.069
 connect between the cell phone and the battery 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.900
 with this you want to get the consumption of 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.000
 energy through measuring the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.530
 current of the voltage that is requested to the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.389
 drums 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.760
 the tool what it does is obviously 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.550
 get the data and pass it by s to 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.039
 computer these are obtained and graph 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.760
 2 in real time the players of 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.900
 music and video gps and wireless networks 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.880
 they cause the batteries to run out 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.949
 easily for this reason it is important 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.800
 know the levels of consumption for 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.870
 systems generate savings if we look at the 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.460
 brightness the cell phone is at maximum 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.520
 so if we load a song by 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.560
 example of some specific genre if 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.570
 we produce then here we go down the 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.470
 shine then to notice the difference 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.720
 true 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.130
 if it can not be observed at first 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.340
 the brightness of the screen is at maximum 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.740
 and consumed enough and then got off 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.510
 the brightness at least and here is already the 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.240
 consumption after this peak and in the 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.440
 audio consumption directly we are 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.360
 doing some tests to see which 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.120
 are the best practices and making a 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.740
 General characterization of consumption 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.360
 This research seeks to guide the 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.880
 mobile application developers 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.800
 so that their creations use less 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.510
 energy can be used for 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.310
 developers to see how much consumption 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.780
 are having and also for 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.300
 people who just want to see what 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.910
 consumptions have that device 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.620
 connected with that battery the project 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.080
 will be presented in the seventh meeting 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.260
 of the digital society that will be realized 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.120
 in France at the end of February 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.250
 but the university of cauca goes more 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.480
 there at this moment they are doing 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.850
 research to develop 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.790
 applications linked to the so-called 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.800
 ubiquitous computing that points out that 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.230
 mobile teams communicate with others 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.390
 smart artifacts and in turn with 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.280
 the users allowing them to perform 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.950
 multiple activities of daily life 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.050
 let's see what it consists of 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.820
 the idea of ​​mobile computing is 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.560
 evolve is what you know as 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.350
 computation or vic or ubiquitous computing 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.360
 is to be able to have intelligent objects that 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.490
 make certain decisions and communicate 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.780
 with other objects or with people to 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.170
 through devices such as 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.910
 mobile devices or devices 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.890
 general character how can they be 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.750
 sensors and others that we can find 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.640
 in daily life the engineers 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.040
 Telematics experts from the university 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.200
 of Cauca hope to achieve 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.360
 cell phone users can 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.610
 have on your mobile devices information 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.410
 immediate and reliable thanks to 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.050
 devices that can be adapted in 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.000
 any product to the object that 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.250
 you want to increase electronically you 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.950
 they put some labels that are known 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.050
 as a referral and those labels can be 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.240
 paste anywhere in the book these 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.250
 labels do not need to be seen as 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.710
 bar codes and have a certain 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.870
 true reach that over the phone 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.120
 cellular can be read with simply 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.770
 touch the point where we want to find 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.200
 the information with this technology 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.600
 it also seeks to strengthen security 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.680
 in electronic payments and records 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.900
 academics 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.850
 simply by touching the cell phone to 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.919
 object that you want to read can be 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.190
 get the information and you avoid 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:14.289
 many elements like digital 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.120
 information has to use the camera 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:18.610
 then it is much more efficient and much 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.039
 friendlier in a first stage of the 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.110
 investigation the only one that together 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:25.509
 with the university carlos third of 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.000
 madrid developed an application of a 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:30.509
 Interactive screen that was played alone 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.860
 with a cell phone in all those creations 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:34.720
 actively participate students of 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:38.250
 undergraduate and experts in the new 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.250
 Colombian southwestern technologies
