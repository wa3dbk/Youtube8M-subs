00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
hi and welcome to stamp and stuff

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.970 
hi and welcome to stamp and stuff
today<00:00:09.150> I'm<00:00:09.389> just<00:00:09.540> going<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.960> show<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.230> how<00:00:10.680> I

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
today I'm just going to show you how I

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.660 
today I'm just going to show you how I
cover<00:00:11.600> letters<00:00:12.600> and<00:00:12.629> chipboard<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.830> anything

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
cover letters and chipboard and anything

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.170 
cover letters and chipboard and anything
like<00:00:14.850> that<00:00:14.879> we<00:00:15.389> have<00:00:15.510> the<00:00:15.539> pattern<00:00:15.809> paper<00:00:16.049> I

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
like that we have the pattern paper I

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.359 
like that we have the pattern paper I
tend<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.270> use<00:00:18.359> Mod<00:00:18.840> Podge<00:00:19.080> when<00:00:19.680> when<00:00:20.160> working

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
tend to use Mod Podge when when working

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.560 
tend to use Mod Podge when when working
with<00:00:20.699> paper<00:00:20.940> but<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.349> also<00:00:22.500> use<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:23.429> PVA<00:00:24.060> or

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
with paper but you can also use a PVA or

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.259 
with paper but you can also use a PVA or
something<00:00:24.900> like<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.589> liquid<00:00:25.859> glue

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
something like that just a liquid glue

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.779 
something like that just a liquid glue
that<00:00:27.269> dries<00:00:27.810> clear

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
that dries clear

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.999 
that dries clear
so<00:00:29.789> I'm<00:00:30.060> using<00:00:30.269> Mod<00:00:30.570> Podge<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:31.169> a<00:00:31.679> little

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
so I'm using Mod Podge in a little

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.550 
so I'm using Mod Podge in a little
squeeze<00:00:32.340> bottle<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.329> I'm<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.350> put

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
squeeze bottle and I'm just going to put

00:00:34.560 --> 00:01:08.510 
squeeze bottle and I'm just going to put
it<00:00:34.650> all<00:00:34.829> over<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.190> letter

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.050 

and<00:01:08.609> then<00:01:09.299> I'm<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.159> stick<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.189> down<00:01:11.579> to

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and then I'm going to stick that down to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:21.750 
and then I'm going to stick that down to
the<00:01:12.359> reverse<00:01:12.750> side<00:01:13.369> of<00:01:14.369> my<00:01:14.729> patterning<00:01:15.119> paper

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.570 

and<00:01:21.850> then<00:01:22.570> let<00:01:23.050> that<00:01:23.080> dry<00:01:23.500> completely<00:01:23.580> because

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
and then let that dry completely because

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.070 
and then let that dry completely because
if<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.820> start<00:01:25.060> trying<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.570> cut<00:01:25.750> around<00:01:25.870> it<00:01:26.230> now

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
if you start trying to cut around it now

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.080 
if you start trying to cut around it now
it<00:01:29.080> sometimes<00:01:29.500> rips<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.130> paper<00:01:30.370> so<00:01:30.760> I<00:01:30.790> like<00:01:31.060> to

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
it sometimes rips the paper so I like to

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.200 
it sometimes rips the paper so I like to
let<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:31.480> dry<00:01:31.660> completely

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
let it dry completely

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.330 
let it dry completely
okay<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.390> glue<00:01:34.600> is<00:01:35.050> reasonably<00:01:35.710> dry<00:01:35.920> it's<00:01:36.250> a

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
okay the glue is reasonably dry it's a

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.100 
okay the glue is reasonably dry it's a
little<00:01:36.550> bit<00:01:36.670> wet<00:01:36.790> but<00:01:38.850> next<00:01:39.850> just<00:01:40.660> go<00:01:40.810> around

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
little bit wet but next just go around

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.500 
little bit wet but next just go around
with<00:01:41.440> a<00:01:41.470> craft<00:01:42.070> knife<00:01:42.190> or<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.640> Stanley<00:01:43.330> knife

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
with a craft knife or a Stanley knife

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.540 
with a craft knife or a Stanley knife
and<00:01:43.810> cut<00:01:44.680> off<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.950> excess<00:01:45.430> paper<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:47.550> sections

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
and cut off the excess paper in sections

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.340 
and cut off the excess paper in sections
I<00:01:48.760> might<00:01:48.970> end<00:01:49.150> up<00:01:49.270> having<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.750> use<00:01:49.780> my<00:01:50.080> big

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
I might end up having to use my big

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:59.510 
I might end up having to use my big
knife<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:51.100> I<00:01:51.130> can<00:01:51.430> reach<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:56.380> go<00:01:56.590> around<00:01:56.710> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:08.949 

and<00:02:00.520> use<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.600> shape<00:02:01.810> as<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.050> guide<00:02:02.320> all<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.710> way

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.410 

so<00:02:09.469> you<00:02:09.560> can<00:02:09.920> see<00:02:10.159> in<00:02:10.519> some<00:02:10.879> of<00:02:11.000> these<00:02:11.090> areas

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
so you can see in some of these areas

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.709 
so you can see in some of these areas
it's<00:02:11.959> really<00:02:12.469> quite<00:02:12.709> rough<00:02:13.540> some<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.659> the

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:14.719 
it's really quite rough some of the

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.270 
it's really quite rough some of the
paper<00:02:14.930> mustn't<00:02:15.500> have<00:02:15.590> been<00:02:15.620> dried<00:02:16.010> properly

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
paper mustn't have been dried properly

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.140 
paper mustn't have been dried properly
and<00:02:16.670> started<00:02:17.599> to<00:02:17.719> rip<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.469> the<00:02:19.250> way<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.519> neaten

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
and started to rip so the way to neaten

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.990 
and started to rip so the way to neaten
this<00:02:20.359> up<00:02:20.569> is<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.200> take<00:02:21.469> a<00:02:21.500> bit<00:02:22.459> of<00:02:22.579> sandpaper

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
this up is to take a bit of sandpaper

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.319 
this up is to take a bit of sandpaper
and<00:02:23.569> I've<00:02:23.719> just<00:02:24.019> glued<00:02:24.290> some<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:25.519> paddle<00:02:26.180> pop

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
and I've just glued some to a paddle pop

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.780 
and I've just glued some to a paddle pop
stick<00:02:26.389> or<00:02:27.139> you<00:02:27.349> can<00:02:27.560> get<00:02:27.709> files<00:02:28.099> and<00:02:28.609> things

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
stick or you can get files and things

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.959 
stick or you can get files and things
like<00:02:28.939> that<00:02:29.000> as<00:02:29.329> well<00:02:30.219> but<00:02:31.219> I<00:02:31.280> tend<00:02:31.579> to<00:02:31.700> change

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:31.969 
like that as well but I tend to change

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.819 
like that as well but I tend to change
my<00:02:32.120> sandpaper<00:02:32.329> a<00:02:32.659> fair<00:02:32.870> bit<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:33.290> just<00:02:33.319> gluing

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
my sandpaper a fair bit so just gluing

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.470 
my sandpaper a fair bit so just gluing
it<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.069> paddle<00:02:34.370> pop<00:02:34.519> stick<00:02:34.579> works<00:02:35.090> best<00:02:35.329> for

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
it to a paddle pop stick works best for

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.589 
it to a paddle pop stick works best for
me<00:02:35.629> and<00:02:35.930> just<00:02:36.739> take<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.219> and<00:02:37.400> swipe<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.209> on<00:02:38.329> the

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
me and just take it and swipe it on the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.059 
me and just take it and swipe it on the
edge<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:39.139> the<00:02:39.319> paper<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:42.230> that'll<00:02:42.560> send<00:02:42.859> it

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
edge of the paper and that'll send it

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:56.210 
edge of the paper and that'll send it
back<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.299> that<00:02:44.329> it<00:02:45.099> it<00:02:46.099> looks<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.549> lot<00:02:46.700> neater

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.000 

if<00:02:56.880> I'm<00:02:57.120> finished<00:02:57.450> going<00:02:57.720> around<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.710> entire

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
if I'm finished going around the entire

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.880 
if I'm finished going around the entire
letter<00:02:59.790> just<00:03:00.300> doing<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:00.750> swiping<00:03:01.410> motion

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
letter just doing that swiping motion

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.440 
letter just doing that swiping motion
with<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:03.410> sandpaper<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.940> it's<00:03:05.940> printed<00:03:06.330> up

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
with the sandpaper and it's printed up

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.560 
with the sandpaper and it's printed up
pretty<00:03:06.900> well<00:03:07.230> but<00:03:08.190> as<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.730> last<00:03:08.940> step<00:03:09.270> I'm

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
pretty well but as the last step I'm

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.410 
pretty well but as the last step I'm
just<00:03:09.960> wanting<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.290> take<00:03:10.860> some<00:03:11.250> distress<00:03:12.060> ink

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
and in a sponge or an applicator tool

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.720 
and in a sponge or an applicator tool
and<00:03:17.130> I'm<00:03:17.250> just<00:03:17.310> going<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:19.190> put<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.220> bit<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.460> ink

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
and I'm just going to put a bit of ink

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.970 
and I'm just going to put a bit of ink
on<00:03:20.880> those<00:03:21.030> edges<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:23.220> tends<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.880> hide

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
on those edges that tends to hide

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.710 
on those edges that tends to hide
blending<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.490> edges<00:03:26.640> in<00:03:26.970> with<00:03:27.120> your<00:03:27.270> paint<00:03:27.540> as

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
blending the edges in with your paint as

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.200 
blending the edges in with your paint as
well<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.110> hence<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.500> hide<00:03:28.740> little<00:03:29.670> little

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
well and hence I hide little little

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.450 
well and hence I hide little little
mistakes<00:03:30.660> like<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:31.170> here<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.860> this<00:03:32.220> one

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
mistakes like this here and this one

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:45.580 
mistakes like this here and this one
just<00:03:33.330> down<00:03:33.480> here<00:03:33.540> as<00:03:33.960> well

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:54.280 

and<00:03:46.590> they<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:48.030> finished<00:03:48.540> result

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290
