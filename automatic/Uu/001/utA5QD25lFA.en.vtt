00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
bit smaller they are on the 930 you can

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.260 
bit smaller they are on the 930 you can
see<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.399> both<00:00:41.550> are<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.940> very

keys down here and here you only get two
keys<00:00:47.670> multitasking<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> bad<00:00:49.860> key<00:00:50.840> so

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
keys multitasking and then a bad key so

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.750 
keys multitasking and then a bad key so
overall<00:00:54.410> of<00:00:55.410> course<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> key<00:00:56.460> things

overall of course one of the key things

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.250 
overall of course one of the key things
here<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> s5<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.020> dust

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
here with the s5 is that it's dust

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.029 
here with the s5 is that it's dust
resistant<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.010> water<00:00:59.190> resistant<00:00:59.670> has<00:01:00.239> this

might ask yourself are you going to use
that<00:01:16.820> you<00:01:17.820> get<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> 20<00:01:18.630> episode<00:01:18.960> camera<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:19.470> on

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that you get a 20 episode camera here on

and<00:01:20.009> II<00:01:20.250> didn't<00:01:21.150> DM<00:01:21.630> 930<00:01:22.729> versus<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:24.290> 16

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
and II didn't DM 930 versus a 16

and II didn't DM 930 versus a 16
megapixel<00:01:25.799> camera<00:01:26.700> here<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.570> galaxy<00:01:28.080> s5

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
megapixel camera here on the galaxy s5

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.380 
megapixel camera here on the galaxy s5
the<00:01:29.070> galaxy<00:01:29.400> s5<00:01:29.610> definitely<00:01:30.000> feels<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.299> little

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the galaxy s5 definitely feels a little

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.069 
the galaxy s5 definitely feels a little
bit<00:01:30.600> more<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> toy<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.829> would<00:01:32.070> say<00:01:32.840> this<00:01:33.840> one

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
bit more like a toy I would say this one

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.359 
bit more like a toy I would say this one
has<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> harder<00:01:35.280> material<00:01:36.590> very<00:01:37.590> nice<00:01:38.009> looking

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
has a harder material very nice looking

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.190 
has a harder material very nice looking
you<00:01:38.729> also<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:40.020> dedicated<00:01:40.590> camera<00:01:41.250> button

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.649 

if<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.439> hold<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:46.970> at<00:01:47.970> least<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.240> think<00:01:48.299> it's

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
if you hold it in at least I think it's

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.319 
if you hold it in at least I think it's
the<00:01:48.899> counter<00:01:49.259> button<00:01:49.439> Nokia<00:01:49.920> camera<00:01:50.329> maybe

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the counter button Nokia camera maybe

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.679 
the counter button Nokia camera maybe
later<00:01:51.689> okay<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:56.070> very<00:01:56.219> nice<00:01:56.610> there<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
later okay so very nice there with a

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:09.219 
later okay so very nice there with a
camera<00:01:58.020> button<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.619> that

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.490 

has<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.950> pretty<00:02:10.340> cool<00:02:10.640> sound<00:02:11.060> there

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.550 

so<00:02:17.500> when<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.730> one<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.030> course<00:02:19.060> also<00:02:19.840> in<00:02:20.170> its

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
so when this one of course also in its

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.010 
so when this one of course also in its
body<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.250> actually<00:02:22.150> thought<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.660> would<00:02:22.870> get

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
body I actually thought that I would get

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.490 
body I actually thought that I would get
these<00:02:23.350> outer<00:02:23.650> edges<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.870> see<00:02:26.140> on

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
these outer edges and that you see on

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.980 
these outer edges and that you see on
product<00:02:27.430> pictures<00:02:27.760> which<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.180> like<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.569> metal

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
probably better game experience on

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.710 
probably better game experience on
Android<00:04:45.770> because<00:04:45.860> there's<00:04:46.220> just<00:04:46.550> so<00:04:47.360> many

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
Android because there's just so many

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.310 
Android because there's just so many
games<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:49.340> Windows<00:04:49.760> Store<00:04:50.390> still<00:04:50.960> feels

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
games and the Windows Store still feels

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.430 
games and the Windows Store still feels
a<00:04:51.530> little<00:04:51.650> bit<00:04:51.830> like<00:04:51.890> a<00:04:52.100> toy<00:04:53.080> with<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.110> little

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
a little bit like a toy with a little

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.350 
a little bit like a toy with a little
bit<00:04:54.560> of<00:04:54.680> silly<00:04:55.070> games<00:04:55.370> that<00:04:55.880> doesn't<00:04:56.180> really

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
bit of silly games that doesn't really

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.520 
bit of silly games that doesn't really
take<00:04:56.600> advantage<00:04:56.720> of<00:04:57.910> them<00:04:58.960> overall<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.260> power

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
take advantage of them overall the power

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.020 
take advantage of them overall the power
and<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:02.330> mean<00:05:02.480> this<00:05:02.600> is<00:05:02.780> so<00:05:03.110> much<00:05:03.800> more<00:05:04.130> in<00:05:04.760> terms

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
okay so yeah it's a quickly a video here

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:00.509 
obviously I didn't take a look at that

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.799 
obviously I didn't take a look at that
much<00:06:00.659> on<00:06:00.839> the<00:06:00.960> software<00:06:01.379> but<00:06:02.219> I<00:06:02.909> might<00:06:03.629> do<00:06:03.779> that

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:03.809 
much on the software but I might do that

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:06.529 
much on the software but I might do that
in<00:06:04.289> other<00:06:04.649> videos<00:06:04.770> if<00:06:05.279> people<00:06:05.789> are<00:06:06.119> interested

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
in other videos if people are interested

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.109 
in other videos if people are interested
but<00:06:06.990> you<00:06:07.139> can<00:06:07.259> see<00:06:07.379> are<00:06:07.589> very<00:06:08.009> cool<00:06:08.399> put<00:06:08.699> totals

00:06:09.109 --> 00:06:09.119 
but you can see are very cool put totals

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.600 
but you can see are very cool put totals
here<00:06:09.389> and<00:06:09.599> a<00:06:10.529> little<00:06:10.770> bit<00:06:10.860> better<00:06:11.069> here<00:06:11.429> I'm

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
here and a little bit better here I'm

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.949 
here and a little bit better here I'm
thinking<00:06:11.639> touch<00:06:12.059> with<00:06:12.300> a<00:06:12.330> lot<00:06:12.599> of<00:06:12.659> things<00:06:12.839> you

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:12.959 
thinking touch with a lot of things you

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:15.350 
thinking touch with a lot of things you
can<00:06:13.080> toggle<00:06:13.349> quick<00:06:13.860> instead<00:06:14.759> of<00:06:14.879> having<00:06:15.059> to<00:06:15.209> go

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
can toggle quick instead of having to go

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.139 
can toggle quick instead of having to go
into<00:06:15.599> all<00:06:15.779> settings<00:06:16.289> all<00:06:16.559> the<00:06:16.679> time<00:06:16.949> and<00:06:17.309> go

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:18.149 
into all settings all the time and go

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:19.760 
into all settings all the time and go
and<00:06:18.300> tweak<00:06:18.479> it<00:06:18.509> so<00:06:18.959> yeah

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
and tweak it so yeah

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.080 
and tweak it so yeah
quickly<00:06:20.339> look<00:06:20.520> here<00:06:20.699> hopefully<00:06:21.270> did<00:06:21.539> angel
