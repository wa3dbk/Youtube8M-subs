from me and dislike their video like
it's<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:43.770> going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.130> affect<00:01:44.340> them<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.850> I've

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
it's really going to affect them so I've

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.780 
it's really going to affect them so I've
never<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.509> understood<00:01:46.070> why<00:01:47.070> people<00:01:47.100> just

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
never really understood why people just

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.249 
never really understood why people just
like<00:01:47.909> videos<00:01:48.270> anyway<00:01:48.780> because<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.079> don't

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
like videos anyway because I don't

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.510 
like videos anyway because I don't
really<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> point<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> honestly

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
really see the point like it honestly

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.240 
really see the point like it honestly
doesn't<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.780> anything<00:01:52.409> at<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.220> doesn't

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
doesn't do anything at all it doesn't

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.649 
doesn't do anything at all it doesn't
really<00:01:53.579> listen<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.880> anything<00:01:54.180> unless<00:01:54.479> you're

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
really listen to anything unless you're

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.690 
really listen to anything unless you're
just<00:01:54.810> trying<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> dick<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.460> guess

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
just trying to be a dick then I guess

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.520 
just trying to be a dick then I guess
that<00:01:57.060> does<00:01:57.329> kind<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.689> accomplish<00:01:58.259> something

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
that does kind of accomplish something

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.170 
that does kind of accomplish something
but<00:01:59.189> yeah<00:01:59.310> I've<00:01:59.430> just<00:01:59.610> never<00:01:59.729> really<00:02:00.060> been

a<00:02:49.920> few<00:02:50.220> things<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> want<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.000> talk<00:02:51.180> about

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
a few things that I want to talk about

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.300 
a few things that I want to talk about
like<00:02:51.660> depression<00:02:52.050> I'm<00:02:52.500> bullying<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.130> stuff

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
like depression I'm bullying and stuff

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.680 
like depression I'm bullying and stuff
like<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.880> i've<00:02:54.330> been<00:02:54.540> procrastinating

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
like that and i've been procrastinating

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.040 
like that and i've been procrastinating
about<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.040> i<00:02:56.459> think<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.880> big<00:02:57.270> reason<00:02:57.540> why

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
about it and i think a big reason why

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.800 
about it and i think a big reason why
i've<00:02:58.320> been<00:02:58.530> procrastinating<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:59.430> because<00:03:00.330> if

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
i've been procrastinating is because if

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.570 
i've been procrastinating is because if
i<00:03:00.959> put<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.260> out<00:03:01.350> there<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.739> then<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.190> gets<00:03:02.340> like

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
i put it out there and then it gets like

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.600 
i put it out there and then it gets like
50<00:03:02.970> dislikes<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.660> that's<00:03:04.620> like<00:03:04.800> wow<00:03:05.160> people

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
50 dislikes I that's like wow people

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.970 
50 dislikes I that's like wow people
don't<00:03:05.790> like<00:03:06.209> me<00:03:06.239> really<00:03:07.110> don't<00:03:07.410> like<00:03:07.620> me<00:03:07.830> and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
don't like me really don't like me and

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.979 
don't like me really don't like me and
that<00:03:08.130> would<00:03:08.280> really<00:03:08.520> really<00:03:08.910> really<00:03:09.090> suck<00:03:09.540> so

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
that would really really really suck so

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.330 
that would really really really suck so
it<00:03:10.110> definitely<00:03:10.260> depends<00:03:10.709> on<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.980> video<00:03:11.160> if

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
it definitely depends on the video if

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.979 
it definitely depends on the video if
it's<00:03:11.459> just<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.670> regular<00:03:11.880> video<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.600> maybe<00:03:12.870> i

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
it's just a regular video and maybe i

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.140 
it's just a regular video and maybe i
said<00:03:13.110> something<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:14.250> people<00:03:14.880> didn't<00:03:15.090> really

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
said something that people didn't really

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.060 
said something that people didn't really
agree<00:03:15.330> with<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:16.170> doesn't<00:03:16.500> really<00:03:16.590> bother<00:03:16.709> me

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
agree with it doesn't really bother me
