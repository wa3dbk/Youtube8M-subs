hello<00:00:00.390> welcome<00:00:00.750> to<00:00:00.840> my<00:00:00.930> demonstration<00:00:01.230> on<00:00:01.709> how

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
hello welcome to my demonstration on how

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.829 
hello welcome to my demonstration on how
to<00:00:01.979> pass<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:03.179> 330<00:00:04.170> limit<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.680> we<00:00:05.040> fits

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
to pass the 330 limit of we fits

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.610 
to pass the 330 limit of we fits
requirements<00:00:06.839> in<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.290> game<00:00:07.529> we<00:00:07.890> fit<00:00:08.360> using

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
requirements in the game we fit using

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.270 
requirements in the game we fit using
why<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:10.889> balance<00:00:11.370> board<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.889> this<00:00:13.889> piece<00:00:14.130> of

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
why we balance board and this piece of

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.590 
why we balance board and this piece of
fall<00:00:15.170> so<00:00:16.170> what<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.529> does<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.670> basically<00:00:17.970> I

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
fall so what that does is it basically I

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.210 
fall so what that does is it basically I
put<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.109> under<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.830> put<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.730> piece<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.180> foam

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
put it under I put this piece of foam

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.509 
put it under I put this piece of foam
under<00:00:23.359> this<00:00:24.359> rebalance<00:00:25.019> board<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:26.400> can

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
under this rebalance board and you can

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.160 
under this rebalance board and you can
see<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> cup<00:00:27.000> areas<00:00:27.390> right<00:00:27.630> around<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
see the cup areas right around the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.929 
see the cup areas right around the
sensor<00:00:28.500> bar<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.340> sensor<00:00:29.609> bars<00:00:29.789> can

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
sensor bar so that the sensor bars can

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.600 
sensor bar so that the sensor bars can
still<00:00:30.210> hit<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.630> ground<00:00:31.130> better<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:34.610> what

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
still hit the ground better and what

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.549 
still hit the ground better and what
this<00:00:35.760> does<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.660> kind<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> makes<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
this does is it kind of makes it like a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.709 
this does is it kind of makes it like a
little<00:00:37.950> lighter<00:00:38.250> mix<00:00:39.030> them<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> load<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> little

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
little lighter mix them a load a little

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.959 
little lighter mix them a load a little
lighter<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.379> spring<00:00:41.160> makes<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.430> more<00:00:41.550> springy

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
lighter and spring makes it more springy

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.010 
lighter and spring makes it more springy
spring<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.760> I'm<00:00:44.760> able<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.809> be

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
spring so that I'm able to not be

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.700 
spring so that I'm able to not be
considered<00:00:46.649> heavy<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.700> thing<00:00:48.030> now<00:00:48.710> for

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
considered heavy on this thing now for

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
considered heavy on this thing now for
some<00:00:49.920> reason<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.550> demo<00:00:50.789> did<00:00:51.059> not<00:00:51.210> build<00:00:51.539> this

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
some reason that demo did not build this

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.830 
some reason that demo did not build this
thing<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.579> Americans<00:00:53.579> as<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.660> much

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
thing for Americans as we are much

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.910 
thing for Americans as we are much
fatter<00:00:55.110> than<00:00:55.320> Japanese<00:00:55.770> people<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.660> I<00:00:57.920> was

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
fatter than Japanese people so I was

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.889 
fatter than Japanese people so I was
able<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.280> find<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.820> way<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.390> through<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> gap

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
able to find a way to go through the gap

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.349 
able to find a way to go through the gap
and<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.680> able<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.070> play<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.489> game<00:01:02.760> without

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359

you're<00:01:40.530> sure<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.130> sensor<00:01:41.670> bars<00:01:42.030> don't

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you're sure that the sensor bars don't

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.069 
you're sure that the sensor bars don't
aren't<00:01:43.290> contacting<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> foam<00:01:44.750> using<00:01:45.750> a

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
aren't contacting the foam using a

that we got that over with let us start
with<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.759> process<00:01:54.439> first<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:56.240> put<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
with the process first I put this on the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.359 
with the process first I put this on the
floor<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.590> this

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
floor like this

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.850 
floor like this
see<00:02:01.369> that's<00:02:01.939> nothing<00:02:02.299> hard<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.689> it<00:02:03.049> next<00:02:03.740> I

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
see that's nothing hard to it next I

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.600 
see that's nothing hard to it next I
adjust<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.490> little<00:02:04.640> bit<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.200> it<00:02:06.200> can

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
adjust a little bit so that it can

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.390 
adjust a little bit so that it can
properly<00:02:07.780> go<00:02:08.780> like<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:10.660> okay<00:02:12.069> we<00:02:13.069> got<00:02:13.250> it

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
properly go like this okay we got it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.080 
properly go like this okay we got it
working<00:02:13.550> now

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
working now

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.190 
working now
our<00:02:14.500> next<00:02:15.500> step<00:02:15.770> is<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:18.220> put<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.250> we<00:02:19.430> board<00:02:19.730> on

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
our next step is to put the we board on

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.160 
our next step is to put the we board on
and<00:02:21.200> we<00:02:21.440> do<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:21.950> then<00:02:22.370> just<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.850> just<00:02:23.420> right

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
and we do it and then just a just right
