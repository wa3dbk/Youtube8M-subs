exciting time for jailbreakers we are
going<00:06:06.789> to<00:06:06.880> reach<00:06:07.060> even<00:06:07.210> new<00:06:07.510> utility<00:06:07.870> it's

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
going to reach even new utility it's

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.260 
going to reach even new utility it's
just<00:06:08.620> a<00:06:08.710> matter<00:06:08.889> of<00:06:09.070> for<00:06:09.370> which<00:06:09.520> version<00:06:10.090> and

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
just a matter of for which version and
