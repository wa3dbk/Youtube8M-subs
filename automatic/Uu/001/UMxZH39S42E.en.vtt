00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hi friends welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.960
 Bistro learned and is heading Kissin paws 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.360
 which I share with you helpful 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.360
 recipes and talk about nutrition 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.110
 in this issue I will tell you how 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.350
 make tasty and healthy jelly from 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.269
 amino acids ie without e of amino acids 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.610
 these are the building elements of which 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.500
 all proteins and the body are made up and they 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.649
 perform functions such as acceleration 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.360
 protein synthesis energy source 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.610
 suppress catabolism and fat burning 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.559
 for this recipe you will need a lot 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.440
 simple ingredients namely this 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.680
 I have no amino acids from their companies 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.489
 am still called amino max and taste 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.780
 called tropical fruit mousse 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.170
 Frankly, why did I decide 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.270
 make jelly from amino acids because i 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.570
 bought in separate acids they are terrible 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.759
 bitter in order not to waste 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.520
 where amino acids do not throw them away 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.229
 keep yourself drinking this bitter liquid 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.119
 then I decided to make something out of it 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.729
 jelly on jelly 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.770
 the next ingredient is bone place 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.130
 sugar and a little sweeten our jelly 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.649
 well, the last ingredient is gelatin from me 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.530
 gelatin immediately with the taste of sweet cherry sometimes 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.590
 still take with taste strawberry stock 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.790
 raspberries i usually like that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.010
 berry but principle you can 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.500
 use the simplest gelatin i 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.750
 He expressed one in which if you go there 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:53.440
 with the addition of doct, I choose this to 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.970
 there was no sugar also so us 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.240
 will need a court that will pour out 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.150
 us jelly mixing spoon a glass of water 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.950
 cold and boiling water kettles and cups in 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.840
 which we will stir is desirable 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:11.970
 but all offer so the first thing we 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.640
 we do this we pour gelatin with boiling water 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:21.900
 sometimes stir literally be 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.900
 3 5 minutes to leave in this hot water 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.100
 now the pot 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.100
 pour out one and a half minutes two spoons 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.100
 amino acids 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:24.620
 and so when we are now mixed 10 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.250
 amino acids and jelly here 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.370
 you we mix it up and put it on 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.370
 slab 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.220
 even before we put on the stove 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.440
 need to add a little series here 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.440
 I will literally add a spoon 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.970
 now on the stove we bring this up 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.310
 boil 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.290
 but do not boil and just bring to 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.440
 boiling stirring all this time in order 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.120
 to have a good time melted 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.340
 amino acids because they are still day on 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.750
 surface on that Misha I stir and she 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.750
 everything 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.750
 dissolve 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:32.180
 we all brought to a boil a couple more times and 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:35.889
 mix and turn everything off and now everyone 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.889
 pour it all into a plate 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:56.690
 everything and now and you are sent off 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:59.080
