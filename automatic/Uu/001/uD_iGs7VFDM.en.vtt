00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
army I'll tell you why because if you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.750 
army I'll tell you why because if you
pick<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:07.830> man<00:01:07.979> army<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.310> mean<00:01:08.490> you're<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
pick one man army I mean you're going to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.100 
pick one man army I mean you're going to
pick<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> different<00:01:09.180> class<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> idea<00:01:10.049> is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
pick a different class but the idea is

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.539 
pick a different class but the idea is
to<00:01:10.229> play<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:10.860> class<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.400> whole

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
to play with this one class the whole

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.770 
to play with this one class the whole
week<00:01:11.790> long<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.390> seems<00:01:12.510> kind<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
week long so that seems kind of

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.359 
week long so that seems kind of
redundant<00:01:13.049> jump<00:01:13.439> from<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.740> class<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
redundant jump from this class to the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.429 
redundant jump from this class to the
same<00:01:14.640> class<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.390> follow<00:01:15.570> me<00:01:15.720> no<00:01:15.960> bling<00:01:16.200> perk

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
same class you follow me no bling perk

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.749 
same class you follow me no bling perk
because<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.950> makes<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> voting<00:01:17.430> really

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
because just makes the voting really

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.609 
because just makes the voting really
difficult<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.509> besides<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.229> isn't<00:01:19.439> about
