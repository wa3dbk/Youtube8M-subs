00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570

12<00:00:21.869> books<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.410> one<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> think<00:00:23.100> probably

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
12 books but this one I think probably

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.460

is<00:00:23.789> geared<00:00:24.150> more<00:00:24.210> toward<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.660> masses<00:00:25.140> perhaps

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.810 
is geared more toward the masses perhaps
some<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.920> others<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.310> you've<00:00:26.640> written

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210

well<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.240> started<00:00:30.960> using<00:00:31.320> music<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.070> my

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
well I started using music in my

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.770 
well I started using music in my
leadership<00:00:32.820> seminars<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.360> teach<00:00:33.540> leadership

leadership seminars to teach leadership

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.560 
leadership seminars to teach leadership

on the Equality of men and women and I

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.670 
on the Equality of men and women and I
thought<00:00:39.210> I'll<00:00:39.329> use<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> little<00:00:39.870> music<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:40.530> I

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
in my research on women's music I took

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.740 
in my research on women's music I took
all<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.979> top<00:01:56.189> 40<00:01:56.579> songs<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.180> women<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
all the top 40 songs of women in the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.870 
all the top 40 songs of women in the
20th<00:01:58.110> century<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.649> analyzed<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.250> lyrics<00:01:59.610> of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
20th century and analyzed the lyrics of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.359 
20th century and analyzed the lyrics of
the<00:02:00.090> music<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.689> then<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.469> developed

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the music and then I developed

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.039 
the music and then I developed
categories<00:02:03.149> followed<00:02:03.509> them<00:02:03.630> throughout<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
categories followed them throughout the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.530 
categories followed them throughout the
century<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:05.189> mapped<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.240> women's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
century and I mapped that on to women's

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.300 
century and I mapped that on to women's
progress<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> early<00:02:07.950> part<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
progress so in the early part of the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.430 
progress so in the early part of the
century<00:02:08.520> when<00:02:09.270> women<00:02:09.599> basically<00:02:10.110> had<00:02:10.259> no

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
century when women basically had no

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.110 
rights they couldn't vote men could beat
them<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120

there were two competing themes and
women's<00:04:06.549> music<00:04:06.970> one<00:04:07.720> was<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.980> cry<00:04:09.400> for<00:04:09.780> Prince

women's music one was the cry for Prince

women's music one was the cry for Prince
Charming<00:04:11.319> and<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.760> other<00:04:12.910> was<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.989> desire<00:04:14.590> a

Prince Charming to save us from

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.879 
Prince Charming to save us from
ourselves<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:20.049> think<00:04:20.079> Madonna<00:04:20.590> actually

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
ourselves and I think Madonna actually

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.680 
ourselves and I think Madonna actually
captured<00:04:21.489> both<00:04:21.669> of<00:04:21.880> those<00:04:22.000> most<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.479> the<00:04:22.570> other

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
captured both of those most of the other

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.550 
captured both of those most of the other
songs<00:04:23.050> had<00:04:23.320> one<00:04:23.560> or<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.830> other<00:04:24.030> but<00:04:25.030> her<00:04:25.270> song

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
songs had one or the other but her song

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.320 
songs had one or the other but her song
was<00:04:26.770> strong<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.730> don't<00:04:27.910> need<00:04:28.030> a<00:04:28.060> prince

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
was strong I don't need a prince

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.790 
was strong I don't need a prince
charming<00:04:28.450> but<00:04:28.900> at<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.110> same<00:04:29.290> time<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.620> words

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
charming but at the same time the words

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.670 
charming but at the same time the words
were<00:04:30.040> saying<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.430> do<00:04:30.780> so<00:04:31.780> she<00:04:31.840> had<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:32.350> all<00:04:32.470> in

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
were saying I do so she had it all in

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.740 
were saying I do so she had it all in
one<00:04:32.860> song<00:04:33.130> which<00:04:33.370> is<00:04:33.400> pretty<00:04:33.790> amazing<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.480> and

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
one song which is pretty amazing and and

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.180 
one song which is pretty amazing and and
again<00:04:35.050> I<00:04:35.080> think<00:04:35.230> that's<00:04:35.470> one<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.860> reasons

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
again I think that's one of the reasons

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.240 
again I think that's one of the reasons
it<00:04:36.310> had<00:04:36.490> such<00:04:36.700> staying<00:04:37.030> power
