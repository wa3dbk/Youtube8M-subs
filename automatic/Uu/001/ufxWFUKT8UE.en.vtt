00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.899
 Hello from Petersburg 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.970
 Today I want to congratulate everyone on 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.550
 coming catholic christmas 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.889
 merry christmas 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.279
 my friends on YouTube many viewers 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.439
 my channel live countries where 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:25.050
 catholic christmas is celebrated 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:27.599
 it is on the night of 24 to 25 I myself 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.510
 learned to celebrate christmas very much 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.340
 long ago when I was a student because 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.489
 that I studied at the institute where it was very 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.640
 many students from around the world and 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.890
 they always celebrated christmas every 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.250
 a little bit in its own way and at the same time 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.860
 equally yes therefore this holiday is for 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.170
 I have great importance already with 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.230
 young years because we celebrated 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.930
 its quite stormy though usually 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.399
 it is customary to celebrate Christmas quietly 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.339
 family circle 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.330
 but you were young students so 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.390
 we get all the same not quiet but 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.909
 today on this bright day, I want everyone 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:21.150
 wish good heat 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.909
 health happiness happiness in general all 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.560
 the fact that each person 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.710
 wants to have in this life I think that 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.500
 All of us are united by this holiday not 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.359
 only Catholics seems to me that in 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.640
 lately it began to celebrate 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:44.189
 everyone is even Chinese, that's why the world 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.189
 unites therefore the Chinese have become 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:55.259
 after all, everyone wants to live in peace 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:58.500
 together in love feel caress care 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.039
 close people and I want to wish this 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.810
 day that it was exactly so 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:08.459
 as far as my channel is concerned 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.810
 see you soon 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:16.730

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.569
