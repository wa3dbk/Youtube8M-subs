nifty little package battery life is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.020 
nifty little package battery life is
about<00:00:39.320> 4<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:41.190> 5<00:00:41.219> hours<00:00:43.670> showing<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.789> what<00:00:44.940> it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
about 4 to 5 hours showing you what it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.090 
about 4 to 5 hours showing you what it
looks<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.379> cartridge<00:00:47.039> inside

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100

power<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.309> up

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.209 

handling<00:00:58.809> with<00:00:59.019> only<00:00:59.170> one<00:00:59.440> hand<00:00:59.649> is<00:00:59.920> quite

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
handling with only one hand is quite

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:52.620 
handling with only one hand is quite
difficult<00:01:00.519> so<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.710> other<00:01:29.830> side

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.600 

laying<00:01:53.630> this<00:01:54.020> with<00:01:54.230> one<00:01:54.380> hand<00:01:54.410> is<00:01:54.890> kind<00:01:55.430> of

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
laying this with one hand is kind of

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:09.130 
laying this with one hand is kind of
complicated<00:02:03.190> as<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.250> consider<00:02:07.840> getting<00:02:08.840> into

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
complicated as you consider getting into

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.940 
complicated as you consider getting into
the<00:02:09.229> right<00:02:09.410> side<00:02:09.680> now<00:02:11.950> would<00:02:12.950> turn<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.460> off

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
the right side now would turn it off

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.100 
the right side now would turn it off
making<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.040> power<00:02:16.310> from<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:16.970> power<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.990> then

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
making it power from the power and then

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.270 
making it power from the power and then
you<00:02:18.230> can<00:02:18.380> charge<00:02:18.620> your<00:02:18.770> batteries<00:02:19.100> at<00:02:19.220> the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
you can charge your batteries at the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.940 
you can charge your batteries at the
same<00:02:19.460> time<00:02:20.350> let<00:02:21.350> me<00:02:21.440> show<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.650> what<00:02:21.860> other

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
same time let me show you what other

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:38.140 
same time let me show you what other
game<00:02:32.500> scenario<00:02:33.500> 64<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:37.640> can<00:02:37.850> see<00:02:38.000> the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
game scenario 64 so you can see the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.350 
game scenario 64 so you can see the
white<00:02:38.360> actually<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:38.960> quite<00:02:39.260> nice

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
white actually is quite nice

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.390 
white actually is quite nice
I<00:02:41.360> rather<00:02:41.900> prefer<00:02:42.140> black<00:02:42.560> but<00:02:42.950> since<00:02:43.220> the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
I rather prefer black but since the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:53.700 
I rather prefer black but since the
Commission<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:44.450> do<00:02:44.900> what<00:02:45.140> I'm<00:02:45.230> told

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:14.949 

very<00:02:54.710> responsive<00:03:11.830> that's<00:03:12.830> about<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.840> are<00:03:14.840> you

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
very responsive that's about it are you

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.660 
very responsive that's about it are you
portable<00:03:15.470> bit<00:03:16.040> wider<00:03:16.450> than<00:03:17.450> my<00:03:17.540> previous<00:03:17.989> one

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
portable bit wider than my previous one

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.630 
portable bit wider than my previous one
and<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.760> bit<00:03:19.910> less<00:03:20.630> in<00:03:20.810> height<00:03:21.100> we<00:03:22.100> saw<00:03:22.280> less<00:03:22.430> in

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
and a bit less in height we saw less in

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.820 
and a bit less in height we saw less in
thickness<00:03:22.930> loose<00:03:23.930> over<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.350> cartridge<00:03:24.680> slot

thickness loose over the cartridge slot

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.610 
thickness loose over the cartridge slot
is<00:03:25.040> not<00:03:25.190> sticking<00:03:25.520> out<00:03:25.670> since<00:03:26.660> this<00:03:26.870> is<00:03:27.080> using

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
is not sticking out since this is using

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.979 
is not sticking out since this is using
the<00:03:28.160> lithium<00:03:28.489> ion<00:03:28.790> battery<00:03:29.150> cylinders<00:03:29.750> and

not flat lithium polymer batteries so

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.390 
not flat lithium polymer batteries so
