Wardian able shattered we do the same
and<00:01:33.740> with<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:33.950> lighting<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:34.459> becomes

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
and with the lighting it becomes

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.120 
and with the lighting it becomes
chemical<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:35.749> it's<00:01:36.319> coming<00:01:36.649> from<00:01:36.740> low

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
chemical and it's coming from low

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.099 
chemical and it's coming from low
angular<00:01:37.759> places<00:01:38.149> and<00:01:38.270> it's<00:01:38.389> attacking<00:01:38.810> the

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
angular places and it's attacking the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:41.529 
angular places and it's attacking the
audience<00:01:39.529> and<00:01:39.799> it's<00:01:40.310> not<00:01:40.579> distant<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.420> from

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
behind a cloud it's artificial and

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.639 
behind a cloud it's artificial and
man-made<00:01:43.969> and<00:01:44.389> it<00:01:44.539> also<00:01:44.719> makes<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:45.200> horses

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
man-made and it also makes the horses

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.980 
man-made and it also makes the horses
translucent<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:46.789> they<00:01:47.420> suddenly<00:01:47.810> go<00:01:47.959> from

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
translucent so they suddenly go from

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.120 
translucent so they suddenly go from
there<00:01:48.289> being<00:01:48.409> these<00:01:48.590> living<00:01:48.950> breathing

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
there being these living breathing

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.620 
there being these living breathing
things<00:01:49.579> to<00:01:49.759> being<00:01:49.909> these<00:01:50.060> very<00:01:50.329> very

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
things to being these very very

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.469 
things to being these very very
vulnerable<00:01:50.899> things<00:01:51.889> I<00:01:52.279> mean<00:01:52.969> it<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.149> just<00:01:53.179> a

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
vulnerable things I mean it is just a

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.999 
vulnerable things I mean it is just a
bucket<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:53.929> piece<00:01:54.079> of<00:01:54.109> string<00:01:54.259> warhorse<00:01:54.889> I

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
bucket and a piece of string warhorse I

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.039 
bucket and a piece of string warhorse I
mean<00:01:55.130> it's<00:01:55.279> there's<00:01:55.609> nothing<00:01:55.999> to<00:01:56.509> it<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:56.840> yet

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
mean it's there's nothing to it and yet

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.859 
mean it's there's nothing to it and yet
everything<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.709> it
