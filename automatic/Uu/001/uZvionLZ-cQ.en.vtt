00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
location changing a few random things so

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.140 
location changing a few random things so
with<00:01:47.160> this<00:01:47.280> fella<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.760> seems<00:01:48.000> like

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
with this fella really seems like

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.540 
with this fella really seems like
they're<00:01:48.300> trying<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.840> remake<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.650> film<00:01:49.950> but

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
they're trying to remake the film but

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.880 
they're trying to remake the film but
there's<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.150> tone<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.200> that's<00:01:52.410> a<00:01:52.530> little<00:01:52.680> bit

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
there's a tone in it that's a little bit

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.370 
there's a tone in it that's a little bit
off<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.790> little<00:01:54.030> more<00:01:54.210> fun<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.930> silly

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
off it's a little more fun and silly

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.930 
off it's a little more fun and silly
than<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> original<00:01:56.340> which<00:01:56.490> was<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> lot<00:01:56.910> more

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
than the original which was a lot more

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.969 
than the original which was a lot more
serious<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.080> little<00:01:58.229> bit<00:01:58.350> more<00:01:58.500> dreadful

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
serious and a little bit more dreadful

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.890 
serious and a little bit more dreadful
so<00:01:59.220> this<00:01:59.369> film<00:01:59.580> sometimes<00:01:59.880> comes<00:02:00.360> off<00:02:00.600> that

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
so this film sometimes comes off that

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.240 
so this film sometimes comes off that
way<00:02:01.080> it<00:02:01.200> comes<00:02:01.380> off<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> little<00:02:01.920> cheesy

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
way it comes off a little cheesy

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.920 
way it comes off a little cheesy
sometimes<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.210> they're<00:02:03.330> still<00:02:03.600> trying<00:02:03.869> to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
sometimes but they're still trying to

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.840 
sometimes but they're still trying to
depict<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.590> same<00:02:04.619> intense<00:02:05.310> thing<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
depict the same intense thing to the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.969 
depict the same intense thing to the
original<00:02:06.300> film<00:02:06.570> did<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:07.320> they're<00:02:07.530> not<00:02:07.710> really

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
original film did but they're not really

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.889 
original film did but they're not really
going<00:02:08.429> all<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.640> way<00:02:08.670> for<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> tone<00:02:09.600> my

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
going all the way for it in the tone my

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.080 
going all the way for it in the tone my
audience<00:02:10.320> was<00:02:10.470> laughing<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.009> lot<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.910> don't

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
audience was laughing a lot and I don't

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.000 
audience was laughing a lot and I don't
think<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.959> filmmakers<00:02:13.470> were<00:02:13.620> intending

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
think that the filmmakers were intending

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.390 
think that the filmmakers were intending
for<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.310> happen

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
for that to happen

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.920 
for that to happen
little<00:02:17.400> early<00:02:17.670> anything<00:02:18.360> that's<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.750> way<00:02:18.840> we

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
little early anything that's the way we

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.390 
little early anything that's the way we

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
do things around here you get used to it

okay thank you guys all right
the<00:02:24.780> real<00:02:24.930> problem<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.380> this<00:02:25.500> movie<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
the real problem of this movie is the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.740 
the real problem of this movie is the
tone<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.340> think<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.120> trying<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.450> depict

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
tone I think that it's trying to depict

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.920 
tone I think that it's trying to depict
really<00:02:28.710> intense<00:02:29.190> serious<00:02:29.850> events<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.720> would

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
really intense serious events that would

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.230 
really intense serious events that would
traumatize<00:02:31.200> your<00:02:31.980> average<00:02:32.310> person<00:02:32.610> but<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
traumatize your average person but the

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.830 
traumatize your average person but the
tone<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.810> film<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:34.440> kind<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.070> fun<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:36.480> and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
tone of the film is kind of fun like and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.420 
tone of the film is kind of fun like and
so<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.320> doesn't<00:02:37.620> really<00:02:37.710> it<00:02:38.040> doesn't<00:02:38.190> really

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
so it doesn't really it doesn't really

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.190 
so it doesn't really it doesn't really
mesh<00:02:38.700> well<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.510> when<00:02:39.630> these<00:02:39.720> really<00:02:40.050> bad

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
mesh well and so when these really bad

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.900 
mesh well and so when these really bad
things<00:02:40.500> are<00:02:40.650> happening<00:02:40.790> sometimes<00:02:41.790> the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
things are happening sometimes the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.310 
things are happening sometimes the
audience<00:02:42.060> was<00:02:42.450> actually<00:02:42.810> laughing<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:43.230> little

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
audience was actually laughing a little

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.570 
audience was actually laughing a little
bit<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.920> think<00:02:44.100> it's<00:02:44.220> because<00:02:44.460> the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
bit and I think it's because the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.520 
bit and I think it's because the
audience<00:02:44.820> couldn't<00:02:45.180> really<00:02:45.330> tell<00:02:45.720> or<00:02:46.050> decide

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
audience couldn't really tell or decide

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.620 
audience couldn't really tell or decide
what<00:02:47.220> tone<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.610> filmmakers<00:02:48.060> are<00:02:48.150> going<00:02:48.390> for

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
what tone the filmmakers are going for

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.810 
what tone the filmmakers are going for
were<00:02:48.810> they<00:02:48.990> pear<00:02:49.530> eating<00:02:49.800> themselves<00:02:49.980> were

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.390 
were they pear eating themselves were
they<00:02:51.000> being<00:02:51.330> really<00:02:52.050> silly<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.500> purpose<00:02:52.950> or

biggest problems with this movie because

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.370 
biggest problems with this movie because

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
them and then never spoken of again

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.570 
them and then never spoken of again
never<00:03:42.930> discussed<00:03:43.440> again<00:03:43.740> never<00:03:44.040> hinted<00:03:44.310> at

never discussed again never hinted at

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.360 
never discussed again never hinted at
again<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.420> much<00:03:45.540> potential<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.410> in<00:03:46.800> two<00:03:47.100> scenes

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
again so much potential is in two scenes

again so much potential is in two scenes
in<00:03:47.550> this<00:03:47.640> movie<00:03:47.700> for<00:03:48.180> some<00:03:48.660> serious<00:03:49.110> dramatic

effect for something that just happened

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.030 
effect for something that just happened
but<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> filmmakers<00:03:52.140> just<00:03:52.320> disregard

even<00:04:48.919> though<00:04:49.010> some<00:04:49.220> of<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.370> things<00:04:49.520> that

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
even though some of the things that

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.460 
even though some of the things that
happened<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.090> was<00:04:50.210> like<00:04:50.240> it<00:04:51.080> doesn't<00:04:51.380> make

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
happened I was like it doesn't make

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.650

sense<00:04:51.500> also<00:04:52.070> without<00:04:52.580> spoiling<00:04:52.970> anything<00:04:53.360> at

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
sense also without spoiling anything at
