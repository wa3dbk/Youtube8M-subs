00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.960 

and<00:03:00.680> if<00:03:01.680> it's<00:03:01.980> if<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:02.790> find<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:04.970> if

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
and if it's if you find that it's not if

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.320 
and if it's if you find that it's not if
it<00:03:06.690> seems<00:03:06.959> Matt<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.760> sparkles<00:03:09.209> are

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
it seems Matt and like the sparkles are

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.259 
it seems Matt and like the sparkles are
going<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.540> come<00:03:09.720> off<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.930> glitter<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:11.430> just

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
going to come off the glitter and just

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.509 
going to come off the glitter and just
go<00:03:12.450> over<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:12.810> with<00:03:12.930> your<00:03:13.140> glaze<00:03:13.410> or<00:03:13.799> mod<00:03:14.129> podge

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.940 

I'm<00:03:17.519> gonna<00:03:17.870> drive<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.500> my<00:03:19.709> heat<00:03:19.920> gun

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
I'm gonna drive this with my heat gun

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:32.120 
I'm gonna drive this with my heat gun
real<00:03:20.340> quick<00:03:30.290> we<00:03:31.290> got<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.530> be<00:03:31.590> careful<00:03:31.620> when<00:03:32.010> you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
real quick we got to be careful when you

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.680 
real quick we got to be careful when you
drive<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.549> heat<00:03:32.730> gun<00:03:32.910> because<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.450> paint

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
drive the heat gun because the paint

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.830 
drive the heat gun because the paint
will<00:03:33.810> bubble<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.180> don't<00:03:36.360> want<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.630> keep

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
will bubble so you don't want to keep

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.589 
will bubble so you don't want to keep
the<00:03:36.989> heat<00:03:37.200> on<00:03:37.230> one<00:03:37.620> area<00:03:38.060> unless<00:03:39.060> that's<00:03:39.510> the

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
the heat on one area unless that's the

00:03:39.599 --> 00:04:05.270 
the heat on one area unless that's the
hook<00:03:39.870> you're<00:03:40.049> gone

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.300 

to<00:04:06.280> see<00:04:06.519> how<00:04:06.640> it's<00:04:06.819> all<00:04:06.939> sparkly<00:04:07.859> now<00:04:08.859> if<00:04:09.129> it's

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
to see how it's all sparkly now if it's

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.640 
to see how it's all sparkly now if it's
not<00:04:09.549> shiny<00:04:09.909> enough<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.450> probably<00:04:11.230> didn't<00:04:11.560> add

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
not shiny enough I probably didn't add

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.839 
not shiny enough I probably didn't add
enough<00:04:11.680> glaze<00:04:12.159> just<00:04:12.519> because<00:04:12.819> I<00:04:12.849> was<00:04:14.849> mixing

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
add glaze to half and mod podge to the

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.580 
add glaze to half and mod podge to the
other<00:04:21.400> half<00:04:21.639> just<00:04:21.850> so<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.090> can<00:04:22.180> see<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:23.560> you

other half just so you can see and you

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.840

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
if you're making this in like a bottle

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.189 
if you're making this in like a bottle
or<00:04:29.530> something<00:04:30.660> so<00:04:31.660> I'm<00:04:31.750> going<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:31.930> put<00:04:32.020> the

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
or something so I'm going to put the

or something so I'm going to put the
glaze<00:04:32.440> on<00:04:32.800> this<00:04:33.039> side<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:39.370> this<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.849> sparkle

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:50.960 
glaze on this side and this is sparkle
play<00:04:40.449> so<00:04:40.690> it's<00:04:40.840> going<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.050> add<00:04:41.229> extra<00:04:42.990> sparkle

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.860 

but<00:04:51.970> just<00:04:52.180> look<00:04:52.300> at<00:04:52.360> this<00:04:52.509> scene<00:04:52.840> that's

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
but just look at this scene that's

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.070 
but just look at this scene that's
pretty<00:04:53.770> much<00:04:53.889> what<00:04:54.280> that's<00:04:54.940> for<00:04:55.389> is<00:04:55.539> to<00:04:55.750> seal

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
pretty much what that's for is to seal

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.140 
pretty much what that's for is to seal
it

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:10.550

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
this at joann's in the paint section and

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:33.050 
this at joann's in the paint section and
this<00:05:13.770> is<00:05:14.040> just<00:05:14.190> plain<00:05:15.000> old<00:05:15.240> gloss<00:05:16.200> mod<00:05:16.620> podge

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.950 

ok<00:05:34.060> so<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.629> side<00:05:34.900> I<00:05:35.349> use<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:36.900> sparkle<00:05:37.900> glaze

and then this side modge podge so that

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.330 
and then this side modge podge so that
mod<00:05:43.389> podge<00:05:43.740> so<00:05:46.169> it's<00:05:47.169> pretty<00:05:47.349> easy<00:05:47.469> to<00:05:47.800> make

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
mod podge so it's pretty easy to make
