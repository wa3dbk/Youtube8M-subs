00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
the other stores and make sure that we

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.320

do have a good variety and while I'm
doing<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:05.810> I'm<00:03:06.020> also<00:03:06.550> sending<00:03:07.550> images<00:03:08.060> to

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
doing this I'm also sending images to

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.590 
doing this I'm also sending images to
the<00:03:09.020> editor<00:03:09.410> of<00:03:09.580> looks<00:03:10.580> that<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.910> think<00:03:11.360> will

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
the editor of looks that I think will

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.660 
the editor of looks that I think will
work<00:03:11.630> for<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:12.320> given<00:03:12.590> trend<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.190> then<00:03:13.370> she

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
work for the given trend and then she

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.430 
work for the given trend and then she
can<00:03:13.880> give<00:03:14.030> me<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.450> thumbs<00:03:14.690> up<00:03:14.870> for<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.230> thumbs

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
can give me the thumbs up for the thumbs

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.790 
can give me the thumbs up for the thumbs
down<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.580> by<00:03:17.090> doing<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:18.050> ensure<00:03:18.770> that

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
down and so by doing that I ensure that

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.160 
down and so by doing that I ensure that
she's<00:03:19.430> gonna<00:03:19.580> be<00:03:19.670> relatively<00:03:20.420> happy<00:03:20.600> she's

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
she's gonna be relatively happy she's

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.040 
she's gonna be relatively happy she's
not<00:03:21.350> gonna<00:03:21.500> be<00:03:21.680> surprised<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:23.840> can

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
not gonna be surprised and it can

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.990 
not gonna be surprised and it can
streamline<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.950> amount<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.280> stuff<00:03:25.640> that<00:03:25.670> I'm

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.030 
streamline the amount of stuff that I'm
pulling<00:03:26.270> which<00:03:26.660> is<00:03:26.840> good<00:03:27.080> because<00:03:27.320> again<00:03:27.770> I'm

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
pulling which is good because again I'm

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.400 
pulling which is good because again I'm
pulling<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.430> lot<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:28.880> looks<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:29.870> want<00:03:30.350> to

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
pulling a lot of looks so I want to

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.100 
pulling a lot of looks so I want to
streamline<00:03:30.739> as<00:03:31.250> much<00:03:31.580> as<00:03:31.820> possible<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:32.989> I'm

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
streamline as much as possible so I'm

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.250 
streamline as much as possible so I'm
not<00:03:33.290> bringing<00:03:33.650> way<00:03:34.100> more<00:03:34.370> than<00:03:34.550> I<00:03:34.580> need

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
not bringing way more than I need

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.960 
not bringing way more than I need
so<00:03:36.260> once<00:03:36.590> I've<00:03:36.739> pulled<00:03:37.010> from<00:03:37.250> all<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.640> stores

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970
