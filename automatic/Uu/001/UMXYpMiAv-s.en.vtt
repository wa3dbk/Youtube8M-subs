00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello to everyone then 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.190
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.299
 video a little bit special since I 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.850
 do not go to an application 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:18.150
 for iphone or ipod touch but a 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.650
 function of the ipod nano so that's the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.100
 fifth generation so whoever has 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.740
 a camera at the back and so we're going 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.690
 go in video camera 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 so that 's just my movie 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.840
 office and so the little tip that I 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.230
 wanted to show you this is if you 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.969
 keep pressing the center button 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 here we have a menu with different modes 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.280
 video that is displayed so we can 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.069
 go down 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.839
 so we do not have any more effect 

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:45.030
 that I like it is cyborg anc au 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.149
 can it give a little effect enough 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.339
 cool so we can record the videos 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.409
 facing normal rest only needed 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.190
 had to have the idea to press the 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.440
 central button 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.719
 and so here I discovered that there is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.879
 not very long so there she was 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.729
 several effects so that's 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.739
 color effects after we have effects 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.649
 rather geometric effects I'll go 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.960
 eg in kaleidoscope therefore its 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.780
 form triangles so here I can 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.899
 put my hand in front of that I'm going 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:21.030
 put my iphone in front here are the 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.149
 facts there he is not really a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.990
 top but hey we're going to say about a 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:34.979
 dozen etf and I think of the effect 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:36.899
 swirls so here's for those who 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.640
 in fifth generation ipod nano 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.450
 Well, I'll let you discover the rest 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.799
 effects and so here we are 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.630
