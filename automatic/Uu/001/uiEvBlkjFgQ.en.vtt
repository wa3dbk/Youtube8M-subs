00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
first here is the HBO Go app this is

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.520 
first here is the HBO Go app this is
actually<00:00:48.360> one<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.570> those<00:00:48.840> aren't<00:00:49.170> running<00:00:49.320> on

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
actually one of those aren't running on

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.979 
actually one of those aren't running on
iOS<00:00:49.680> 5<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.030> basically<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.390> companion

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
iOS 5 and this is basically a companion

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.709 
iOS 5 and this is basically a companion
app<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.829> HBO<00:00:53.520> subscription<00:00:54.090> service<00:00:54.510> so

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
app for the HBO subscription service so

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.630 
app for the HBO subscription service so

on<00:01:35.100> iOS<00:01:35.700> devices<00:01:36.090> essentially<00:01:37.049> what<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
on iOS devices essentially what this is

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.469 
on iOS devices essentially what this is
it's<00:01:37.619> kind<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> central<00:01:38.310> repository<00:01:38.490> for

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
it's kind of a central repository for

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.690 
it's kind of a central repository for
all<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.900> your<00:01:40.049> logins<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.680> passwords<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.610> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
there like the codes if you're like me

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.670 
there like the codes if you're like me
you<00:01:45.210> got<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> lot<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.570> passwords<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.530> lot<00:01:46.649> of

these<00:01:49.500> sites<00:01:49.710> seem<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.100> forcing<00:01:50.610> their

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
these sites seem to be forcing their

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.060 
these sites seem to be forcing their
little<00:01:50.970> rules<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.799> personally<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.860> feel

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
all these rules like has to be so many

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.209 
all these rules like has to be so many
characters<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.619> one<00:01:55.740> capital

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
characters you have to have one capital

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.950 
characters you have to have one capital
letter<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:56.670> two<00:01:56.880> numbers<00:01:57.270> or<00:01:57.540> start<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
letter or two numbers or start with a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.749 
letter or two numbers or start with a
number<00:01:58.170> star<00:01:58.469> thing<00:01:58.680> actually<00:01:59.159> makes<00:01:59.490> things

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
number star thing actually makes things

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.340 
number star thing actually makes things
worse<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.719> can<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.960> perfectly

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
worse because you can have a perfectly

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.830 
worse because you can have a perfectly
acceptable<00:02:01.500> password<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.520> by<00:02:03.119> making<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.630> do

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
acceptable password but by making you do

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.179 
acceptable password but by making you do
these<00:02:04.020> rules<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.530> makes<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:04.920> kind<00:02:05.159> of

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
these rules it makes you do kind of

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.980 
these rules it makes you do kind of
stupid<00:02:05.549> things<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.630> know<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.810> use

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
stupid things like you know to use

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.359 
stupid things like you know to use
Dumber<00:02:07.229> passwords<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.829> guess<00:02:07.979> her<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.310> start

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
Dumber passwords I guess her we start

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.550 
Dumber passwords I guess her we start
writing<00:02:08.849> things<00:02:08.879> down<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.660> non-secure<00:02:10.319> way

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
writing things down in a non-secure way

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.650 
writing things down in a non-secure way
so<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.250> password<00:02:11.459> keeps<00:02:11.790> track<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.180> also

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
so one password keeps track of it also

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.030 
so one password keeps track of it also
lies

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
lies

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.039

use<00:02:13.129> some<00:02:13.340> kind<00:02:13.519> of<00:02:13.610> higher-level<00:02:14.049> passwords

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
use some kind of higher-level passwords

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.720 
use some kind of higher-level passwords
that<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.290> don't<00:02:15.439> have<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.769> remember<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.610> what

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
read it anywhere in my leisure and I

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.460 
read it anywhere in my leisure and I
kind<00:03:44.329> of<00:03:44.359> like<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.599> digital<00:03:44.930> format<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.319> little

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
kind of like the digital format a little

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.719 
kind of like the digital format a little
bit<00:03:45.560> there<00:03:45.680> on<00:03:45.769> the<00:03:45.859> magazine<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.370> think<00:03:46.549> just

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:46.729 
bit there on the magazine I think just

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.640 
bit there on the magazine I think just
makes<00:03:46.909> a<00:03:47.000> little<00:03:47.150> bit<00:03:47.329> easier<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.930> similar<00:03:48.500> to

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
makes a little bit easier and similar to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.649 
makes a little bit easier and similar to
that<00:03:48.739> is<00:03:48.979> wired<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:50.000> same<00:03:50.030> issue<00:03:50.329> with<00:03:50.479> their

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659

the<00:06:14.600> just<00:06:14.960> look<00:06:15.080> at<00:06:15.200> the<00:06:15.289> radar<00:06:15.470> necessarily

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
the just look at the radar necessarily

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.760 
the just look at the radar necessarily
as<00:06:16.190> no<00:06:16.310> forecast<00:06:16.729> data<00:06:16.940> but<00:06:17.270> great<00:06:18.140> for<00:06:18.320> storm

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
as no forecast data but great for storm

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.260 
as no forecast data but great for storm
tracking<00:06:19.130> that<00:06:19.370> seems<00:06:19.640> to<00:06:19.729> be<00:06:19.760> what<00:06:19.970> really<00:06:20.240> a

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270
