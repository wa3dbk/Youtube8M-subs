it would have your code and everything
in<00:03:25.580> there<00:03:25.790> okay<00:03:26.560> there's<00:03:27.560> your<00:03:27.769> regular<00:03:28.220> price

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
in there okay there's your regular price

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.130 
in there okay there's your regular price
and<00:03:28.940> in<00:03:29.060> this<00:03:29.209> case<00:03:29.450> we're<00:03:29.660> gonna<00:03:29.720> put<00:03:30.049> in

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
and in this case we're gonna put in

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.680 
and in this case we're gonna put in
let's<00:03:30.380> say<00:03:30.530> $25<00:03:31.489> again<00:03:31.760> don't<00:03:32.000> put<00:03:32.239> in<00:03:32.390> any

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
let's say $25 again don't put in any

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.410 
let's say $25 again don't put in any
currency<00:03:33.310> symbol<00:03:34.310> because<00:03:34.580> that's<00:03:34.790> added<00:03:35.180> for

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
currency symbol because that's added for

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.699 
currency symbol because that's added for
you<00:03:35.510> automatically<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.380> get<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.680> choose

that do you want a sale price on it and

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.229 
that do you want a sale price on it and
you<00:03:39.980> can<00:03:40.190> do<00:03:40.310> this<00:03:40.459> in<00:03:40.670> dollars<00:03:41.090> or

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
that we're not going to feature it so

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.780 
that we're not going to feature it so
that's<00:04:12.260> good<00:04:12.500> now<00:04:12.709> we<00:04:12.769> go<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.070> advanced

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
that's good now we go to advanced

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
that you could have a couple of items

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.940 
that you could have a couple of items
that<00:04:21.790> aren't<00:04:22.030> taxable<00:04:22.690> say<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:22.960> food<00:04:23.320> item<00:04:23.530> I

know in British Columbia and Canada is
not<00:04:26.020> taxable<00:04:26.620> for<00:04:27.040> instance<00:04:27.340> so<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:27.580> might

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
not taxable for instance so you might

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.310

have that

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.130 
have that
then<00:04:29.800> what<00:04:30.190> kind<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.520> classes<00:04:31.180> it<00:04:31.360> in<00:04:31.510> for<00:04:32.020> your

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
with that later wait in dimensions now

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.370 
with that later wait in dimensions now
these<00:04:39.730> become<00:04:40.120> very<00:04:40.150> important<00:04:40.780> for<00:04:40.960> shipping

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
these become very important for shipping

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.920 
these become very important for shipping
I<00:04:41.500> know<00:04:41.560> for<00:04:41.890> example<00:04:42.340> with<00:04:42.490> Canada<00:04:42.970> Post<00:04:43.000> they

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
I know for example with Canada Post they

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.380 
I know for example with Canada Post they
only<00:04:44.320> work<00:04:44.890> through<00:04:45.340> their<00:04:45.490> automated<00:04:46.000> system

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
only work through their automated system

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.750 
only work through their automated system
using<00:04:46.840> weights<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.440> dimensions<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.340> they

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
using weights and dimensions and they

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.990 
using weights and dimensions and they
have<00:04:49.030> to<00:04:49.270> be<00:04:49.480> in<00:04:49.810> metric<00:04:50.680> okay<00:04:51.610> so<00:04:51.670> you<00:04:51.820> would

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
have to be in metric okay so you would

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.150 
have to be in metric okay so you would
select<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:52.510> in<00:04:52.930> your<00:04:53.200> settings<00:04:53.650> in<00:04:53.860> G<00:04:54.040> go

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
select that in your settings in G go

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160 
select that in your settings in G go
shop<00:04:54.430> and<00:04:54.640> then<00:04:55.390> this<00:04:55.630> is<00:04:55.810> where<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.050> would

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
shop and then this is where you would

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.020 
shop and then this is where you would
fill<00:04:56.470> in<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.800> weight<00:04:56.980> the<00:04:57.370> length<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.850> width

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
fill in the weight the length the width

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.870 
fill in the weight the length the width
and<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.360> height<00:04:58.390> and<00:04:58.780> so<00:04:58.990> on<00:04:59.760> visibility<00:05:00.760> this

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
and the height and so on visibility this

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.790 
and the height and so on visibility this
is<00:05:01.060> kind<00:05:01.270> of<00:05:01.390> handy<00:05:01.750> I'm<00:05:01.990> not<00:05:02.170> sure<00:05:02.410> exactly

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
is kind of handy I'm not sure exactly

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.610 
is kind of handy I'm not sure exactly
how<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.460> would<00:05:03.670> use<00:05:03.880> this<00:05:04.090> like<00:05:04.810> typically<00:05:05.410> if

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
how you would use this like typically if

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.290 
how you would use this like typically if
it's<00:05:05.800> in<00:05:05.920> my<00:05:05.950> catalog<00:05:06.460> I'd<00:05:06.790> want<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.150> be

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
it's in my catalog I'd want it to be
