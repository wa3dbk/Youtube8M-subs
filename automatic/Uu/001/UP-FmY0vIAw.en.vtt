00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
I think I'll focus more on the Spanish

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.510 
I think I'll focus more on the Spanish
all<00:03:36.790> right<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:37.120> mean<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.660> my<00:03:37.780> turn<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:41.740> the<00:03:42.340> skip
