that you're going to be finishing and
also<00:00:45.870> you're<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.160> about<00:00:47.340> your

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
also you're going to think about your

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.090 
also you're going to think about your
arms<00:00:47.640> being<00:00:48.059> fully<00:00:48.329> engaged<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.110> wide<00:00:49.410> you

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.900 
want to make sure that your arms don't
sink<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.440> well<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:52.739> your<00:00:52.860> chest<00:00:53.129> because

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
sink in as well as your chest because

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.729 
sink in as well as your chest because
then<00:00:54.120> you'll<00:00:54.480> spin<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:55.350> sorts<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
then you'll spin in all sorts of

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.799 
then you'll spin in all sorts of
directions<00:00:55.910> it's<00:00:56.910> also<00:00:57.120> important<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.629> you

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
directions it's also important that you

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.170 
directions it's also important that you
try<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.170> about<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:59.340> towards<00:00:59.969> that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
try to think about going towards that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.700 
try to think about going towards that
direction<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.170> talked<00:01:01.379> about<00:01:01.500> in

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
direction just as we talked about in

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.990 
direction just as we talked about in
pique<00:01:02.010> turns<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.460> want<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> make<00:01:02.760> sure<00:01:02.879> they

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
pique turns you want to make sure they

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.329 
pique turns you want to make sure they
are<00:01:03.090> always<00:01:03.239> stepping<00:01:03.780> ahead<00:01:03.899> not<00:01:04.799> off<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
are always stepping ahead not off to the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.980 
are always stepping ahead not off to the
side<00:01:05.549> because<00:01:05.850> wherever<00:01:06.299> you're<00:01:06.420> stepping<00:01:06.869> is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
side because wherever you're stepping is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.200 
side because wherever you're stepping is
where<00:01:07.200> you're<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.770> going<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.150> I'm

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
going to demonstrate on a very basic

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.420 
going to demonstrate on a very basic
level<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.299> action<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:13.100> Shelly<00:01:14.100> turns

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
fast I'm also going to show it just by

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.929 
fast I'm also going to show it just by
flipping<00:01:27.119> front<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.380> back<00:01:28.590> front<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.460> back

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
flipping front to back front to back

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
to back movement is good at creating

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
to back movement is good at creating
speed<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.369> also<00:01:35.549> helping<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> fluidity

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
speed and also helping with the fluidity

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.319 
speed and also helping with the fluidity
of<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.110> movement<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:38.189> demonstrating<00:01:38.850> the

flip<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.100> flip<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:57.950> it's<00:01:58.950> very<00:01:59.160> good<00:01:59.370> even<00:01:59.850> if

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
flip and flip and it's very good even if

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.910 
flip and flip and it's very good even if
you<00:02:00.060> are<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> professional<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:01.170> practice<00:02:01.770> that

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
every once in a while it's good because

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.450 
every once in a while it's good because
it<00:02:03.930> engages<00:02:04.050> your<00:02:04.470> back<00:02:04.650> as<00:02:04.830> I<00:02:04.950> said<00:02:05.130> earlier

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
and it's a very simple version but it

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859 
and it's a very simple version but it
can<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.160> very<00:02:08.340> effective<00:02:08.580> I'm<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:09.509> going<00:02:09.720> to
