00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
understood this one but I think it comes

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.469 
understood this one but I think it comes
from<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> misconception<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.119> higher

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
from the misconception that higher

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.810 
from the misconception that higher
octane<00:01:24.990> gas<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.619> more<00:01:25.860> combustive<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
octane gas is more combustive and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.969 
octane gas is more combustive and
therefore<00:01:27.540> gives<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.530> for<00:01:28.950> a

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
therefore gives you more go for a

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.760 
therefore gives you more go for a
droplet<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.460> fuel<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:30.030> fact<00:01:30.810> higher<00:01:31.290> octane

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
droplet of fuel in fact higher octane

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
droplet of fuel in fact higher octane
fuel<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.220> actually<00:01:32.610> less<00:01:33.119> likely<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.780> detonate

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
fuel is actually less likely to detonate

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.380 
fuel is actually less likely to detonate
and<00:01:34.409> therefore<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.189> has<00:01:35.220> no<00:01:35.430> impact<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.880> mpg

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and therefore it has no impact on mpg
