00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.850 
Morisset needs to see what they're doing
I<00:01:54.950> think<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.789> jump<00:01:56.179> in<00:01:56.420> 7th<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:57.110> 8th<00:01:57.319> is<00:01:57.619> that

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
I think the jump in 7th to 8th is that

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.929 
I think the jump in 7th to 8th is that
there's<00:01:58.039> a<00:01:58.099> little<00:01:58.189> bit<00:01:58.399> more<00:01:58.579> independent

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
there's a little bit more independent

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.240 
there's a little bit more independent
work<00:01:59.569> you<00:02:00.079> know<00:02:00.229> as<00:02:00.289> Brooks<00:02:00.560> said<00:02:00.799> we<00:02:01.099> get

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
work you know as Brooks said we get

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.370 
work you know as Brooks said we get
something<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.610> do<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:01.819> Friday<00:02:02.020> they<00:02:03.020> have<00:02:03.229> to

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
something to do on Friday they have to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.929 
something to do on Friday they have to
now<00:02:03.530> start<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.039> do<00:02:04.159> those<00:02:04.310> things<00:02:04.579> that<00:02:04.670> they

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
now start to do those things that they

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.990 
now start to do those things that they
had<00:02:05.090> really<00:02:05.360> done<00:02:05.509> in<00:02:05.689> class<00:02:06.429> on<00:02:07.429> their<00:02:07.819> own

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
had really done in class on their own

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.419 
had really done in class on their own
but<00:02:08.390> then<00:02:08.539> with<00:02:08.750> checks<00:02:09.049> from<00:02:09.319> teachers<00:02:09.769> so<00:02:10.399> I

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
but then with checks from teachers so I

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.710 
but then with checks from teachers so I
think<00:02:10.519> there's<00:02:10.819> gonna<00:02:10.940> be<00:02:11.030> some<00:02:11.150> variability

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
think there's gonna be some variability

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.420 
think there's gonna be some variability
but<00:02:12.049> also<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.560> in<00:02:12.709> terms<00:02:12.769> of<00:02:13.040> thinking<00:02:13.220> about

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
but also just in terms of thinking about

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.120 
but also just in terms of thinking about
middle<00:02:13.880> school<00:02:13.959> it's<00:02:14.959> teaching<00:02:15.500> those<00:02:15.709> skills

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
middle school it's teaching those skills

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.590 
middle school it's teaching those skills
