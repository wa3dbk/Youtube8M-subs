back when we taped our first experiment
with<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.770> abusive<00:02:50.400> boyfriend<00:02:50.640> we<00:02:51.600> told<00:02:51.810> our

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
with that abusive boyfriend we told our

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.130 
with that abusive boyfriend we told our
actors<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.560> trade<00:02:52.890> places<00:02:53.130> for<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:54.030> one<00:02:54.300> take

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.170 

why<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.800> later<00:02:59.130> brought<00:02:59.430> bystanders

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
why and later brought bystanders

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.570 
why and later brought bystanders
together<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:01.050> talk<00:03:01.350> about<00:03:01.620> what<00:03:01.980> they've<00:03:02.220> seen

together to talk about what they've seen

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.490 
together to talk about what they've seen
my<00:03:03.300> first<00:03:03.600> thought<00:03:03.780> was<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:03.960> he<00:03:04.140> must<00:03:04.380> have

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
my first thought was that he must have

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:16.190 
my first thought was that he must have
cheated<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:11.250> don't<00:03:11.520> buy<00:03:12.230> exactly<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:15.200> now

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
cheated you don't buy exactly and now

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.160 
cheated you don't buy exactly and now
over<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.190> over<00:03:17.640> again<00:03:17.790> when<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.600> victim<00:03:19.020> is<00:03:19.140> a

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
over and over again when the victim is a

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.090 
over and over again when the victim is a
man<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:20.160> many<00:03:20.460> women<00:03:20.820> perceive<00:03:21.750> him<00:03:22.020> as<00:03:22.100> guilty

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
man so many women perceive him as guilty

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.230 
man so many women perceive him as guilty
I<00:03:23.510> figured<00:03:24.510> while<00:03:24.630> he<00:03:24.750> probably<00:03:24.990> deserved<00:03:25.590> it

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
I figured while he probably deserved it

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.880 
I figured while he probably deserved it
