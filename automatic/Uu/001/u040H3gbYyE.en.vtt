a<00:00:11.130> step<00:00:11.280> back<00:00:11.550> bus<00:00:12.420> not<00:00:12.660> modern<00:00:12.900> warfare<00:00:13.049> 3<00:00:13.230> I

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
a step back bus not modern warfare 3 I

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.039 
a step back bus not modern warfare 3 I
was<00:00:13.590> running<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.950> l<00:00:14.130> 86<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.570> thermal

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.019 
was running the l 86 with the thermal
and<00:00:17.000> I<00:00:18.000> think<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.080> was<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.439> maybe<00:00:20.400> rapid<00:00:20.880> fire

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029

people like people said you know maybe

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.370 
people like people said you know maybe
it's<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> length<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> videos<00:01:10.200> which

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
it's just the length of the videos which

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.630 
it's just the length of the videos which
is<00:01:10.530> very<00:01:10.710> true<00:01:10.890> that's<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.159> very<00:01:11.549> good

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
is very true that's a very good

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.320 
is very true that's a very good
possibility<00:01:12.320> however<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:15.030> know<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.270> just

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
possibility however you know it's just

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.850 
possibility however you know it's just
for<00:01:15.600> me<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.960> easier<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.830> to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
for me it's just easier to not have to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.800
