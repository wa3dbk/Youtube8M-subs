00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
little more pressure on one end to keep

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.929 
little more pressure on one end to keep
a<00:01:57.960> nice<00:01:59.600> you<00:02:00.600> know<00:02:00.750> straight<00:02:01.729> straight<00:02:02.729> dough

this<00:05:28.699> is<00:05:28.910> basically<00:05:29.360> where<00:05:29.660> you're<00:05:30.470> going<00:05:30.590> to

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
this is basically where you're going to

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.370 
this is basically where you're going to
start<00:05:30.979> your<00:05:31.160> tight<00:05:31.460> roll<00:05:31.789> okay<00:05:32.510> and<00:05:32.780> you<00:05:33.169> kind

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
start your tight roll okay and you kind

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.159 
start your tight roll okay and you kind
of<00:05:33.470> want<00:05:33.680> to<00:05:34.030> make<00:05:35.030> a<00:05:35.060> tight<00:05:35.389> roll<00:05:35.690> because

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
of want to make a tight roll because

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.260 
of want to make a tight roll because
when<00:05:36.440> we<00:05:36.590> slice<00:05:36.889> it<00:05:37.160> you<00:05:37.370> kind<00:05:37.910> of<00:05:38.000> want<00:05:38.180> the

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
when we slice it you kind of want the

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.050 
when we slice it you kind of want the
layers<00:05:38.479> to<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:39.320> pinwheel<00:05:39.710> layers<00:05:40.550> to<00:05:40.849> stick

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
layers to the pinwheel layers to stick

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.089 
layers to the pinwheel layers to stick
together<00:05:41.240> and<00:05:41.990> if<00:05:42.530> you've<00:05:42.650> got<00:05:42.770> a<00:05:42.830> lot<00:05:43.070> of

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
together and if you've got a lot of

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.310 
together and if you've got a lot of
space<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:43.580> a<00:05:43.880> gap<00:05:44.090> between<00:05:44.330> it<00:05:44.720> it's<00:05:45.139> gonna<00:05:45.260> be

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
space and a gap between it it's gonna be

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.920 
space and a gap between it it's gonna be
hard<00:05:45.650> for<00:05:45.740> them<00:05:45.949> to<00:05:46.010> stick<00:05:46.220> together<00:05:46.400> so<00:05:46.930> once

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
hard for them to stick together so once

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.560 
hard for them to stick together so once
we<00:05:48.080> get<00:05:48.169> it<00:05:48.289> about<00:05:48.440> halfway<00:05:48.740> up<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:50.240> we'll<00:05:50.479> be

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
we get it about halfway up and we'll be

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.969 
we get it about halfway up and we'll be
able<00:05:50.690> to<00:05:50.840> take<00:05:51.050> it<00:05:51.260> and<00:05:51.530> we're<00:05:51.710> just<00:05:51.770> going<00:05:51.949> to

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
able to take it and we're just going to

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:58.330 
able to take it and we're just going to
roll<00:05:52.220> it<00:05:53.080> all<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:54.560> way<00:05:55.570> all<00:05:56.570> the<00:05:56.630> way<00:05:56.900> up<00:05:57.340> okay

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
roll it all the way all the way up okay

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.879 
roll it all the way all the way up okay
now<00:05:59.090> what<00:05:59.270> we're<00:05:59.419> gonna<00:05:59.510> do<00:05:59.810> is<00:06:00.620> we're<00:06:00.800> going

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
now what we're gonna do is we're going

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.510 
now what we're gonna do is we're going
to<00:06:00.979> take<00:06:01.099> a<00:06:01.130> little<00:06:01.340> bit<00:06:01.490> of<00:06:01.610> this<00:06:01.669> mustard<00:06:03.520> and

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
to take a little bit of this mustard and

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.260 
to take a little bit of this mustard and
we're<00:06:05.150> gonna<00:06:05.240> put<00:06:05.479> it<00:06:05.510> on<00:06:05.659> the<00:06:05.780> edge<00:06:07.270> the

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
we're gonna put it on the edge the

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.060 
we're gonna put it on the edge the
reason<00:06:08.510> I<00:06:08.570> didn't<00:06:08.780> brush<00:06:08.990> this<00:06:09.199> before<00:06:09.680> is<00:06:09.949> if

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
reason I didn't brush this before is if

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.360 
reason I didn't brush this before is if
I<00:06:10.190> needed<00:06:10.430> to<00:06:10.610> unroll<00:06:11.000> it<00:06:11.889> I'd<00:06:12.889> be<00:06:13.130> able<00:06:13.280> to

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
I needed to unroll it I'd be able to

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.310 
I needed to unroll it I'd be able to
unroll<00:06:13.789> it<00:06:13.820> once<00:06:14.180> if<00:06:14.389> I<00:06:14.510> brush<00:06:14.780> this<00:06:14.990> mustard

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
unroll it once if I brush this mustard

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.290 
unroll it once if I brush this mustard
all<00:06:15.500> the<00:06:15.650> way<00:06:15.740> up<00:06:15.949> once<00:06:16.580> the<00:06:16.760> mustard<00:06:17.180> is

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
all the way up once the mustard is

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.000 
all the way up once the mustard is
attached<00:06:17.599> to<00:06:17.900> it<00:06:18.020> it's<00:06:18.199> not<00:06:18.380> gonna<00:06:18.560> unroll

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
attached to it it's not gonna unroll

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.689 
attached to it it's not gonna unroll
okay<00:06:19.669> so<00:06:20.330> this<00:06:20.539> just<00:06:21.159> this<00:06:22.159> just<00:06:22.220> helps<00:06:22.639> to

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:22.699 
okay so this just this just helps to

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.089 
okay so this just this just helps to
keep<00:06:22.849> a<00:06:23.030> smooth<00:06:23.300> seam<00:06:23.710> for<00:06:24.710> the<00:06:24.830> finished

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
keep a smooth seam for the finished

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.670 
keep a smooth seam for the finished
product<00:06:25.490> so<00:06:26.020> we're<00:06:27.020> going<00:06:27.110> to<00:06:27.169> brush<00:06:27.409> it<00:06:27.560> with

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
product so we're going to brush it with

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.270 
product so we're going to brush it with
the<00:06:27.800> mustard<00:06:29.020> and<00:06:30.020> then<00:06:30.770> basically<00:06:31.099> what

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
the mustard and then basically what

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.260 
the mustard and then basically what
we're<00:06:31.400> going<00:06:31.490> to<00:06:31.550> do<00:06:31.729> is<00:06:31.820> we're<00:06:31.970> just<00:06:32.000> going<00:06:32.180> to
