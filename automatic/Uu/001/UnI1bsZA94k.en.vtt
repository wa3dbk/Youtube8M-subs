the record button and then I record a
little<00:01:31.200> something<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.980> then<00:01:32.070> maybe<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.460> want

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
little something and then maybe I want

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.800 
little something and then maybe I want
to<00:01:33.290> cut<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.500> video<00:01:34.640> but<00:01:35.640> maintain<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.540> same

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
to cut the video but maintain the same

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.510 
to cut the video but maintain the same
contiguous<00:01:37.560> file<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.430> going<00:01:38.940> to<00:01:39.060> hit<00:01:39.210> pause

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
contiguous file I going to hit pause

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.000 
contiguous file I going to hit pause
simply<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.730> it<00:01:42.300> does<00:01:42.600> not<00:01:42.780> stop<00:01:43.230> recording<00:01:43.650> I

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
simply and it does not stop recording I

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.380 
simply and it does not stop recording I
mean<00:01:44.220> what<00:01:44.340> stops<00:01:44.580> recording<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.270> does

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
mean what stops recording but it does

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.020 
mean what stops recording but it does
not<00:01:45.570> switch<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> new<00:01:46.800> file<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.490> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
not switch to a new file so it it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.440 
not switch to a new file so it it
contiguously<00:01:48.930> records<00:01:49.680> my<00:01:50.070> next<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:51.210> tap

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
contiguously records my next my tap

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.530 
contiguously records my next my tap
record<00:01:51.630> over<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.640> that<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.120> it<00:01:54.390> will

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
record over here that you know it will

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
think it has to do with the fact that

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.080 
think it has to do with the fact that
Samsung<00:05:44.330> uses<00:05:45.289> a<00:05:45.320> minimal<00:05:45.770> amount<00:05:45.860> of<00:05:46.250> metals

brick<00:06:11.630> feel<00:06:11.870> like<00:06:12.320> something<00:06:12.800> like<00:06:12.860> a

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
brick feel like something like a

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.290
