half this summer so I just recently got
a<00:04:34.490> fixed<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.270> this<00:04:35.540> is<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.780> first<00:04:35.810> gameplay

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260

a fixed and this is the first gameplay
that<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.680> got<00:04:36.950> it's<00:04:37.430> not<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.760> best<00:04:37.940> gameplay<00:04:38.240> I

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
that I got it's not the best gameplay I

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.570 
that I got it's not the best gameplay I
believe<00:04:38.930> I<00:04:39.050> go<00:04:39.200> 33<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:39.920> seven<00:04:39.980> or<00:04:40.400> something

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.080 
believe I go 33 and seven or something
but<00:04:41.080> it's<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.230> pretty<00:04:42.410> good<00:04:42.620> gameplay<00:04:43.040> I<00:04:43.250> kinda
