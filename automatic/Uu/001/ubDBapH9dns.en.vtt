than some of the puns that we had when

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.659 
than some of the puns that we had when
JJ<00:00:16.450> was<00:00:16.630> here<00:00:16.869> it's<00:00:17.290> so<00:00:17.560> bad<00:00:17.830> that<00:00:18.130> it<00:00:18.310> went<00:00:18.490> all

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:18.669 
JJ was here it's so bad that it went all

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.700 
JJ was here it's so bad that it went all
the<00:00:18.700> way<00:00:18.789> around<00:00:19.240> but<00:00:19.720> it<00:00:19.869> didn't<00:00:20.169> quite<00:00:20.380> make

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
the way around but it didn't quite make

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.580 
the way around but it didn't quite make
it<00:00:20.770> back<00:00:21.130> into<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.580> good<00:00:21.789> oh<00:00:22.060> it's<00:00:23.019> just<00:00:23.260> bad

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
it back into the good oh it's just bad

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.830 
it back into the good oh it's just bad
it's<00:00:23.859> like<00:00:23.980> really<00:00:24.849> bad<00:00:24.880> late<00:00:25.359> night<00:00:25.570> stuff

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
it's like really bad late night stuff

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.470 
it's like really bad late night stuff
you<00:00:25.929> would<00:00:26.050> see<00:00:26.199> on<00:00:26.230> USA<00:00:26.859> in<00:00:27.070> like<00:00:27.220> the<00:00:27.369> 90s

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.590 

it's<00:00:34.480> one<00:00:34.809> click<00:00:35.170> away<00:00:35.320> for<00:00:36.250> like<00:00:36.489> ShamWow

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.640 

they<00:00:40.600> said<00:00:40.809> with<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.049> ridiculous

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
they said with the ridiculous

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.340 
they said with the ridiculous
headset<00:00:42.129> and<00:00:42.400> the<00:00:42.760> jaw<00:00:42.970> line<00:00:43.239> cuz<00:00:43.690> you've<00:00:44.199> got

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
headset and the jaw line cuz you've got

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.670 
headset and the jaw line cuz you've got
the<00:00:44.500> jaw<00:00:44.680> line<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:46.510> just<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.780> beer<00:00:46.930> let's

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
the jaw line it's just the beer let's

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.070 
the jaw line it's just the beer let's
talk<00:00:47.799> about<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.100> eight<00:00:48.220> in<00:00:48.460> 6800<00:00:49.390> k<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.960> new

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
talk about the eight in 6800 k the new

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.899 
talk about the eight in 6800 k the new
richland<00:00:50.470> part<00:00:50.680> from<00:00:50.860> AMD<00:00:51.129> and<00:00:51.430> it<00:00:51.489> looks<00:00:51.670> just

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
richland part from AMD and it looks just

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.320 
richland part from AMD and it looks just
like<00:00:52.089> the<00:00:52.239> AMD<00:00:52.690> 5800<00:00:53.500> k<00:00:53.790> almost<00:00:54.790> just<00:00:54.970> like<00:00:55.059> it

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
like the AMD 5800 k almost just like it

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.869 
like the AMD 5800 k almost just like it
in<00:00:55.479> fact<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:56.530> it<00:00:57.189> looks<00:00:57.400> like<00:00:57.460> they<00:00:57.640> used<00:00:57.790> the

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
in fact it it looks like they used the

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.250 
in fact it it looks like they used the
same<00:00:58.000> is<00:00:58.119> still<00:00:58.269> 32<00:00:58.629> nanometer<00:00:59.229> a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
same is still 32 nanometer a

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.500 
same is still 32 nanometer a
manufacturing<00:00:59.860> process<00:01:00.100> still<00:01:01.030> left<00:01:01.180> them<00:01:01.330> to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
manufacturing process still left them to

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.740 
manufacturing process still left them to
and<00:01:01.689> it<00:01:02.080> still<00:01:02.320> is<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.589> 100<00:01:03.220> watt<00:01:03.309> TDP<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.510> what

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
and it still is a 100 watt TDP so what

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.600 
and it still is a 100 watt TDP so what
has<00:01:04.839> changed<00:01:04.869> with<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.530> 6800<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.250> why<00:01:06.340> is<00:01:06.400> it

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
has changed with the 6800 and why is it

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.399 
has changed with the 6800 and why is it
a<00:01:06.670> little<00:01:07.150> bit<00:01:07.330> faster<00:01:07.720> when<00:01:08.020> you<00:01:08.080> compare<00:01:08.350> it

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
a little bit faster when you compare it

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.749 
a little bit faster when you compare it
to<00:01:08.439> the<00:01:08.560> 58<00:01:08.830> under<00:01:09.009> case<00:01:09.159> if<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.369> get<00:01:09.460> under<00:01:09.609> k

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759

to the 58 under case if you get under k
base<00:01:10.420> clock<00:01:10.630> is<00:01:10.780> 3.8<00:01:11.320> and<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.679> turbo<00:01:11.979> clock<00:01:12.159> is

giving<00:01:17.619> us<00:01:17.740> just<00:01:17.859> a<00:01:17.979> little<00:01:18.009> bit<00:01:18.280> better

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
giving us just a little bit better

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.130 
giving us just a little bit better
performance<00:01:18.909> to<00:01:19.299> justify<00:01:19.659> that<00:01:19.719> a<00:01:19.869> little<00:01:20.049> bit

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
performance to justify that a little bit

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.569 
performance to justify that a little bit
bigger<00:01:20.320> price<00:01:20.590> tag<00:01:20.619> you<00:01:21.100> also<00:01:21.249> get<00:01:21.399> a<00:01:21.429> little

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
bigger price tag you also get a little

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.609 
bigger price tag you also get a little
bit<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:21.939> bump<00:01:22.119> on<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.359> GPU<00:01:22.630> yeah<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:23.409> here's

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
bit of a bump on the GPU yeah and here's

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:24.450 
bit of a bump on the GPU yeah and here's
the<00:01:23.740> way<00:01:23.859> that<00:01:23.979> what<00:01:24.070> they've<00:01:24.219> done<00:01:24.340> here

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
the way that what they've done here

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.429 
the way that what they've done here
umbels<00:01:24.880> did<00:01:25.060> yeah<00:01:25.179> the<00:01:25.270> GPU<00:01:25.570> clock<00:01:25.780> is<00:01:26.020> up<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.409> a

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
umbels did yeah the GPU clock is up to a

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.770 
umbels did yeah the GPU clock is up to a
44<00:01:27.130> versus<00:01:27.460> 800<00:01:27.850> now<00:01:28.749> and<00:01:29.020> also<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:30.600> ddr3<00:01:31.600> well

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
44 versus 800 now and also the ddr3 well

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.989 
44 versus 800 now and also the ddr3 well
you<00:01:32.109> can<00:01:32.259> use<00:01:32.409> maximum<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:33.159> 21<00:01:33.399> 33<00:01:33.819> megahertz

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
you can use maximum of 21 33 megahertz

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:36.239 
you can use maximum of 21 33 megahertz
ddr3<00:01:34.719> or<00:01:35.319> you<00:01:35.439> can<00:01:35.560> overclock<00:01:35.829> a<00:01:35.920> little<00:01:36.159> bit

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249 
ddr3 or you can overclock a little bit

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:38.370 
ddr3 or you can overclock a little bit
we<00:01:36.369> did<00:01:36.549> overclock<00:01:36.969> some<00:01:37.240> we<00:01:38.020> did<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.200> video

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
we did overclock some we did a video

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.679 
we did overclock some we did a video

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
for you to watch in fact I wish I was

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.989 
for you to watch in fact I wish I was
you<00:01:47.109> guys<00:01:47.289> so<00:01:47.439> I<00:01:47.499> could<00:01:47.619> watch<00:01:47.770> it<00:01:47.799> and<00:01:48.399> not<00:01:48.670> be

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
you guys so I could watch it and not be

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.989 
you guys so I could watch it and not be
in<00:01:49.119> it<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.389> don't<00:01:50.200> anyway<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:51.100> forgot<00:01:51.789> I<00:01:51.939> was

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
in it I don't anyway I forgot I was

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:53.370 
in it I don't anyway I forgot I was
talking<00:01:52.149> about<00:01:52.359> oh<00:01:52.420> yeah<00:01:52.569> so<00:01:52.719> what<00:01:53.049> makes<00:01:53.200> this

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
talking about oh yeah so what makes this

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.559 
talking about oh yeah so what makes this
better<00:01:54.189> than<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.460> 58<00:01:54.819> under<00:01:54.969> Kate<00:01:55.119> other<00:01:55.329> than

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
better than the 58 under Kate other than

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.169 
better than the 58 under Kate other than
the<00:01:55.719> slight<00:01:55.990> bump<00:01:56.229> up<00:01:56.469> and<00:01:57.369> in<00:01:57.759> speed<00:01:57.999> some

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
the slight bump up and in speed some

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:59.429 
the slight bump up and in speed some
people<00:01:58.359> thought<00:01:58.479> maybe<00:01:58.719> it's<00:01:58.929> just<00:01:59.079> you<00:01:59.319> know

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
people thought maybe it's just you know

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.770 
people thought maybe it's just you know
a<00:01:59.469> nice<00:01:59.770> Bend<00:02:00.209> 5,800<00:02:01.209> K<00:02:01.359> well<00:02:01.539> it's<00:02:01.659> actually

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
a nice Bend 5,800 K well it's actually

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.529 
a nice Bend 5,800 K well it's actually
not<00:02:02.130> because<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.729> voltage<00:02:04.030> regulation

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
not because the the voltage regulation

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.569 
not because the the voltage regulation
process<00:02:04.959> is<00:02:05.319> a<00:02:05.350> little<00:02:05.530> bit<00:02:05.679> different<00:02:06.130> now

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
process is a little bit different now

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:07.980 
process is a little bit different now
with<00:02:06.639> the<00:02:06.819> 5800<00:02:07.359> K<00:02:07.479> sometimes<00:02:07.689> you'll<00:02:07.929> be

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
with the 5800 K sometimes you'll be

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.719 
with the 5800 K sometimes you'll be
playing<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.319> video<00:02:08.530> game<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.250> APU<00:02:09.610> would

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
playing a video game and the APU would

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.820 
playing a video game and the APU would
be<00:02:09.880> like<00:02:10.090> hey<00:02:10.690> there's<00:02:11.020> a<00:02:11.080> hundred<00:02:11.319> watts<00:02:11.500> I

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
be like hey there's a hundred watts I

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.830 
be like hey there's a hundred watts I
want<00:02:12.160> all<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.610> power<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:13.000> need<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.450> all<00:02:13.570> and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
want all the power I need it all and

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.530 
want all the power I need it all and
then<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.380> quad-core<00:02:15.330> portion<00:02:16.330> of

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
then the the the quad-core portion of

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.869 
then the the the quad-core portion of
the<00:02:16.660> CPU

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
the CPU

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.309 
the CPU
that's<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.629> noise<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.959> would<00:02:19.049> make<00:02:19.140> it'd<00:02:19.260> be

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
that's the noise it would make it'd be

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.559 
that's the noise it would make it'd be
like<00:02:19.439> hey<00:02:19.620> you've<00:02:20.489> got<00:02:20.640> all<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.849> power<00:02:20.999> I<00:02:21.359> have

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
like hey you've got all the power I have

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.520 
like hey you've got all the power I have
no<00:02:21.840> power

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
no power

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.839 
no power
I<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:23.099> no<00:02:23.340> power<00:02:23.609> I'm<00:02:24.060> dying<00:02:25.099> I'm<00:02:26.099> dying<00:02:26.129> even

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
I have no power I'm dying I'm dying even

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.399 
I have no power I'm dying I'm dying even
though<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.150> was<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.329> quad-core<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.959> was<00:02:28.079> it<00:02:28.319> was

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
though it was a quad-core it was it was

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.000 
though it was a quad-core it was it was
terrible

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
terrible

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.429 
terrible
yeah<00:02:29.249> well<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:30.150> power<00:02:30.359> management<00:02:30.900> was<00:02:31.260> it's

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
yeah well the power management was it's

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.709 
yeah well the power management was it's
not<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:32.040> bad<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.579> it<00:02:32.700> was<00:02:32.819> not<00:02:33.329> as<00:02:33.480> good<00:02:33.599> as

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
not that bad but it was not as good as

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.709 
not that bad but it was not as good as
it<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.109> 6800<00:02:34.620> case<00:02:34.769> 6800<00:02:35.670> K<00:02:35.819> seemed<00:02:36.629> to

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
it is on the 6800 case 6800 K seemed to

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.089 
it is on the 6800 case 6800 K seemed to
be<00:02:36.810> more<00:02:36.989> intelligent<00:02:37.439> when<00:02:37.530> one<00:02:37.739> requests

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
be more intelligent when one requests

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.860 
be more intelligent when one requests
power<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:38.489> like<00:02:38.609> let<00:02:38.909> me<00:02:39.000> evenly<00:02:39.359> distribute

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
power it's like let me evenly distribute

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.780 
power it's like let me evenly distribute
things<00:02:40.079> you<00:02:40.290> know<00:02:40.409> so<00:02:40.650> that's<00:02:40.769> that's<00:02:41.609> where

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
things you know so that's that's where

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.160 
things you know so that's that's where
was<00:02:41.879> a<00:02:41.909> pleasant<00:02:42.359> surprise<00:02:42.510> from<00:02:43.109> the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
was a pleasant surprise from the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.080 
was a pleasant surprise from the
benchmarking<00:02:43.799> yeah<00:02:44.159> so<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:44.760> then<00:02:44.819> also

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
benchmarking yeah so that and then also

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.780 
benchmarking yeah so that and then also
helps<00:02:45.299> them<00:02:45.419> keep<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.049> hundred<00:02:46.319> watt<00:02:46.439> TDP

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
helps them keep that hundred watt TDP

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.039 
helps them keep that hundred watt TDP
now<00:02:47.790> also<00:02:48.030> with<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.239> platform<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:48.840> one

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
now also with this platform this one

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.659 
now also with this platform this one
really<00:02:49.230> just<00:02:49.650> crushed<00:02:49.889> all<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.099> records<00:02:50.519> with

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
really just crushed all the records with

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.940 
really just crushed all the records with
overclocking<00:02:51.239> they<00:02:51.719> hit<00:02:51.900> over<00:02:52.319> eight

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
overclocking they hit over eight

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.369 
overclocking they hit over eight
gigahertz<00:02:53.669> over<00:02:54.150> eight<00:02:54.299> with<00:02:54.900> all<00:02:55.079> cores

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
gigahertz over eight with all cores

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.349 
gigahertz over eight with all cores
enabled<00:02:55.769> that's<00:02:56.280> pretty<00:02:56.549> ridiculous<00:02:56.909> crazy

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
enabled that's pretty ridiculous crazy

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:58.729 
enabled that's pretty ridiculous crazy
so<00:02:57.900> they've<00:02:58.079> changed<00:02:58.139> the<00:02:58.500> way<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
so they've changed the way the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.020 
so they've changed the way the
overclocking<00:02:59.129> works<00:02:59.459> in<00:02:59.609> this<00:02:59.699> one<00:02:59.849> whereas

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
overclocking works in this one whereas

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.140 
overclocking works in this one whereas
before<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:00.540> was<00:03:00.599> based<00:03:00.840> upon<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:02.150> wattage

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
before it was based upon the the wattage

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.939 
before it was based upon the the wattage
you<00:03:03.269> know<00:03:03.389> you<00:03:03.449> hit<00:03:03.689> a<00:03:03.719> certain<00:03:03.930> wattage<00:03:04.739> your

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:04.949 
you know you hit a certain wattage your

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.439 
you know you hit a certain wattage your
cutoff<00:03:05.219> that's<00:03:05.549> all<00:03:05.639> you<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:05.909> well<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.269> one

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:06.449 
cutoff that's all you get well this one

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.780 
cutoff that's all you get well this one
is<00:03:06.569> based<00:03:06.810> upon<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.590> temperature<00:03:07.889> so<00:03:08.280> as<00:03:08.489> long

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
is based upon the temperature so as long

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.009 
is based upon the temperature so as long
as<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:09.090> temperatures<00:03:09.449> low<00:03:09.599> enough<00:03:09.780> yeah<00:03:09.930> you

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
as the temperatures low enough yeah you

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:10.789 
as the temperatures low enough yeah you
can<00:03:10.199> have<00:03:10.290> some<00:03:10.409> more<00:03:10.469> power

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
can have some more power

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.289 
can have some more power
hope<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.370> don't<00:03:11.459> melt<00:03:11.639> your<00:03:11.790> motherboard<00:03:12.060> up

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
hope you don't melt your motherboard up

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.129 
hope you don't melt your motherboard up
you<00:03:12.389> know<00:03:12.480> what<00:03:12.569> you're<00:03:12.689> doing<00:03:12.840> hope<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.049> have

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
you know what you're doing hope you have

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.270 
you know what you're doing hope you have
a<00:03:13.199> decent<00:03:13.530> motherboard<00:03:13.859> so<00:03:13.980> if<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.159> have<00:03:14.250> a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
a decent motherboard so if you have a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.339 
a decent motherboard so if you have a
really<00:03:14.519> good<00:03:14.639> motherboard<00:03:15.060> with<00:03:15.719> a<00:03:15.750> decent

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
really good motherboard with a decent

really good motherboard with a decent
power<00:03:16.439> phase<00:03:16.739> design<00:03:17.129> and<00:03:17.459> also<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.969> want<00:03:18.120> to

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
power phase design and also you want to

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.729 
power phase design and also you want to
get<00:03:18.299> make<00:03:18.480> sure<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.629> have<00:03:18.719> a<00:03:18.750> thick<00:03:19.049> PCB<00:03:19.590> you

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
get make sure you have a thick PCB you

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:20.809 
get make sure you have a thick PCB you
can<00:03:19.889> really<00:03:20.099> push<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.400> hell<00:03:20.519> out<00:03:20.669> of<00:03:20.699> this

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
can really push the hell out of this

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.580 
can really push the hell out of this
thing<00:03:21.030> just<00:03:21.060> get<00:03:21.299> some<00:03:21.449> good<00:03:21.599> cooling<00:03:21.810> some

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
thing just get some good cooling some

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.839 
thing just get some good cooling some
liquid<00:03:22.859> nitrogen<00:03:23.159> you<00:03:23.340> know<00:03:23.430> just<00:03:23.609> sit<00:03:23.729> there

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
liquid nitrogen you know just sit there

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.009 
liquid nitrogen you know just sit there
and<00:03:23.939> pour<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.209> on<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.479> entire<00:03:24.720> time<00:03:24.900> you're

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
and pour it on the entire time you're

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.259 
and pour it on the entire time you're
gaming<00:03:25.259> this<00:03:25.829> switch<00:03:26.129> from<00:03:26.430> TDP<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.150> the

gaming this switch from TDP to the

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.490 
gaming this switch from TDP to the
temperature<00:03:27.629> base<00:03:27.780> it's<00:03:28.049> probably<00:03:28.319> going<00:03:28.439> to

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
temperature base it's probably going to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.740 
temperature base it's probably going to
matter<00:03:28.680> more<00:03:28.949> for<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.310> next<00:03:29.519> generation

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
matter more for the next generation

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.599 
matter more for the next generation
APU<00:03:31.349> but<00:03:31.799> we<00:03:32.040> thought<00:03:32.159> it<00:03:32.280> was<00:03:32.340> interesting

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
APU but we thought it was interesting

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.789 
APU but we thought it was interesting
that<00:03:32.939> they<00:03:33.269> explicitly<00:03:34.049> said<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.500> was<00:03:34.709> one

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
that they explicitly said that was one

you know we want to deliver some nice

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.670 
you know we want to deliver some nice
gameplay<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.209> we're<00:03:51.329> gonna<00:03:51.419> use<00:03:51.509> the<00:03:51.659> 660<00:03:52.379> 800

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680

gameplay so we're gonna use the 660 800
K<00:03:52.799> for<00:03:52.979> that<00:03:53.009> and<00:03:53.459> then<00:03:53.729> we're<00:03:53.819> going<00:03:53.939> to<00:03:53.970> do<00:03:54.090> a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
K for that and then we're going to do a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.390 
K for that and then we're going to do a
separate<00:03:54.419> system<00:03:54.750> with<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.900> 6300<00:03:55.769> that's<00:03:55.919> not

nice if you do get an 810 6800 K and you

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:13.360 
nice if you do get an 810 6800 K and you
decide<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.669> use<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.939> onboard<00:04:12.120> video<00:04:12.509> and

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
decide to use the onboard video and

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.289 
decide to use the onboard video and
let's<00:04:14.370> say<00:04:14.459> like<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.639> year<00:04:14.939> or<00:04:15.000> two<00:04:15.090> from<00:04:15.239> now

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
let's say like a year or two from now

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.969 
let's say like a year or two from now
you<00:04:15.419> want<00:04:15.629> upgrade<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:15.989> graphics<00:04:16.380> card<00:04:16.440> do

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
you want upgrade to a graphics card do

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.060 
you want upgrade to a graphics card do
not<00:04:17.250> worry<00:04:17.969> the<00:04:18.239> quad<00:04:18.539> core<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:18.989> quite<00:04:19.380> capable

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
not worry the quad core is quite capable

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.039 
not worry the quad core is quite capable
and<00:04:20.789> it<00:04:20.940> will<00:04:21.090> be<00:04:21.209> able<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.449> keep<00:04:21.570> up<00:04:21.719> with<00:04:21.840> some

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
and it will be able to keep up with some

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.959 
and it will be able to keep up with some
of<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.229> fastest<00:04:22.770> quad<00:04:22.979> cores<00:04:23.280> out<00:04:23.460> there<00:04:23.789> when

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
of the fastest quad cores out there when

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.730 
of the fastest quad cores out there when
you<00:04:24.060> add<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.240> dedicated<00:04:24.690> graphics<00:04:24.960> card<00:04:25.409> in

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
you add a dedicated graphics card in

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.790 
you add a dedicated graphics card in
gaming<00:04:26.310> in<00:04:26.430> productivity<00:04:27.150> no<00:04:27.900> in<00:04:28.169> rendering

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
gaming in productivity no in rendering

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.800 
gaming in productivity no in rendering
no<00:04:29.610> but<00:04:30.000> in<00:04:30.270> gaming

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
no but in gaming

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.410 
no but in gaming
since<00:04:31.200> it's<00:04:31.350> mostly<00:04:31.500> gonna<00:04:31.830> be<00:04:31.980> done<00:04:32.820> on<00:04:33.030> the

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
since it's mostly gonna be done on the

since it's mostly gonna be done on the
graphics<00:04:33.900> card<00:04:34.370> you'll<00:04:35.370> be<00:04:35.490> okay<00:04:35.850> I<00:04:36.060> mean<00:04:36.360> it

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
graphics card you'll be okay I mean it

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.850 
graphics card you'll be okay I mean it
still<00:04:36.600> won't<00:04:36.690> be<00:04:36.810> quite<00:04:37.020> as<00:04:37.050> fast<00:04:37.290> as<00:04:37.410> a<00:04:37.500> 300

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
still won't be quite as fast as a 300

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.400 
still won't be quite as fast as a 300
hour<00:04:37.920> CPU<00:04:38.370> but<00:04:38.490> it's<00:04:38.639> not<00:04:38.820> gonna<00:04:39.000> be<00:04:39.210> half<00:04:40.169> as

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
hour CPU but it's not gonna be half as

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.310 
hour CPU but it's not gonna be half as
fast<00:04:40.650> it'll<00:04:40.889> be<00:04:41.040> like<00:04:41.690> it's<00:04:42.690> almost<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.139> same

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
fast it'll be like it's almost the same

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.320 
fast it'll be like it's almost the same
speed<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.830> really<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.220> it's<00:04:44.430> ridiculous<00:04:44.940> we

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
speed it really is it's ridiculous we

did some very terrible things we we put
a<00:04:47.370> very<00:04:47.669> expensive<00:04:48.150> GPU<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.020> just<00:04:49.230> to<00:04:49.290> see

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
a very expensive GPU and just to see

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.470 
a very expensive GPU and just to see
what<00:04:49.530> would<00:04:49.650> happen<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.160> actually<00:04:50.310> 780<00:04:51.000> it

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
what would happen and it actually 780 it

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.330 
what would happen and it actually 780 it
was<00:04:51.600> actually<00:04:51.900> crazy<00:04:52.230> yeah<00:04:52.710> it's<00:04:52.860> almost<00:04:53.100> the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
was actually crazy yeah it's almost the

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.950 
was actually crazy yeah it's almost the
same<00:04:53.460> speed<00:04:53.700> so<00:04:53.910> if<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.419> guys<00:04:54.540> want<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.810> see

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
same speed so if you guys want to see

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.600 
same speed so if you guys want to see
those<00:04:55.200> results<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:55.800> yell<00:04:55.980> and<00:04:56.100> scream<00:04:56.250> about

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
those results and yell and scream about

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.490 
those results and yell and scream about
them<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:57.120> depends<00:04:57.389> of<00:04:57.480> the<00:04:57.570> game<00:04:57.720> -<00:04:58.050> yeah<00:04:58.440> it

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
them it depends of the game - yeah it

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.930 
them it depends of the game - yeah it
does<00:04:58.650> depend<00:04:58.950> on<00:04:58.980> the<00:04:59.040> game<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.669> ones<00:04:59.820> that

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
does depend on the game the ones that

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.490 
does depend on the game the ones that
are<00:05:00.030> more<00:05:00.150> CPU<00:05:00.480> intensive<00:05:00.690> are<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.080> little<00:05:01.290> bit

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
are more CPU intensive are a little bit

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.610 
are more CPU intensive are a little bit
like<00:05:01.770> e<00:05:02.720> they're<00:05:03.720> much<00:05:03.930> more<00:05:04.110> sketchy

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
like e they're much more sketchy

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.560 
like e they're much more sketchy
yeah<00:05:05.100> but<00:05:05.280> games<00:05:05.640> like<00:05:05.820> Bioshock<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.480> are

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
yeah but games like Bioshock that are

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.360 
yeah but games like Bioshock that are
not<00:05:06.780> that<00:05:06.960> CPU<00:05:07.380> intensive<00:05:07.590> they<00:05:07.890> rely<00:05:08.130> a<00:05:08.160> lot

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
not that CPU intensive they rely a lot

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.550 
not that CPU intensive they rely a lot
on<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:09.750> graphics<00:05:10.110> card<00:05:10.290> Unreal

video is that if you stretch you
actually<00:05:47.580> could<00:05:47.729> get<00:05:47.880> it<00:05:48.000> under<00:05:48.180> 399<00:05:49.010> yeah<00:05:50.010> you

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
actually could get it under 399 yeah you

actually could get it under 399 yeah you
really<00:05:50.310> could<00:05:50.520> I<00:05:50.550> mean<00:05:50.729> we<00:05:50.820> use<00:05:50.970> like

really could I mean we use like
extremely<00:05:52.080> high<00:05:52.260> quality<00:05:52.590> components<00:05:52.740> you

extremely high quality components you

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.070 
extremely high quality components you
can<00:05:53.190> get<00:05:53.370> about<00:05:53.490> the<00:05:53.580> same<00:05:53.640> speed<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.360> cut<00:05:55.050> a

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
can get about the same speed and cut a

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.850 
can get about the same speed and cut a
couple<00:05:55.229> corners<00:05:55.460> and<00:05:56.460> you'll<00:05:56.880> be<00:05:56.940> just<00:05:57.090> fine
