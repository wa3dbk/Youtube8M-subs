00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.770 
pretty good let me show you another spot
for<00:04:22.039> own<00:04:22.600> gas<00:04:23.600> station<00:04:25.300> this<00:04:26.300> is<00:04:26.449> probably<00:04:26.630> the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
for own gas station this is probably the

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.100 
for own gas station this is probably the
most<00:04:26.870> dangerous<00:04:27.259> spot<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:27.919> play<00:04:28.900> ok<00:04:29.900> because

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
most dangerous spot to play ok because

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.140 
most dangerous spot to play ok because
you're<00:04:30.380> going<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.530> have<00:04:30.650> your<00:04:30.800> back<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.759> ru

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
you're going to have your back to the ru

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.529 
you're going to have your back to the ru
base<00:04:32.389> so<00:04:32.780> if<00:04:32.870> they're<00:04:33.050> heli<00:04:33.259> spawns<00:04:34.539> you're

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
base so if they're heli spawns you're

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.710 
base so if they're heli spawns you're
going<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.720> need<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.960> react<00:04:36.289> quickly<00:04:36.650> and<00:04:37.720> the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
going to need to react quickly and the

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.260 
going to need to react quickly and the
spot<00:04:38.990> is<00:04:39.020> actually<00:04:39.470> behind<00:04:39.590> these<00:04:39.860> rocks<00:04:40.270> so

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
spot is actually behind these rocks so

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.770 
spot is actually behind these rocks so
if<00:04:41.330> there's<00:04:41.509> tanks<00:04:41.900> here<00:04:42.169> or<00:04:42.500> whatever<00:04:43.490> just

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
if there's tanks here or whatever just

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.409 
if there's tanks here or whatever just
hide<00:04:44.780> behind<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.110> rocks<00:04:45.319> fly<00:04:46.280> around<00:04:46.430> switch

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
hide behind the rocks fly around switch

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.210 
hide behind the rocks fly around switch
it<00:04:47.569> up<00:04:47.660> maybe<00:04:47.900> you<00:04:48.050> can<00:04:48.169> fly<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.410> that<00:04:48.680> spot<00:04:48.949> get

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
it up maybe you can fly to that spot get

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.730 
it up maybe you can fly to that spot get
a<00:04:49.250> better<00:04:49.490> angle<00:04:50.139> but<00:04:51.139> that's<00:04:51.319> pretty<00:04:51.500> much<00:04:51.620> it

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
a better angle but that's pretty much it

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.670
