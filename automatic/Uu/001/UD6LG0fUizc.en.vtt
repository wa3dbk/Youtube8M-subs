00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:16.139
This is a team building session

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.616
for the Volvo Ocean Race crew.

00:00:23.452 --> 00:00:26.824
We're trying to pull the group together as best we can

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:31.928
in the sometimes tough and physical conditions of the mountains,

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.456
in preparation for the Volvo Ocean Race.

00:00:35.457 --> 00:00:37.525
A lot hinges on the cohesion of the crew.

00:00:37.526 --> 00:00:38.941
It's a very long race

00:00:38.942 --> 00:00:40.405
and you have to prepare for it well in advance

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:42.045
as the group will be working together

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:44.076
 for a very long time.

00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:47.362
We've been forming mixed rope parties

00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:49.461
with Swedes, Spaniards and French sailors,

00:00:49.462 --> 00:00:51.620
and that enables us to discuss things and exchange ideas

00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:52.824
and we improve our English

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:54.622
while they pick up a few more French words.

00:00:54.623 --> 00:00:55.826
We're trying to mix things up

00:00:55.827 --> 00:00:57.378
so we end up with the right balance.

00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:59.851
- I'm a bit stuck hereâ€¦

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:10.794
- What do I do now?

00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:16.170
At the start they found things a bit tricky

00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:20.966
 because most of them are either Breton, English or Australian,

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:24.978
who naturally haven't seen a lot of snow.

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.641
As such they were a little reticent to begin with.

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:32.561
Things are working very, very well now though

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:36.166
and we've just had a string of good results since the start.

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:38.279
-I said the rock to the left is good.

00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:41.147
We're completely changing the playing field

00:01:41.148 --> 00:01:42.959
and it's interesting to switch environments.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.398
It does you good when you're always at sea

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.051
to get a dose of green and then mountains.

00:01:49.052 --> 00:01:51.208
The exercise has great appeal in terms of strength

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.509
and physiologically, in terms of the formation of red corpuscles,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.703
it's not bad either.

00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:58.289
All in all then it's a really interesting preparation ground,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.682
as well as being the perfect training method.

00:02:00.883 --> 00:02:03.239
- Can you feel it in your abdominal muscles?

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:15.701
I think the mindset is very similar

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.637
between a sailor and a mountaineer

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:21.200
and that's why I really can't go far wrong in bringing them

00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:23.764
into the mountains for a preparation like this.
