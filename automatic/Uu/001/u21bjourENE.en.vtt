again this is Daisy by sensational NASA

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.830 
again this is Daisy by sensational NASA
pitcher<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.700> got<00:01:38.880> her<00:01:39.060> any<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:41.840> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
pitcher and I got her any one be and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.170 
pitcher and I got her any one be and
she's<00:01:42.990> nice<00:01:43.200> she<00:01:43.649> stand<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.189> straight<00:01:44.869> bang<00:01:46.100> um

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.109 
she's nice she stand up straight bang um
I<00:01:48.979> guess<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.159> she<00:01:50.430> has<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.610> bane<00:01:50.909> she

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
I guess because she has the bane she

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.109 
I guess because she has the bane she
doesn't<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> lot<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.979> parting<00:01:53.119> space

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
doesn't have a lot of parting space

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.359 
doesn't have a lot of parting space
going<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:56.119> it's<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.860> it's<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.979> little<00:01:59.219> bit

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
going on but it's it's it's a little bit

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.590 
going on but it's it's it's a little bit
in<00:01:59.520> there<00:02:01.250> I<00:02:02.250> know<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.450> be

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
in there I know this is going to be

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.840 
in there I know this is going to be
definitely<00:02:04.469> super<00:02:04.860> hard<00:02:05.040> because<00:02:05.189> it's

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
definitely super hard because it's

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.419 
definitely super hard because it's
really<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.020> really<00:02:07.560> tight<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.340> air

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
really like it's really tight in the air

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.210 
really like it's really tight in the air
so

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.580 

took<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.250> piece<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.430> white<00:02:12.700> paper<00:02:13.020> behind<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.440> so

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
took a piece of white paper behind it so

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.330
