inside<00:00:50.489> you'll<00:00:50.790> find<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.420> little

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
inside you'll find a little

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.770 
inside you'll find a little
piezoelectric<00:00:53.100> crystal<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.060> struck<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
piezoelectric crystal that is struck and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.540 
piezoelectric crystal that is struck and
you<00:00:55.500> push<00:00:55.739> down<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.130> hammer<00:00:56.840> and<00:00:58.460> creates<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
you push down the hammer and creates a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.819 
you push down the hammer and creates a
spark<00:00:59.880> that<00:01:00.329> ignites<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> butane<00:01:01.200> flame<00:01:01.559> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
spark that ignites the butane flame I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.369 
spark that ignites the butane flame I
don't<00:01:02.460> know<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.610> you'll<00:01:02.700> just<00:01:02.910> see<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.379> spark

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
don't know if you'll just see that spark

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.580 
don't know if you'll just see that spark
inside<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:05.040> let's<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:08.330> perhaps<00:01:09.330> not<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:10.440> any

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
inside here let's see perhaps not in any

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.700 
inside here let's see perhaps not in any
case<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.820> first<00:01:12.090> thing<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:12.330> need<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:13.549> is<00:01:14.549> to

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
case the first thing we need to do is to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.100 
case the first thing we need to do is to
strip<00:01:16.710> off<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:18.030> metal<00:01:18.390> flame<00:01:18.600> protector<00:01:21.110> it

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
strip off the metal flame protector it

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.570 
strip off the metal flame protector it
looks<00:01:22.260> like<00:01:22.470> they<00:01:22.590> also<00:01:22.860> popped<00:01:23.190> off<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
looks like they also popped off the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.469 
looks like they also popped off the
little<00:01:23.760> push<00:01:23.940> button<00:01:24.590> off<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.890> our<00:01:26.479> phaser

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
little push button off of our phaser

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.810 
little push button off of our phaser
igniter<00:01:29.270> okay<00:01:32.390> now<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> keep<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.610> spark<00:01:35.610> from

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
igniter okay now to keep the spark from

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.330 
igniter okay now to keep the spark from
igniting<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.420> butane<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> lighter<00:01:37.409> I'm

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
igniting the butane and the lighter I'm

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.770 
igniting the butane and the lighter I'm
going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> slip<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.000> little<00:01:39.299> place<00:01:39.510> with<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
going to slip this little place with the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:49.550 
going to slip this little place with the
plastic<00:01:40.200> tubing<00:01:40.590> over<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:44.119> valve

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:02:02.800 

and<00:01:50.190> go<00:01:50.370> push<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.730> push<00:01:50.910> button<00:01:51.210> back<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.570> here

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.660 

and<00:02:03.380> let's<00:02:03.619> see<00:02:03.740> if<00:02:03.770> we<00:02:03.920> can<00:02:04.040> see<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.310> spark

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
and let's see if we can see the spark

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:32.700 
and let's see if we can see the spark
without<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.150> flame

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.190 

difficult<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:33.770> see<00:02:34.360> in<00:02:35.360> any<00:02:35.570> case<00:02:35.780> what<00:02:36.080> we're

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
difficult to see in any case what we're

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.100 
difficult to see in any case what we're
going<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.440> do<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.800> lift<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:38.450> plastic<00:02:38.720> push

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
going to do is lift the plastic push

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.430 
going to do is lift the plastic push
button<00:02:39.470> off<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.360> we'll<00:02:41.360> take<00:02:41.930> out<00:02:42.170> the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
button off and we'll take out the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.160 
button off and we'll take out the
igniter<00:02:43.220> mechanism<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:46.780> think<00:02:47.780> it's<00:02:47.900> straight

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
igniter mechanism I think it's straight

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:58.000 
igniter mechanism I think it's straight
up<00:02:48.350> like<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:54.700> there<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.850> have<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.950> is

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
up like so and there you have it this is

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.470 
up like so and there you have it this is
the<00:02:58.990> Paizo<00:02:59.990> ignite<00:03:00.320> ignition<00:03:04.300> all<00:03:05.300> that's

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
the Paizo ignite ignition all that's

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.000 
the Paizo ignite ignition all that's
required<00:03:05.630> is<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.080> push<00:03:06.260> on<00:03:06.440> this<00:03:06.530> button<00:03:06.590> and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
required is to push on this button and

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.170 
required is to push on this button and
it<00:03:07.100> will<00:03:07.160> make<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> spark<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:10.700> can<00:03:11.030> use

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
it will make a spark and you can use

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.900 
it will make a spark and you can use
this<00:03:11.300> for<00:03:11.570> igniting<00:03:13.959> potato<00:03:14.959> cannons<00:03:15.410> or

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
this for igniting potato cannons or

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.650 
this for igniting potato cannons or
anything<00:03:16.910> where<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.270> need<00:03:17.300> a<00:03:17.450> high-voltage

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
anything where you need a high-voltage

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.400 
anything where you need a high-voltage
spark<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:19.280> without<00:03:19.700> battery<00:03:20.060> power<00:03:23.320> here<00:03:24.320> you

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
spark and without battery power here you

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.979 
spark and without battery power here you
see<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.680> small<00:03:25.130> block<00:03:25.880> of<00:03:26.060> wood<00:03:26.270> that<00:03:26.540> we've

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
see a small block of wood that we've

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.270 
see a small block of wood that we've
drilled<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.820> quarter-inch<00:03:28.820> hole<00:03:29.209> in<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:30.250> put<00:03:31.250> a

the<00:03:35.299> quarter-inch<00:03:35.750> hole<00:03:36.049> is<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:37.250> we<00:03:37.370> can<00:03:37.519> make

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
the quarter-inch hole is so we can make

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.660 
the quarter-inch hole is so we can make
contact<00:03:38.180> with<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.570> bottom<00:03:38.750> electrode<00:03:39.110> of<00:03:39.680> the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.080 
igniter like so and we've got the wire
so<00:03:50.690> we're<00:03:50.810> going<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:50.959> test<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.650> unit<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:53.030> we

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
so we're going to test the unit that we

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.160 
so we're going to test the unit that we
pulled<00:03:53.480> out<00:03:53.600> of<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:54.190> Electric<00:03:56.170> butane

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
pulled out of this Electric butane

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:08.760 
pulled out of this Electric butane
lighter<00:03:58.630> when<00:03:59.630> we<00:03:59.780> push<00:04:00.140> down

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:16.150 

as<00:04:09.770> you<00:04:10.040> can<00:04:10.160> see<00:04:12.280> we<00:04:13.280> get<00:04:13.430> a<00:04:13.490> spark<00:04:14.800> so<00:04:15.800> we

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
as you can see we get a spark so we

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.900 
as you can see we get a spark so we
haven't<00:04:16.310> broken<00:04:17.269> anything<00:04:17.660> here<00:04:18.730> we've<00:04:19.730> got

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
haven't broken anything here we've got

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.440 
haven't broken anything here we've got
us<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.239> very<00:04:20.450> cheap<00:04:22.090> piezoelectric<00:04:23.090> igniter

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
us a very cheap piezoelectric igniter

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.310 
us a very cheap piezoelectric igniter
and<00:04:23.750> we<00:04:24.500> can<00:04:24.680> use<00:04:24.830> in<00:04:25.010> our<00:04:25.150> potato<00:04:26.150> gun<00:04:26.420> the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
and we can use in our potato gun the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.210 
and we can use in our potato gun the
trigger<00:04:27.590> mechanism<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:29.300> ignite<00:04:29.630> the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
trigger mechanism to ignite the

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.250 
trigger mechanism to ignite the
explosive<00:04:31.220> gases<00:04:31.460> in<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:31.850> potato<00:04:32.120> gun<00:04:32.920> or<00:04:35.260> we

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
explosive gases in the potato gun or we

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.680 
explosive gases in the potato gun or we
could<00:04:36.410> also<00:04:36.560> use<00:04:36.830> this<00:04:36.980> for<00:04:37.040> one<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.690> Big

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
could also use this for one of the Big

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.150 
could also use this for one of the Big
Bang<00:04:38.900> cannons<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.620> uses<00:04:40.660> carbide<00:04:41.660> a<00:04:42.160> matter

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
Bang cannons that uses carbide a matter

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.090 
Bang cannons that uses carbide a matter
of<00:04:43.250> fact<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.700> used<00:04:44.180> one<00:04:44.420> of<00:04:44.450> these<00:04:44.710> in<00:04:45.710> my<00:04:45.770> Big

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
of fact I used one of these in my Big

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.180 
of fact I used one of these in my Big
Bang<00:04:46.280> cannon<00:04:46.700> because<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.680> normal<00:04:48.680> Flint

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
Bang cannon because the normal Flint

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.490 
Bang cannon because the normal Flint
type<00:04:49.460> sparking<00:04:50.060> igniter<00:04:50.680> was<00:04:51.680> lost<00:04:51.950> and<00:04:53.470> so<00:04:54.470> I

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
type sparking igniter was lost and so I

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.280 
type sparking igniter was lost and so I
needed<00:04:54.740> something<00:04:55.040> to<00:04:55.370> make<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.060> spark<00:04:56.510> so<00:04:57.230> I

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
needed something to make a spark so I

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.050 
needed something to make a spark so I
put<00:04:57.530> one<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.710> these<00:04:57.800> in<00:04:57.980> its<00:04:58.100> place<00:04:58.280> and

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
put one of these in its place and

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.700 
put one of these in its place and
perhaps<00:04:59.750> I'll<00:04:59.930> make<00:05:00.050> another<00:05:00.230> video<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.650> I'll

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
perhaps I'll make another video and I'll

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.470 
perhaps I'll make another video and I'll
show<00:05:00.740> you<00:05:00.950> that<00:05:01.070> cannon<00:05:01.550> with<00:05:01.700> a<00:05:01.730> sparker<00:05:02.360> in

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
show you that cannon with a sparker in

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.930 
show you that cannon with a sparker in
place<00:05:02.980> but<00:05:03.980> as<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:04.280> can<00:05:04.400> see<00:05:04.460> we've<00:05:04.790> got<00:05:04.820> a

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
place but as you can see we've got a

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.480 
place but as you can see we've got a
pretty<00:05:05.000> inexpensive<00:05:06.070> $0.75<00:05:07.070> because<00:05:07.370> we've

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
pretty inexpensive $0.75 because we've

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.060 
pretty inexpensive $0.75 because we've
got<00:05:07.580> two<00:05:07.730> of<00:05:07.760> them<00:05:07.910> for<00:05:08.060> dollar-fifty

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
got two of them for dollar-fifty

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.900 
got two of them for dollar-fifty
piezoelectric<00:05:10.070> igniter<00:05:11.260> that<00:05:12.260> we<00:05:12.500> can<00:05:12.910> use

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
piezoelectric igniter that we can use

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:34.330 
piezoelectric igniter that we can use
for<00:05:14.360> any<00:05:15.220> high-voltage<00:05:16.220> experiments

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340
