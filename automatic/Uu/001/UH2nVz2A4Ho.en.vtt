 I specifically made in the key la 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.769

 how to play so let's get started 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.010

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.300

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.260

 my faithful friend I can not grandmother without 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.649
 your heat 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.649
 and the most tender 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.680
 a waterfall 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.680
 apa 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.490
 cook 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.519
 by 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.980
 so let's start with chords 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.360
 first chord in a minor 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:47.489
 take so first open 2 on first 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.310
 fret 3 4 on the second palm there 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.190
 there will be a chord in A major 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.610
 the second third and fourth string on 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.610
 second fret 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:04.080
 next chord in d minor 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.030
 first on first 2 on third 3 on 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.470
 the second 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.470
 playing the four lower strings 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.470
 there will be a chord in d minor 6 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.830
 we remove the nameless from our minor 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.300
 finger 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.300
 open the second string 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.740
 index and middle remain in place 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.490
 at the seminar 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.540
 Here is such a ramina 6 next chord 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.680
 will we have in E major 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.140
 first second open 3 on the first 4 5 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.240
 on the second hand 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.640
 I play with all the strings on a chord c to 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.190
 major 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:55.530
 first open 2 at first third 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.680
 open 4 on the second 5 and 6 on the third 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.680
 fret 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.450
 appreciated the next chord pharma id 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.500
 seventh chord means take so here we are 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.709
 keep in C major is basically the same 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.799
 index finger stays in place 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:18.720
 three fingers drop down one string 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:23.020
 and so we got the first open 2 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.620
 on the first 3 on the second 4 guys on 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.620
 third fret 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.370
 Here's a chord on Chord salt 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.199
 major 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:40.860
 first little finger on the third 6 nameless 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:44.310
 on the third and fifth string on the second 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.550
 palms pressed by the middle finger 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.650
 can with other fingers and can you so 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.190
 it is more convenient but it is convenient for me 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.360
 telling 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:59.730
 there is probably all chords 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.730
 let's start the fight 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:09.659
 here's a fight playing it starting down 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.620
 play all the strings depending on 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.360
 chord 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.270
 the sixth is desirable not to play 6 with us 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:25.340
 plays the chords itself here is our case 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.820
 mi salt and yes here you can play on all 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.480
 strings 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.560
 on the frame of the holes it is advisable to play lower 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:37.590
 four strings that had less dirt 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.590
 and chords la play about five strings 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.520
 in F major is also meij 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.810
 five strings understandably back to the fight means 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.820
 play 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:53.520
 let's play my chord so we play by 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.870
 all the strings means the first blow down 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.740
 in all further 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.740
 top play 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:06.600
 top when we play all the strings are not 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.600
 we play we catch literally 3-4 strings 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:16.240
 continue to play down the stub stub 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:20.220
 do we just played the strings and 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.949
 put their hands on the strings 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.750
 do not specifically need to do this as it were 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:32.229
 mute separately just lowered 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:38.470
 conducted on the strings and this is the place for 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:46.979
 glow us on the strings understandable back on 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:46.979
 start down up down and silence further 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.889
 two blows up goes with us 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.830
 I will initially say that our hand goes 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:00.100
 constantly like a pendulum down up down 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:03.990
 up only when we need we cling 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.990
 strings and so first 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:14.290
 here played up two down again 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.290
 stub and up again 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:38.690
 Here we have a beautiful fight 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:41.259
 here perhaps the whole song is just two songs 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:44.060
 verse they are played exactly the same 

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:47.979
 of course you will succeed 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.979
 I wish you all success
