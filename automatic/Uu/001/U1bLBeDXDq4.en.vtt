a body for the butterfly with chenille
stems I've cut one in half I'm going to

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:46.529
evenly for that

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.360

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.199
twist the antenna around

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:03.199
like that

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.379
you will then glue it to the center
butterfly then you will use

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:16.449
some all-purpose craft glue dab on

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.119
a few dabs of glue on the backside

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:24.889
chenille stem and place it

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.419
in the center your butterfly

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.060
