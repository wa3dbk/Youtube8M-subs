00:00:01.207 --> 00:00:03.962
Wellcome to a new
Não Salvo Challenge!

00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:06.263
Today, we're gonna show you

00:00:06.732 --> 00:00:09.250
What NOT to do
in a fast food restaurant.

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:32.665
&lt;i&gt;What the hell?!&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.621
She just got the cup,
and Josué says: "Damn!"

00:00:52.903 --> 00:00:57.602
And when I looked
she did that, and walked.

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:03.358
She asked for a 24 oz. Coke,
then after the attendant gave it to her,

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:05.238
she asked if it was Diet Coke.

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:07.636
The attendant said:
"No. You asked for regular Coke."

00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:09.494
Then she just spilled
it all over her head.

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:11.776
and went home, wet.

00:01:12.154 --> 00:01:14.659
Either she's high on something,
or she isn't normal.

00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:17.728
Must be ill or crazy.
Unbelieveble to do such a thing.

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:19.573
Yeah, she looks crazy.

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:24.801
She's a rich girl.
Very neat looking, straight hair...

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:30.009
-Good afternoon.
-RAAAAAAAAAAAWR!

00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:39.542
What meal?
Big Mac?

00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:41.005
Would you like to
supersize it just for a $1?

00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:43.618
And to drink?
Coke?

00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:47.288
Anything else?
That would be $15.

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:51.005
Debit or credit?
Debit?

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.712
-Salt.
-Salt?

00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:14.855
-What do you want it for?
-Saaaaalt.

00:03:39.695 --> 00:03:41.466
&lt;i&gt;I almost had a heart attack.&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:45.826
Three meatballs, please.

00:03:54.212 --> 00:03:56.789
The guys from Habib's always
mess up the order, huh?

00:03:57.364 --> 00:03:59.143
They ordered a meatball.

00:04:04.673 --> 00:04:05.673
&lt;i&gt;that's rough, man.&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:12.213 --> 00:04:13.882
Excuse-me.

00:04:18.994 --> 00:04:21.001
This meatball taste bad.

00:04:25.303 --> 00:04:27.199
But this isn't meatball.

00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:30.618
This is dog crap.

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.474
I ate that meatball.

00:04:35.347 --> 00:04:36.886
This is dog crap.

00:04:39.861 --> 00:04:42.130
(Exchanging the meatball.)

00:04:45.972 --> 00:04:49.504
Thank you.
This time I'm gonna check it now.

00:04:52.304 --> 00:04:53.606
This one is good.

00:04:54.387 --> 00:04:55.993
That other was bad.

00:04:58.128 --> 00:04:59.265
Thank you.

00:04:59.353 --> 00:05:03.216
Dude, everyone in the kitchen
was cracking up laughing at the dog shit.

00:05:03.798 --> 00:05:06.390
That was one of the funniest
things I've ever seen.

00:05:06.675 --> 00:05:10.771
I just found out that the customer
is actually always right.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.792
That dude exchanged dog shit
for meatballs, son.

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:17.646
That's TROLL Life Style, bitch.

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:46.361
