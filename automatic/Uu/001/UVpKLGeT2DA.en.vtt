00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 attach links in her how do you do 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.370
 Which 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.830
 messages ask how do you make ribbons 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.700
 stuck in hair if you have four for example 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.820
 strands 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.379
 is going to braid I always use one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.510
 clip for but that has to do with it 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.869
 is already has very thin hair or 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.920
 very fine hair anyway and 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.390
 rubber bands here like a bump 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.590
 the hair so I do n't like it so 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.810
 I use myself 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.250
 person water group clamp but you 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.740
 can also use my rubber band and I will do it 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.440
 just on the show ok ok I am going now 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.820
 so attach the ribbon 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.980
 then we go from I 4 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.200
 would make strands but braid it 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.660
 principle is also with a 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.760
 strands braid actually the same 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.379
 the piece I want to braid is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.420
 this piece about 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.670
 So here I want to braid this and this 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.440
 I then divide into three because one piece 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.420
 so becomes the ribbon instead of her 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.789
 so we have these two strands I have 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.789
 well then take the ribbon 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.390
 I will fix that here 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.680
 so also so stuck so and I set this up 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.799
 the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.479
 i start from above the braid is a 2 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.009
 this will be the 3rd string and here I have 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.630
 tom a4 the fight 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.600
 this actually puts this at the second 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.100
 I strengthen that as 3rd string with 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 a clip 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.580
 now I get modern string here again 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.790
 up 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 I don't need this and so I go 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.070
 just 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.689
 i want to give you what you should do if 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.509
 you delete flights now it is whole 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.860
 loose hold moment that you now to this 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.270
 ribbon you are going to pull 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.110
 well then you know what happened and red 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.869
 ribbon look like this 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.630
 So I'm here under here am I 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.430
 she once again on few strokes 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.829
 then the ribbon is stuck 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.520
 in between you no longer have the problem 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.439
 I'm going over this again means me 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.909
 here again should normally be there 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.909
 to get a hold of things 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.880
 so 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.429
 and now I'm going again so this is over 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:15.550
 here goes below 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.480
 ribbon is pretty good place at 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.560
 Below 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.830
 need to go over that one more time you go 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.830
 about it 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.410
 means that he must underneath then grab 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.410
 Now a bit by 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.239
 you'll see the link as long as you get there 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.069
 not too hard just pulls in the clamp 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.750
 stuck 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.400
 I'm now not quite sat a 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.230
 another video of how you are with four 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.380
 strands braid only one for you 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.010
 specifically blind you are stuck so then 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.010
 again 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.880
 now you actually want two as the 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.590
 braid is finished then you want of course 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.900
 not that it stays that way 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.540
 you stand to loose and you will see that here 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.980
 a piece is left when the braid is finished 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.019
 can i tell you this is a whole 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.250
 piece has been pulled down 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.019
 but suppose you have a very small piece 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.560
 as braids as I do now in this case 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.560
 then you just can or something else and 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.100
 then you just pull it a little bit 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.180
 through the braid so that you are a little tight 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.299
 gets stuck 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.910
 move one of the ribbons below and 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.790
 you would also just take this to 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.459
 being able to fold underneath came on longer 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.440
 then let the women speak to women 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.180
 of course two hands to do this 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.160
 then you fold it down and then it is 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.889
 which is also hidden or you just pull 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.560
 to gently pull some ribbon again 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:46.090
 until it is hidden or you fold 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.769
 just look at him as I just showed 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.810
 inside 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.459
 so this is one way and another 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.200
 when it is finished, of course 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.150
 slightly different hair than a human 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.160
 so then it is actually not quite 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.620
 as humans will look like 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.940
 but the principle is the same she takes 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.489
 honor those locks that you want to flee with 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.829
 three strands would have to go to this 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.660
 be it actually only the top 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.870
 two needed the bottom I will come soon 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.079
 up again and I'll just do this now 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.280
 forward and fasten an elastic band 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.400
 sit around my little finger 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.500
 in a minute and this is easier 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.110
 to do if you are with two 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.360
 twister if you use the double ribbon 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.120
 I find it difficult to handle this myself 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.410
 rubber band here to fasten this ribbon 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.960
 make it possible you can do it with one 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.380
 button you can attach to it 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.740
 so then turn it around and then you have 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.740
 ankle 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.020
 so that is how it could cut this 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.820
 wonder if you choose to double it 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.370
 double in work and what looks like 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.130
 really just to get through it 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.190
 pull and pull you are absolutely right 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.780
 2 equal pieces have let you quickly 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.669
 so just with double ribbon and then hoof 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.890
 I don't make a knot here it plays 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.710
 also a chat corner itself then hear 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.560
 you gotta get it here so comes the ribbon 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.650
 behind so I need this piece 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.390
 about to enter the rubber band 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:16.000
 to do 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:19.720
 harder by turning over more times 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.610
 ring stuffed a big as I am now so in 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.560
 doing sso therefore gets a bump in it 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.870
 her 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.840
 so press ribbon to it as well 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.040
 I put on the rubber band and the rubber band 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.110
 in the hair 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.010
 now, of course, it is also candy 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.979
 divide these two strands into two 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.610
 this will be my 3rd strand this this piece 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:47.200
 off the ribbon I stop at the second 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.650
 strict and then blind and then last 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.910
 strict 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.910
 so now i can start again 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.350
 but this is always third she must be here 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:06:02.629
 what he's jumping over here 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:09.680
 below and over 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:11.090
 one more time on talking about going 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.560
 he comes back here when you go in 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.030
 braids would be a piece for us 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.190
 but the go now works just because 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:21.349
 ribbon that is stuck so one sees that you 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.960
 now nothing to process and so that you 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:25.819
 can continue to flee 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.819
 without loosening the ribbon because it sits 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:31.310
 of course much firmer in the hair 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:32.569
 so you have thicker hair or work 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.610
 with deeper hair 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.469
 then this is an excellent option so 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.680
 also easier than that with a 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:42.650
 clip works but for girls that 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.780
 his young so thin hair have been 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.669
 the other option with the clip 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.669
 yes I find it more beautiful myself 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.349
 so these are my two options to 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.490
 would of course work for this clamp 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:57.020
 for this clamp are of course also 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.150
 just be able to use a hairpin 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.650
 only then it will be less secure 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.560
 but you could also pin chicken for example 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.509
 and then it works too 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.130
 these are my ways to make a ribbon 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.150
 Fasten in hair maybe you have 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.430
 a good tip yourself 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.169
 please leave it below 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.800
 gladly trip back sunday for new 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:14.029
 hairstyle 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.250
 and next Wednesday we have again 

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:17.870
 a new tip thanks for looking 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.770
 no don't subscribe i like a thumbs up 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.770
 do it up 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.340
 a little bit
