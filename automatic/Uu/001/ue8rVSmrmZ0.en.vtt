00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
melts a little bit and then it refreezes

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.650 
melts a little bit and then it refreezes
and<00:00:58.710> makes<00:00:58.890> clear<00:00:59.129> ice<00:00:59.520> shows<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.210> dark<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and makes clear ice shows up dark on the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.429 
and makes clear ice shows up dark on the
picture<00:01:01.160> in<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:03.629> winter<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.229> snow<00:01:04.409> just

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
picture in the winter the snow just

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.960 
picture in the winter the snow just
packs<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.189> doesn't<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> chance<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.820> melt

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and so it shows up as a white layer so

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.969 
and so it shows up as a white layer so
these<00:01:09.540> layers<00:01:09.780> represent<00:01:10.020> summer<00:01:10.590> winter

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
these layers represent summer winter

we've ever drilled is ten thousand feet
deep<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:18.570> counted<00:01:18.900> these<00:01:19.020> ice<00:01:19.259> rings<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
deep and we counted these ice rings and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.950 
deep and we counted these ice rings and
they're<00:01:21.180> 135<00:01:21.810> thousand<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.590> them<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:24.420> now

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
they're 135 thousand of them and now

the earth is 6,000 years old we can

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.300 
the earth is 6,000 years old we can
prove<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.590> at<00:01:28.710> least<00:01:28.829> 135<00:01:29.610> thousand<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:31.310> said

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
prove it's at least 135 thousand I said

they melted this hole down to get to the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.610 
they melted this hole down to get to the
plane<00:02:15.480> took<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.780> plane<00:02:15.959> apart<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.500> brought

ours<00:02:25.500> maybe<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:27.239> plane<00:02:27.420> said<00:02:27.569> that's<00:02:27.720> where's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
ours maybe the plane said that's where's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.940 
ours maybe the plane said that's where's
home<00:02:27.989> bases<00:02:28.349> Middleborough<00:02:29.060> well<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:31.739> planes

home bases Middleborough well the planes

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.710 
home bases Middleborough well the planes
were<00:02:32.099> in<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.250> ice<00:02:32.370> for<00:02:32.400> 48<00:02:33.000> years<00:02:33.180> they<00:02:33.660> were

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
were in the ice for 48 years they were

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.680 
were in the ice for 48 years they were
263<00:02:34.709> feet<00:02:34.920> down<00:02:35.190> that's<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.730> 5<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.300> half<00:02:36.420> feet

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
263 feet down that's a 5 and a half feet

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.890 
263 feet down that's a 5 and a half feet
a<00:02:36.930> year<00:02:38.120> now<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.180> deepest<00:02:39.480> hole<00:02:39.630> they've<00:02:39.810> ever

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
a year now the deepest hole they've ever

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.440 
a year now the deepest hole they've ever
drilled<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.410> 10,000<00:02:41.040> feet<00:02:41.190> he<00:02:42.090> divided<00:02:42.330> that

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
drilled is 10,000 feet he divided that

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.449 
drilled is 10,000 feet he divided that
by<00:02:42.510> five<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:42.989> half<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:43.380> 1,800<00:02:43.980> years

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
by five and a half you get 1,800 years

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.500 
by five and a half you get 1,800 years
I<00:02:45.590> know<00:02:46.590> deeper<00:02:47.040> layers<00:02:47.220> get<00:02:47.459> squished<00:02:47.910> called

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
I know deeper layers get squished called

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.720 
I know deeper layers get squished called
glacial<00:02:48.720> ferns<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.440> really<00:02:49.680> 4,000<00:02:50.370> years<00:02:50.549> is

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
glacial ferns so really 4,000 years is

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.789 
glacial ferns so really 4,000 years is
plenty<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.209> time<00:02:51.510> but<00:02:51.840> all<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.230> ice<00:02:52.380> at<00:02:52.680> the

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
plenty of time but all the ice at the

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.340 
plenty of time but all the ice at the
North<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.190> South<00:02:53.310> Pole<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.810> why<00:02:54.930> isn't<00:02:55.080> there

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
North and South Pole so why isn't there

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.780 
North and South Pole so why isn't there
more<00:02:55.380> ice<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.980> North<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.280> South<00:02:56.370> Pole<00:02:56.730> I

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
more ice at the North and South Pole I

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.009 
more ice at the North and South Pole I
visited<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.910> museum<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.540> saw<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.780> guy<00:03:00.989> who

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
visited the museum and saw the guy who

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.479 
visited the museum and saw the guy who
dug<00:03:01.349> out<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.650> airplane<00:03:01.860> his<00:03:02.040> name<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.280> Bob

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
dug out the airplane his name is Bob

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.289 
dug out the airplane his name is Bob
Cardin<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.349> said<00:03:04.349> Bob<00:03:04.880> when<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:05.970> went<00:03:06.150> down<00:03:06.269> to

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
Cardin I said Bob when you went down to

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.759 
Cardin I said Bob when you went down to
get<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.780> airplane<00:03:07.019> did<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.380> melt<00:03:07.620> you

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
get to that airplane did you melt you

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.400 
get to that airplane did you melt you
did<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.160> go<00:03:08.280> through<00:03:08.430> ice<00:03:08.610> rings<00:03:09.080> he<00:03:10.080> said<00:03:10.260> oh

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
did you go through ice rings he said oh

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.610 
did you go through ice rings he said oh
yeah<00:03:10.650> many<00:03:10.920> hundreds<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.489> them<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:12.530> said<00:03:13.530> no

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
yeah many hundreds of them I said no

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.410 
yeah many hundreds of them I said no
wait<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.830> minute<00:03:13.950> how<00:03:14.459> can<00:03:14.640> there<00:03:14.790> be<00:03:14.819> hundreds

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
wait a minute how can there be hundreds

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.920 
wait a minute how can there be hundreds
of<00:03:15.569> ice<00:03:15.750> rings<00:03:16.080> in<00:03:16.349> 48<00:03:16.799> years<00:03:17.810> shouldn't<00:03:18.810> there

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
of ice rings in 48 years shouldn't there

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.319 
of ice rings in 48 years shouldn't there
be<00:03:18.959> somewhere<00:03:19.380> around<00:03:20.390> 48<00:03:23.000> he<00:03:24.000> said<00:03:24.209> who<00:03:24.299> told

be somewhere around 48 he said who told

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.220 
be somewhere around 48 he said who told
you<00:03:24.630> those<00:03:24.780> are<00:03:24.959> annual<00:03:25.500> layers<00:03:26.900> he<00:03:27.900> said<00:03:28.079> that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
you those are annual layers he said that

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.930 
you those are annual layers he said that
doesn't<00:03:28.350> represent<00:03:28.680> summer<00:03:29.220> winter<00:03:29.579> summer
