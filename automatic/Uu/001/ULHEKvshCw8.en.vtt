00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
okay what's up guys this piece we got

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.549 
okay what's up guys this piece we got
four<00:00:07.080> over<00:00:07.109> here<00:00:07.470> I'm<00:00:07.680> making<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.370> new<00:00:08.610> video<00:00:08.850> on

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
four over here I'm making a new video on

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.499 
four over here I'm making a new video on
this<00:00:10.559> Tekkit<00:00:11.040> server<00:00:11.340> um<00:00:12.500> so<00:00:13.500> uh<00:00:13.920> i<00:00:14.670> think<00:00:14.940> i'll

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
this Tekkit server um so uh i think i'll

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.609 
this Tekkit server um so uh i think i'll
make<00:00:15.540> me<00:00:15.840> some<00:00:16.040> 90<00:00:17.040> armor<00:00:17.640> right<00:00:17.790> now<00:00:18.619> I'm

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
make me some 90 armor right now I'm

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.319 
make me some 90 armor right now I'm
sorry<00:00:20.099> buff<00:00:20.310> with<00:00:20.489> a<00:00:20.579> little<00:00:20.790> bit<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.029> why<00:00:21.300> i

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:21.329 
sorry buff with a little bit of why i

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.240 
sorry buff with a little bit of why i
got<00:00:21.720> running<00:00:21.899> that<00:00:22.230> 49a<00:00:22.919> feels<00:00:23.279> right<00:00:23.550> now

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
got running that 49a feels right now

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.060 
got running that 49a feels right now
well<00:00:26.509> headache<00:00:27.509> like<00:00:27.989> who<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.559> hell<00:00:28.710> was<00:00:28.980> that

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
well headache like who the hell was that

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.010 
well headache like who the hell was that
line<00:00:29.399> you<00:00:29.610> 49<00:00:29.939> FPS<00:00:31.759> 52<00:00:32.759> well<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:35.360> let's<00:00:36.360> see<00:00:36.720> I

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
line you 49 FPS 52 well so let's see I

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.520 
line you 49 FPS 52 well so let's see I
guess<00:00:40.220> because<00:00:41.220> I<00:00:41.520> hate<00:00:42.030> someone<00:00:42.330> and<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.960> died

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
guess because I hate someone and I died

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.319 
guess because I hate someone and I died
yeah<00:00:44.420> died<00:00:45.420> dead<00:00:48.320> hmm<00:00:49.490> that<00:00:50.490> is<00:00:50.520> powered<00:00:51.150> up

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
yeah died dead hmm that is powered up

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.580 
yeah died dead hmm that is powered up
whoops<00:00:52.340> damn<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.989> what<00:00:54.989> did<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.200> broke

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
whoops damn it what did I just broke

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.260 
whoops damn it what did I just broke
that<00:00:57.440> I'm<00:00:58.440> stupid<00:00:58.800> why<00:00:59.430> did<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.670> use<00:00:59.700> rope<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that I'm stupid why did I use rope that

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.510 
that I'm stupid why did I use rope that
oh<00:01:05.630> my<00:01:06.630> god<00:01:06.930> i<00:01:06.960> need<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.409> much<00:01:07.590> no<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.070> don't<00:01:08.430> need

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
oh my god i need so much no I don't need

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.700 
oh my god i need so much no I don't need
that<00:01:08.670> much<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.240> got<00:01:09.479> energy<00:01:09.659> crystals<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
that much I got energy crystals and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.890 
that much I got energy crystals and
copper<00:01:11.460> cable<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.270> i<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.540> make<00:01:12.690> another<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.409> a

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
copper cable so i can make another one a

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.580 
copper cable so i can make another one a
simple<00:01:15.900> click<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.440> a<00:01:16.530> button<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:18.290> need<00:01:19.290> some

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
simple click of a button I need some

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.090 
simple click of a button I need some
copper<00:01:20.070> cables<00:01:20.580> some<00:01:22.820> diamond<00:01:23.820> block<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:26.040> so

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
copper cables some diamond block it so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.289 
copper cables some diamond block it so
much<00:01:26.490> stone<00:01:27.170> mm-hmm<00:01:28.170> now<00:01:29.030> decide<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.120> make

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
much stone mm-hmm now decide you make

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.230 
much stone mm-hmm now decide you make
energy<00:01:30.540> crystal<00:01:31.290> or<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:33.900> 40<00:01:34.200> 134

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
energy crystal or there to do 40 134

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.120 
energy crystal or there to do 40 134
four<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.600> two<00:01:36.630> three<00:01:36.780> four<00:01:36.950> one<00:01:37.950> two<00:01:37.979> three

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
four one two three four one two three

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.700 
four one two three four one two three
four<00:01:38.369> two<00:01:39.240> three<00:01:39.390> four<00:01:39.510> two<00:01:40.470> three<00:01:40.710> four<00:01:40.799> 1234

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
four two three four two three four 1234

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.190 
four two three four two three four 1234
that's<00:01:43.710> how<00:01:43.830> you<00:01:43.890> make<00:01:44.100> energy<00:01:44.670> crystals<00:01:45.390> now

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
that's how you make energy crystals now

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.300 
that's how you make energy crystals now
to<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.280> put<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:48.060> them<00:01:48.720> around<00:01:49.110> here

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.749 

then<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.799> then<00:01:56.400> this<00:01:58.549> you<00:01:59.549> get

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
then you do this and then this you get

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:07.190 
then you do this and then this you get
MFE

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.020 

well<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.229> just<00:02:08.530> waste<00:02:08.740> all<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.340> he<00:02:09.580> knows<00:02:09.759> in

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
well I just waste all and he knows in

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:23.839 
well I just waste all and he knows in
there<00:02:13.680> hey<00:02:15.120> sorry<00:02:16.120> about<00:02:16.210> that

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:31.679 

okay<00:02:24.849> you<00:02:24.909> know<00:02:25.180> what<00:02:25.329> I<00:02:25.390> mean<00:02:26.250> no<00:02:30.329> time<00:02:31.329> I<00:02:31.540> need

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
okay you know what I mean no time I need

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.140 
okay you know what I mean no time I need
to<00:02:31.870> wait<00:02:32.019> until<00:02:32.200> data<00:02:32.530> well<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.459> guess<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:33.879> was

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
to wait until data well I guess that was

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.910 
to wait until data well I guess that was
just<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.420> simple<00:02:34.780> video<00:02:34.959> showing<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.709> how<00:02:35.799> to

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
just a simple video showing you how to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.740 
just a simple video showing you how to
make<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:38.069> wife<00:02:39.069> Crystal<00:02:39.730> last<00:02:40.209> oh<00:02:40.359> yeah<00:02:40.569> I'll

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
make a wife Crystal last oh yeah I'll

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.650 
make a wife Crystal last oh yeah I'll
see<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:40.989> later<00:02:41.200> bye
