so<00:00:33.930> couple<00:00:34.260> days<00:00:34.380> ago<00:00:34.560> we<00:00:35.100> put<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> video<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.970> a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
so couple days ago we put a video of a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.280 
so couple days ago we put a video of a
trash<00:00:37.620> control<00:00:38.130> test<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> lot<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.940> people

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
trash control test and a lot of people

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.450 
trash control test and a lot of people
didn't<00:00:40.290> seem<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.560> think<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.980> was<00:00:41.070> legitimate

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
didn't seem to think it was legitimate

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.920 
didn't seem to think it was legitimate
so<00:00:41.850> worked<00:00:42.060> in<00:00:42.240> our<00:00:42.450> own<00:00:42.600> today<00:00:44.570> stock<00:00:45.570> two

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
so worked in our own today stock two

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.850 
so worked in our own today stock two
wheel<00:00:46.140> drive

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
wheel drive

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.770 
wheel drive
no<00:00:47.190> four<00:00:47.460> wheel<00:00:47.610> drive<00:00:47.850> levers<00:00:48.270> nothing<00:00:48.630> like

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
no four wheel drive levers nothing like

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.930 
no four wheel drive levers nothing like
that<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.860> we're<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.130> to<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.550> GAE

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that and we're going to see if this GAE

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.460 
that and we're going to see if this GAE
actually<00:00:51.450> works<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.870> way<00:00:51.990> it<00:00:52.140> did<00:00:52.290> in<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
actually works the way it did in the

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.770 
actually works the way it did in the
video<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.130> wish<00:00:54.030> me<00:00:54.060> luck<00:00:54.420> we're<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.720> to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
video so wish me luck we're going to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:30.250 
video so wish me luck we're going to
give<00:00:54.900> it<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.020> shot<00:00:55.200> right<00:00:55.230> now

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.650 

the<00:01:31.260> word<00:01:31.610> where<00:01:32.610> are<00:01:32.730> we<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.150> best<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.540> do

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
the word where are we going best to do

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.230 
the word where are we going best to do
the<00:01:33.780> same<00:01:33.990> test<00:01:34.320> where<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.740> go<00:01:34.980> a<00:01:35.460> slightly

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the same test where I go a slightly

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.210 
the same test where I go a slightly
different<00:01:36.450> view<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.320> guys<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.800> see<00:01:37.980> so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
different view for you guys to see so

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
different view for you guys to see so
hopefully<00:01:38.580> you'll<00:01:38.760> be<00:01:38.790> able<00:01:38.940> to<00:01:39.330> get<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.140> grasp

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
hopefully you'll be able to get a grasp

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.840 
hopefully you'll be able to get a grasp
of<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.710> exactly<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.190> happening<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.730> what

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
of what exactly is happening but what

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.030 
of what exactly is happening but what
you're<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.150> see<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:43.500> Dodge<00:01:43.680> does

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
you're going to see is the Dodge does

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.830 
you're going to see is the Dodge does
not<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.670> GAE<00:01:44.970> automatic<00:01:45.630> locking

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
not have the GAE automatic locking

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.140 
not have the GAE automatic locking
differential<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.100> will<00:01:47.220> spin<00:01:47.520> free<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
differential and it will spin free and

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.520 
differential and it will spin free and
it<00:01:48.330> will<00:01:48.420> transfer<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.840> power<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.410> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
it will transfer that power to the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.100 
it will transfer that power to the
loosest<00:01:49.890> wheel<00:01:50.130> will<00:01:50.760> have<00:01:51.030> where<00:01:51.330> once<00:01:51.870> that

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
loosest wheel will have where once that

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.960 
loosest wheel will have where once that
spins<00:01:52.560> around<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.370> feels<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.700> there's<00:01:53.910> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
spins around and it feels that there's a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.390 
spins around and it feels that there's a
slip<00:01:54.480> and<00:01:54.630> traction<00:01:54.870> will<00:01:55.500> lock<00:01:55.800> in<00:01:56.070> both

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
slip and traction will lock in both

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.910 
slip and traction will lock in both
wheels<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.180> 50/50<00:01:57.900> transfer<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.740> will

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
wheels will go 50/50 transfer and will

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.500 
wheels will go 50/50 transfer and will
crawl<00:01:59.190> right<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.670> hill<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.030> we're<00:02:00.180> try<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
crawl right up the hill so we're try and

00:02:00.510 --> 00:03:02.500 
crawl right up the hill so we're try and
get<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.690> a<00:02:00.720> better<00:02:00.900> view<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.290> thing

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.569 

you
