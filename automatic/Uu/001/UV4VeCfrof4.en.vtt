going to come with the standard bolt
which<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.070> good<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.250> medium<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.180> close<00:00:45.510> range

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
which is good for medium to close range

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.900 
which is good for medium to close range
engagements<00:00:46.010> but<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> last<00:00:47.370> three<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> have

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
engagements but the last three you have

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
engagements but the last three you have
to<00:00:48.090> unlock<00:00:48.420> with<00:00:48.660> achievements<00:00:49.050> now<00:00:49.559> they

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
to unlock with achievements now they

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.020 
to unlock with achievements now they
haven't<00:00:49.829> really<00:00:50.039> gone<00:00:50.219> into<00:00:50.430> detail<00:00:50.579> what

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
haven't really gone into detail what

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.369 
haven't really gone into detail what
those<00:00:51.149> achievements<00:00:51.449> are<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.079> entail

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
those achievements are going to entail

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.350 
those achievements are going to entail
but<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> feeling<00:00:53.219> they<00:00:53.730> might<00:00:53.760> be

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
but I have a feeling they might be

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
but I have a feeling they might be
class-specific<00:00:55.170> considering<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> high

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
class-specific considering that the high

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.610 
class-specific considering that the high
explosives<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> c4<00:00:58.410> at<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
explosives is going to be a c4 at the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
explosives is going to be a c4 at the
end<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.100> maybe<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.850> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.059> be

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
end of it so maybe it's going to be

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.060 
end of it so maybe it's going to be
you're<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.780> unlock<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.109> with

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
you're going to have to unlock it with

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.429 
you're going to have to unlock it with
the<00:01:02.460> engineer<00:01:03.030> or<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.539> support<00:01:03.899> class<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the engineer or the support class and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.899 
the engineer or the support class and
then<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> balance<00:01:05.010> Bowl<00:01:05.159> or<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.339> scan<00:01:05.670> bolt

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
then the balance Bowl or the scan bolt

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.600 
then the balance Bowl or the scan bolt
might<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.600> deal<00:01:06.830> with<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> recon<00:01:08.400> I

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
might have to deal with the recon I

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.039 
might have to deal with the recon I
don't<00:01:09.000> know<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.270> that's<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.600> sure<00:01:09.720> by<00:01:09.900> any

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
don't know if that's for sure by any

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.600 
don't know if that's for sure by any
means<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.560> would<00:01:10.650> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.040> make<00:01:11.159> sense<00:01:11.220> if

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
means but it would kind of make sense if

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
means but it would kind of make sense if
they<00:01:11.729> went<00:01:11.880> down<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.270> line<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:13.500> we'll<00:01:13.650> just

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
they went down that line but we'll just

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.830 
they went down that line but we'll just
have<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.010> wait<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.299> said<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
have to wait and see so like I said the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.240 
have to wait and see so like I said the
standard<00:01:16.259> bolt<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:17.070> well

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
standard bolt is going to do really well

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.609 
standard bolt is going to do really well
at<00:01:17.490> medium<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> close<00:01:18.450> range<00:01:18.750> engagements<00:01:18.960> but

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
at medium to close range engagements but

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.170 
at medium to close range engagements but
dice<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.189> hasn't<00:01:20.369> gone<00:01:20.580> into<00:01:20.790> much<00:01:21.000> detail

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.649 
those circumstances from the premium
video<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:26.040> did<00:01:26.250> look<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.060> standard<00:01:27.119> bolt

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
video it did look like the standard bolt

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.569 
video it did look like the standard bolt
is<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:28.229> shot<00:01:28.409> one<00:01:28.650> kill<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.070> head<00:01:29.250> which

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
is a one shot one kill to the head which

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.999 
is a one shot one kill to the head which
makes<00:01:29.820> perfect<00:01:30.210> sense<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.560> were<00:01:31.770> some

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
makes perfect sense but there were some

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.859 
makes perfect sense but there were some
times<00:01:32.310> when<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.150> soldier<00:01:33.509> using<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
times when the soldier using the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.990 
times when the soldier using the
crossbow<00:01:34.259> got<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:34.890> shot<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.280> kill<00:01:35.310> when<00:01:35.759> he

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
crossbow got a one shot one kill when he

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.870 
crossbow got a one shot one kill when he
hit<00:01:36.150> someone<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.930> chest<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> don't

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
hit someone in the chest so it I don't

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.969 
hit someone in the chest so it I don't
know<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.329> target<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.320> he<00:01:40.380> took<00:01:40.530> out<00:01:40.710> had

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
know if the target that he took out had

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.130 
know if the target that he took out had
some<00:01:41.220> damage<00:01:41.549> done<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.759> him<00:01:41.909> before<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.540> if

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
some damage done to him before but if

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.679 
some damage done to him before but if
not<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.159> looks<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.939> might<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
not then it looks like this might be a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.690 
not then it looks like this might be a
fairly<00:01:46.079> effective<00:01:46.680> one-shot<00:01:47.220> killing

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
fairly effective one-shot killing

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.090 
fairly effective one-shot killing
machine<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.960> those<00:01:49.200> circumstances<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.979> have

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
machine in those circumstances will have

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.679 
machine in those circumstances will have
to<00:01:50.189> wait<00:01:50.310> until<00:01:50.460> dice<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.119> actually<00:01:51.360> confirm

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
to wait until dice can actually confirm

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.929 
to wait until dice can actually confirm
it<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.470> think<00:01:52.950> that's<00:01:53.369> probably<00:01:53.640> going<00:01:53.880> to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
it but I think that's probably going to

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.030 
it but I think that's probably going to
be<00:01:54.060> how<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.960> standard<00:01:55.560> bolt<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:55.979> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
be how this standard bolt is going to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.039 
be how this standard bolt is going to
perform<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> next<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.659> high

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
perform so the next one is the high

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.050 
perform so the next one is the high
explosives<00:01:58.680> bolts<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.759> fair

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
explosives bolts and I know a fair

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.069 
explosives bolts and I know a fair
amount<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.299> people<00:02:00.540> out<00:02:00.689> there<00:02:00.719> were

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
amount of people out there were

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.780 
amount of people out there were
speculating<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.740> was<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.340> basically

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
speculating that was this was basically

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.569 
speculating that was this was basically
just<00:02:02.909> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.159> glorified<00:02:05.159> grenade

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
just going to be a glorified grenade

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.550 
just going to be a glorified grenade
launcher<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:06.810> clearly<00:02:06.960> not<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.409> case

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
launcher but that's clearly not the case

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.669 
launcher but that's clearly not the case
from<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.399> information<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:08.940> has<00:02:09.270> been

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
from the information that has been

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.399 
from the information that has been
least<00:02:09.829> we<00:02:10.099> now<00:02:10.280> know<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.609> ace<00:02:11.269> mini<00:02:11.750> c4<00:02:12.260> is

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
least we now know that ace mini c4 is

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.229 
least we now know that ace mini c4 is
basically<00:02:12.859> going<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.129> be<00:02:13.219> attached<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:14.000> the

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
basically going to be attached to the

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.750 
basically going to be attached to the
end<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.689> the<00:02:14.840> arrow<00:02:15.019> and<00:02:15.319> it's<00:02:16.219> it's<00:02:16.549> going<00:02:16.670> to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
end of the arrow and it's it's going to

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.209 
end of the arrow and it's it's going to
pack<00:02:16.939> a<00:02:16.969> punch<00:02:17.299> in<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:18.049> premium<00:02:18.469> video<00:02:18.709> we<00:02:18.980> saw

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:19.219 
pack a punch in the premium video we saw

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.490 
pack a punch in the premium video we saw
a<00:02:19.430> soldier<00:02:19.640> using<00:02:20.209> this<00:02:20.269> ammo<00:02:20.510> type<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.019> they

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
a soldier using this ammo type and they

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.709 
a soldier using this ammo type and they
were<00:02:21.560> going<00:02:22.069> after<00:02:22.219> a<00:02:22.609> enemy<00:02:23.090> little<00:02:23.359> bird<00:02:23.480> and

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
were going after a enemy little bird and

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.089 
were going after a enemy little bird and
once<00:02:23.989> they<00:02:24.109> were<00:02:24.170> able<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.469> actually<00:02:24.560> line<00:02:25.069> up

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
once they were able to actually line up

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.729 
once they were able to actually line up
the<00:02:25.340> shot<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:26.329> disabled<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.349> little<00:02:27.500> bird

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
the shot it disabled the the little bird

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.410 
the shot it disabled the the little bird
in<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.189> first<00:02:28.400> shot<00:02:28.579> and<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.730> think<00:02:28.939> the<00:02:29.060> second

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
in the first shot and I think the second

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.690 
in the first shot and I think the second
shot<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:29.840> took<00:02:30.079> it<00:02:30.109> out<00:02:30.290> outright<00:02:30.799> and<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.579> if

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
shot and took it out outright and so if

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.759 
shot and took it out outright and so if
we<00:02:31.790> can<00:02:31.939> use<00:02:32.000> some<00:02:32.480> deduction<00:02:33.079> we<00:02:33.349> do<00:02:33.560> know

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
we can use some deduction we do know

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.009 
we can use some deduction we do know
that<00:02:33.799> RPGs<00:02:34.670> can<00:02:35.000> take<00:02:35.180> out<00:02:35.329> a<00:02:35.359> little<00:02:35.569> bird<00:02:35.780> in

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
that RPGs can take out a little bird in

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.129 
that RPGs can take out a little bird in
one<00:02:36.200> shot<00:02:36.469> and<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:37.159> potentially<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.930> high

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:39.139 
one shot and so potentially the the high

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.920 
one shot and so potentially the the high
explosive<00:02:39.680> bolt<00:02:39.889> is<00:02:40.099> going<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:40.579> do<00:02:40.700> about<00:02:41.060> half

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
explosive bolt is going to do about half

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.110 
explosive bolt is going to do about half
the<00:02:42.169> damage<00:02:42.379> of<00:02:42.650> an<00:02:42.829> RPG<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.519> if<00:02:43.639> that<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:43.970> the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
the damage of an RPG and if that is the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.789 
the damage of an RPG and if that is the
case<00:02:44.150> maybe<00:02:44.659> it'll<00:02:44.959> even<00:02:45.049> be<00:02:45.230> effective

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
case maybe it'll even be effective

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.979 
case maybe it'll even be effective
against<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.819> main<00:02:47.000> battle<00:02:47.299> tanks<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:47.720> take

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
against the main battle tanks and take

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.800 
against the main battle tanks and take
out<00:02:48.169> high<00:02:48.519> highly<00:02:49.519> armored<00:02:49.939> enemy<00:02:50.150> vehicles

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
out high highly armored enemy vehicles

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.800 
out high highly armored enemy vehicles
and<00:02:51.079> if<00:02:51.409> that<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.919> case<00:02:51.950> then<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:53.269> Recon

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
and if that is the case then the Recon

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.659 
and if that is the case then the Recon
class<00:02:54.109> and<00:02:54.349> also<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.889> assault<00:02:55.219> class<00:02:55.400> is

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
class and also the assault class is

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.599 
class and also the assault class is
truly<00:02:56.239> can<00:02:56.359> now<00:02:56.510> have<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:57.159> ability<00:02:58.159> or<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.340> tool

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
truly can now have a ability or a tool

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.240 
truly can now have a ability or a tool
at<00:02:58.849> their<00:02:58.879> disposal<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.599> take<00:03:00.290> out<00:03:00.500> enemy<00:03:01.040> are

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
at their disposal to take out enemy are

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.789 
at their disposal to take out enemy are
highly<00:03:01.700> armored<00:03:02.239> enemy<00:03:02.419> vehicles<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:03.650> there's

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
highly armored enemy vehicles so there's

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.619 
highly armored enemy vehicles so there's
also<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.159> little<00:03:04.430> information<00:03:04.819> released<00:03:05.419> about

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
also a little information released about

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.830 
also a little information released about
the<00:03:05.930> skin<00:03:06.349> bolts<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.189> this<00:03:07.639> is<00:03:07.790> one<00:03:08.239> I'm<00:03:08.450> kind

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
the skin bolts and this is one I'm kind

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.300 
the skin bolts and this is one I'm kind
of<00:03:08.989> worried<00:03:09.290> about<00:03:09.469> considering<00:03:09.919> well<00:03:10.219> it

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
of worried about considering well it

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.319 
of worried about considering well it
doesn't<00:03:10.579> look<00:03:10.639> like<00:03:10.700> it's<00:03:10.939> going<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.120> be<00:03:11.180> able

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
doesn't look like it's going to be able

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.360 
doesn't look like it's going to be able
to<00:03:11.389> do<00:03:11.480> any<00:03:11.689> damage<00:03:11.989> by<00:03:12.260> any<00:03:12.409> means<00:03:12.680> but<00:03:13.250> it

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
to do any damage by any means but it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.710 
to do any damage by any means but it
looks<00:03:13.519> like<00:03:13.579> it's<00:03:13.790> going<00:03:13.909> to<00:03:13.940> be<00:03:14.090> basically<00:03:14.359> as

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
looks like it's going to be basically as

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.869 
looks like it's going to be basically as
effective<00:03:14.750> as<00:03:15.319> the<00:03:15.349> motion<00:03:16.069> balls<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:16.609> a

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
effective as the motion balls in a

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.849 
effective as the motion balls in a
battlefield<00:03:17.150> bad<00:03:17.389> company<00:03:17.540> 2<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.199> in<00:03:18.620> my

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
battlefield bad company 2 and in my

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.469 
battlefield bad company 2 and in my
opinion<00:03:18.949> those<00:03:19.310> were<00:03:19.459> one<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.180> most

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:20.479 
opinion those were one of the most

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.689 
opinion those were one of the most
useful<00:03:20.750> gadgets<00:03:21.379> in<00:03:21.500> those<00:03:21.680> games<00:03:21.889> and<00:03:22.190> to

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:22.699 
useful gadgets in those games and to

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.879 
useful gadgets in those games and to
have<00:03:22.729> that<00:03:22.909> at<00:03:23.389> your<00:03:23.599> disposal<00:03:23.900> for<00:03:24.139> any<00:03:24.470> class

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
have that at your disposal for any class

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.059 
have that at your disposal for any class
in<00:03:25.220> battlefield<00:03:26.060> 3<00:03:26.260> kinda<00:03:27.260> seems<00:03:27.530> like<00:03:27.739> it's

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
in battlefield 3 kinda seems like it's

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.409 
in battlefield 3 kinda seems like it's
going<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.340> little<00:03:28.430> bit<00:03:28.549> too<00:03:28.699> far<00:03:28.939> but<00:03:29.239> the

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
going a little bit too far but the

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.939 
going a little bit too far but the
information<00:03:29.599> that<00:03:29.900> we<00:03:30.109> now<00:03:30.229> how<00:03:30.439> about<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.829> is

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
information that we now how about it is

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.309 
information that we now how about it is
that<00:03:31.010> it's<00:03:31.760> going<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.150> give<00:03:32.810> you<00:03:32.930> a<00:03:32.959> nice

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
that it's going to give you a nice

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.129 
that it's going to give you a nice
little<00:03:33.530> 10<00:03:33.829> meter<00:03:34.069> radius<00:03:34.579> from<00:03:35.449> the<00:03:35.510> position

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
little 10 meter radius from the position

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.929 
little 10 meter radius from the position
where<00:03:36.439> you<00:03:36.769> shoot<00:03:37.040> it<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.639> basically

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:37.939 
where you shoot it so it basically

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.909 
where you shoot it so it basically
exactly<00:03:38.599> like<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.169> motion<00:03:39.500> balls<00:03:39.680> in

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
exactly like the motion balls in

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.949 
exactly like the motion balls in
battlefield<00:03:40.370> bad<00:03:40.489> company<00:03:40.669> 2<00:03:41.030> i'm<00:03:41.329> hoping

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
battlefield bad company 2 i'm hoping

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.140 
battlefield bad company 2 i'm hoping
dice<00:03:42.409> is<00:03:42.680> able<00:03:43.099> to<00:03:43.220> balance<00:03:43.400> this<00:03:43.699> correctly

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
dice is able to balance this correctly

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.759 
dice is able to balance this correctly
and<00:03:44.419> it's<00:03:44.569> not<00:03:44.780> overpowered<00:03:45.439> and<00:03:45.560> we<00:03:45.650> don't

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
and it's not overpowered and we don't

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.860 
and it's not overpowered and we don't
just<00:03:46.069> see<00:03:46.189> people<00:03:46.430> running<00:03:46.609> around<00:03:46.909> as<00:03:47.359> the

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
just see people running around as the

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.240 
just see people running around as the
assaults<00:03:48.259> with<00:03:48.439> the<00:03:48.620> best<00:03:48.799> weapons<00:03:49.129> in<00:03:49.189> the

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
assaults with the best weapons in the

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.550 
assaults with the best weapons in the
game<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.669> just<00:03:50.239> blowing<00:03:50.659> everyone<00:03:51.169> out<00:03:51.530> of

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
game and just blowing everyone out of

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.869 
game and just blowing everyone out of
the<00:03:51.709> water<00:03:51.739> because<00:03:52.310> they<00:03:52.519> know<00:03:52.759> exactly

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
the water because they know exactly

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.969 
the water because they know exactly
where<00:03:53.449> everyone<00:03:53.810> is<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.199> they<00:03:54.560> have<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.859> best

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:54.979 
where everyone is and they have the best

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.140 
where everyone is and they have the best
weapons<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.430> game<00:03:55.549> so<00:03:55.669> hopefully<00:03:56.030> they

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
weapons of the game so hopefully they

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.309 
weapons of the game so hopefully they
can<00:03:56.209> balance<00:03:56.449> it<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:56.900> I'm<00:03:56.959> keeping<00:03:57.229> my

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
can balance it and I'm keeping my

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.740 
can balance it and I'm keeping my
fingers<00:03:57.349> crossed<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.669> final<00:03:59.000> one<00:03:59.030> is<00:03:59.509> the

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
fingers crossed and the final one is the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.360 
fingers crossed and the final one is the
balance<00:04:00.169> bolts<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:00.680> there<00:04:00.919> really<00:04:01.040> hasn't

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
balance bolts and there really hasn't

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.399 
balance bolts and there really hasn't
been<00:04:01.549> too<00:04:02.120> much<00:04:02.329> more<00:04:02.540> information<00:04:03.049> released

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
been too much more information released

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.080 
been too much more information released
about<00:04:03.560> this<00:04:03.799> one<00:04:03.979> basically<00:04:04.459> all<00:04:04.819> we<00:04:04.970> really

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
about this one basically all we really

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.089 
about this one basically all we really
know<00:04:05.389> is<00:04:05.419> that<00:04:05.930> it's<00:04:06.199> going<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.620> be<00:04:06.739> good<00:04:06.859> for

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
know is that it's going to be good for

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.219 
know is that it's going to be good for
long<00:04:07.280> range<00:04:07.579> engagements<00:04:07.849> and<00:04:08.389> it's<00:04:09.049> going<00:04:09.169> to

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:09.229 
long range engagements and it's going to

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:11.020 
long range engagements and it's going to
have<00:04:09.439> less<00:04:09.889> bullet<00:04:10.280> drop<00:04:10.519> than<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.909> other

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
have less bullet drop than the other

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.819 
have less bullet drop than the other
ones<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.540> I'm<00:04:11.930> assuming<00:04:12.199> that<00:04:12.560> what<00:04:12.709> that

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
ones and I'm assuming that what that

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.619 
ones and I'm assuming that what that
also<00:04:13.009> means<00:04:13.189> is<00:04:13.579> that<00:04:13.609> it's<00:04:13.909> going<00:04:14.060> to<00:04:14.120> travel

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
also means is that it's going to travel

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.060 
also means is that it's going to travel
a<00:04:14.750> little<00:04:14.870> bit<00:04:15.019> faster<00:04:15.259> as<00:04:15.620> well<00:04:15.739> that<00:04:15.979> would

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
a little bit faster as well that would

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.709 
a little bit faster as well that would
just<00:04:16.220> kind<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.430> make<00:04:16.579> sense<00:04:16.609> so<00:04:17.479> it's<00:04:17.570> going<00:04:17.659> to

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:17.719 
just kind of make sense so it's going to

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:19.240 
just kind of make sense so it's going to
get<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:17.959> your<00:04:18.079> target<00:04:18.229> faster<00:04:18.709> as<00:04:18.769> well<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.099> so

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
get to your target faster as well and so

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.620 
get to your target faster as well and so
you're<00:04:19.370> not<00:04:19.459> going<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.639> have<00:04:19.789> to<00:04:19.969> well<00:04:20.419> first

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
you're not going to have to well first

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.180 
you're not going to have to well first
of<00:04:20.810> all<00:04:20.900> compensate<00:04:21.620> as<00:04:21.709> much<00:04:21.799> for<00:04:21.979> bullet

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
of all compensate as much for bullet

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.260 
of all compensate as much for bullet
drop<00:04:22.370> but<00:04:22.550> not<00:04:22.729> lead

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
drop but not lead

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.150 
drop but not lead
your<00:04:23.449> target<00:04:23.840> as<00:04:23.960> much<00:04:24.199> as<00:04:24.349> well<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.800> mean

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
your target as much as well I mean

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.279 
your target as much as well I mean
really<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.819> the<00:04:25.849> crossbows<00:04:26.690> and<00:04:26.960> what<00:04:27.080> types

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
really the the crossbows and what types

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:28.869 
really the the crossbows and what types
