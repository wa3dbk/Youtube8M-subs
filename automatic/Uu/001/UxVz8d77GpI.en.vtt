 version a total of three vehicles in one 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.379
 garage slipping could mean that's you 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.300
 have 13 vehicles in a garage 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.670
 if you two can not you until 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.290
 to have 26 vehicles in two garages 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.239
 In any case, we come now to 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.980
 tutorial that is not a solo happiness 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.360
 You can now in the comments in 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.280
 play a tec to write yourselves 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.019
 can help each other first 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.450
 enter the garage and have to go first 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.840
 buy three bmx bike for every 800 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.309
 dollar 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.739
 I already did that 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.320
 Just get on a motorcycle the car 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.680
 or the motorcycle should be bought legally 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.289
 his 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.119
 then you open the minimum left and 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.850
 makes your vehicle access to the passenger 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.320
 and drive out as normal as soon as you 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.140
 All this then must have done 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.630
 colleague of himself on the back of the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.460
 motorbikes sit on makes the whole 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.990
 now someone colleague banks again the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.970
 ten modding me in this slippery 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.860
 golf for once then stop on your 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.299
 you have to get on your bike immediately 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.100
 give him no helmet pulls 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.450
 that it really is very very important and 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.450
 then he just grabs the motorcycle 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.140
 simply here goes out or descends 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.610
 and then enter your garage it is 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.049
 also important that a colleague only now 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.270
 times all the time on your motorcycle 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.799
 Next, you stay looking for her 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.570
 you online authors what we then stop 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.610
 now would like to draw a study and also 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.390
 past where the whole volt 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.400
 bicycles are standing 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.619
 He simply drives the vehicle then 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.659
 stop like in the video now and measure 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.490
 Next, duplicate the car 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.110
 the whole thing is really very simple 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.610
 and that's how soon it will get out of here 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.590
 we are packing the car 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.479
 just in front of the motorcycle respectively 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.159
 just open the motorcycle and open it 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.570
 the minimum left and make one 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.310
 suicide click on yourself 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.440
 kill there is another alternative 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.239
 I can easily make friends with my colleagues 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.250
 as soon as you are dead since 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.620
 then you will grow old on the street of the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.940
 pont, a colleague just has to get off 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.920
 you can do that by headset or something 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.750
 let me know and then as soon as you 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.940
 Colleague of the hand , so to speak , rises 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.799
 So you have to be spun soon 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.360
 just have a colleague Descending can 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.590
 you can time also there would have to 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.019
 you will not notice 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.650
 that also the street duplicates the car 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.390
 has been 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.670
 as is the marked vehicle 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.349
 a car is parked here now 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.420
 because the unmarked vehicle rises 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.000
 then just park the car 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.189
 here, therefore, left taker and garage door 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.989
 Now it is important that a colleague too 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.209
 you come and turn left into the corner 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.829
 purely puts or here in the corner where I 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.900
 I was just showing you the whole thing 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.370
 So exactly colleague turns 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.260
 simply left resp 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.390
 now in this case, next to it and left 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.769
 you enter your garage in time 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.239
 it really is very important 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.579
 a colleague on the left is standing next to it 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.139
 the car does not disappear next 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.579
 then you any bicycle from what 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.290
 you bought at the beginning is 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.489
 not matter what were the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.260
 I choose to do this now 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.109
 the right bike and drive all the way 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.310
 normal out as soon as we get out 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.720
 driven more we realize that it 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.549
 other car in our garage 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.620
 teleported that is the car 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.019
 did not get lost next climb 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.459
 if the unmarked car is like now 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.139
 in the video and then drive to ls customs 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.579
 so arrived at ellis box drive 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.129
 We just have to go in and have to 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.989
 short repair the car and then still 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.459
 Ultimately, the color around change that 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.169
 It simply means the paint is 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.459
 no matter what you change about it 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.379
 It is only important that you have the car 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.069
 would have to repair and then briefly one 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.660
 color or a paint adds as 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.049
 I 'm just going green here now 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.970
 White 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.859
 and then we drive out of here and drive 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.389
 then back to our garage 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.769
 as soon as we arrive at our garage 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.359
 arrived we pack the car 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.989
 left again as we take now in 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.060
 Video 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.590
 and then our colleague has to come back 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.540
 put left in the corner like now 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.979
 in the video and you press on state and 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.810
 just go to the playstation 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:04.909
 store or xbox live 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.769
 depending on which console the whole 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.479
 do as soon as you are in the store since then 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.470
 he pushes then circled back into the 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:10.940
 lobby 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.159
 Here it is also important that you 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.900
 Colleague of the Horst is not in it 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.820
 Another meeting will be kicked 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.560
 that means your colleague has to turn you into one 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.060
 Meeting only for players with each other and 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.470
 At the very beginning, I mean you now 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.389
 not be kicked but in the 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.699
 same lobby will come as soon as we leave 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.320
 circle or pressed b we are then 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.630
 back at the lobby now we enter 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.789
 quite simply our garage and found here 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.500
 with a vehicle out is perfect 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.880
 no matter what kind of vehicle that is me 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.260
 I just want to go bald now 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.570
 Rebell aussteiger simply in the cellar 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.980
 and drive out the normal way now 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.720
 we already finished with the lightning 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.220
 as soon as we get out we have to 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.290
 turn around briefly and back in the 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.200
 drive in the garage and now it became 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.240
 car teleported and where that 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.400
 right bike was what i selected 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.070
 there is my car now you see 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.870
 this was teleported on the left and there 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.310
 Do you see the bike is gone and there 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.630
 is now my car I want that now 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.430
 just look like and you see 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.140
 not with my bike out but 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.120
 I've got that over with my car 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.680
 clapped and you can be like me 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.840
 in all three bikes that open 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.190
 The biologist says process again selects 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.170
 Of course not the right bike 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.520
 but the left one is still here 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.440
 important if you then with the author 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.880
 turns out like you to the video is likely to 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.190
 no case back to normal 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.930
 drive garage rhine but measures that 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.880
 So first of all, if you really 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.070
 back to the autonomous garage a 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.960
 you want to be able to yell 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.060
 Do it solo and you have to 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.030
 The car just to the left of the garage door 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.730
 get out and then your garage 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.350
 So enter a garage on foot then 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.060
 selects her in my case I will then 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.380
 stop my cards rebell out of you chooses 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.450
 then any other vehicle from 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.490
 drive out with the vehicle turns 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.170
 moves back to € gage purely 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.760
 as soon as he is in your garage 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.590
 Will you realize that there is neither that 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.330
 car stands or stands it is 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.130
 is invisible then stop where the 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.110
 Whole bicycles are in the back left in 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.760
 corner and then we can do that again 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.990
 Select and then go out on 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.910
 in any case it was already with this 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.220

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.680
