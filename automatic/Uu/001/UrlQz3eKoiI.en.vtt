how<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.230> do<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.470> switch<00:00:04.740> Ollie<00:00:07.460> the<00:00:08.460> switch

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
how to do a switch Ollie the switch

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.180 
how to do a switch Ollie the switch
Ollie<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:09.210> basically<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.139> opposite<00:00:10.800> coming

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
Ollie is basically the opposite coming

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.110 
Ollie is basically the opposite coming
up<00:00:12.170> and<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.799> Ollie<00:00:14.009> either<00:00:14.610> finger<00:00:14.880> placement

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
up and in Ollie either finger placement

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.290 
up and in Ollie either finger placement
is<00:00:15.450> like<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.590> with<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> switch<00:00:17.400> switch

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
is like this but with a switch switch

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.620 
is like this but with a switch switch
flip<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:19.289> finger<00:00:19.529> placement<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.070> like<00:00:20.220> this

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
flip the finger placement is like this

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.950 
flip the finger placement is like this
instead<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.750> like<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.310> it's<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.960> so

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
instead of like this it's like this so

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.570 
instead of like this it's like this so
when<00:00:25.289> we're<00:00:25.439> doing<00:00:25.529> our<00:00:25.769> switch<00:00:26.039> Ollie<00:00:26.279> we

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
when we're doing our switch Ollie we

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.279 
when we're doing our switch Ollie we
want<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> exact<00:00:27.449> same<00:00:27.480> thing<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.019> we

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
want to do the exact same thing that we

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.849 
want to do the exact same thing that we
usually<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:28.890> with<00:00:29.820> an<00:00:29.970> ollie<00:00:30.230> except<00:00:31.230> using

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
usually do with an ollie except using

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.950 
usually do with an ollie except using
this<00:00:32.160> finger<00:00:32.550> placement<00:00:32.850> we're<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.809> to

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
this finger placement we're going to

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.549 
this finger placement we're going to
push<00:00:34.350> down<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:34.829> our<00:00:35.899> with<00:00:36.899> our<00:00:37.020> index<00:00:37.350> finger

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
push down with our with our index finger

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.010 
push down with our with our index finger
and<00:00:37.950> we're<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> slide<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.600> our<00:00:39.780> middle

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and we're going to slide with our middle

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.799 
and we're going to slide with our middle
finger<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> like<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:43.730> okay<00:00:44.730> now<00:00:45.329> I'm<00:00:45.690> just

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.139 
finger so like is it okay now I'm just
like<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.379> volley<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.070> switch<00:00:47.550> Ollie<00:00:47.760> takes

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
like the volley the switch Ollie takes

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.920 
like the volley the switch Ollie takes
quite<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.809> practice<00:00:49.820> because<00:00:50.930> unlike

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
quite a bit of practice because unlike

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.200 
quite a bit of practice because unlike
the<00:00:52.110> ollie<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.590> switch<00:00:52.949> Ollie<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.460> using<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the ollie the switch Ollie is using the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.170 
the ollie the switch Ollie is using the
middle<00:00:54.539> finger<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.860> slide<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:57.000> you're<00:00:57.090> gonna

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
middle finger to slide so you're gonna

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.560 
middle finger to slide so you're gonna
pop<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.690> board<00:00:57.899> up<00:01:01.219> release<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.910> pressure<00:01:03.149> on

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
pop the board up release the pressure on

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.469 
pop the board up release the pressure on
the<00:01:03.840> index<00:01:04.170> finger<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.909> slide<00:01:05.909> your<00:01:06.090> middle

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
finger forward in a level on the air

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.960 
finger forward in a level on the air
level<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> air<00:01:11.189> by<00:01:11.430> releasing

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
level it out in the air by releasing

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.760 
level it out in the air by releasing
more<00:01:12.360> even<00:01:12.750> more<00:01:12.930> pressure<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> index

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
more even more pressure on the index

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.130 
more even more pressure on the index
finger<00:01:13.890> bringing<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:15.150> finger<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.869> sliding

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
finger bringing this finger in sliding

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.080 
finger bringing this finger in sliding
this<00:01:16.380> middle

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
this middle

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.620 
this middle
forward<00:01:18.020> more<00:01:18.229> than<00:01:19.420> okay

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
forward more than okay

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.609 
forward more than okay
just<00:01:21.079> catch<00:01:21.320> it<00:01:22.210> usually<00:01:23.210> you're<00:01:23.479> very<00:01:24.200> Canali

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619

have to worry about catching it or
anything<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:34.100> um<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:35.390> good<00:01:35.539> thing<00:01:35.720> about

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
anything but um the good thing about

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.419 
anything but um the good thing about
learning<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.229> switch<00:01:36.439> ollie<00:01:36.679> is<00:01:37.009> once<00:01:37.340> you

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
learning a switch ollie is once you

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.929 
learning a switch ollie is once you
learn<00:01:37.580> switch<00:01:37.820> Ollie<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.330> do<00:01:38.450> look<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:40.820> know

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
learn switch Ollie you do look you know

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.999 
learn switch Ollie you do look you know
switch<00:01:41.299> switch<00:01:41.960> flick<00:01:42.259> at<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.530> point<00:01:42.770> so

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
switch switch flick at the point so

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.060 
switch switch flick at the point so
that's<00:01:43.159> basically<00:01:43.789> a<00:01:44.320> switch<00:01:45.320> Ollie<00:01:45.590> for<00:01:45.920> you

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
that's basically a switch Ollie for you

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.480 
that's basically a switch Ollie for you
and<00:01:46.899> remember<00:01:47.899> just<00:01:48.560> like<00:01:48.710> any<00:01:48.890> other<00:01:49.100> trick

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
and remember just like any other trick

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.639 
and remember just like any other trick
this<00:01:49.729> takes<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.119> lot<00:01:50.299> of<00:01:50.330> practice<00:01:50.959> so<00:01:51.259> I<00:01:51.289> hope

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
this takes a lot of practice so I hope

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.199 
this takes a lot of practice so I hope
this<00:01:51.950> tutorial<00:01:52.100> helps<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:52.729> guys<00:01:52.940> out
