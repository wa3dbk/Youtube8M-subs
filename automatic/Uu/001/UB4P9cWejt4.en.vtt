00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
shelf and anyway yeah let's get started

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.150 
shelf and anyway yeah let's get started
a<00:00:26.699> little<00:00:26.730> bit<00:00:27.029> then<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.930> basically<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:29.099> is

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
a little bit then so basically this is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160 
a little bit then so basically this is
your<00:00:29.429> shelf<00:00:29.699> up<00:00:29.910> here<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.689> all<00:00:30.929> these

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
your shelf up here you have all these

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.010 
your shelf up here you have all these
ones<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.890> normally<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.390> mine<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.809> i<00:00:33.840> use

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
ones and normally in the mine that i use

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.630 
ones and normally in the mine that i use
on<00:00:34.050> my<00:00:34.200> other<00:00:34.410> work<00:00:34.649> station<00:00:35.190> i<00:00:35.280> don't<00:00:35.460> have

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
on my other work station i don't have

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.600 
on my other work station i don't have
these<00:00:35.880> default<00:00:36.360> shelves<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:37.370> really<00:00:38.370> at<00:00:38.489> all

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
these default shelves up really at all

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.790 
these default shelves up really at all
because<00:00:39.540> they're<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.020> mess<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.620> they

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
because they're just a mess and they

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.250 
because they're just a mess and they
take<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.520> space<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:41.969> all<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:42.809> we're

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
take up space and all that but we're

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.930 
take up space and all that but we're
basically<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.739> there<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.070> everything<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
basically in there for everything and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
basically in there for everything and
since<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.719> know<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:45.870> probably<00:00:46.200> gone<00:00:46.500> model

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
since you know we probably gone model

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.130 
since you know we probably gone model
here<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.190> my<00:00:47.309> tutorials<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.660> polygon

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
here in my tutorials this is the polygon

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.479 
here in my tutorials this is the polygon
shelf<00:00:49.469> here<00:00:49.680> which<00:00:49.890> pretty<00:00:50.129> much<00:00:50.219> has

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
shelf here which pretty much has

i'm<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.549> rendering<00:02:02.850> tab<00:02:03.119> now<00:02:03.390> i<00:02:03.659> want<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
i'm in the rendering tab now i want to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.929 
i'm in the rendering tab now i want to
make<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.409> polygon<00:02:04.979> tools<00:02:05.340> that's<00:02:05.759> why<00:02:05.909> i

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
make this is polygon tools that's why i

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.109 
make this is polygon tools that's why i
named<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.719> i<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.200> tab<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.740> for

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
named it that so i know the tab is for

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.210 
named it that so i know the tab is for
modeling<00:02:09.119> with<00:02:09.209> polygons

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
modeling with polygons

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.940 
modeling with polygons
when<00:02:11.180> I'm<00:02:11.300> just<00:02:11.570> modeling<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:12.650> I'm<00:02:12.770> going<00:02:12.920> to

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
when I'm just modeling so I'm going to

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.870 
when I'm just modeling so I'm going to
go<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.190> modeling<00:02:13.610> tab<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:15.760> basically<00:02:16.760> I

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
go to the modeling tab and basically I

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.810 
go to the modeling tab and basically I
had<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.180> think<00:02:17.360> about<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.990> tools<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.890> I'm

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
had to think about the tools that I'm

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.860 
had to think about the tools that I'm
going<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.090> use<00:02:20.300> most<00:02:21.430> okay<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:23.360> know<00:02:23.480> like<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
going to use most okay you know like the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.060 
going to use most okay you know like the
ones<00:02:24.230> I'm<00:02:24.380> going<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.620> model<00:02:24.890> with<00:02:24.980> the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
ones I'm going to model with the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.270 
ones I'm going to model with the
polygons<00:02:25.550> most<00:02:26.800> ones<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.950> will<00:02:28.040> probably

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
polygons most ones you will probably

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.970 
polygons most ones you will probably
always<00:02:28.640> want<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.630> put<00:02:29.810> on<00:02:30.020> your<00:02:30.350> shelf

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
that one the other tutorial so I will

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.600 
that one the other tutorial so I will
just<00:05:35.720> create<00:05:36.080> a<00:05:36.500> polygon<00:05:37.570> plane<00:05:39.160> one<00:05:40.160> by<00:05:40.370> one

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
just create a polygon plane one by one

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:47.049 
just create a polygon plane one by one

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:47.059 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.449 

and<00:05:48.059> I<00:05:48.179> wait<00:05:48.419> for<00:05:48.449> this<00:05:48.749> machine<00:05:48.989> alag<00:05:49.529> put<00:05:50.339> its

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:50.459 
and I wait for this machine alag put its

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:53.119 
and I wait for this machine alag put its
