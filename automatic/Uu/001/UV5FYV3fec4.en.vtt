00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.549
 before any attack by a dog or 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.830
 of the race that was the main thing is not 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.019
 act with violence so recommends it 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.119
 the veterinary in nicoletta palier and so 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.160
 himself emphasized that the confinement and 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.380
 abuse is not recommended for the 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.099
 pitbull or for any other type of 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.770
 canine race 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.960
 I would say stay calm now but 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.000
 in that moment that one was there is 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.510
 try to separate as quickly 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.850
 true not to the blows and avoid the 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.980
 screams but as I tell you is to keep the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.620
 calm until the dog releases the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.960
 person that is and derive the person 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.140
 there are no races for medical personnel 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.540
 aggressive but irresponsible owners 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.070
 First, it depends a lot on parenting 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.320
 of the puppy 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.840
 in this case good pitbull hours if the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.460
 dog was from small already locked in 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.570
 a small space was deprived of 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.570
 foods 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.610
 there was emotional abuse as much as 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.440
 physical let's make it a way like that 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.370
 there is a risk that the dog will then 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.320
 be quite aggressive with the same 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.910
 with strangers he argued that it should be 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.710
 avoid the dog's jealousy for some 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.650
 member of the family or another person 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 through daily coexistence and that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.410
 if he attacks, it is not because of evil since 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.030
 It's a puppy but you have to socialize 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.910
 you have to be has to be with others 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.010
 dogs with children you have to take it out 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.650
 ride so that in this way the animal 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.140
 can remove all their energies 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.850
 now because this is what happens, I do not know 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.030
 he gets it out he is not given the precise attention 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.550
 the puppy then he is loading 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.170
 loading of that and these happen 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.670
 incidents do not know how it's going to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.490
 reacting the dog is a means of 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.950
 defense are the teeth and legs 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.860
 then the dog to defend itself does 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.660
 that but there is not or there is no study 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.630
 That's what it does out of badness to all 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.520
 purpose is not done if you know a 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.860
 part of the cortex acts in such a way 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.010
 but like the acidity by defense of 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.200
 suddenly this child stretched his tail wta him 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.479
 stretched the ear made him more nervous 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.369
 dog then if you predispose with 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.290
