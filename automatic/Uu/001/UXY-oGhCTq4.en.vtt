00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.340 

if<00:03:51.580> you're<00:03:51.760> still<00:03:52.000> there<00:03:52.240> the<00:03:52.660> purifier<00:03:53.080> needs

if you're still there the purifier needs
to<00:03:53.500> be<00:03:53.620> activated<00:03:53.980> now<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.370> don't<00:03:54.820> have<00:03:54.940> much

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
to be activated now you don't have much

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:39.110 
to be activated now you don't have much
time<00:03:55.390> left

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.230

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.060 
discovering the fate of a father who had
once<00:04:50.530> sacrificed<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.430> future<00:04:51.820> of<00:04:51.970> humanity

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
once sacrificed the future of humanity

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.250

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
for that of his only child the capital

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.530 
for that of his only child the capital
wasteland<00:04:59.380> proved<00:05:00.160> a<00:05:00.310> cruel<00:05:00.640> inhospitable

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
wasteland proved a cruel inhospitable

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.370
