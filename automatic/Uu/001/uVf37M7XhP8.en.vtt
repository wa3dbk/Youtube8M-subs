00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:17.020
 because I'm here 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.020
 what plans of your ways that I love you 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.360
 well the truth is that I'm 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.860
 I was delighted to have been able to present my 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.779
 new single stay with her who 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.720
 follows the artist's reaction 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.220
 public has been great I had a lot 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.800
 of mariachis behind who came with me 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.900
 tonight and it was truly spectacular 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.030
 I had a great time all my life from 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.640
 that since I started making songs 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.129
 with my group because I was doing ranchera music 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.710
 I have always been good at writing 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.089
 rancheras and mariachis and so I 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.230
 fact I have had the opportunity to 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.199
 write songs for other artists 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.539
 also in this genre and it is 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.280
 fun I do not know is a beautiful genre I've 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.710
 lived so many years in Mexico 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.120
 Well nothing the truth is that I love 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.120
 play the mariachi yes or no 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.399
 the song of stay with her the truth 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.140
 that the theme is super super feminist 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.000
 I wrote together with brant claudia 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.039
 she and I when we get together to write 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.469
 songs we get things like that super 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.170
 intense and in this song we decided 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.060
 do something so as for those 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.500
 miserable men who think that 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.069
 we have to be tied to the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.170
 I do not think I've grown up 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.040
 very much as an artist as a composer 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.920
 especially 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.780
 and has surrounded me with people with a lot 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.610
 talent and with a lot of experience 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.610
 also in the world of music 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.020
 whenever I make new songs I think 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.030
 what is it that I will take if I make a 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.310
 video of that song in the show me 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.530
 I am the artist and when I have presented 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.960
 with the song of stay with her the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.730
 diadem that we wore well because I 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.780
 I say just like everyone because it's like my 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.120
 team we all have since we made it 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.760
 between the three of us we were there today 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.550
 making the diadem So , yes very much 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.290
 funny we do it all I invite you 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.670
 to buy my new album because the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.170
 truth is that it is a very different album 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.300
 if you liked it I think I stay 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.080
 with her and she will continue to surprise you 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.880
 the rest of the album 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.060
 you will also like the new 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.560
 sound I bring a mixture of sounds very 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.920
 different from what they have heard 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.020
 now in Latin music in general 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.180
 and especially because it costs a lot 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.310
 love and a lot of love for my fans that I 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.870
 they want so much, of course, 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.310
 buy my album that they will do if not 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.670
 I buy the album I have to buy 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.670
 the album
