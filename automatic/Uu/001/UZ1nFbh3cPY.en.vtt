closure and they had this actually a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.870 
closure and they had this actually a
little<00:02:38.100> net<00:02:38.430> wrapped<00:02:38.820> around<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.209> closure

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
little net wrapped around the closure

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.820
