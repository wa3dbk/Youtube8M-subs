00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.730
 summer 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.730
 all have all gardeners lovers who 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:18.840
 doing their favorite thing once or twice in 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:23.150
 week and week leave means your 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.859
 farm leaving for city to work 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:33.180
 there is a problem of airing 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:35.780
 greenhouses here last means achievement 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.899
 in this case was the use 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.000
 hydraulic cylinders 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.040
 but from the experience of using these 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.530
 hydraulic cylinders for two seasons 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.300
 it can be said that it is very unreliable 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.730
 way hydraulic cylinders fail 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.399
 Here they are expensive under 800 700 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:03.840
 rubles here and 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:08.930
 was mean was found on the internet and 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:13.080
 the idea of ​​how to use 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.600
 energy of expanding air which 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.890
 means expands in tanks under 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:26.970
 heat and motor quality 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.290
 salt use here such inflatable 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.750
 the ball is clearly visible as it means only 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.720
 worth the effort to remove and now he starts 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:44.310
 there inflate meaning there is pressure pretty 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:46.619
 serious here and so is such a 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.950
 simple and cheap design price 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.630
 such a ball made in China 45 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:58.610
 rubles here are the tin kegs 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:04.229
 they were literally found in the dustbin and 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:10.190
 here are mounted three devices mean in 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.190
 one for the sample means it was done 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.240
 opening part on top 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:22.390
 book hinges and two others 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.000
 how more efficient the hinges mean 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.950
 top opening part is not yes it 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:39.100
 more effectively also presented here 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:41.310
 the ball is right here it opens up but 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.030
 there is a heavier casement here 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.000
 so an hour after some time still 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.380
 I will put one barrel in order to 3 well 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.330
 here on the covers 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:01.660
 can be seen as using epoxy copper 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.880
 tube means fixed and done 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.920
 epoxy resin seal 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:14.080
 but she is from the other side is not visible with that 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:16.560
 side cover and here's so simple and 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.560
 cheap way 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:28.470
 but now june june is the 11th day and 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.140
 tomatoes in Siberia 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:37.720
 still weak 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:46.500
 but summer is still ahead and they will gain 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:50.550
 gain power will be very happy if someone 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.550
 This device will help
