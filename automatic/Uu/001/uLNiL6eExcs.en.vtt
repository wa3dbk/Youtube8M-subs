the radios not signal working and he was
signaling<00:01:04.309> that<00:01:04.820> he<00:01:04.940> understands<00:01:05.630> he's

an acknowledgement understanding or a
question<00:01:12.080> Danny<00:01:12.320> well<00:01:13.160> I<00:01:13.190> would<00:01:13.580> imagine<00:01:13.880> it

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
question Danny well I would imagine it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.630 
question Danny well I would imagine it
was<00:01:14.420> an<00:01:14.570> understanding<00:01:15.440> but<00:01:15.649> you<00:01:16.369> know<00:01:16.490> when

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
was an understanding but you know when

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.190 
was an understanding but you know when
you're<00:01:16.759> tucked<00:01:17.060> down<00:01:17.240> in<00:01:17.300> that<00:01:17.600> car<00:01:17.869> your

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
you're tucked down in that car your

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.170 
you're tucked down in that car your
seatbelts<00:01:18.770> are<00:01:18.890> tightened<00:01:19.280> down<00:01:19.340> it's<00:01:19.910> very

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
seatbelts are tightened down it's very

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.969 
seatbelts are tightened down it's very
difficult<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.840> get<00:01:21.020> your<00:01:21.170> hand<00:01:21.380> up<00:01:21.619> in<00:01:21.770> there

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
difficult to get your hand up in there

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.950 
difficult to get your hand up in there
it's<00:01:22.430> probably<00:01:22.640> not<00:01:22.970> an<00:01:23.090> easy<00:01:23.210> signal<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.840> do

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
it's probably not an easy signal to do

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.240 
it's probably not an easy signal to do
but<00:01:24.170> he<00:01:24.229> was<00:01:24.350> probably<00:01:24.560> giving<00:01:24.920> them<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.070> thumbs

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
but he was probably giving them a thumbs

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.240 
but he was probably giving them a thumbs
