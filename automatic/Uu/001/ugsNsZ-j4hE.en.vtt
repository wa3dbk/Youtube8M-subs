current<00:00:04.980> top<00:00:05.339> but<00:00:05.730> three<00:00:06.120> concepts<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:07.049> I

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
current top but three concepts that I

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.830 
current top but three concepts that I
found<00:00:07.560> on<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.799> web<00:00:08.069> on<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.389> galaxy<00:00:10.320> s4<00:00:10.950> so

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
found on the web on the galaxy s4 so

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.720 
found on the web on the galaxy s4 so
this<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.870> my<00:00:12.990> top<00:00:13.049> three<00:00:13.590> list<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:14.280> now<00:00:14.670> you

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
reminds you about the galaxy s3 design

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.170 
reminds you about the galaxy s3 design
it's<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.480> curved<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.250> has<00:00:50.460> improbable

bit less curves but there has a pretty
like<00:00:54.000> badass<00:00:54.510> look<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.170> especially<00:00:55.460> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
like badass look to it especially the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.760 
like badass look to it especially the
back<00:00:56.640> casing<00:00:57.000> here<00:00:57.510> looks<00:00:58.170> pretty<00:00:58.559> pretty

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
back casing here looks pretty pretty

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.040 
back casing here looks pretty pretty
magical<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.760> things<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.660> it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
magical and things like that but it

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.119 
magical and things like that but it
doesn't<00:01:01.170> seem<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.859> kind<00:01:02.039> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
doesn't seem to have this kind of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.310 
doesn't seem to have this kind of
edge-to-edge<00:01:02.370> display<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.510> home<00:01:04.049> button

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
edge-to-edge display and the home button

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.310 
edge-to-edge display and the home button
looks<00:01:04.680> kind<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.189> retarded<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> also<00:01:07.080> i

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
looks kind of retarded so and also i

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.520 
looks kind of retarded so and also i
think<00:01:08.040> at<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> top<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.600> concept<00:01:10.049> on

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
think at the top of the the concept on

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.469 
think at the top of the the concept on
the<00:01:10.770> top<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> phone<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.850> looks<00:01:12.299> pretty

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the top of the phone it looks pretty

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.380 
the top of the phone it looks pretty
weird<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.220> then<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.490> don't<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> sensors

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
weird and then you don't see the sensors

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.600 
weird and then you don't see the sensors
a<00:01:15.420> face<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:16.439> why<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.340> one

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
a face like that so that's why this one

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.570 
a face like that so that's why this one
is<00:01:17.729> coming<00:01:18.210> almost<00:01:18.720> at<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.710> end<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.100> my<00:01:20.250> or<00:01:20.549> my

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
is coming almost at the end of my or my

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.840 
is coming almost at the end of my or my
top<00:01:21.270> three<00:01:21.600> list<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.549> the

top three list and this one is at the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.749 
top three list and this one is at the

love the galaxy s2 design and this is

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.359 
love the galaxy s2 design and this is
this<00:01:38.159> concept<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.210> coming<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:39.990> alessio<00:01:40.680> 94

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
galaxy s2 but with the galaxy s3 design

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.760 
galaxy s2 but with the galaxy s3 design
with<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> more<00:01:51.630> curved<00:01:52.170> galaxy

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
with like it's like a more curved galaxy

with like it's like a more curved galaxy
s<00:01:53.390> galaxy<00:01:54.390> s2<00:01:54.479> actually<00:01:55.290> love<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.470> off<00:01:55.920> and

that I do like the most right now is a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.030 
that I do like the most right now is a
badass<00:02:12.579> concept<00:02:13.390> from<00:02:14.319> raul<00:02:15.720> sharma<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.040> at

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
badass concept from raul sharma and at

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.990 
badass concept from raul sharma and at
role<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:19.379> 9688<00:02:20.379> he<00:02:20.860> has<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:20.980> facebook<00:02:21.430> s<00:02:21.579> why<00:02:21.730> he

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
role in 9688 he has a facebook s why he

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.449 
role in 9688 he has a facebook s why he
asked<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.360> see<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.720> also<00:02:22.810> about<00:02:23.049> me<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.860> page

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
asked you see and also about me a page

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.539 
asked you see and also about me a page
but<00:02:25.060> i<00:02:25.780> thought<00:02:26.110> this<00:02:26.170> concept<00:02:26.680> was<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:27.099> clearly

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
but i thought this concept was a clearly

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.550 
but i thought this concept was a clearly
the<00:02:27.640> winner<00:02:27.819> because<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.750> can<00:02:28.930> really<00:02:29.049> see<00:02:29.379> it

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
the winner because you can really see it

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.140 
the winner because you can really see it
it<00:02:29.769> seems<00:02:29.980> like<00:02:30.189> they<00:02:30.310> put<00:02:30.489> some<00:02:30.670> time<00:02:30.879> into

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
it seems like they put some time into

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.270 
it seems like they put some time into
doing<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.569> concept<00:02:32.109> and<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.769> also<00:02:32.980> looks

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
doing this concept and it also looks

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.949 
doing this concept and it also looks
like<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.489> phone<00:02:33.819> is<00:02:34.090> having<00:02:34.299> 5-inch<00:02:34.900> display

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
like the phone is having 5-inch display

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.920 
like the phone is having 5-inch display
which<00:02:35.769> is<00:02:35.799> one<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.250> those<00:02:36.430> rumors<00:02:36.939> about<00:02:37.840> the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
which is one of those rumors about the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.009 
which is one of those rumors about the
galaxy<00:02:38.260> s4<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.650> will<00:02:38.920> come<00:02:39.459> around<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:40.030> kind

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
galaxy s4 that will come around the kind

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.339 
galaxy s4 that will come around the kind
of<00:02:41.079> April<00:02:41.560> timeframe<00:02:42.159> in<00:02:42.480> 2013<00:02:43.480> with<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.019> little

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
of April timeframe in 2013 with a little

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.440 
of April timeframe in 2013 with a little
bit<00:02:44.470> more<00:02:44.739> like<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.069> badass<00:02:45.340> look<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:46.030> little<00:02:46.299> bit

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
bit more like a badass look a little bit

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.180 
bit more like a badass look a little bit
more<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.750> an<00:02:46.810> edge<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:46.989> edge<00:02:47.230> displaying<00:02:47.739> like

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
more of an edge to edge displaying like

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.550 
more of an edge to edge displaying like
the<00:02:48.370> chips<00:02:48.670> at<00:02:48.849> maybe<00:02:49.060> Exynos<00:02:49.389> 5<00:02:49.629> 50<00:02:50.170> for<00:02:50.349> 50

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
the chips at maybe Exynos 5 50 for 50

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.449 
the chips at maybe Exynos 5 50 for 50
and<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:52.239> this<00:02:52.659> concept<00:02:53.109> I<00:02:53.230> think<00:02:53.470> this<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.859> too

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
and so this concept I think this is too

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.460 
and so this concept I think this is too
awesome<00:02:54.609> it<00:02:54.970> seems<00:02:55.150> like<00:02:55.359> it's<00:02:55.599> very<00:02:56.019> well

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
awesome it seems like it's very well

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.699 
awesome it seems like it's very well
edited<00:02:57.040> has<00:02:57.849> a<00:02:57.879> lot<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.780> looks<00:02:58.959> like<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.200> you

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
edited has a lot of it looks like a you

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.190 
edited has a lot of it looks like a you
know<00:02:59.739> an<00:02:59.920> updated<00:03:00.400> galaxy<00:03:00.879> s3<00:03:01.359> but<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:01.810> little

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
know an updated galaxy s3 but a little

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.530 
know an updated galaxy s3 but a little
bit<00:03:02.290> more<00:03:02.560> like<00:03:02.859> a<00:03:02.889> like<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> badass<00:03:03.549> can<00:03:04.299> look

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
bit more like a like a badass can look

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.539 
bit more like a like a badass can look
and<00:03:04.810> also<00:03:05.019> they<00:03:05.230> had<00:03:05.439> a<00:03:05.680> lot<00:03:05.920> more<00:03:06.159> pictures

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
and also they had a lot more pictures

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.759 
and also they had a lot more pictures
here<00:03:06.790> showing<00:03:07.450> off<00:03:07.659> the<00:03:07.870> column<00:03:08.109> in<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.319> UI<00:03:08.590> it

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
here showing off the column in the UI it

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.170 
here showing off the column in the UI it
seems<00:03:09.099> like<00:03:09.280> they<00:03:09.400> really<00:03:09.579> put<00:03:09.819> some<00:03:09.909> time

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
seems like they really put some time

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.050 
seems like they really put some time
into<00:03:10.389> doing<00:03:10.720> this<00:03:10.840> concept<00:03:11.319> and<00:03:11.549> then<00:03:12.549> almost

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
into doing this concept and then almost

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.000 
into doing this concept and then almost
seems<00:03:13.329> like<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.599> has<00:03:13.720> dual<00:03:14.019> cameras<00:03:14.620> there<00:03:14.829> at

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
seems like it has dual cameras there at

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.349 
seems like it has dual cameras there at
the<00:03:15.129> front<00:03:15.250> which<00:03:15.579> we're<00:03:15.819> probably<00:03:16.090> not<00:03:16.239> going

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
the front which we're probably not going

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.809 
the front which we're probably not going
to<00:03:16.449> see<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.870> also<00:03:17.560> seems<00:03:17.919> like<00:03:18.069> that<00:03:18.280> speakers

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
to see and also seems like that speakers

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.909 
to see and also seems like that speakers
there<00:03:19.060> on<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.299> front<00:03:19.449> on<00:03:19.989> both<00:03:20.260> which<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.739> of

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
there on the front on both which is of

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:22.470 
there on the front on both which is of
course<00:03:20.949> good<00:03:21.489> because<00:03:21.790> then<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.090> don't<00:03:22.120> have

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
course good because then you don't have

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.710 
course good because then you don't have
to<00:03:22.660> turn<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.769> phone<00:03:24.040> around<00:03:24.549> every<00:03:25.180> time<00:03:25.419> when

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
to turn the phone around every time when

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.689 
to turn the phone around every time when
you<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.109> know<00:03:26.139> play<00:03:26.500> music<00:03:26.919> or<00:03:27.069> something

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:27.699 
you you know play music or something

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.369 
you you know play music or something
like<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.090> seems<00:03:28.449> like<00:03:28.599> it's<00:03:28.750> rocking<00:03:29.169> son

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
like that seems like it's rocking son

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.220 
like that seems like it's rocking son
can<00:03:29.560> Oh<00:03:29.590> Andrew<00:03:30.340> five<00:03:30.639> or<00:03:30.819> something<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.389> if

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
can Oh Andrew five or something and if

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.199 
can Oh Andrew five or something and if
go<00:03:32.440> ahead<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:32.949> continue<00:03:33.190> here<00:03:33.819> we<00:03:33.970> can<00:03:34.090> also

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
go ahead and continue here we can also

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.020 
go ahead and continue here we can also
see<00:03:34.389> some<00:03:34.419> more<00:03:34.840> pictures<00:03:35.109> here<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.879> I<00:03:36.879> mean

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
see some more pictures here and I mean

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.490 
see some more pictures here and I mean
like<00:03:37.180> I<00:03:37.239> think<00:03:37.389> I<00:03:37.720> think<00:03:38.019> it's<00:03:38.109> kind<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.319> cool

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
like I think I think it's kind of cool

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.800 
like I think I think it's kind of cool
that<00:03:38.699> they've<00:03:39.699> been<00:03:39.879> doing<00:03:40.090> this<00:03:40.180> concept<00:03:40.629> and

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
that they've been doing this concept and

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.490 
that they've been doing this concept and
it<00:03:41.199> I<00:03:41.470> think<00:03:41.530> looks<00:03:41.859> amazing<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:44.290> also

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
it I think looks amazing so and also

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.589 
it I think looks amazing so and also
that<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:45.069> back<00:03:45.280> looks<00:03:45.579> extremely<00:03:46.090> shooting

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
that the back looks extremely shooting

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.569 
that the back looks extremely shooting
more<00:03:46.780> curved<00:03:47.229> and<00:03:47.440> also<00:03:47.889> that<00:03:48.010> device<00:03:48.310> looks

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
more curved and also that device looks

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.330 
more curved and also that device looks
thinner<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:50.049> what<00:03:50.859> do<00:03:50.919> you<00:03:50.979> think<00:03:51.159> of<00:03:51.250> this

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
thinner so what do you think of this

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.399
