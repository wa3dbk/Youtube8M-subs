00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.149 
like that and the reason I don't like to
have<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.170> two<00:01:31.320> different<00:01:31.470> ones<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.920> when<00:01:32.070> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
have it two different ones is when you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.420 
have it two different ones is when you
slide<00:01:32.780> then<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.170> kind<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.590> ruins<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> effect

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
slide then it kind of ruins the effect

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.020 
slide then it kind of ruins the effect
of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> sliding<00:01:36.390> icons<00:01:36.810> which<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.530> kind<00:01:37.799> of

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
of the sliding icons which is kind of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.219 
of the sliding icons which is kind of
which<00:01:39.030> didn't<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.659> justice<00:01:39.750> with

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
which didn't really do it justice with

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.789 
which didn't really do it justice with
that<00:01:40.380> picture<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:41.369> uh<00:01:42.350> which<00:01:43.350> use<00:01:43.649> it

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
that picture but uh which use it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.960 
that picture but uh which use it
differently<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.460> actually<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.820> can

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
differently here and actually you can

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.060 
differently here and actually you can
download<00:01:45.149> others<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.890> here's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
download others like I have so here's

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.190 
download others like I have so here's
what<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.430> really<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.360> go<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:48.840> says

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
what I really like and go in here says

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.510 
what I really like and go in here says
both<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.869> there<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.990> go<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.409> that's<00:01:52.860> about<00:01:53.009> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
both and there you go and that's about a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.760 
both and there you go and that's about a
really<00:01:54.450> simple<00:01:54.750> tutorial<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.350> how<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> change

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
really simple tutorial on how to change

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.310 
really simple tutorial on how to change
this<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.719> simple<00:01:57.960> once<00:01:58.259> you

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
this I know it is really simple once you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.109 
this I know it is really simple once you
figure<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.189> thought<00:01:59.430> people

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
figure it out but I thought people

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270 
figure it out but I thought people
really<00:02:00.540> need<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.780> know<00:02:00.869> how<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.439> so

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
really need to know how to do this so

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.670 
really need to know how to do this so
that<00:02:02.310> way<00:02:03.170> they're<00:02:04.170> not<00:02:04.200> constantly

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
that way they're not constantly

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.810 
that way they're not constantly
wondering<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.310> notice<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.670> is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
wondering and if you notice this is

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.069 
wondering and if you notice this is
actually<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> bug<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.570> didn't<00:02:06.750> mean<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:07.049> this

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
actually a bug I didn't mean to do this

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.589 
actually a bug I didn't mean to do this
but<00:02:07.710> that's<00:02:08.160> actually<00:02:08.399> my<00:02:08.879> lockscreen<00:02:09.390> I

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
but that's actually my lockscreen I

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.300 
but that's actually my lockscreen I
don't<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.590> that's

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
don't know if you can see that that's

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.210 
don't know if you can see that that's
pretty<00:02:11.640> funny<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.090> anyway<00:02:12.629> I'm<00:02:12.750> not<00:02:12.900> going<00:02:13.050> to

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
pretty funny but anyway I'm not going to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.310 
pretty funny but anyway I'm not going to
I'm<00:02:13.370> not<00:02:13.550> refuse<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:13.940> reshoot<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:14.510> video<00:02:14.810> so

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
I'm not refuse to reshoot this video so

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.930 
I'm not refuse to reshoot this video so
i<00:02:15.380> can<00:02:15.410> go<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.740> here<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.220> i<00:02:16.610> can<00:02:16.640> choose

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
i can go in here and i can choose

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.120 
i can go in here and i can choose
another<00:02:16.970> one<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:17.750> that's<00:02:18.620> actually<00:02:18.830> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
another one so that's actually the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.330 
another one so that's actually the
original<00:02:19.220> wallpaper<00:02:19.790> it's<00:02:20.270> pretty<00:02:20.510> funny<00:02:20.690> but

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
original wallpaper it's pretty funny but

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.150 
original wallpaper it's pretty funny but
to<00:02:22.340> something<00:02:22.580> else<00:02:22.760> here<00:02:23.060> pretty<00:02:24.020> cool<00:02:24.200> set

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
to something else here pretty cool set

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.470 
to something else here pretty cool set
both<00:02:26.050> closed<00:02:27.050> out<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:28.160> that's<00:02:28.910> about<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.210> and

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
both closed out and that's about it and

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.540 
both closed out and that's about it and
that<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.200> basically<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.860> simplest<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.490> things

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
that is basically the simplest of things

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.820 
that is basically the simplest of things
you<00:02:31.850> can<00:02:32.000> do<00:02:32.090> on<00:02:32.120> iOS<00:02:32.660> 4.1<00:02:33.140> oh<00:02:33.350> there's<00:02:33.530> tons

you can do on iOS 4.1 oh there's tons

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.500 
you can do on iOS 4.1 oh there's tons
more<00:02:33.980> but<00:02:34.730> i<00:02:34.790> thought<00:02:34.970> this<00:02:35.030> could<00:02:35.330> really

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
more but i thought this could really
