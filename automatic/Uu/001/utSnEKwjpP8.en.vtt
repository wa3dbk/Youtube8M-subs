00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.480
 hello everyone you are watching but in with you 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 valerian before you t-64 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.460
 main battle tank 4 levels immediately 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.119
 worth noting a good booking 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.269
 tank in the forehead of the tower 320 millimeters 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.760
 sides 260 combined with round shape this 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.980
 gives us very good performance 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.469
 reduced armor and hull vld has 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.590
 good slope and two hundred and five millimeters 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.780
 plus on t-64 combined 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.149
 armor that gives a good advantage in 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.250
 combat cumulative shells when 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.980
 hitting the tower cumulative will need 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.770
 punch no longer 320 millimeters and 35 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.440
 percent more which corresponds to 4 130 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.570
 millimeters in case of a reservation 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.480
 increases by 50 percent and this is no longer 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.520
 two hundred and five millimeters from 307 it all 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.379
 allows you to tank and play well 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.180
 towers but do not get too substituted 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.000
 since the enemy still has a chance 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.939
 cause damage if it hits the proceeds or 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.670
 breaks through the mask of the gun but by mobility 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.320
 the T-64 is not so good though 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 top speed and stated on 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.030
 around 61 kilometers per hour 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.509
 the tank is gaining and and very reluctantly acceleration 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.970
 up to 32 km per hour is 8 seconds and this 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.920
 pretty slow besides the tank is not 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.720
 especially keeps the gained speed and she 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.640
 will fall when maneuvering 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.950
 by the way maneuvering is also nothing 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.130
 stands out for tank steering 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.439
 pretty low 64 reviews equals 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.299
 300 96 meters and stealth coefficient 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.540
 is 011 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.299
 Now let's talk about the tank gun 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.189
 t-64 is set to 115 millimeter 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.590
 smooth-bore gun with pretty 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.450
 good parameters aiming time 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.040
 three and a half seconds time 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.020
 recharge just over eight with 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.619
 half seconds declination angles 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.570
 plus 16 minus 6 down the gun goes down not 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.920
 very well and it is worth considering in 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.899
 certain situations 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.860
 gun can shoot three types 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.020
 ammunition 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.960
 This is a standard set of sabers 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.280
 shells cumulative and high-explosive 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.220
 caliber shells and we are pretty 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.690
 good one-time damage of 350 units 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.530
 breaking through in two hundred thirty nine 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.630
 millimeters 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.330
 case of cumulative pierce and 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.580
 becomes even less but the damage increases 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.830
 up to 400 60 units 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.890
 which is very, very good for that 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.210
 level only low armor penetration 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.160
 leaves its mark in the case of 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.590
 games against enemy bt likely 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.990
 you will have to target vulnerable points a 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.850
 Here you are against lightly armored targets. 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:44.040
 you can safely charge cumulative and 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.720
 do quite good damage by the way yet 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.600
 a little about dynamics and speed 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.310
 tank movements since the t-64 in 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.350
 average rides at a speed of 30 kilometers 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.810
 in an hour you should choose carefully 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.820
 attack direction so how do you if 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.100
 go there and you will be required 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.320
 change the location on your map 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.570
 it takes a lot of time for which 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.300
 your allies will have time to suffer hard 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.250
 or worse, it will completely evaporate so 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.740
 look more closely at the map and in 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.630
 time make decisions now 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.910
 let's talk a little more about the tank gun 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.890
 his rate of fire and accuracy 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.500
 makes it very comfortable to fight on 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.300
 near and middle distances and without 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.440
 problems target the right places at 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.140
 enemy technology 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.300
 here's a great example of enemy t-64 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.860
 left but not quite right for me 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.750
 manage to put it on the rink with 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.850
 causing damage and rate of fire 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.470
 guns without problems allows it 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.570
 hold in that position but all this 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.370
 fair and in the opposite direction so 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.390
 if you do not have a market and you are not neat 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.370
 drove out of the corner 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.710
 then you risk being exactly the same 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.220
 situation can only save you 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.050
 an ally if he distracts from you 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.700
 otherwise you go to the hangar 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.800
 As for shooting at large 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.320
 the distance then the accuracy of the gun is quite 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.870
 enough though periodically and will 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.660
 happen slips and finally talk 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.260
 a little about the review of the tank he had nothing 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.970
 does not stand out and is 300 96 meters 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.680
 so it will be very useful to close 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.600
 there was a technique with you that sees 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.060
 much better and able to provide you 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.450
 intelligence data otherwise you risk a lot 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.549
 so that you can be sent to the hangar 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.690
 but never know who it is for you 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.040
 fired 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.680
 well let's summarize 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.740
 t-64 is not very bad tank for your 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.020
 level has a good tool good 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.940
 booking and tolerable dynamics but 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.580
 most likely he will remain for you 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.289
 I didnâ€™t notice how I played on it 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.080
 any difficulties and with ease 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.090
 I got to the next t-64 tank 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.270
 left myself pretty positive 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.460
 impressions and on this i finish my 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.259
 review so the tank subscribe to 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.449
 channel and not to miss new ones 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.449
 interesting issues and see you soon
