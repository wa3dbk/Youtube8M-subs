issues in fact I was at work one day and

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:09.999 
issues in fact I was at work one day and
I<00:01:08.329> had<00:01:08.479> my<00:01:08.659> phone<00:01:08.869> I<00:01:09.109> was<00:01:09.259> actually<00:01:09.590> pulling<00:01:09.799> up

I had my phone I was actually pulling up
to<00:01:10.130> work<00:01:10.340> I<00:01:10.609> had<00:01:10.969> my<00:01:11.119> phone<00:01:11.270> in<00:01:11.509> my<00:01:11.539> lap<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.079> I

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
to work I had my phone in my lap and I

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.050 
to work I had my phone in my lap and I
stood<00:01:12.679> up<00:01:12.740> my<00:01:13.130> phone<00:01:13.340> hit<00:01:13.549> the<00:01:13.639> ground<00:01:13.850> that

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
stood up my phone hit the ground that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.230 
stood up my phone hit the ground that
bouncing<00:01:14.479> off<00:01:14.569> like<00:01:14.749> oh<00:01:14.899> it<00:01:15.259> went<00:01:15.709> face-first

bouncing off like oh it went face-first
no<00:01:17.240> issues<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.679> think<00:01:18.709> this<00:01:19.130> case<00:01:19.340> has<00:01:19.369> a

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
no issues and I think this case has a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.359 
no issues and I think this case has a
lot<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.029> do<00:01:20.149> with<00:01:20.359> it<00:01:20.539> that<00:01:20.689> being<00:01:21.590> said<00:01:21.859> this

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
lot to do with it that being said this

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.989 
lot to do with it that being said this
case<00:01:22.639> can<00:01:22.850> be<00:01:22.969> a<00:01:22.999> little<00:01:23.209> bulky<00:01:23.689> at<00:01:23.779> times<00:01:24.049> and

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:24.999 
case can be a little bulky at times and

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:26.859 
case can be a little bulky at times and
particularly<00:01:25.999> right<00:01:26.240> around<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.689> edges

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
particularly right around the edges

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.779 
particularly right around the edges

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
it can make it uncomfortable and it also

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:34.269 
it can make it uncomfortable and it also
can<00:01:32.299> cause<00:01:32.689> issues<00:01:33.020> coming<00:01:33.590> in<00:01:33.859> out<00:01:34.039> of<00:01:34.069> your

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
because I forgot to pull it out before I

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.959 
because I forgot to pull it out before I
got<00:01:47.990> in<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.560> it's<00:01:48.950> hard<00:01:49.159> to<00:01:49.340> get<00:01:49.490> out<00:01:49.520> because

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
got in and it's hard to get out because

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.909 
got in and it's hard to get out because
this<00:01:50.209> case<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.659> just<00:01:50.929> so<00:01:51.109> bulky<00:01:51.560> around<00:01:51.649> the

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:51.919 
this case is just so bulky around the

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:54.249 
this case is just so bulky around the
edges<00:01:52.279> so<00:01:52.909> I<00:01:53.149> decided<00:01:53.689> I<00:01:53.810> wanted<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.109> try

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
edges so I decided I wanted to try

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.800 
edges so I decided I wanted to try
something<00:01:54.499> a<00:01:54.649> little<00:01:54.679> thinner<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:55.490> in<00:01:56.479> pops

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
something a little thinner and in pops

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.289 
something a little thinner and in pops
the<00:01:57.429> spigen<00:01:58.429> slim<00:01:59.329> Armour<00:01:59.630> s<00:01:59.869> which<00:02:00.499> is<00:02:00.969> a<00:02:01.969> lot

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
the spigen slim Armour s which is a lot

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.969 
the spigen slim Armour s which is a lot
of<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.539> same<00:02:02.749> features<00:02:03.200> of<00:02:03.529> this<00:02:03.649> particular

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
of the same features of this particular

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.789 
of the same features of this particular
case<00:02:04.279> but<00:02:04.489> it<00:02:04.579> promises<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:05.090> be<00:02:05.499> much<00:02:06.499> thinner

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
case but it promises to be much thinner

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.020 
case but it promises to be much thinner
and<00:02:07.099> much<00:02:08.030> sleeker<00:02:08.470> let's<00:02:09.470> see<00:02:09.680> what

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
it said slim armor it's just like a

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.390 
it said slim armor it's just like a
sticker<00:04:16.299> it's<00:04:17.019> kind<00:04:17.200> of<00:04:17.260> just<00:04:17.410> not<00:04:18.070> sticker

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
sticker it's kind of just not sticker

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.310 
sticker it's kind of just not sticker
but<00:04:18.640> it's<00:04:18.789> not<00:04:19.030> on<00:04:19.239> there<00:04:19.479> it's<00:04:19.870> gonna<00:04:20.140> come

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
but it's not on there it's gonna come

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.530 
but it's not on there it's gonna come
off<00:04:20.470> it's<00:04:20.680> gonna<00:04:20.769> rub<00:04:20.979> off

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
off it's gonna rub off

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.620 
off it's gonna rub off
not<00:04:22.170> a<00:04:22.200> huge<00:04:22.590> gripe<00:04:22.980> for<00:04:23.520> $15<00:04:24.210> but<00:04:24.420> I<00:04:24.450> would

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
not a huge gripe for $15 but I would

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.450 
not a huge gripe for $15 but I would
have<00:04:24.720> liked<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:24.870> have<00:04:25.020> seen<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.350> machine<00:04:26.250> to

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
have liked to have seen that machine to

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.410 
have liked to have seen that machine to
something<00:04:26.850> versus<00:04:27.720> on<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:29.010> tough<00:04:29.250> armor<00:04:29.730> it's

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
something versus on the tough armor it's

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.710 
something versus on the tough armor it's
actually<00:04:31.080> in<00:04:31.290> there<00:04:31.830> is<00:04:32.790> embossed<00:04:33.270> until<00:04:33.660> the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
actually in there is embossed until the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.690 
actually in there is embossed until the
plastic<00:04:33.930> go<00:04:34.230> so<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.410> think<00:04:34.500> that's<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:35.130> nicer

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
plastic go so I think that's a nicer

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.840 
plastic go so I think that's a nicer
setup<00:04:36.740> should<00:04:37.740> going<00:04:38.100> pretty<00:04:38.310> much<00:04:38.400> exactly

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
setup should going pretty much exactly

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.950 
setup should going pretty much exactly
the<00:04:39.090> same<00:04:39.740> goes<00:04:40.740> in<00:04:41.310> get<00:04:42.150> all<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.420> corners

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
the same goes in get all the corners

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.400 
the same goes in get all the corners
holy<00:04:43.680> smokes<00:04:44.160> like<00:04:45.090> 30<00:04:45.360> messages<00:04:45.600> popped<00:04:46.170> up

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
holy smokes like 30 messages popped up

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.700 
holy smokes like 30 messages popped up
and<00:04:46.620> then<00:04:47.160> once<00:04:47.850> it's<00:04:48.060> on<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.870> line<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.320> up<00:04:49.440> and

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
and then once it's on you line it up and

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.740 
and then once it's on you line it up and
you<00:04:50.100> can<00:04:50.250> put<00:04:50.460> this<00:04:50.580> on<00:04:50.790> one<00:04:51.030> of<00:04:51.090> two<00:04:51.210> ways<00:04:51.510> you

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
you can put this on one of two ways you

piece if you all just top the phone in

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.520

that's<00:05:05.190> your<00:05:05.370> preference<00:05:05.870> from<00:05:06.870> first<00:05:07.200> feel

that's your preference from first feel

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.610 
that's your preference from first feel
this<00:05:08.130> feels<00:05:08.460> so<00:05:08.880> much<00:05:09.090> better<00:05:09.360> and<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:10.290> can't

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
this feels so much better and I can't

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.200 
this feels so much better and I can't
explain<00:05:10.860> it<00:05:10.980> does<00:05:11.280> make<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.610> phone<00:05:11.820> feel

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
explain it does make the phone feel

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.110 
explain it does make the phone feel
lighter<00:05:12.540> and<00:05:13.500> better<00:05:14.250> doesn't<00:05:14.580> always<00:05:14.880> mean

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
lighter and better doesn't always mean

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.910 
lighter and better doesn't always mean
more<00:05:15.180> protection<00:05:15.870> but<00:05:16.080> it<00:05:16.200> does<00:05:16.380> feel<00:05:16.680> better

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
more protection but it does feel better

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.510 
more protection but it does feel better
in<00:05:17.160> my<00:05:17.280> hand<00:05:17.550> I<00:05:18.240> it<00:05:19.080> doesn't<00:05:19.500> feel<00:05:19.740> any<00:05:20.010> slicker

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
in my hand I it doesn't feel any slicker

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.920 
in my hand I it doesn't feel any slicker
I<00:05:20.670> thought<00:05:20.880> it<00:05:21.000> might<00:05:21.150> feel<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.390> little<00:05:21.480> slicker

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
I thought it might feel a little slicker

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.560 
I thought it might feel a little slicker
but<00:05:22.590> it<00:05:22.710> does<00:05:22.890> not<00:05:23.100> so<00:05:23.640> it's<00:05:23.850> a<00:05:23.970> very<00:05:24.270> nice

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
but it does not so it's a very nice

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.230 
but it does not so it's a very nice
feeling<00:05:24.900> product<00:05:25.580> I'll<00:05:26.580> wear<00:05:26.850> it<00:05:26.880> for<00:05:27.030> a

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
feeling product I'll wear it for a

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.730 
feeling product I'll wear it for a
little<00:05:27.480> while<00:05:27.630> let<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.110> guys<00:05:28.260> know<00:05:28.530> what<00:05:28.650> I

little while let you guys know what I

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.480 
little while let you guys know what I
think<00:05:29.010> if<00:05:29.220> you<00:05:29.400> even<00:05:29.640> care<00:05:29.760> to<00:05:30.510> learn<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:30.810> note

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
think if you even care to learn the note

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.040 
think if you even care to learn the note
everything's<00:05:32.490> lined<00:05:32.790> up<00:05:33.030> looks<00:05:33.360> pretty<00:05:33.870> good
