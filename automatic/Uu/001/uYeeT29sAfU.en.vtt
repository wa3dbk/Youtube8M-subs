00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.019
 world and good people today I want to teach 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.299
 You guys are going to make a tnt pitcher well. 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.279
 cool but before tell man leave the joinha 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.470
 Let's see if we can get at least 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.180
 at 1000 lights a would be really cool and 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.650
 would be an important incentive point as well 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.859
 so it already leaves I liked it 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.730
 although there this mc very cool pitcher 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.980
 why people 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.070
 remembering that you can only use it 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.280
 1.8 or better saying in shopping nep 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.989
 is finally being the last sex shops 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.590
 and put so striking is already going to give 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.629
 right 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.640
 Good first let me show you 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.640
 You do not know how the scheme works. 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.860
 saw it is a slide- based system 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.590
 blocks which is the new block there that holds 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.960
 several functions and this is just the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.799
 first of many 2 seconds actually 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 is that there was already one of the troll there the use of this 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:13.619
 block to do once again how to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.049
 works here at the tnt dispensary 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.960
 This low part poet goes forward. 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.030
 good people this system is very easy to 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.909
 TAAG only do you not err in a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.340
 part of all Argentine teams because 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.409
 What will make this work the time? 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.240
 of repeaters is on the side that is already 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.970
 To make the time for you. 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.720
 put any block there may itself the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:45.540
 right little button which will make it go 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.670
 linking a redstone here above may 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.960
 put repeater here and if repeated as 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.079
 You're seeing here. He's going to have to 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.860
 stay at maximum right at most 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.820
 and here goes your first are missing 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.820
 slime bloch 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.630
 that already can put the islaine good block 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.890
 You can go alone and fire to see if 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.770
 everything is alright 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.830
 Beauty, all right here. 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.420
 there is something very important for you 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.100
 at the time you are putting this 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.450
 dispensers and dispensing will have to stay 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.270
 above the blog design 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.220
 Just do not leave those two behind. 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.180
 Blocks here why why not 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.370
 to function 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.630
 in the blog he gets stuck to the blocks of 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.810
 back then break the two right there 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.209
 broke the two can test here again 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.680
 if I always like pressing the button 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.260
 to see if everything is right 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.660
 There you go and do what the guys are going to do now. 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.760
 have to place the second competitor and 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.810
 second with be seen there you go 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.800
 put in this medium and it may be in the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.690
 Minimum 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.050
 after placing a block here at 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:03:02.209
 People are going to have to call now 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:04.280
 dispenses for some reason here 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.080
 People, I made this block here. 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.600
 But it does not have to be. 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.350
 The way I'm doing, it's not wrong. 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.390
 also 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.209
 so it is even getting more 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.519
 under it but finally let's go the tutorial 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.480
 Now we're going to do what we 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:23.209
 You can call here here, we can 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.710
 put any block just to give a 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.740
 tested right 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.190
 You have already seen that the little paddle flies. 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.190
 from jack 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.020
 Come on, it's all right, it's ready fans. 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.820
 will go there 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.010
 Now we're going to have to do what the 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.510
 Second International Tristan going 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.540
 be an option that will give a boost to 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.310
 forward to they will do what you 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.410
 They will tell the guys look at that here is 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.920
 very important how to make two blocks 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.920
 above the dispensing exactly two blocks 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.630
 two blocks there you can even put the 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.870
 slime here already let him go after the 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.110
 laine is going to put a block down 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:12.530
 the back design ready put can 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.910
 take now increases 3 ac and puts the 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.300
 the first environment where they are today 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:22.770
 will come here to islaine there will you 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.880
 put the story here a rate of 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.070
 return here 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.710
 but calm people will activate now more 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.260
 People are going to make some paranÃ¡ It's okay to 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.060
 it will disable how we're going to do 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.090
 you can place a row that does not 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.970
 are making you will break going 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.770
 placing blocks until it is disabled 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.890
 You saw it here now you go. 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.350
 imagine a guy but it went wrong there 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.830
 because it is activated can not be done 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.750
 so it breaks one more down simple 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.320
 You fixed now that we're going to have to 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:05:00.470
 Do that will work on it here now 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:03.000
 always remembering the times are here 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.750
 sooou repeater that will put here is 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.680
 The first one I'll put here is going to be the 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.630
 first 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.620
 now you can call forth ever 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:19.670
 I broke the beauty actor there. 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:23.120
 The pilot remembering guys never test. 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.490
 with dnt because it might be that 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.470
 come wrong and you will end up with 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:32.390
 then I'll use a block myself 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:34.100
 I want this so here in the wood where 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.230
 it's working so you have 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.600
 that make the adjustments but that the people 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:42.860
 finds the right time 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.770
 so come on O you may be 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:49.790
 going wrong may be because the blocks 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.140
 of wood they are not the same 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.640
 tnt size 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.480
 I'm going to suck, gotta have you. 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:59.240
 hardcore'll believe in God here woman 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.700
 because if you go wrong you will be ugly in the 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.510
 video 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.880
 let's hope it works out the worked 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.400
 until he gives a bath he does not ice my heart 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.250
 But that's a 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.720
 The tutorial can do several times here 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:20.060
 oh, it's going to work 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.130

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.690
 But then, guys, what's up? 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.640

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.310
