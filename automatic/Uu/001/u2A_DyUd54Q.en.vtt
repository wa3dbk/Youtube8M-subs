00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.360
 what I have in my hand is axis 6 and there 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.740
 we dedicate a very fast video this 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.320
 samsung product because all the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.239
 the technical characteristics are the same 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.410
 of the s6 then gives you review the 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.320
 video of the same ours 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.759
 deepening to deepen precisely 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.340
 all the features of these new 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.730
 top of the range with respect to mental s6 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.489
 reads at rounded edges either from one 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.590
 part that on the other hand then we describe 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.769
 very quickly we always have a 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.579
 precious design with glass front e 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.600
 and a metal frame behind the button 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.249
 home 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.050
 below with the two touch keys 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.550
 in the right edge despite being 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.399
 we have thinned even more 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.640
 always the power button and in the 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:04.580
 left side double button for 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.409
 the volume the compartment for the sim card is 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.360
 moved over here because actually 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.560
 there was not enough on this side 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.020
 space 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.040
 we have a door and it's below we have 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.610
 still the 3.5 mm jack and the territory 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.700
 which hides the speaker behind 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.680
 always camera and glass surface 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.520
 with LED flash 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.159
 a product that is even more to the touch 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.420
 precious compared to s6 then this is 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.330
 broken enemy of surfaces 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.860
 and makes it even smaller at least at 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.909
 view because it is actually the same 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.920
 but what gives the feeling 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.250
 actually having a 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.189
 s6 compact phone and also in this one 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.240
 In case you don't know the prices I remind you 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.920
 to go further 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.740
 the technical characteristics are the same 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.330
 of the s6 found somewhere here in 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.200
 overlay the link for another video 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.200
 to the next hello
