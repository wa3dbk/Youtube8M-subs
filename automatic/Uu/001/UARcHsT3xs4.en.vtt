every type of Mobb some mobs really have
a<00:00:37.770> hard<00:00:38.010> time<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> hard

time<00:00:39.660> killing<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.410> because<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:41.520> their

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
time killing with it because just their

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.830 
time killing with it because just their
passing<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.420> how<00:00:42.540> they<00:00:42.719> react<00:00:43.230> there<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> i<00:00:43.559> ah

passing and how they react there a i ah
so<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.320> not<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.590> best<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.219> every<00:00:47.460> modern

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.260 
either charge or leap and that's gonna
round<00:02:35.870> out<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.320> build<00:02:36.560> in<00:02:36.860> my<00:02:37.010> opinion<00:02:37.340> to

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
round out the build in my opinion to

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.930 
round out the build in my opinion to
make<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:39.290> easier<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.130> survive<00:02:40.610> because

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
make it just easier to survive because

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.900 
make it just easier to survive because

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
things like Waller jailer you know

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.140 
things like Waller jailer you know
anything<00:02:44.390> that's<00:02:44.570> getting<00:02:45.200> up<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.770> and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
anything that's getting up on you and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.790 
anything that's getting up on you and

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
won't allow you to escape having those

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.910 
won't allow you to escape having those
two<00:02:49.070> escapes<00:02:49.430> either<00:02:49.670> one<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:49.910> could<00:02:50.150> pick

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
two escapes either one you could pick

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.470 
two escapes either one you could pick
charged<00:02:51.920> with<00:02:52.250> dread<00:02:52.700> not<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.180> can<00:02:53.300> heal

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
charged with dread not so you can heal

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.780 
charged with dread not so you can heal
up<00:02:53.690> or<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.350> can<00:02:54.470> have<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.620> leap<00:02:54.920> personally<00:02:55.730> I

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
up or you can have a leap personally I

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.950 
up or you can have a leap personally I
think<00:02:55.970> charge<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.860> just<00:02:57.860> better<00:02:58.280> all<00:02:58.520> around

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
think charge is just better all around

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.200 
think charge is just better all around
but<00:02:59.960> it's<00:03:00.350> really<00:03:00.620> up<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:02.180> can

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
but it's really up to you and you can

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.030 
but it's really up to you and you can
kind<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.600> tailor<00:03:02.960> this<00:03:03.140> however<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:03.680> want<00:03:03.950> it

gear<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.320> really<00:03:48.530> going<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.709> matter<00:03:48.830> for<00:03:49.130> this

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
gear is really going to matter for this

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.130 
gear is really going to matter for this
particular<00:03:49.550> skill<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.720> next<00:03:50.900> scale

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
particular skill so the next scale

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.380 
particular skill so the next scale
sprint<00:03:51.680> with<00:03:52.160> run<00:03:52.489> like<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.820> wind<00:03:52.850> this

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
sprint with run like the wind this

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.780 
sprint with run like the wind this
produces<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:53.989> tornado<00:03:54.650> effect<00:03:55.100> behind<00:03:55.550> you

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
produces the tornado effect behind you

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.030 
produces the tornado effect behind you
um<00:03:56.060> if<00:03:56.810> you<00:03:56.930> guys<00:03:57.080> remember<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:57.470> made<00:03:57.620> a<00:03:57.680> video<00:03:57.920> a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
um if you guys remember I made a video a

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.340 
um if you guys remember I made a video a
very<00:03:58.459> long<00:03:58.580> time<00:03:58.760> ago<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.360> suppose<00:03:59.930> a'n't<00:04:00.080> that

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
very long time ago I suppose a'n't that

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.020 
very long time ago I suppose a'n't that
long<00:04:00.620> ago<00:04:00.890> if<00:04:01.070> games<00:04:01.280> hasn't<00:04:01.700> been<00:04:01.790> out<00:04:01.880> that

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
long ago if games hasn't been out that

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.540 
long ago if games hasn't been out that
long<00:04:02.090> but

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
long but

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.140 
long but
um<00:04:03.080> very<00:04:04.080> early<00:04:04.560> levels<00:04:05.010> i<00:04:05.220> was<00:04:05.550> using<00:04:05.820> this

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
um very early levels i was using this

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.440 
um very early levels i was using this
and<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:07.170> talked<00:04:07.560> about<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:08.040> um<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:09.000> it's<00:04:09.150> good<00:04:09.300> to

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
and I talked about it um so it's good to

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.140 
and I talked about it um so it's good to
see<00:04:09.630> it<00:04:09.750> come<00:04:09.990> back<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.680> some<00:04:11.070> form<00:04:11.370> this<00:04:11.970> is

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
see it come back in some form this is

the<00:04:21.150> fray<00:04:21.450> this<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:21.959> how<00:04:22.140> you're<00:04:22.320> going<00:04:22.470> to<00:04:22.560> get

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
the fray this is how you're going to get

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.090 
the fray this is how you're going to get
a<00:04:22.950> lot<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.340> fury<00:04:23.820> very<00:04:24.270> easily<00:04:24.680> every<00:04:25.680> time<00:04:25.890> you

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
a lot of fury very easily every time you

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.100 
a lot of fury very easily every time you
crit<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:27.030> going<00:04:27.240> to<00:04:27.300> generate<00:04:27.480> well<00:04:27.990> not

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
crit it's going to generate well not

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.020 
crit it's going to generate well not
every<00:04:28.350> time<00:04:28.560> as<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.860> chance<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.640> generate

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
every time as a chance to generate

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.000 
every time as a chance to generate
additional<00:04:30.180> theory<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:30.930> it's<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:31.530> very<00:04:31.560> high

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
additional theory and it's a very high

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.860 
additional theory and it's a very high
chance<00:04:32.040> of<00:04:32.520> notice<00:04:32.850> like<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.240> get<00:04:33.420> a<00:04:33.450> ton<00:04:33.840> of

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
chance of notice like you get a ton of

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.430 
chance of notice like you get a ton of
fury<00:04:34.320> sometimes<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.870> your<00:04:36.870> you<00:04:37.290> know<00:04:37.410> your

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
fury sometimes and your you know your

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.650 
fury sometimes and your you know your
whole<00:04:37.710> globe<00:04:37.980> is<00:04:38.100> filled<00:04:38.340> up<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:39.150> then<00:04:39.360> war

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
whole globe is filled up and then war

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.870 
whole globe is filled up and then war
cry<00:04:39.960> this<00:04:40.410> is<00:04:40.560> just<00:04:40.740> your<00:04:40.830> resistances<00:04:41.550> and

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
cry this is just your resistances and

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.200 
cry this is just your resistances and
then<00:04:42.420> passives<00:04:43.080> like<00:04:43.890> I<00:04:44.010> said<00:04:44.280> weapons<00:04:45.000> master

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
then passives like I said weapons master

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.850 
then passives like I said weapons master
for<00:04:45.450> the<00:04:45.510> crib<00:04:45.750> ruth<00:04:46.020> is<00:04:46.170> for<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.440> crib<00:04:46.680> and

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
for the crib ruth is for the crib and

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.070 
for the crib ruth is for the crib and
then<00:04:47.130> nerves<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.580> steel<00:04:47.940> i<00:04:48.210> think<00:04:48.750> some<00:04:48.930> other

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
then nerves of steel i think some other

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.800 
then nerves of steel i think some other
possibilities<00:04:49.950> here<00:04:50.220> are<00:04:50.460> maybe<00:04:51.390> going<00:04:51.480> with

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
possibilities here are maybe going with

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.480 
possibilities here are maybe going with
a<00:04:51.840> relentless<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:52.740> if<00:04:52.830> you<00:04:52.920> get<00:04:53.040> low<00:04:53.250> health

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
a relentless and if you get low health

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.280 
a relentless and if you get low health
you're<00:04:53.820> never<00:04:54.060> out<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.480> fear<00:04:54.750> you<00:04:54.870> can<00:04:55.140> just

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
you're never out of fear you can just

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.740 
you're never out of fear you can just
spam<00:04:55.560> sprint<00:04:56.130> but<00:04:56.700> i<00:04:56.730> didn't<00:04:57.150> see<00:04:57.300> a<00:04:57.330> lot<00:04:57.720> of

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
spam sprint but i didn't see a lot of

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.320 
spam sprint but i didn't see a lot of
use<00:04:58.080> in<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.470> twenty<00:04:59.460> percent<00:04:59.670> life<00:04:59.880> is<00:05:00.120> very

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
use in that twenty percent life is very

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.730 
use in that twenty percent life is very
low<00:05:00.600> you<00:05:00.660> can<00:05:00.930> pretty<00:05:01.140> much<00:05:01.230> just<00:05:01.410> get<00:05:01.620> one

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
low you can pretty much just get one

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.770 
low you can pretty much just get one
shot<00:05:01.920> at<00:05:01.980> that<00:05:02.190> point<00:05:02.400> even<00:05:03.210> with<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.480> fifty

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
shot at that point even with the fifty

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.010 
shot at that point even with the fifty
percent<00:05:04.050> reduction<00:05:04.290> um<00:05:05.630> animosity<00:05:06.630> maybe<00:05:06.900> I

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
percent reduction um animosity maybe I

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.600 
percent reduction um animosity maybe I
haven't<00:05:07.290> tested<00:05:07.590> this<00:05:07.890> out<00:05:08.100> but<00:05:08.460> just

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
haven't tested this out but just

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.490 
haven't tested this out but just
increasing<00:05:09.300> that<00:05:09.419> fury<00:05:09.690> generation<00:05:10.260> may<00:05:10.440> be

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
increasing that fury generation may be

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.710 
increasing that fury generation may be
helping<00:05:10.980> wrath<00:05:11.190> of<00:05:11.400> Berserker<00:05:11.850> sustained

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
helping wrath of Berserker sustained

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.550 
helping wrath of Berserker sustained
even<00:05:13.230> longer<00:05:13.760> and<00:05:14.760> having<00:05:15.480> the<00:05:15.630> higher<00:05:15.870> pool<00:05:16.290> I

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
even longer and having the higher pool I

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.470 
even longer and having the higher pool I
think<00:05:16.770> that<00:05:16.950> one<00:05:17.100> actually<00:05:17.310> could<00:05:17.970> work<00:05:18.240> out

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
think that one actually could work out

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.360 
think that one actually could work out
but<00:05:19.110> I<00:05:19.140> haven't<00:05:19.410> gotten<00:05:19.860> around<00:05:19.950> to<00:05:20.100> testing

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
but I haven't gotten around to testing

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.550 
but I haven't gotten around to testing
it<00:05:20.730> so<00:05:21.090> those<00:05:21.300> are<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:21.480> skills<00:05:21.810> um<00:05:22.230> you<00:05:22.470> know

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
it so those are the skills um you know

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.560 
it so those are the skills um you know
go<00:05:22.740> out<00:05:22.860> try<00:05:23.190> play<00:05:23.580> around<00:05:23.760> with<00:05:23.940> it<00:05:24.060> try<00:05:24.390> out

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
go out try play around with it try out

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.570 
go out try play around with it try out
you<00:05:24.840> know<00:05:24.960> different<00:05:25.169> passives<00:05:25.800> and<00:05:26.070> then

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
you know different passives and then

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.250 
you know different passives and then
just<00:05:26.760> looking<00:05:27.030> at<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.300> Christian<00:05:27.810> sir<00:05:27.990> I'm<00:05:28.140> at

this<00:05:51.240> is<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.450> viable<00:05:51.900> way<00:05:52.410> which<00:05:53.100> is<00:05:53.130> just

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
this is a viable way which is just

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.010 
this is a viable way which is just
hilarious<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.419> me<00:05:54.510> that<00:05:54.720> it's<00:05:54.870> actually

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
viable and another thing is it's kind of

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.250 
viable and another thing is it's kind of
annoying<00:05:59.220> to<00:05:59.490> pick<00:05:59.700> a<00:05:59.730> balut<00:06:00.150> so<00:06:01.050> if<00:06:01.140> you're

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:11.830 
this actually works quite well I was
really<00:06:09.680> surprised<00:06:10.130> it<00:06:11.030> does<00:06:11.389> take<00:06:11.599> a<00:06:11.630> long

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
really surprised it does take a long

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.110 
really surprised it does take a long
time<00:06:12.080> to<00:06:12.139> kill<00:06:12.410> things<00:06:12.620> like<00:06:12.770> champions<00:06:13.310> but<00:06:14.090> I

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
time to kill things like champions but I

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.550 
time to kill things like champions but I
guess<00:06:14.240> you<00:06:14.479> could<00:06:14.750> always<00:06:14.780> like<00:06:15.289> to<00:06:15.380> switch<00:06:15.530> up

guess you could always like to switch up
your<00:06:15.710> skills<00:06:16.130> if<00:06:16.460> you<00:06:16.610> needed<00:06:17.150> to<00:06:17.270> kill
