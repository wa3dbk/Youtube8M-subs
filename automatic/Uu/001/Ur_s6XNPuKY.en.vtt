00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.990
 finally alberto I do not know if this request 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:06.280
 it has been a torture but always at 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.180
 end of the interviews 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.200
 we have centuries of books we have to sing not 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.360
 we ask the interviewees that 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.059
 recommend five lines 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.059
 I know it's a random choice but 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.880
 significant I do not know if I can achieve it 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.880
 we understand 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.869
 if it's weird I do not work so much with 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.029
 lists even though he made a book of 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.250
 lists like from the movie of my life to 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.949
 see the last one that I loved that I 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.010
 loved that I loved it and fascinated me by 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.469
 a reason 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.329
 and I'm getting tired of the books of 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.120
 writers about writers or books that 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.550
 Do not tell a story and plot 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.649
 Aunt's cold bridal or ideas from the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.479
 writer of the suicide virginia that 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.760
 tells a story basically a 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.640
 romance of a girl with two boys 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.680
 university that was a very little subject 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.560
 attractive and it is an impressive book 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.080
 I like we can be alone of Jonathan 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.100
 franzén 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.100
 I like it 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.030
 in the last three or four the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.030
 last three or four of philip roth 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.690
 not so much messi but conclusion of the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.690
 boy 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.820
 what happens with 50's 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.000
 but like school 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.469
 m 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.450
 you the biography that I read recently 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.450
 polo kyle loved it 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.090
 I'm rereading also 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.780
 that other 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.460
 and now he 's reading a book from a 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.410
 writer who has always fascinated me 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.710
 I've always liked that he prepares 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.750
 a lot and that also makes movies and the 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.820
 true that 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.680
 to see if he wanted to be much more famous and 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.940
 much more respected that there was no 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.460
 written my times and to martín rejtman 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.740
 the Argentine who pulled out a new book that 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.350
 it's called three stories and I'm in the 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.030
 first and it seems to me that he always has 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.160
 a voice always had it he's always going to 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.020
 to have 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.020
 thank you very much to you next time
