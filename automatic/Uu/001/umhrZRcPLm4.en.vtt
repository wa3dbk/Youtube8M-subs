00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.040
 congratulations in this new year all my 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.740
 friends of facebook and youtube 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.630
 today I will be uploading a video that 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.880
 it does not look anything really no 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.290
 surely something that sings a song 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.720
 I play guitar be here for today 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.509
 giving a little to the percussion I have 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.220
 to make the clarification that I'm not a 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.110
 percussionist 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.140
 and it always caught my attention but I did not 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.680
 had had the opportunity but in 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 this Christmas my wife gave me a gift 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.489
 dj true something that is a little time that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.970
 I wanted to have so I thank you very much 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.949
 to my beauty and successes for her that I 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.790
 gave away this instrument is a 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.320
 traditional percussion instrument 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.989
 African clear, are you what I 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.290
 I have is an American version of the 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.000
 rowing house truth there is no in woods 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.970
 It looks like wood but it 's all really 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.790
 it's like it's like faith rules and also because 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.200
 the body is a synthetic leather but that 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:17.090
 in terms of general because it is more is 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.729
 more practical for what I do true 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.280
 and I'm just barely three days ago 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.009
 I have it and they try to get a 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.990
 little bit of sound and really on account 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.859
 of videos more or less so that you 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.540
 see how it sounds like that combined with 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.330
 modern music 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.340
 For this, he will be helping me in 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.250
 the guitar and in the voice alone because no 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.790
 Can sing and play Alava because it 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.060
 I find it difficult that from here one year 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.670
 two years then he can do it but I'm going to 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.960
 practice here on the guitar and you 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.040
 will be helping me from the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.520
 distance in engraving true 28 hours with 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.470
 a theme of mike and riverside so I hope 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.220
 so that they like that they can 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.750
 enjoy and apologize truth the heap 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.480
 of mistakes they can make but 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.480
 it really took me three days with the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.030
 instrument and I'm missing a lot a lot 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.290
 a lot so I hope that they can 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.590
 enjoy 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.569
 a little bit of what is the sound of 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.150
 this wonderful That is returning to 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.829
 I hope so if this video tell 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.140
 for someone else to call you the 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.819
 attention and be encouraged to practice it 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.819
 that is that way 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:10.319
 if this already annoying of forgiveness is a 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:13.909
 ritual that destroys me the distance goes 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.909
 killing dreams 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.599
 importing the child 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.720
 I know people 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:34.260
 losing his battle to oblivion and 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:38.360
 that spring is hell when 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.360
 loneliness marks the way 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.940
 day to day 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.100
 Y 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:45.490
 then your lips with fidelity that 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:52.740
 did that one day presented for my good or 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:58.199
 of luck a time of peace militates in the 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.199
 I spent my life smiling 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:08.319
 letting myself be carried away by the beauty of 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:13.259
 one that prefers to be present at the 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:13.259
 feline moral gets naked 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.130
 to me 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.889
