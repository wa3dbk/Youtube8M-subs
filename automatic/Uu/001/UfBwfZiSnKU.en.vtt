00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
okay here we are with a recently DC seed

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.130 
okay here we are with a recently DC seed
chassis<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.360> glorious<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.259> lovely<00:00:04.710> LMS<00:00:05.250> loco

chassis of glorious a lovely LMS loco
not<00:00:07.140> too<00:00:07.259> sure<00:00:07.379> what<00:00:07.500> class<00:00:07.740> shares<00:00:07.980> off<00:00:08.099> the

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
not too sure what class shares off the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.770 
not too sure what class shares off the
top<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.370> my<00:00:08.519> head<00:00:08.700> I'll<00:00:09.150> add<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
top of my head I'll add that to the

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.160 
top of my head I'll add that to the
video<00:00:09.990> later<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:11.300> think<00:00:12.300> it's<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.509> jubilee<00:00:12.900> class

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
video later I think it's a jubilee class

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.169 
video later I think it's a jubilee class
but<00:00:14.009> we'll<00:00:14.670> check

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
but we'll check

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:24.650 
but we'll check
there's<00:00:16.170> her<00:00:16.379> body<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.830> let's<00:00:19.830> selector<00:00:23.660> and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
there's her body so let's selector and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.660 
there's her body so let's selector and
then<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.439> check<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.740> she<00:00:25.920> moves<00:00:26.189> forwards

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
then just check that she moves forwards

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.560 
then just check that she moves forwards
and<00:00:26.760> backwards

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:42.540 

oh<00:00:33.550> yes<00:00:34.550> lovely<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.690> then<00:00:35.840> backwards<00:00:36.170> as<00:00:36.260> well

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.350 

that's<00:00:43.270> so<00:00:43.510> smooth<00:00:44.170> that's<00:00:44.980> baleen<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:46.300> we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
that's so smooth that's baleen and we

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.850 
that's so smooth that's baleen and we
can<00:00:46.540> see<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.810> chip<00:00:47.050> hidden<00:00:47.440> there<00:00:47.620> on<00:00:47.770> the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
can see the chip hidden there on the

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.310 
can see the chip hidden there on the
back<00:00:48.040> I<00:00:48.690> believe<00:00:49.690> that's<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:49.930> only<00:00:50.140> place

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
back I believe that's the only place

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.840 
back I believe that's the only place
where<00:00:50.350> this<00:00:50.680> room<00:00:50.890> well<00:00:51.580> there's<00:00:51.730> something

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
where this room well there's something

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.410 
where this room well there's something
special<00:00:52.180> about<00:00:52.420> this<00:00:52.810> particular<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:55.090> isn't

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
special about this particular one isn't

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:08.730 
special about this particular one isn't
that<00:00:55.920> if<00:00:56.920> we<00:00:57.910> just<00:00:58.090> select<00:00:58.480> function<00:00:59.050> one

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:20.540

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.249 

unless<00:01:26.080> independents<00:01:26.920> as<00:01:27.040> well<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.990> she<00:01:29.020> could

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
unless independents as well so she could

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.050 
unless independents as well so she could
be<00:01:29.350> stopped<00:01:29.619> in<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.830> station<00:01:29.979> right<00:01:30.310> now<00:01:30.369> and

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
be stopped in the station right now and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.399 
be stopped in the station right now and
then<00:01:31.270> about<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.720> move<00:01:31.869> off<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.720> she<00:01:37.960> continues
