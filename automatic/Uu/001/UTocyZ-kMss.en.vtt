00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
about a thousand 20 kilos and it can

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.340 
about a thousand 20 kilos and it can
over<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.149> bumps<00:00:55.570> vary<00:00:55.929> between<00:00:56.140> 300<00:00:57.129> and<00:00:57.219> one

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.730 
over the bumps vary between 300 and one
kilos<00:00:58.859> look<00:00:59.070> at<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.340> again

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
kilos look at that again

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.920

this<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.340> reason<00:01:07.670> why<00:01:07.820> they<00:01:08.000> run<00:01:08.210> negative

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
this is the reason why they run negative
