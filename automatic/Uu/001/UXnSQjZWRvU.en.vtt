lot of decks can't get over it so if

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.639

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
can make big guy they have to take

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.840 
can make big guy they have to take
because<00:01:02.039> there's<00:01:02.219> nothing<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.579> their<00:01:02.670> neck

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
they can answer this card because it

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.500 
they can answer this card because it
ends<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.500> having<00:01:04.890> 3,800<00:01:05.880> attack<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.390> there's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
very few things that get over that so

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
very few things that get over that so
we'll<00:01:08.610> try<00:01:08.760> steal<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.330> say<00:01:09.510> no

one of the only cards that you want to
summon<00:02:49.300> like<00:02:49.959> turn<00:02:50.470> 1<00:02:50.620> next<00:02:51.370> up<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.550> play<00:02:51.700> 3

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
summon like turn 1 next up you play 3

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.960 
summon like turn 1 next up you play 3
counterpunch<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.690> is<00:02:52.780> kind<00:02:52.959> of<00:02:52.989> like<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.290> clue

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
counterpunch this is kind of like a clue

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.370 
counterpunch this is kind of like a clue
but<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.030> banish<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.690> from<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.900> graver<00:02:56.080> so<00:02:56.320> it

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
but you banish it from the graver so it

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.110 
but you banish it from the graver so it
gains<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.590> thousand<00:02:56.950> attack<00:02:57.130> q<00:02:57.640> Mike<00:02:57.820> you<00:02:57.970> can

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
gains a thousand attack q Mike you can

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.479 
gains a thousand attack q Mike you can
still<00:02:58.420> use<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:59.020> lead<00:02:59.440> yoke<00:02:59.770> with<00:03:00.220> a

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
still use a lead yoke with a

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.640 
still use a lead yoke with a
counterpunch<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:01.360> if<00:03:01.660> lead<00:03:02.050> yoke<00:03:02.230> has<00:03:02.410> already

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
counterpunch so if lead yoke has already

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.120 
counterpunch so if lead yoke has already
detached<00:03:03.190> twice<00:03:03.970> um<00:03:04.360> he<00:03:05.260> actually<00:03:05.380> was<00:03:05.680> 38

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
detached twice um he actually was 38

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.610 
detached twice um he actually was 38
plus<00:03:06.340> another<00:03:06.610> thousand<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.150> that's<00:03:07.270> 40<00:03:07.840> 800

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
plus another thousand so that's 40 800

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.410 
plus another thousand so that's 40 800
points<00:03:08.739> of<00:03:08.920> damage<00:03:08.980> there's<00:03:09.910> very<00:03:10.090> few<00:03:10.150> things

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
points of damage there's very few things

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.300 
points of damage there's very few things
and<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.870> can<00:03:11.050> get<00:03:11.140> over<00:03:11.320> 4,800<00:03:11.920> like<00:03:12.130> I

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
and you you can get over 4,800 like I

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.370 
and you you can get over 4,800 like I
know<00:03:12.489> five<00:03:12.790> headed<00:03:12.970> dragon<00:03:13.060> can<00:03:13.540> map<00:03:13.810> by<00:03:14.230> that

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
know five headed dragon can map by that

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.560 
know five headed dragon can map by that
a<00:03:14.410> dragon<00:03:14.590> he<00:03:14.890> runs<00:03:15.070> over<00:03:15.280> everything<00:03:15.700> next

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
a dragon he runs over everything next

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.300 
a dragon he runs over everything next
time<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.720> play<00:03:16.900> three<00:03:17.440> Wisel<00:03:17.920> just<00:03:18.100> because

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
time I play three Wisel just because

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.699 
time I play three Wisel just because
Wisel<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.850> also<00:03:19.239> dark<00:03:19.510> plus<00:03:19.840> y<00:03:20.080> is<00:03:20.110> all<00:03:20.320> kind<00:03:20.680> of

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
Wisel is also dark plus y is all kind of

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.110 
Wisel is also dark plus y is all kind of
technically<00:03:21.160> has<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.340> better<00:03:21.549> effect<00:03:21.730> right

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
technically has a better effect right

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.490 
technically has a better effect right
now<00:03:22.299> in<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.690> metagame<00:03:23.200> because<00:03:23.650> um<00:03:25.500> Grandal

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
now in the metagame because um Grandal

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.380 
now in the metagame because um Grandal
can<00:03:26.799> be<00:03:26.950> good<00:03:27.190> too<00:03:27.580> but<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.880> think<00:03:28.030> as<00:03:28.120> Randall

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
can be good too but I think as Randall

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.050 
can be good too but I think as Randall
is<00:03:28.510> really<00:03:28.870> only<00:03:29.019> good<00:03:29.489> within<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.640> first<00:03:30.670> few

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
is really only good within the first few

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.979 
is really only good within the first few
terms<00:03:31.269> in<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.450> game<00:03:31.540> because<00:03:31.690> if<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:31.840> take<00:03:31.870> a

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
terms in the game because if you take a

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.690 
terms in the game because if you take a
whole<00:03:32.170> bunch<00:03:32.320> down<00:03:32.500> Randall<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.100> not<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.549> great

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
whole bunch down Randall is not so great

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.850 
whole bunch down Randall is not so great
and<00:03:33.970> synchros<00:03:34.750> aren't<00:03:35.019> too<00:03:35.230> big<00:03:35.500> at<00:03:35.739> the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
and synchros aren't too big at the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.470 
and synchros aren't too big at the
moment<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.250> feel<00:03:36.730> like<00:03:36.790> Wisel<00:03:37.150> has<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.269> much

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
moment I feel like Wisel has a much

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.870 
moment I feel like Wisel has a much
better<00:03:37.720> effect<00:03:38.049> his<00:03:38.500> effect<00:03:38.799> being<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.280> when

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
better effect his effect being that when

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.130 
better effect his effect being that when
your<00:03:40.090> opponent<00:03:40.329> activates<00:03:40.390> a<00:03:40.660> spell<00:03:40.840> card<00:03:40.989> you

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
your opponent activates a spell card you

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.780 
your opponent activates a spell card you
can<00:03:41.260> negate<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.590> activation<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:42.250> destroy<00:03:42.640> it

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
can negate the activation and destroy it

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.810 
can negate the activation and destroy it
so<00:03:43.329> one<00:03:43.959> thing<00:03:44.049> I<00:03:44.260> also<00:03:44.470> want<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.769> mention<00:03:44.860> if

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
so one thing I also want to mention if

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.280 
so one thing I also want to mention if
you<00:03:46.030> use<00:03:46.150> glass<00:03:46.480> tiles<00:03:46.720> effect<00:03:46.959> it<00:03:47.049> does<00:03:47.170> not

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
you use glass tiles effect it does not

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.350 
you use glass tiles effect it does not
force<00:03:47.620> missing<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.160> timing<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.640> summon<00:03:48.970> your

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
force missing the timing to summon your

force missing the timing to summon your
meklord<00:03:49.570> I<00:03:49.900> know<00:03:49.989> some<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.380> math<00:03:50.530> words

you<00:04:19.359> can<00:04:19.479> add<00:04:19.630> this<00:04:19.780> curve<00:04:19.930> was<00:04:20.049> hanging

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
you can add this curve was hanging

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.430 
you can add this curve was hanging
because<00:04:20.549> his<00:04:20.699> attack<00:04:20.940> was<00:04:21.090> actually<00:04:21.479> zero<00:04:22.109> so

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
because his attack was actually zero so

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.499 
because his attack was actually zero so
that<00:04:22.470> was<00:04:22.620> pretty<00:04:22.740> cool<00:04:22.949> but<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.790> find<00:04:24.090> out<00:04:24.210> why

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
that was pretty cool but I find out why

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.360 
that was pretty cool but I find out why
it'll<00:04:24.720> just<00:04:24.870> be<00:04:25.020> a<00:04:25.050> lot<00:04:25.259> more<00:04:25.290> meta<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.919> in<00:04:26.280> the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
it'll just be a lot more meta and in the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.890 
it'll just be a lot more meta and in the
off<00:04:26.490> chance<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:26.820> you<00:04:26.970> want<00:04:27.240> to<00:04:27.330> technically

you<00:04:27.990> can<00:04:28.199> make<00:04:28.350> performance<00:04:28.770> in<00:04:28.919> krum<00:04:29.070> but<00:04:29.490> I

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
you can make performance in krum but I

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.800 
you can make performance in krum but I
took<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.850> out<00:04:29.940> because<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:30.389> wanted<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.690> play
