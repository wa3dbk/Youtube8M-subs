with<00:00:30.010> dinosaurs<00:00:30.360> the<00:00:31.360> idea<00:00:31.750> was<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.470> take

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
with dinosaurs the idea was to take

with dinosaurs the idea was to take
Jurassic<00:00:33.280> Park<00:00:33.580> style<00:00:34.060> graphics<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:35.650> put

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
Jurassic Park style graphics and put

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.440 
Jurassic Park style graphics and put
them<00:00:36.070> into<00:00:36.220> a<00:00:36.880> television<00:00:37.830> and<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:40.210> been

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
them into a television and it been

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
people had grown to understand and

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.100 
people had grown to understand and
imagine<00:00:45.730> dinosaurs<00:00:46.270> through<00:00:46.600> those<00:00:46.809> programs

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
imagine dinosaurs through those programs

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.860 
imagine dinosaurs through those programs
but<00:00:48.040> the<00:00:48.129> proposal<00:00:48.670> here<00:00:48.940> in<00:00:49.239> this<00:00:49.449> arena

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
but the proposal here in this arena

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.020 
but the proposal here in this arena
spectacle<00:00:50.559> was<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:51.280> animals<00:00:51.610> would<00:00:51.699> get<00:00:51.910> up

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
spectacle was the animals would get up

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.880 
spectacle was the animals would get up
and<00:00:52.210> walk<00:00:52.360> they<00:00:52.840> would<00:00:52.989> move<00:00:53.170> around<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:53.830> the

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
and walk they would move around and the

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.049 
and walk they would move around and the
audience<00:00:54.220> would<00:00:54.340> believe<00:00:54.640> that<00:00:54.910> they're

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
audience would believe that they're
