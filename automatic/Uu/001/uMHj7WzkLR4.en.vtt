00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.400
 presented with the second generation 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.920
 porsche the further development of the 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.470
 Panamera to plug in hybrid on the 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.300
 Power grid charging is the basis for this 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.800
 supplies a battery with the good 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.320
 five times the energy content of the 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.269
 predecessor models and the electric motor 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.499
 has more than doubled its performance 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.759
 on 70 kw the panamera hybrid drives 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.439
 virtually silent 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.270
 the only thing you hear are the ones 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.820
 rolling noise through the tires and 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.590
 of course the wind noise up to 36 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.090
 For miles around, he manages to get in 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.070
 to be on the move electrically who 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.170
 especially economical is even more creates 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.060
 than 50 kilometers and that's one 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.280
 quantum leap compared to the predecessor 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.930
 because he could barely two 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.370
 miles of pure electric travel 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.960
 if the juice runs out the must 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.600
 panamera not necessarily to the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.450
 Plug a pressure on the charts button 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.010
 turns the electric motor into a generator 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.500
 the petrol engine drives not only the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.180
 wheels but his energy will also 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.439
 used for power generation 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.939
 so you can for example at 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.830
 highway rides the battery for 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.830
 load emission-free city ​​driving 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.920
 impressive is that the hybrid 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.660
 practically impossible to switch between 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.000
 electric drive and petrol engine 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.730
 the other way round you will get each one 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.460
 quantity in the boost function packs the 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.430
 electric motor on its 95 hp power 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.930
 that of the combustion engine on top 416 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.700
 is it then in total and that 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.090
 allows driving performance from 0 to 100 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:46.150
 in 5 5 seconds and a peak of 270 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:48.220
 km / h to 306 kilowatts system power 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.530
 it brings the new hybrid model and 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.900
 generates a massive 590 minutes 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.140
 middle torque thanks to the electric motor 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.220
 but it is only 3.1 liters per 100 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.750
 kilometer 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.390
 the top speed in 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.390
 electric is 135 km h 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.340
 the design of the panamera has always been 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.070
 already the ghosts divorced but who 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.380
 he likes him most and the rest 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.380
 just buys the classic 9 11 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.709
 under the hood rests a three-liter v6 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.709
 Motor combined with the electric motor 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.720
 striking lettering and rims round 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.720
 the exterior 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.080
 The battery can be connected to a special 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.700
 Charger refreshed again 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.410
 become 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.940
 In Germany, we have the normal 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.860
 Household sockets that can be used between 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.190
 eight to ten amps that is here are 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.930
 Loading times of one charge for 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.150
 the battery of about four hours 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.130
 to be expected if you have a strong current 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.770
 you can use a socket 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.670
 What the device also neither can both 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.099
 then there are about 2 to 23 hours 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.770
 possible for a battery of empty too 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.320
 fully reload 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.910
 even the rear of the hybrid can be seen 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.930
 of course you can also find here 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.250
 the obligatory led taillights of the 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.010
 trunk can be accessed via a button 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.200
 open at windscreen wiper at 335 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.770
 liter load volume when folded 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.209
 back seat even 1153 liters 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.880
 Among other things , the panamera s 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.370
 hybrid as well as his brother the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.660
 panamera gts the porsche active 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.069
 suspension management system short psn 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.230
 This system fits the spring travel of the 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.010
 damper by means of air pressure automatically 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.010
 to the underground 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.660
 Inside , the hybrid looks exactly like it does 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.380
 the normal panamera except for a small one 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.380
 detail 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.329
 the letters in the tacho 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.459
 the sc hybrid is switched over 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.930
 eight-speed tiptronic s automatic transmission 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.329
 the full bowls offer comfort 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.019
 leather seats they are well finished and 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.019
 almost luxurious 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.340
 for the broad masses is the industry with 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.410
 logically not the green conscience 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.620
 made because the good has its price 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.930
 from over 110,000 euros is the panamera s 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.830
 hybrid in germany available but 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.639
 only if you have the extra charge 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.639
 consistently ignored
