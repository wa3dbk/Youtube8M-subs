00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.800
 Today I'm going to show you one of my 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.790
 finished products and has always had 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:23.000
 I've seen this video everywhere 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:25.429
 but it always lasts a few but I 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.019
 I agreed because I also want to talk to you 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.150
 of those products and I think of them buying 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.150
 again or not the first thing is this 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.090
 civil and is a brand of cosmetics or 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.190
 organic beauty products and this me 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.900
 they sent it in an ipsi bag and for 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.120
 course those that are sample sizes 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.910
 they are easier to finish but 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.190
 This is a moisturizing spray for the face 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.770
 and this one I remember that when we saw 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.790
 new york I know 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.160
 very much because as you understand the 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.260
 hotel heating I was 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.270
 respecting the skin very much and I 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.100
 I took with that purpose because it is 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.350
 a product for skin hydration 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.589
 and that's when I liked the most 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.420
 I already had about half of it and 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.220
 then super sad because I feel that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.740
 these products that even if you do not bring 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.780
 makeup put you put it on I know that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.570
 your skin will look much healthier without 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.850
 tell that it's organic and says that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.500
 tones and refreshes has a lot of 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.990
 natural products and another of them is 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.149
 the grape seed oil that has been 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.039
 become very popular lately like this is 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.530
 that this is something that I'm definitely going 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.930
 to look to go buy again more 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.200
 in a product is this nail polish 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.729
 he says he has vitamin e and it's for nails 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.100
 natural because there are some that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.679
 work with false fingernails this 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.350
 that brand that they sell from guarín and is 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.390
 being enamel remover really not 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.280
 I care what brand is like this is that 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.530
 obviously I'm going to buy another one 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.270
 but I need to paint the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.700
 Nail is nothing special nothing fancy 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.819
 another world but I wanted it included sorry 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.030
 I do not have many products next 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:02.429
 is the academy shampoo now these 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.709
 you know about organics that to me 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.430
 fascinate is probably one of the 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.140
 few things 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.970
 I like my hair although the truth is 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.740
 I want to try other things that I feel 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.960
 that you need a change to my routine 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.000
 and I was changing some things I did not 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.390
 I'm going to lie like that, I feel like I already 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.970
 I'm going in a good direction so much that 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.740
 the best is not going I want them 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.959
 say but the safest thing is that they 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.850
 I can do a routine for the hair 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.590
 very soon I know that many of you 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.570
 they have asked me and you know that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.730
 these are great are organic says 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.650
 they do not have sulphate they do not have 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.810
 less so, this is one of his 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.190
 products that I really recommend 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.050
 as well as who says with the eyes 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.330
 closed you can not go wrong with the 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.860
 Coconut this is the next product 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.900
 finished with these wipes 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.660
 Neutrogena make-up remover can 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.850
 say yes I definitely liked them 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.380
 I'm going to buy them back in fact 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.690
 I just told you even talking about 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.580
 that lancôme makeup and how I 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.860
 like you give me paint your eyes and everything 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.560
 that's good because I said it's the 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.050
 equivalent of 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.810
 s of makeup but for my whole face 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.940
 it removes all the makeup but so on 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.440
 cannon and the truth is that fascinates you 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.020
 because before when I used other 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.760
 wipes I was washing the ship I still 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.220
 it came out like that a little makeup 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.230
 but now do not realize it has 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.480
 I use the clues and wash my face and 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.000
 water comes out practically and you have me 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.580
 mixed to fat and these contain a little 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.680
 of oil but I did not notice that they made me 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.930
 my reaction and they will remove granites 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.280
 nothing like that which I appreciate 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.989
 very much because you know that I have 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.010
 had such a prone skin granites 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.480
 you really can not be like that 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.940
 anything almost finished I told them 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.569
 that did not have many the next one is this 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.160
 glycolic acid toner 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.200
 performance road and this one you find in 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.330
 Sephora reduces the appearance of 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.180
 acne scars expression lines 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.390
 dead skin and good does not want dead the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.120
 time according to the guards contains acid 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.709
 glycolic and other acids like the arctic 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.450
 the citrus and also eating very 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.380
 facebook and this you can only use 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.210
 at night 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.580
 I would be the best when I was 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.980
 using but obviously obviously looks great 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.110
 so it's over literally you can 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.030
 see the changes and you get used to that 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.970
 so your skin look one way and then 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.560
 when you already have it, obviously it is 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.300
 how do you see that is what happens when 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.770
 you find a good product then you 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.440
 you go crazy when you no longer have or 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.660
 when you run out and the next one is this 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.640
 that is called out and many of you 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.040
 I have been asked as third of the 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.810
 wicks and blah blah you see that I have 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.930
 a video on how to make the wicks 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.720
 Californian or man hair and oberto 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.850
 with 3 6 and 4 months depending on my 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.370
 humor and how it looks coming out the 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.830
 hair but while retouching it so be 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.440
 in shape with the peroxide and all that what 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.710
 what use is this this where walmart 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.050
 basically it's a hair lightener and 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.090
 mexico this would be like the equivalent 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.490
 of chamomile in crisis that also 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.740
 it clears your hair like that but what 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.540
 important is that you put it on 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.260
 the tips because if you put it here in 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.320
 this part above 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.240
 like a glow there you will stay 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.760
 all red on the top and then 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.990
 in the tips of super-dark bacchanal if 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.220
 is that you have dark hair if 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.620
 You have clear hair, obviously 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.960
 that does not happen but if you have hair 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.820
 dark I recommend you use it in 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.310
 the tips nothing more than that is what I 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.400
 I do and that's what helps my 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.770
 mier men look cooler without that 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.660
 you have to put the whole process of 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.090
 peroxide although this contains peroxide 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.310
 so keep an eye on that contains production 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.100
 but very minimal and obviously it's like a 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.740
 kind like rinse and everything you do 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.100
 is to put it on the tips let it 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.020
 dry out in the sun and the sun knows 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.760
 mind the heat not the sun but the heat 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.740
 what activates it is that if he does not want to leave 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.750
 or if there is no sun or if you want to do it 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.240
 night nothing more than the dry ones with the 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.250
 dryer and that's it, I'm not very 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.230
 sure the truth if I stain clothes like that 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.360
 so as not to get into trouble, use 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.500
 old clothes that do not mind when 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:12.620
 use it 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:26.030
 this kind of videos to keep doing 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:26.030
 an help to remind you 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.850
 why
