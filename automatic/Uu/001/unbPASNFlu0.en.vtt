around I want to make a difference I
want<00:04:12.489> to<00:04:12.610> make<00:04:12.730> something<00:04:12.970> of<00:04:13.209> my<00:04:13.330> life<00:04:13.360> that's

want to make something of my life that's

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.500 
want to make something of my life that's
what<00:04:14.470> I've<00:04:14.530> tried<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:14.830> live<00:04:14.980> by<00:04:18.180> when<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.239> see

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
what I've tried to live by when I see

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.030 
what I've tried to live by when I see
people<00:04:19.810> walk<00:04:19.959> away<00:04:20.139> from<00:04:20.410> here<00:04:20.590> at<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.829> end<00:04:20.950> of

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
people walk away from here at the end of

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.850 
people walk away from here at the end of
the<00:04:21.100> programs<00:04:21.700> they're<00:04:22.479> invigorated<00:04:23.169> they're

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
the programs they're invigorated they're

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.920 
the programs they're invigorated they're
given<00:04:24.190> hope<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.790> it's<00:04:25.240> also<00:04:25.419> a<00:04:25.600> little<00:04:25.780> bit

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
given hope and it's also a little bit

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.570 
given hope and it's also a little bit
tinged<00:04:26.470> with<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.650> little<00:04:26.919> sadness<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.550> a

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
tinged with a little sadness and a

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.760 
tinged with a little sadness and a
little<00:04:27.790> bit<00:04:27.910> of<00:04:27.970> emotion<00:04:28.419> perhaps<00:04:28.840> because

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
little bit of emotion perhaps because

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.469 
little bit of emotion perhaps because
for<00:04:30.010> some<00:04:30.250> people<00:04:30.610> it<00:04:30.760> hits<00:04:31.000> them<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.240> little

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
for some people it hits them a little

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.550 
for some people it hits them a little
harder<00:04:31.990> they<00:04:32.560> see<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:33.760> life<00:04:34.720> isn't<00:04:34.960> quite<00:04:35.410> as

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
harder they see that life isn't quite as

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.520 
harder they see that life isn't quite as
simple<00:04:35.800> as<00:04:36.370> maybe<00:04:36.880> they<00:04:37.090> see<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:37.930> here<00:04:38.350> and

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
simple as maybe they see it here and

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.800 
simple as maybe they see it here and
that<00:04:38.740> there<00:04:39.190> isn't<00:04:39.340> these<00:04:39.669> these<00:04:40.000> problems

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
that there isn't these these problems

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.719 
that there isn't these these problems
that<00:04:40.930> we<00:04:41.050> have<00:04:41.229> don't<00:04:41.440> really<00:04:41.740> have<00:04:41.979> easy

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
that we have don't really have easy

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.180 
that we have don't really have easy
answers<00:04:43.210> there's<00:04:43.510> a<00:04:43.600> complexity<00:04:44.229> but<00:04:45.070> we

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
answers there's a complexity but we

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.120 
answers there's a complexity but we
bring<00:04:45.460> hope<00:04:45.640> to<00:04:45.669> them<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.590> think<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.710> future

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
bring hope to them I think the future

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.440 
bring hope to them I think the future
rests<00:04:48.400> in<00:04:49.090> one<00:04:49.780> word<00:04:50.160> love

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
rests in one word love

00:04:51.450 --> 00:05:15.459 
rests in one word love
