and<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.539> probably<00:00:48.719> match<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and you can probably match to the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.569 
and you can probably match to the
one-play<00:00:49.440> 7<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.010> waist<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> width

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.950 

you<00:00:58.260> got<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.680> Armada<00:00:59.370> Bubba<00:00:59.670> here<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.539> new

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you got the Armada Bubba here it's a new

you got the Armada Bubba here it's a new
ski<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.460> 2013<00:01:02.460> basically<00:01:03.300> taking<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> same

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
ski for 2013 basically taking the same

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.590 
ski for 2013 basically taking the same
principle<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.799> JJ<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> five<00:01:06.060> points

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
principle as the JJ with the five points

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.770 
principle as the JJ with the five points
of<00:01:06.860> side<00:01:07.860> cut<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> ski<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.760> also<00:01:09.450> our

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
of side cut to the ski and also our

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.719 
of side cut to the ski and also our
modest<00:01:10.200> come<00:01:10.500> out<00:01:10.650> with<00:01:10.830> sort<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.220> formula

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
modest come out with sort of a formula

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.350 
modest come out with sort of a formula
for<00:01:12.030> floatation<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.710> 188<00:01:14.130> Bubba<00:01:15.000> has<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
for floatation and the 188 Bubba has the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.390 
for floatation and the 188 Bubba has the
most<00:01:15.509> flotation<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> line

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.680 

we've<00:01:22.400> got<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:23.350> 2013<00:01:24.350> line<00:01:25.090> 115<00:01:26.090> influence

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
we've got the 2013 line 115 influence

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.440 
we've got the 2013 line 115 influence
basically<00:01:27.320> inspired<00:01:27.800> by<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.760> Pollard<00:01:29.150> Opus

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
basically inspired by the Pollard Opus

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.440 
basically inspired by the Pollard Opus
but<00:01:30.440> basically<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.550> going<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:31.820> be<00:01:31.940> directional

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
but basically is going to be directional

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.540 
but basically is going to be directional
so<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:32.720> has<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:32.840> fairly<00:01:33.140> stiff<00:01:33.500> tail<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.980> it<00:01:34.040> so

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
so it has a fairly stiff tail to it so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.400 
so it has a fairly stiff tail to it so
anybody<00:01:34.730> that<00:01:34.940> wants<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.600> ski<00:01:35.750> that's<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.230> little

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
anybody that wants a ski that's a little

anybody that wants a ski that's a little
bit<00:01:36.670> more<00:01:37.670> calmer<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:38.330> know<00:01:38.450> they're<00:01:38.630> going

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
bit more calmer you know they're going

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.230 
bit more calmer you know they're going
to<00:01:38.810> use<00:01:39.020> it<00:01:39.200> for<00:01:39.410> out<00:01:39.950> runs<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.760> straight<00:01:41.090> line

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
to use it for out runs and straight line

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.050 
to use it for out runs and straight line
any<00:01:41.330> more<00:01:41.480> stuff<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.800> influence<00:01:43.220> 115<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.880> for
