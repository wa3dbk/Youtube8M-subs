00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
this a little early this morning and we

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.370 
this a little early this morning and we
were<00:01:55.179> looking<00:01:55.299> about<00:01:56.039> 2012<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.340> about<00:01:57.810> 2000<00:01:58.810> 45

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
were looking about 2012 to about 2000 45

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.709 
were looking about 2012 to about 2000 45
but<00:02:00.249> look<00:02:00.429> there<00:02:00.609> are<00:02:00.700> no<00:02:00.789> absolutes<00:02:01.389> that's

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
but look there are no absolutes that's

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.709 
but look there are no absolutes that's
our<00:02:01.959> opinion<00:02:02.469> today<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:04.090> gives<00:02:04.419> us<00:02:04.599> a

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
our opinion today but that gives us a

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.719 
our opinion today but that gives us a
rough<00:02:04.959> idea<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.529> think<00:02:05.649> of<00:02:05.979> how<00:02:06.099> long<00:02:06.279> the<00:02:06.399> vinyl

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
rough idea I think of how long the vinyl

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.240 
rough idea I think of how long the vinyl
age<00:02:06.909> but<00:02:07.149> when<00:02:07.509> we<00:02:07.599> say<00:02:07.749> from<00:02:07.929> 2012<00:02:08.830> onwards

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
age but when we say from 2012 onwards

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.800 
age but when we say from 2012 onwards
