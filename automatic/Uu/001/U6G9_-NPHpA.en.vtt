00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.270
 super week end I like to mix flour 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.620
 and baking powder always prefers 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.690
 in the flour 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.690
 I had felt rain so you came back 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.840

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.930
 melted butter 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.880
 still a little lukewarm there is not bad 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.800
 butter is greedy laden 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.110
 we ended up at a very important phase 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.880

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.560
 refrigerator is already ready will be nick 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.650
 so there other devices in madiana 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.520
 rest and we will add nuggets or 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.860
 chocolate chips 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.080
 you see go we put it in a pocket to 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.670
 socket on non-madeleine layer and after 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.970
 cooking it's over the device is 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.090
 well rested and so to garnish us 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.830
 madeleine must fill after this quarter to 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.910
 okay of course of course I 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.850
 am not jealous because I have a small 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.680
 little head and you can without problem the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.229
 do with a tablespoon then 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.450
 cooking between 8 and 12 minutes on my 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.240
 size of the molds obviously gives 190 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.770
 and prefer balls to him that's fine 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.220
 it's better the match will be a little bit more 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.220
 crunchy 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.440
 let's talk about the high expectation even before 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.239
 to exist because one has to be well 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.239
