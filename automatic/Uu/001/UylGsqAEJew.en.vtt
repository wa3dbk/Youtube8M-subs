part<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.579> them<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.780> i<00:00:45.780> don't<00:00:46.500> know<00:00:46.559> why<00:00:46.770> i

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
part of them that i don't know why i

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.819 
part of them that i don't know why i
thought<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.610> um<00:00:48.170> anyways<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.590> very

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
thought that but um anyways it's a very

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.060 
thought that but um anyways it's a very
very<00:00:50.100> smooth<00:00:50.430> track<00:00:51.079> it's<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.440> pretty<00:00:52.890> good

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
very smooth track it's it's pretty good

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.369 
very smooth track it's it's pretty good
fun<00:00:53.430> um<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:54.059> kind<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> more<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.170 
fun um it's kind of more on the
competitive<00:00:55.680> side<00:00:56.010> cuz<00:00:56.309> playing<00:00:56.910> by<00:00:57.059> yourself

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
competitive side cuz playing by yourself

anyways<00:01:12.689> though<00:01:12.869> also<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.619> jump<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
anyways though also that jump not the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.050 
anyways though also that jump not the
best<00:01:15.240> jump<00:01:15.600> ever<00:01:15.750> um<00:01:16.610> it<00:01:17.610> could<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.939> been

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
best jump ever um it could have been

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.749 
best jump ever um it could have been
better<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:19.890> doesn't<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.369> away<00:01:20.490> that

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
better but it doesn't take away that

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.969 
better but it doesn't take away that
much<00:01:21.000> from<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> track<00:01:21.619> but<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.770> still<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
much from the track but it's still a
