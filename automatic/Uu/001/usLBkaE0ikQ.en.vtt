00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.699
 Hello everyone, we will see the house today 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.770
 on a novelty from publishing the alphabet it 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.880
 comic called mortal kombat 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.789
 bloody bond 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.680
 this is the first book of all of them as far as knowing 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.590
 planned 4 or 3 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.860
 but until one actually came out the 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.000
 the building is again all glossy cover 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.950
 shimmers I don't know you really will 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.329
 seen on video or not here below 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.930
 listed actually 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.240
 authors are artists themselves author himself 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.260
 shawn skitls he is an artist doctor everything and 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.329
 ronnie k gandhi no disi comics logo up 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.730
 We have a disi comics publisher in Russia 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.780
 ABC with spine looks like this 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.730
 way logo mortal kombat name 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.600
 You can say the game and the comic book itself 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.930
 again listed authors and logo 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.640
 alphabet numbering first volume back 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.119
 hand looks like this here with us 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.189
 depicted Raiden is like stuck to 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.360
 the game itself which came out quite recently 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:21.110
 from China reviews about the dzhen test we see 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.170
 what is this about the publication itself 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.720
 all as done in ABC at the highest 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.060
 level well and now actually the very 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.650
 comic naturally i've already read it 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.110
 I probably will not spoil much 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.760
 I do not like when they reveal Oka Davos 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.380
 Those reviews are fully comic storyline. 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.080
 then probably it will be already uninteresting 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.090
 read to some people so strong 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.369
 spoilers will not tell so little 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.290
 about the plot and did you like the comics? 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.200
 or not like that we have a turn of sub-zero 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.380
 vitamin scorpion wallpaper not even on 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.549
 the desktop was like this 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.619
 property as for the plot 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.090
 the plot is divided into several 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.509
 Lines here are many different characters 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.750
 intertwined their lines yes there 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.200
 interaction so on here with us 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.180
 Immediately begins already line kenshi 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.970
 clan red dragon i don't remember hots 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.769
 u or whatever this name was 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.140
 the general to which the red dragon is still 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.880
 I remember was in the game mortal kombat 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.430
 apocalypse or how 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.420
 was called where armageddon water mortal 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.990
 kombat armageddon 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.970
 on playstation 2 and xbox 1 which else 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.590
 once it was here and there was a very large 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.580
 the number of characters almost all of them 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.110
 there is but with the exception of some 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.850
 here and the plot twists on the fact that 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.980
 the outside world or rather miles us city 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.630
 plans to capture the outside world 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.570
 and then earth and to talc which is like 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.780
 she goes to the earth instead of shawk 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.970
 to ask earthly for help 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.200
 warriors up to, in particular, the sony blade to 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.140
 she helped defeat milen their mountains otherwise 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.590
 how to torment the earth is waiting for the same as 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.870
 the outside world rally storyline and 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:18.230
 it's about how kidnapped son sonia blade 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.140
 casey father i'm by the way johnny cage and there 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.790
 yet . to my mind 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.760
 jackson brix up to which on iron 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.640
 with your hands around it all 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.350
 this whole plot is twisted 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.350
 comic well there will be different 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.160
 flashbacks a few years ago a little 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.240
 be told the scorpion story about 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.390
 he became like this want to have a demon 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:47.330
 how he sat down for his clan his family so 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.030
 as there is a lot of blood all 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.000
 severed hands severed heads guts 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.610
 brains and so on well, all as fact 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.430
 the best traditions of mortal kombat as well 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.830
 everyone's favorite scenes from 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.070
 x-ray but where they show how they break 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.070
 jaw bones liver knock out and so 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.020
 Further, in general, the comic is so great to me 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.790
 Loved it is natural not in vain 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.760
 it was somewhere eighteen plus 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.459
 the length of the dark become on it is not 18 + 4 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.389
 the logo 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.900
 strange on some comics there on 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.370
 injustice in my Levite described 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.669
 but on this comic is not for some reason 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.870
 age restrictions weird in general 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.639
 here with us and sabiro 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.770
 a very large amount as i said 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.110
 before the characters are not all here 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.020
 transfer not enough time well 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.729
 still the most famous here is sub ziro 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.330
 scorpion raid 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.849
 sleepyhead more John Cage and Goro sometimes 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:51.150
 there flashed a show to quite well on 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:54.689
 a little reptile here is kenshi the most such 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.879
 nasty villain what concerns 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:05:01.500
 drawing picture is also so great 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:04.289
 I liked Well, you can do 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.719
 observe everything so bright yes no of 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.719
 faint colors sub ziro 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:15.300
 in this respect, everything is fine drawings in terms of 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:20.400
 drawing and so on owning a raid 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:23.490
 the scorpion hook appears in sight and here 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:29.009
 actually sony blade and jackson daughters 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.810
 shave frost by the way forgot too 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.370

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.330

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.789
 to get hold of just shows us 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.689
 can score but this is the only one 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:45.199
 the moment came to us for me personally 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:48.139
 so new to character so who can 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.699

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:54.839
 Kinsay what type of this general is like 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:57.810
 know the Aztecs did the whole composition like 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:06:01.139
 cultures supposedly they were gods there and so 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:05.089

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:09.659
