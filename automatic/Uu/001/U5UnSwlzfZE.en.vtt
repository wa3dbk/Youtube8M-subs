00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:04.990
 painting is one of the least expensive and most effective partners for 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.590
 redecorating your home with a rayco sprayer 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.710
 you can change the look of any room in the house in a 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.770
 fraction of the time it would take to paint it by hand with a roller 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.710
 a brush before you start painting 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.980
 must perform all the necessary preparation tasks 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.989
 to achieve a satisfactory result 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.029
 received a few objects cover the mitation 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.649
 you do not want to paint 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.500
 repair damaged walls 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.090
 and fill in gurÃ­ physios and cracks 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.970
 I cleared the dust and the fast paris 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.840
 to see a list of the materials you need 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.090
 visit the project pages the command one point but ecopunto comma 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.670
 You can also check the material lists for the project of 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.530
 painting 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.060
 they will find us the division that is delivered with their pulverized 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.990
 When using the sprayer be sure to comply with all 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.440
 safety procedures I read the user manual and instructions for 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.440
 Safety before using the sprayer 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.380
 cover Genoese surfaces and paint uses a protective screen 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.289
 spray if small surfaces 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:16.890
 wherever you spray it 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.350
 Use a public accessory for pressure roller to get results 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.660
 excellent and to work a valuable time 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.360
 to start select the spray nozzle what better to separate the 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.280
 materials you use and the surface you want to paint 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.409
 usually for interior applications a nozzle with 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:37.360
 one hole 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.659
 from zero point 0 13 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.880
 make a point 0 15 inches 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.750
 spray patterns 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.610
 they vary according to the surfaces of the wones habits and the personal taste but 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.610
 in general they oscillate between 8 and 12 inches 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.470
 Ask your supplier to order the paint can and size label 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.930
 Nozzle is recommended for the paint you want to apply 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.050
 I was with a 5 15 nozzle to start and then adjust the size 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.979
 as required 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:08.970
 make sure 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.960
 that the size of the orifice of the nozzle does not demand the maximum capacity 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.789
 of the pulverized 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:19.929
 it is generally better to start from the top than to go painting is low 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:23.759
 I worked by sections did I painted the surfaces that I reached with 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.359
 comfort 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:29.510
 First paint the outer edges ribet and both monitor it you want 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.389
 pulverize and demilitarized the angles 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.540
 to paint the interior angles ap a stretch that already horizontally in 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:37.880
 direction to angle 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.159
 so that the paint covers both sides 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.280
 then light busti to the edge of the surface previously painted to 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:50.680
 that the past and after the penalty around a possible percent account 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.809
 first paint around the windows and doors and then continue with 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.879
 Flat surfaces after the past 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.479
 Once the work is finished, wait for the paint to dry and remove the tape and 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:08.359
 pop papers movies that used to protect it surfaces that what's going 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.590
 to paint and clean
