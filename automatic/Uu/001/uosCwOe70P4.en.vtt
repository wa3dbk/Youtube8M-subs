that<00:00:41.309> question<00:00:42.269> is<00:00:42.710> engine<00:00:43.710> selection<00:00:44.219> do<00:00:44.730> we

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
that question is engine selection do we

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.389 
that question is engine selection do we
go<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> lower<00:00:45.960> cost<00:00:46.260> engine<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.249> lower

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
go for a lower cost engine and a lower

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.459 
go for a lower cost engine and a lower
cost<00:00:47.640> airplane<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.690> lower<00:00:48.839> performance

cost airplane and a lower performance

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.709 
cost airplane and a lower performance
point<00:00:49.800> or<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.640> go<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.329> higher<00:00:51.449> cost

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
point or do we go for the higher cost

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.689 
point or do we go for the higher cost
higher<00:00:51.960> performance<00:00:52.559> let's<00:00:53.129> make<00:00:53.339> this<00:00:53.489> thing

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
higher performance let's make this thing

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.759 
higher performance let's make this thing
a<00:00:53.850> real<00:00:54.179> screamer<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> debate<00:00:55.739> that

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
a real screamer but it's a debate that

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.319 
a real screamer but it's a debate that

can't<00:01:39.300> be<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.440> sell<00:01:40.680> airplanes<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
can't be that we sell airplanes to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
do the least little thing wrong we've

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.050 
do the least little thing wrong we've
got<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:45.990> make<00:01:46.080> airplanes<00:01:46.290> easier<00:01:46.830> and<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.970> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
got to make airplanes easier and in this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.310 
got to make airplanes easier and in this
case<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.510> we've<00:01:48.630> got<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.990> Honeywell

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.770 
case what we've got with the Honeywell
engine<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.650> much<00:01:49.860> more<00:01:50.180> robust<00:01:51.180> system<00:01:51.630> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
engine is much more robust system to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.600 
engine is much more robust system to
protect<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.500> pen<00:01:52.680> think<00:01:53.250> how<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.460> sounds

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
protect the pen think how this sounds

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.610 
protect the pen think how this sounds
protect<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> engine<00:01:54.570> from<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.780> pilot<00:01:55.200> so

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
protect the engine from the pilot so

they<00:03:43.240> decide<00:03:43.540> on<00:03:43.660> their<00:03:43.750> airplane<00:03:44.110> but<00:03:44.739> then

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
they decide on their airplane but then

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.440 
they decide on their airplane but then
what<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.130> also<00:03:45.459> have<00:03:45.640> is<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.910> other<00:03:46.060> side<00:03:46.420> of

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
what you also have is the other side of

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.270 
what you also have is the other side of
your<00:03:46.660> brain<00:03:46.930> thinking<00:03:47.350> about<00:03:47.590> mission<00:03:47.980> dream

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
your brain thinking about mission dream

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.790 
your brain thinking about mission dream
if<00:03:48.520> you<00:03:48.670> will<00:03:49.020> missions<00:03:50.020> expand<00:03:50.530> with<00:03:50.709> the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
if you will missions expand with the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.590 
if you will missions expand with the
capability<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.580> are<00:03:51.670> offered<00:03:51.820> by<00:03:52.120> products

again<00:03:53.020> whether<00:03:53.260> it's<00:03:53.440> because<00:03:53.920> it's<00:03:54.070> easier

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
again whether it's because it's easier

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.010 
again whether it's because it's easier
to<00:03:54.489> user<00:03:54.670> because<00:03:55.060> it's<00:03:55.239> higher<00:03:55.390> performance

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
really excited about where the mission

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.820 
really excited about where the mission
goes<00:04:00.700> on<00:04:00.940> this<00:04:01.090> airplane<00:04:01.330> as<00:04:01.750> part<00:04:02.650> of<00:04:02.680> that

he produced the interior stuff can still
in<00:04:30.900> changing<00:04:31.350> but<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.530> outside<00:04:31.830> shape<00:04:32.040> is<00:04:32.250> now

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
in changing but the outside shape is now

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.820 
in changing but the outside shape is now

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
set a lot of volume we've increased the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.530 
set a lot of volume we've increased the
size<00:04:35.040> of<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.310> baggage<00:04:35.640> area<00:04:35.730> significantly

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
size of the baggage area significantly

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.060 
size of the baggage area significantly
and<00:04:36.990> I've<00:04:37.110> forgotten<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.560> number<00:04:37.800> already

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
and I've forgotten the number already

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.650 
and I've forgotten the number already
but<00:04:39.590> 36<00:04:40.590> cubic<00:04:40.890> feet<00:04:41.010> good<00:04:41.250> as<00:04:42.180> we've<00:04:42.480> flown

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
but 36 cubic feet good as we've flown

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.790 
but 36 cubic feet good as we've flown
the<00:04:42.780> prototype<00:04:43.170> around<00:04:43.440> one<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.680> things

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
the prototype around one of the things

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.260 
the prototype around one of the things
you<00:04:43.890> notice<00:04:44.040> will<00:04:44.490> say<00:04:44.640> well<00:04:44.790> we've<00:04:44.910> got<00:04:44.940> six

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
you notice will say well we've got six

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.670 
you notice will say well we've got six
seats<00:04:45.600> here<00:04:45.810> but<00:04:45.960> we<00:04:46.020> haven't<00:04:46.170> enough<00:04:46.410> space

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
seats here but we haven't enough space

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.900 
seats here but we haven't enough space
for<00:04:46.830> all<00:04:46.890> this<00:04:47.040> stuff<00:04:47.160> we<00:04:47.370> would<00:04:47.520> take<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:47.820> the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
for all this stuff we would take to the

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.670 
for all this stuff we would take to the
air<00:04:48.030> show<00:04:48.060> so<00:04:48.480> we<00:04:48.570> need<00:04:48.720> more<00:04:48.870> bag<00:04:49.230> of<00:04:49.380> space<00:04:49.560> to

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
air show so we need more bag of space to

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.260 
air show so we need more bag of space to
go<00:04:49.770> along<00:04:49.980> with<00:04:50.010> six<00:04:50.340> seeds<00:04:50.520> so<00:04:51.150> we've

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
go along with six seeds so we've

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.400 
go along with six seeds so we've
increased<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.690> baggage<00:04:52.020> space<00:04:52.200> we've

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
increased the baggage space we've

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.750 
increased the baggage space we've
increased<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.830> size<00:04:53.010> of<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.220> windows<00:04:53.550> we've

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
increased the size of the windows we've

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.270 
increased the size of the windows we've
increased<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.210> aisle<00:04:54.450> width<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:55.050> it's<00:04:56.040> all

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
increased the aisle width and it's all

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.940 
increased the aisle width and it's all
coming<00:04:56.760> down<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:56.970> this<00:04:57.390> pretty<00:04:58.290> good<00:04:58.380> package

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
coming down to this pretty good package

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.280 
coming down to this pretty good package
we<00:04:59.130> feel<00:04:59.340> very<00:04:59.580> good<00:04:59.760> about<00:04:59.960> some<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:01.140> the

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
we feel very good about some of the

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.780 
we feel very good about some of the
things<00:05:01.590> that<00:05:01.770> are<00:05:01.860> important<00:05:02.310> in<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.580> are

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
things that are important in that are

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.730 
things that are important in that are
making<00:05:03.030> sure<00:05:03.300> that<00:05:03.480> the<00:05:03.630> spar<00:05:03.960> is<00:05:04.140> now<00:05:04.350> below

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
making sure that the spar is now below

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.300 
making sure that the spar is now below
the<00:05:05.040> the<00:05:05.340> floor<00:05:05.640> got<00:05:06.120> a<00:05:06.150> nice<00:05:06.270> flat<00:05:06.570> floor

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
the the floor got a nice flat floor

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.010 
the the floor got a nice flat floor
we've<00:05:08.310> questioned<00:05:08.970> ourselves<00:05:09.390> many<00:05:09.570> times<00:05:09.840> on

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
we've questioned ourselves many times on

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.120 
we've questioned ourselves many times on
that<00:05:10.170> not<00:05:10.380> whether<00:05:10.560> or<00:05:10.620> not<00:05:10.680> it's<00:05:10.800> a<00:05:10.830> good<00:05:10.980> idea

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
that not whether or not it's a good idea

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.380 
that not whether or not it's a good idea

all<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.000> cad<00:05:15.150> model<00:05:15.450> looks<00:05:15.600> good<00:05:15.920> so<00:05:16.920> the<00:05:17.220> the

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
all the cad model looks good so the the

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.240 
all the cad model looks good so the the

it's certified but that's primarily a

the<00:06:24.900> business<00:06:25.350> cases<00:06:25.800> get<00:06:26.160> the<00:06:26.250> airplane<00:06:26.460> into

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
the business cases get the airplane into

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.580 
the business cases get the airplane into
production<00:06:26.970> as<00:06:27.180> fast<00:06:27.360> as<00:06:27.540> possible<00:06:27.600> and<00:06:28.200> put

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
production as fast as possible and put

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.780 
production as fast as possible and put
the<00:06:28.680> parachute<00:06:29.010> on<00:06:29.130> when<00:06:29.310> the<00:06:29.400> parachutes

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
the parachute on when the parachutes

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.730 
the parachute on when the parachutes
ready<00:06:30.060> but<00:06:30.780> are<00:06:30.840> we<00:06:30.870> working<00:06:31.260> with<00:06:31.290> with<00:06:31.710> the

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
ready but are we working with with the

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.740 
ready but are we working with with the
people<00:06:32.070> at<00:06:32.160> BRS<00:06:32.460> on<00:06:32.760> developing<00:06:33.210> a<00:06:33.300> parachute

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
people at BRS on developing a parachute

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.110 
people at BRS on developing a parachute
so<00:06:34.650> that's<00:06:34.770> another<00:06:35.370> of<00:06:35.580> the<00:06:35.669> system

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
so that's another of the system

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.530 
so that's another of the system
integrations<00:06:36.870> that<00:06:37.169> will

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
integrations that will

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.750 
integrations that will
be<00:06:37.660> working<00:06:38.380> into<00:06:38.530> the<00:06:38.590> airplane<00:06:38.950> as<00:06:39.430> we<00:06:39.610> get

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
be working into the airplane as we get

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.330 
be working into the airplane as we get
all<00:06:39.850> those<00:06:40.000> systems<00:06:40.780> decisions<00:06:41.410> made<00:06:42.040> and

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
all those systems decisions made and

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.470 
all those systems decisions made and
will<00:06:42.520> be<00:06:42.610> going<00:06:42.850> through<00:06:42.880> the<00:06:43.090> final<00:06:43.360> design

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
will be going through the final design

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.300 
will be going through the final design
obviously<00:06:43.990> then<00:06:44.140> we<00:06:44.260> get<00:06:44.410> into<00:06:44.650> the<00:06:44.890> formal

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
obviously then we get into the formal

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.310 
obviously then we get into the formal
certification<00:06:45.460> process<00:06:46.330> that<00:06:46.660> we<00:06:47.020> all<00:06:47.110> end<00:06:47.290> up

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
certification process that we all end up

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.230 
certification process that we all end up
talking<00:06:47.620> about<00:06:47.800> so<00:06:47.950> much<00:06:48.130> we<00:06:48.880> still<00:06:49.090> think

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
talking about so much we still think

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.870 
talking about so much we still think
it's<00:06:49.450> call<00:06:50.290> it<00:06:50.440> roughly<00:06:50.740> three<00:06:51.040> years<00:06:51.310> we

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
it's call it roughly three years we

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.370 
it's call it roughly three years we
don't<00:06:52.090> know<00:06:52.180> how<00:06:52.330> fast<00:06:52.630> we<00:06:52.840> don't<00:06:53.050> know<00:06:53.170> when

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
don't know how fast we don't know when

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.290 
don't know how fast we don't know when
we<00:06:53.680> don't<00:06:53.890> know<00:06:53.980> how<00:06:54.130> much<00:06:54.340> all<00:06:54.790> those<00:06:55.000> kinds

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
we don't know how much all those kinds

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.910 
we don't know how much all those kinds
of<00:06:55.330> things<00:06:55.480> that<00:06:55.600> we<00:06:55.780> always<00:06:55.990> say<00:06:56.140> but<00:06:56.800> it's

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
of things that we always say but it's

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.170 
of things that we always say but it's
all<00:06:57.040> feeling<00:06:57.370> pretty<00:06:57.490> good<00:06:57.670> there<00:06:57.850> aren't<00:06:58.030> any

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
all feeling pretty good there aren't any

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.120 
all feeling pretty good there aren't any
big<00:06:58.480> decisions<00:06:58.690> that<00:06:59.410> we're<00:06:59.650> waiting<00:06:59.890> for

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130 
big decisions that we're waiting for

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.870 
big decisions that we're waiting for
that<00:07:00.610> we<00:07:00.730> feel<00:07:01.060> are<00:07:01.920> unknowns<00:07:02.920> now<00:07:03.280> that<00:07:03.700> would

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880 
that we feel are unknowns now that would

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.550 
that we feel are unknowns now that would
change<00:07:04.180> the<00:07:04.450> design<00:07:04.600> significantly<00:07:05.410> or

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
change the design significantly or

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.860 
change the design significantly or
change<00:07:05.800> the<00:07:05.980> schedule<00:07:06.160> significantly<00:07:06.880> so<00:07:07.750> the

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
change the schedule significantly so the

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.020 
change the schedule significantly so the
