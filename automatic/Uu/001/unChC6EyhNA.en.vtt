gonna go over some what a camera gimbal

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.570 
gonna go over some what a camera gimbal
does<00:00:08.540> I've<00:00:09.540> got<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.960> hump<00:00:10.170> TD<00:00:10.410> here<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:10.980> ready<00:00:11.490> to

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
does I've got a hump TD here on ready to

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.079 
does I've got a hump TD here on ready to
go<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.830> see<00:00:13.830> I've<00:00:13.980> got<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> GoPro<00:00:14.340> mounted<00:00:14.910> on

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
go and see I've got the GoPro mounted on

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.450 
go and see I've got the GoPro mounted on
him<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.719> now<00:00:16.170> here's<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.529> camera<00:00:16.830> gimbal<00:00:17.010> now

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
him and now here's the camera gimbal now

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.109 
him and now here's the camera gimbal now
as<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.060> notice<00:00:18.270> as<00:00:19.430> Humpty<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.520> flying<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
as you notice as Humpty is flying in the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.580 
as you notice as Humpty is flying in the
air<00:00:21.949> as<00:00:23.210> he<00:00:24.210> tilts<00:00:24.600> back<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.050> forth<00:00:27.590> you

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
air as he tilts back and forth you

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.209 
air as he tilts back and forth you
notice<00:00:28.859> how<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> camera<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.910> staying<00:00:30.269> put

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
notice how the camera is staying put

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.959 
notice how the camera is staying put
that<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:33.500> it's<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.920> bit<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.160> an<00:00:35.280> amazing

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
that is it's it's a bit of an amazing

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.540 
that is it's it's a bit of an amazing
technology<00:00:36.300> actually<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.680> basically

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
technology actually but it's a basically

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.180 
technology actually but it's a basically
two<00:00:38.760> servo<00:00:39.180> motors<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.050> tilt<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
two servo motors one for tilt and the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.940 
two servo motors one for tilt and the
other<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.640> roll<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.440> what<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> does<00:00:43.710> is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
other for the roll and what it does is

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.590 
other for the roll and what it does is
it<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.100> simply<00:00:44.460> moves<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.149> opposite

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
it just simply moves the opposite

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.400 
it just simply moves the opposite
direction<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> craft<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.820> doing<00:00:48.410> now

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
direction of what the craft is doing now

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.160 
direction of what the craft is doing now
this<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.829> two<00:00:50.100> axis<00:00:50.700> gimbal<00:00:51.030> meaning<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> has

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
this is a two axis gimbal meaning it has

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.830 
this is a two axis gimbal meaning it has
the<00:00:52.350> role<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.920> has<00:00:53.340> tilt<00:00:53.699> however<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.750> it

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the role and has tilt however what it

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.920 
the role and has tilt however what it
doesn't<00:00:55.050> do<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.559> side<00:00:55.890> by<00:00:56.039> side<00:00:56.300> so<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.809> I'm

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
doesn't do is side by side so what I'm

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.260 
doesn't do is side by side so what I'm
finding<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.620> lot<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.829> my<00:00:59.070> videos<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.120> if

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
finding in a lot of my videos is that if

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.229 
finding in a lot of my videos is that if
you<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:00.930> bit<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.289> rough<00:01:01.500> wind<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
you get a little bit of a rough wind and

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.609 
you get a little bit of a rough wind and
the<00:01:03.239> craft<00:01:03.480> starts<00:01:03.750> doing<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.470> notice

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the craft starts doing this you notice

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.609 
the craft starts doing this you notice
how<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.890> camera<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.489> able<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.299> move<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> what

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
how the camera is able to move so what

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.929 
how the camera is able to move so what
I'm<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.189> I'm<00:01:08.250> gonna<00:01:08.310> replace<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna replace it

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.539 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna replace it
with<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> 3-axis<00:01:10.260> gimbal<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.860> I'll<00:01:11.280> show<00:01:11.520> you

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
with a 3-axis gimbal and I'll show you

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.170 
with a 3-axis gimbal and I'll show you
what<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.510> does<00:01:13.520> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.700> gonna<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.939> my<00:01:15.030> new

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
what that does this is gonna be my new

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.170 
what that does this is gonna be my new
gimbal<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> 3-axis<00:01:17.250> gimbal<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:18.060> you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
gimbal this is a 3-axis gimbal as you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.060 
gimbal this is a 3-axis gimbal as you
can<00:01:18.299> see<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> camera<00:01:18.900> with<00:01:19.049> mount<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.530> here

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
can see the camera with mount on here

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.300 
can see the camera with mount on here
and<00:01:20.659> did<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:23.070> got

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and did you see it's got the it's got

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.109 
and did you see it's got the it's got
the<00:01:23.520> roll<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:25.229> got<00:01:25.380> pitch<00:01:25.820> but<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> also

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
the roll and it's got pitch but it also

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.670 
the roll and it's got pitch but it also
has<00:01:28.049> side<00:01:28.350> by<00:01:28.500> side<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:30.079> if<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.320> cameras

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
has side by side so if the cameras

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.170 
has side by side so if the cameras
mounted<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:32.729> all<00:01:32.759> the

mounted here you can see all the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.600 
mounted here you can see all the
different<00:01:33.570> motions<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.189> craft<00:01:35.490> could

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
different motions that the craft could

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.920 
different motions that the craft could
be<00:01:35.850> doing<00:01:37.880> get<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.909> camera<00:01:39.390> would<00:01:39.720> stay

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
be doing get the camera would stay

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.030 
be doing get the camera would stay
absolutely<00:01:40.650> put<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:43.229> gonna<00:01:43.470> go<00:01:43.649> install

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
well it's next morning I finished a

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.890 
well it's next morning I finished a
project<00:04:06.140> as<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.620> see<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:07.480> so<00:04:08.480> now<00:04:08.570> let's<00:04:08.780> take

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
project as you see and so now let's take

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.000 
project as you see and so now let's take
a<00:04:08.960> look<00:04:09.200> at<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.830> result<00:04:10.420> so<00:04:11.420> here<00:04:11.570> we<00:04:11.630> go

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
a look at the result so here we go

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.100 
a look at the result so here we go
here's<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.220> new<00:04:13.370> 3<00:04:13.670> axis<00:04:14.060> gimbal<00:04:14.090> in<00:04:14.630> action

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
here's the new 3 axis gimbal in action

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.430 
here's the new 3 axis gimbal in action
as<00:04:15.260> you<00:04:15.980> can<00:04:16.160> see<00:04:16.400> as<00:04:16.670> I<00:04:17.420> tilt<00:04:17.480> back<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.140> forth

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
as you can see as I tilt back and forth

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.590 
as you can see as I tilt back and forth
back<00:04:19.130> and<00:04:19.160> forth<00:04:19.400> this<00:04:19.700> way<00:04:19.760> like<00:04:20.239> a<00:04:20.269> little

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
back and forth this way like a little

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.840 
back and forth this way like a little
