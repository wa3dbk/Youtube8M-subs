00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.240
 commented by random user what in 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.370
 this occasion I bring you is one of the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.350
 games that like many java players 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.420
 game fans the diamonds of Tony Stark 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.730
 We've been waiting since they filter 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.710
 the news of his future existence me 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.660
 I mean clear ironman 3 of the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.189
 movie that premieres soon 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.539
 little that I saw compared to the few 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.090
 images of its version for smartphones 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.270
 the java version is going to be much better 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.610
 that the ios and android I'm sure and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.500
 how can I be sure good people 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.270
 of smartphone will know how much worse is not 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.399
 the game of men in black 3 that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.649
 he also made game love while his 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.030
 java version was much better since 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.890
 had more action and game dynamics 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.260
 and also in the case of an official game 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.940
 from a movie we the ones that we have 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.940
 Ã¡lava we will be able to experience 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.579
 before the movie is released 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.519
 said here in Argentina premiere 25 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.800
 April that they came forward one week 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.080
 I swear I do not have the slightest idea 7 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.990
 It was applied to all throughout Latin America 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.549
 america or around the world the thing is 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.130
 that the mobile game is coming for us 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.060
 before that for the teams 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.390
 sophisticated 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.890
 and apart from this I remember it well there 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.170
 passed with the game in quotes 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.140
 officer 'fast and furious' without 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.950
 control so well done by gameloft 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.720
 while the version for smartphones 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.909
 it left the same day that it premiered the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.039
 movie in the world to just had 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.929
 out last week so 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.030
 many of us could know before I went to 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:39.190
 Roll the new movie car 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.610
 who says you were obsolete that you 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.979
 extinguished that it does not work without good maybe 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.900
 but it's never dead, let's remember that 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.060
 the cradle of mobile games and now 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.820
 without further ado comments on the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.490
 game in this game we deal with the 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.479
 new armor from iron man the aemec to 42 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.430
 or marc 42 although as in its which is its 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.530
 version for smartphones the game has 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.229
 with a room of between 18 armors for 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.420
 choose to play the java version 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.890
 only has five of which 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.630
 four are unlocked in compliance 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.660
 missions what would make the game something 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.220
 repetitive 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.050
 each level has three 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.600
 collectibles scattered throughout 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.560
 the same ones that we must collect these 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.350
 are the ones who are going to help us 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.700
 unlock the other armors the 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.380
 levels also have three 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.090
 missions to fulfill already 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.980
 collect a certain amount of chips 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.350
 as they have the level in a certain amount 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.440
 of time how to avoid damage in certain 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.440
 occasions 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.090
 remember that the version that we are 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.580
 seeing is what corresponds to the sony 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.650
 ericsson k 800 is because we can 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.550
 delight us with the maximum of animations 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.340
 and scenes for the 240 x 320 screen 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.420
 pixels since although there are dimensions 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.560
 Larger screen like 360 x 640 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.420
 they do not have the same graphic quality 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.420
 on the contrary they are minor 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.810
 a double game comparison there was no 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.000
 already made the official game of the movie 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.959
 of iron man 2 for both smartphones 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.719
 as for mobile 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.049
 the difference was not much 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:14.750
 missions dialogues enemy characters e 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.480
 stories both versions were almost 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.120
 same I say almost because in the version 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.360
 of was handled based the character so much 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.270
 ironman as war machine 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.000
 from the back view that is to say you put 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.760
 in its place the same as in the diary 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.050
 said android only that in these you 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.730
 you could go through the map where 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.489
 the action was going 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.590
 and now in the iron man 3 is the 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.290
 mobile version where you can explore your 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.900
 craving on the level map while 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.480
 in the version for airs and android 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.799
 apparently what is according to what 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.170
 it was seen in the trailers videos of 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.239
 gameloft had to fly constantly 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.360
 to an address with no possibility of 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.250
 explore the map good as always if 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.200
 they liked the video you can give thumb 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.849
