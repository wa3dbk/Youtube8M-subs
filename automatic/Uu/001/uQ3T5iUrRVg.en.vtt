00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
important feature is here this is what

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.449 
important feature is here this is what
we<00:01:26.749> call<00:01:26.899> a<00:01:26.929> left<00:01:27.229> exit<00:01:27.709> region<00:01:28.069> of<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.249> jet

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:28.459 
we call a left exit region of the jet

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:30.489 
we call a left exit region of the jet
stream<00:01:28.609> and<00:01:28.880> that's<00:01:29.359> a<00:01:29.569> zone<00:01:29.779> for<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.109> rapid

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:30.499 
stream and that's a zone for the rapid

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:32.050 
stream and that's a zone for the rapid
development<00:01:30.529> of<00:01:31.039> areas<00:01:31.759> of<00:01:31.880> low<00:01:32.029> pressure

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
development of areas of low pressure

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.819 
development of areas of low pressure
which<00:01:32.599> is<00:01:32.630> exactly<00:01:32.899> what's<00:01:33.439> going<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.709> take

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
which is exactly what's going to take

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.709 
which is exactly what's going to take
place<00:01:33.889> as<00:01:34.369> we<00:01:34.670> get<00:01:34.819> through<00:01:34.999> towards<00:01:35.389> Friday
