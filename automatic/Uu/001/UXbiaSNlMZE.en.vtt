now I think it's a shame that he had to
leave<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.680> think<00:03:22.890> it's<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.070> shame<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.310> he<00:03:23.550> got

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
leave I think it's a shame that he got

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.870 
leave I think it's a shame that he got
