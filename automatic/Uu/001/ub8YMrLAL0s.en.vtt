here<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:20.900> um<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:23.000> there's<00:03:23.450> actually<00:03:23.660> like<00:03:24.110> two

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
here so um so there's actually like two

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.250 
here so um so there's actually like two
bundles<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.250> each<00:03:25.549> pack<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:26.390> i<00:03:26.660> bought<00:03:27.110> two

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
bundles and each pack so i bought two

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.280 
bundles and each pack so i bought two
packs<00:03:27.530> which<00:03:27.980> would<00:03:28.160> make<00:03:28.549> it<00:03:28.760> four<00:03:29.030> bundles

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
packs which would make it four bundles

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.140 
packs which would make it four bundles
so<00:03:30.290> i<00:03:30.680> pretty<00:03:30.890> much<00:03:31.010> used<00:03:31.489> all<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.940> four

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
so i pretty much used all the four

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.120 
so i pretty much used all the four
bundles<00:03:32.330> because<00:03:33.170> i<00:03:33.320> only<00:03:33.470> have<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.680> handful

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
bundles because i only have a handful

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.250 
bundles because i only have a handful
left<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:35.330> I<00:03:35.360> pretty<00:03:35.540> much<00:03:35.690> use<00:03:35.810> i'll

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
left so I pretty much use i'll

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.500 
left so I pretty much use i'll
definitely<00:03:36.830> see<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.070> cornrow<00:03:37.820> part<00:03:38.150> was<00:03:38.390> the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
definitely see the cornrow part was the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.039 
definitely see the cornrow part was the
most<00:03:38.720> difficult<00:03:38.930> for<00:03:39.680> me<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.970> took<00:03:41.570> like

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
most difficult for me it took like

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.960 
most difficult for me it took like
pretty<00:03:42.380> much<00:03:42.470> all<00:03:42.830> day<00:03:42.920> for<00:03:43.489> me<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.760> finish

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
pretty much all day for me to finish

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.539 
pretty much all day for me to finish
doing<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.480> chron<00:03:44.750> grows<00:03:44.959> like<00:03:45.549> probably

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
doing the chron grows like probably

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:47.949 
doing the chron grows like probably
because<00:03:46.670> i'm<00:03:46.940> not<00:03:47.060> really<00:03:47.269> good<00:03:47.360> at<00:03:47.570> cornrows

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
because i'm not really good at cornrows

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.070 
because i'm not really good at cornrows
I<00:03:48.140> did<00:03:48.410> not<00:03:48.620> want<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.010> do<00:03:49.220> straight<00:03:49.840> front<00:03:50.840> and

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
I did not want to do straight front and

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.410 
I did not want to do straight front and
back<00:03:51.350> hormones<00:03:51.830> because<00:03:52.040> I<00:03:52.220> hated<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.940> way<00:03:53.120> it

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
back hormones because I hated the way it

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.830 
back hormones because I hated the way it
looked<00:03:53.750> when<00:03:53.870> um<00:03:54.739> when<00:03:55.580> you<00:03:55.910> when<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.299> split<00:03:56.690> in

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
looked when um when you when it split in

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.800 
looked when um when you when it split in
the<00:03:56.930> middle<00:03:57.340> when<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.730> parts<00:03:59.090> in<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.390> middle

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
the middle when the parts in the middle

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.720 
the middle when the parts in the middle
and<00:04:00.019> then<00:04:00.170> you<00:04:00.320> can<00:04:00.440> actually<00:04:00.620> see<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:01.310> hair

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
and then you can actually see the hair

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.660 
and then you can actually see the hair
because<00:04:02.720> like<00:04:03.230> you<00:04:03.590> can't<00:04:03.860> really<00:04:04.070> see<00:04:04.220> the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
because like you can't really see the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.580 
because like you can't really see the
way<00:04:04.820> I<00:04:04.850> did<00:04:05.090> it<00:04:05.239> you<00:04:05.329> can't<00:04:05.540> really<00:04:05.690> see<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:06.350> mean

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
way I did it you can't really see I mean

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.140 
way I did it you can't really see I mean
you<00:04:06.680> can<00:04:06.860> see<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.310> but<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:07.519> can't<00:04:07.850> really<00:04:08.000> see

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
you can see it but you can't really see

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.890 
you can see it but you can't really see
it<00:04:08.420> if<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:08.930> know<00:04:09.079> any<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:10.070> I<00:04:10.100> decided<00:04:10.640> to
