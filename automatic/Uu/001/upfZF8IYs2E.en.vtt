00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.410 
watch karate girl the crabs here and I
got<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> very<00:00:03.480> small<00:00:03.710> automatic<00:00:04.710> stone

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
got a very small automatic stone

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.000 
got a very small automatic stone
generator<00:00:06.710> so<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.400> for<00:00:08.880> high<00:00:09.800> for<00:00:10.800> wide

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
generator so this is for high for wide

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.240 
generator so this is for high for wide
and<00:00:11.340> 3<00:00:12.330> long<00:00:12.540> as<00:00:12.780> it's<00:00:13.230> really<00:00:13.530> long<00:00:13.620> because

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
and 3 long as it's really long because

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.500 
and 3 long as it's really long because
this<00:00:15.210> blog<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.839> like<00:00:16.670> what<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.820> kind<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.210> can't

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
this blog is like what you kind of can't

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.050 
this blog is like what you kind of can't
do<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.050> way<00:00:19.109> but<00:00:19.560> then<00:00:19.680> have<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.880> do

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
do this this way but then have to do

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.580 
do this this way but then have to do
like<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.779> then<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.990> water<00:00:22.140> will<00:00:22.380> spill

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
like that and then the water will spill

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.550 
like that and then the water will spill
out<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.789> could<00:00:24.090> say<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:25.380> white

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
out so you could say this is for white

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.929 
out so you could say this is for white
but<00:00:25.769> I'm<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:26.099> going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.310> say<00:00:26.460> three<00:00:26.730> white

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
but I'm just going to say three white

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.810 
but I'm just going to say three white
because<00:00:27.300> yeah<00:00:28.070> this<00:00:29.070> would<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> shame<00:00:29.760> that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
because yeah this would be a shame that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.630 
because yeah this would be a shame that
this<00:00:30.150> one<00:00:30.449> block<00:00:30.689> would<00:00:30.960> add<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> sign<00:00:31.640> but

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
this one block would add to the sign but

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.630 
this one block would add to the sign but
yeah<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.710> got<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.219> an<00:00:35.340> off<00:00:35.489> switch

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
yeah here I got my on an off switch

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.330 
yeah here I got my on an off switch
which<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.300> control<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.809> torch<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.160> got

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
which just control this torch then I got

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.790 
which just control this torch then I got
my<00:00:38.520> reset<00:00:39.149> button<00:00:39.180> there<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.379> what<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.649> do

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
my reset button there so what you do

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.549 
my reset button there so what you do
there<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.489> flick<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.230> it

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
there just flick it on to the on and it

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.190 
there just flick it on to the on and it
will<00:00:43.680> start<00:00:43.890> generating<00:00:44.340> very<00:00:44.910> quickly<00:00:45.200> and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
will start generating very quickly and

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.979 
will start generating very quickly and
this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:47.129> bud<00:00:47.460> switch<00:00:47.780> which<00:00:48.780> goes

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
this is just a bud switch which goes

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.939 
this is just a bud switch which goes
into<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.890> torch<00:00:50.600> dust<00:00:51.649> goes<00:00:52.649> into<00:00:52.920> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
into this torch dust goes into that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.770 
into this torch dust goes into that
piston<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:54.690> here<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.910> this<00:00:56.910> act<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> bud

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
piston and up here and this act as a bud

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.459 
piston and up here and this act as a bud
switch<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.320> both<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.800> them<00:00:59.870> but<00:01:00.870> most<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.289> this

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
switch for both of them but most of this

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.240 
switch for both of them but most of this
then<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.750> done<00:01:03.979> their<00:01:04.979> in-house

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
then just one this done their in-house

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
then just one this done their in-house
at<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.270> down<00:01:06.540> while<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.350> still

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
at all or do it down while it's still

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.130 
at all or do it down while it's still
going<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.090> then<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.270> want<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.750> hit<00:01:09.930> this

rest<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:53.520> bud<00:01:53.820> switch

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
rest on because this is now bud switch

rest on because this is now bud switch
as<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.479> see<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.840> reset<00:01:55.799> itself<00:01:57.680> then<00:01:58.680> you

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
as you can see as reset itself then you

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.420 
as you can see as reset itself then you
wanna<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.430> put<00:01:59.640> glass<00:01:59.969> right<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.409> and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
wanna just put glass right here and

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.270 
wanna just put glass right here and
class<00:02:02.430> up<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.820> so

buff and then you can have your little
level<00:02:15.459> right<00:02:15.580> here<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.510> have<00:02:16.629> had<00:02:16.840> this

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
level right here and I have had this

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.559 
level right here and I have had this
happen<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.530> lot<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:17.920> times<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.430> know<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:19.239> just

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
happen a lot of times I know it's just

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.970 
happen a lot of times I know it's just
this<00:02:19.780> design<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.650> happens<00:02:20.920> quite<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.640> lot

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
this design but that happens quite a lot
