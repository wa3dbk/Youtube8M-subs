I'm working fairly generally at this

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:01.140 
I'm working fairly generally at this
stage<00:01:52.130> I'm<00:01:52.430> just<00:01:52.790> mapping<00:01:53.000> some<00:01:53.330> stuff<00:01:53.540> in

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.250 

it's<00:02:02.150> normal<00:02:02.510> at<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:02.690> stage<00:02:02.750> you're

it's normal at this stage you're

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.440 
it's normal at this stage you're
painting<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.740> look<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:04.040> little<00:02:04.250> messy<00:02:04.460> one<00:02:05.330> of

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
painting to look a little messy one of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.810 
painting to look a little messy one of
the<00:02:05.600> most<00:02:06.380> obvious<00:02:06.560> things<00:02:06.740> my<00:02:07.130> students<00:02:07.640> do

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
the most obvious things my students do

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.940 
the most obvious things my students do
is<00:02:08.209> they<00:02:08.780> give<00:02:08.959> themselves<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.410> really<00:02:09.709> hard

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
is they give themselves a really hard

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.860 
is they give themselves a really hard
time<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.520> painting<00:02:10.850> looks<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.270> bit<00:02:11.569> messy

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
time that the painting looks a bit messy

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.230 
time that the painting looks a bit messy
when<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.890> course<00:02:13.069> it's<00:02:13.490> not<00:02:13.640> finished<00:02:13.880> we're
