00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.499 
I didn't have any experience with it so
I<00:01:29.009> thought<00:01:29.400> that's<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.880> how<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.119> went<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
I thought that's just how it went and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.179 
I thought that's just how it went and
once<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.990> plugged<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.890> started

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
once I plugged this one in and started

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.609 
once I plugged this one in and started
using<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:33.150> really<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.600> powerful<00:01:34.170> tool

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
using it it's really a powerful tool

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.980 
using it it's really a powerful tool
especially<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.280> how<00:01:35.610> small<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.869> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
especially for how small it is and it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.960 
especially for how small it is and it
really<00:01:37.170> got<00:01:37.500> right<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.829> there<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.310> finished

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
really got right in there and I finished

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.460 
really got right in there and I finished
the<00:01:39.119> job<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.420> no<00:01:39.540> time<00:01:39.720> after<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.079> started<00:01:40.380> using

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the job in no time after I started using

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.350 
the job in no time after I started using
this<00:01:40.829> okay<00:01:41.250> tell<00:01:41.670> me<00:01:41.700> about<00:01:41.850> switching<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
this okay tell me about switching the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.359 
this okay tell me about switching the
sandpaper<00:01:42.689> out<00:01:42.960> switching<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.829> sandpaper<00:01:44.040> is

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
sandpaper out switching the sandpaper is

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.330 
sandpaper out switching the sandpaper is
really<00:01:44.670> easy<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.360> velcro<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.860> do

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
really easy this is velcro on here so do

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.219 
really easy this is velcro on here so do
you<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.610> pull<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.000> off<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.630> then<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.110> have

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you just pull this off and then you have

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.319 
you just pull this off and then you have
the<00:01:49.380> pre-cut<00:01:49.890> sheets<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.670> are<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.090> same

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the pre-cut sheets that are the same

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.450 
the pre-cut sheets that are the same
shape<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.930> slap<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.649> there<00:01:52.950> where<00:01:53.399> did

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
shape and slap that on there where did

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.889 
shape and slap that on there where did
you<00:01:53.549> go<00:01:53.640> seems<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.210> did<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> lot<00:01:54.840> of

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
you go seems like you did a lot of

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.719 
you go seems like you did a lot of
sanding<00:01:55.439> how<00:01:55.770> did<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.950> sandpaper<00:01:56.189> hold<00:01:56.579> up

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
sanding how did the sandpaper hold up

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.609 
sanding how did the sandpaper hold up
for<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.299> sandpaper<00:01:57.810> old<00:01:57.930> up<00:01:58.110> really<00:01:58.439> well

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
I really only used one other sheet and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.270 
I really only used one other sheet and
then<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.100> that

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
and it comes with an orbital and also a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.350 
and it comes with an orbital and also a
detail

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
detail

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.730 
detail
and<00:02:12.540> her<00:02:12.630> function<00:02:13.050> did<00:02:13.170> use<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:13.410> at<00:02:13.650> all

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
and her function did use that at all

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.790 
and her function did use that at all
yeah<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.430> tried<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.790> out<00:02:15.000> there<00:02:15.240> was<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.800> detail

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
yeah I tried it out there was a detail

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.230 
yeah I tried it out there was a detail
sander<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.340> goes<00:02:17.490> on<00:02:17.700> here<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:18.000> you'd<00:02:18.120> be

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
sander that goes on here that you'd be

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.390 
sander that goes on here that you'd be
used<00:02:18.450> around<00:02:18.710> spindles<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.890> railing<00:02:20.070> or

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
used around spindles and a railing or

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.230 
used around spindles and a railing or
something<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:20.820> that

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
something like that

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.000 
something like that
I<00:02:21.270> put<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:21.990> there<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:22.350> really<00:02:22.590> sturdy<00:02:22.830> I

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
I put it on there it's really sturdy I

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.590 
I put it on there it's really sturdy I
didn't<00:02:23.370> necessarily<00:02:23.520> need<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.120> but<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.390> checked

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
didn't necessarily need it but I checked

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.240 
didn't necessarily need it but I checked
it<00:02:24.720> out<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.020> then<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.170> pulled<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.650> off<00:02:25.860> and

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
it out and then I pulled this off and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.070 
it out and then I pulled this off and
changed<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> orbital<00:02:27.390> sander<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.900> to

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
changed it to the orbital sander just to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.170 
changed it to the orbital sander just to
see<00:02:28.620> how<00:02:28.770> easy<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.070> was<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.310> change<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.970> I

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
see how easy it was to change and I

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.000 
see how easy it was to change and I
didn't<00:02:30.480> need<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.630> use<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.140> but<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.560> was<00:02:31.710> really

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
didn't need to use it but it was really

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
didn't need to use it but it was really
easy<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.430> switch<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.700> out

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
easy to switch it out

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.420 
easy to switch it out
okay<00:02:33.330> did<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.720> dare<00:02:33.930> twist<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.530> knob<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:35.070> did

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
okay did you dare twist the knob I did

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.310 
okay did you dare twist the knob I did
yes<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:36.030> did<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.420> tried<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.810> different<00:02:37.140> settings

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
yes I did I tried the different settings

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.230 
yes I did I tried the different settings
just<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.770> see<00:02:37.950> how<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.190> works<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.610> fat<00:02:38.940> there's

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
just to see how it works the fat there's

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.850 
just to see how it works the fat there's
faster<00:02:39.630> settings<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.140> found<00:02:40.380> really<00:02:40.620> good

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
faster settings that I found really good

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.050 
faster settings that I found really good
for<00:02:41.040> when<00:02:41.070> you're<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> middle<00:02:41.970> of

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
for when you're just in the middle of

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
for when you're just in the middle of
the<00:02:42.150> door<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.720> want<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.290> crank<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.650> out<00:02:43.709> and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the door and want to crank it out and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.560 
the door and want to crank it out and
then<00:02:44.130> it's<00:02:44.340> good<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.760> go<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.970> little<00:02:45.090> bit<00:02:45.300> slower

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
then it's good to go a little bit slower

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.780 
then it's good to go a little bit slower
around<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.050> edges<00:02:46.380> well<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.190> looks<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.430> your

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
around the edges well it looks like your

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.730 
around the edges well it looks like your
natural<00:02:48.030> with<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.750> just<00:02:48.870> hold<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.620> like

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740
