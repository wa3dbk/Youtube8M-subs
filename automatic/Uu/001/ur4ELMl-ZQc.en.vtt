machines<00:00:43.590> from<00:00:44.040> decent<00:00:44.309> level<00:00:44.789> living

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
machines from decent level living

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.880 
machines from decent level living
perfect<00:00:45.600> machines<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> number<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
perfect machines with a number of

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.940 
perfect machines with a number of
reasons<00:00:47.129> number<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.539> fly<00:00:48.840> very<00:00:49.559> very

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
reasons number one they fly very very

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.610 
reasons number one they fly very very
stable<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.300> means<00:00:51.570> beginners<00:00:52.230> will<00:00:52.379> not

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
stable so that means beginners will not

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.799 
stable so that means beginners will not
have<00:00:52.829> any<00:00:53.070> troubles<00:00:53.520> hovering<00:00:54.030> them<00:00:54.239> or

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
have any troubles hovering them or

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.080 
have any troubles hovering them or
flying<00:00:55.500> them<00:00:55.739> around<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.789> four

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
flying them around they are four

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270 
flying them around they are four
channels<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:58.079> toys<00:00:58.410> anymore<00:00:58.800> they

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
channels they are not toys anymore they

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.670 
channels they are not toys anymore they
can<00:00:59.309> fly<00:00:59.820> out<00:01:00.090> those<00:01:00.420> very<00:01:00.780> well<00:01:01.020> even<00:01:01.350> in

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
can fly out those very well even in

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.359 
can fly out those very well even in
modest<00:01:02.160> means<00:01:03.080> you<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.409> seen<00:01:04.710> these<00:01:05.040> have

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
modest means you have seen these have

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.440 
modest means you have seen these have
big<00:01:05.909> carbon<00:01:06.390> fiber<00:01:06.960> blades<00:01:07.409> strong<00:01:08.220> blades<00:01:08.700> ok

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
big carbon fiber blades strong blades ok

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.560 
big carbon fiber blades strong blades ok
the<00:01:09.930> bodies<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.640> fiberglass<00:01:11.640> bodies<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.330> both

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the bodies are fiberglass bodies on both

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.469 
the bodies are fiberglass bodies on both
of<00:01:12.750> these<00:01:12.869> helicopters<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.010> fight<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.180> one

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
of these helicopters and fight in one

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.420 
of these helicopters and fight in one
controller<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.290> three<00:01:16.500> axis<00:01:16.860> gyro<00:01:17.070> give

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
controller with three axis gyro give

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.270 
controller with three axis gyro give
them<00:01:17.640> extra<00:01:18.000> stability<00:01:18.920> outdoors<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
them extra stability outdoors and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.700 
them extra stability outdoors and
indoors<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.240> basically<00:01:21.689> these<00:01:21.930> machines<00:01:22.409> are

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
indoors so basically these machines are

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
indoors so basically these machines are
really<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.369> designed<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.850> fly<00:01:24.119> outdoors

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
really really designed to fly outdoors

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.120 
really really designed to fly outdoors
and<00:01:24.960> indoors<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:25.710> very<00:01:25.950> very

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and indoors and they are very very

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.700 
and indoors and they are very very
stable<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.820> they<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:28.049> good<00:01:28.320> machines

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
stable and they are really good machines

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.249 
stable and they are really good machines
for<00:01:28.920> beginners<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.820> what<00:01:30.780> I'm<00:01:30.900> going<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.110> do

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
for beginners so what I'm going to do

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.289 
for beginners so what I'm going to do
now<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:32.520> going<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.820> bring<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> camera

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
now is I'm going to bring the camera

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330 
now is I'm going to bring the camera
closer<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.200> give<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> closer<00:01:35.009> look<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
closer and give you a closer look to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.940 
closer and give you a closer look to
this<00:01:35.670> extra<00:01:36.180> aircraft<00:01:36.659> before<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.619> let<00:01:37.829> me

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
this extra aircraft before that let me

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.890 
this extra aircraft before that let me
mention<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:38.579> thing<00:01:38.939> at<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.360> moment<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
mention one more thing at the moment the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.200 
mention one more thing at the moment the
rear<00:01:40.259> propeller<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.400> aircraft<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:42.180> a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
rear propeller on this aircraft is a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.020 
rear propeller on this aircraft is a
dummy<00:01:42.600> propeller<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.799> there<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.280> an<00:01:44.490> optional

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
dummy propeller but there is an optional

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.500 
dummy propeller but there is an optional
upgrade<00:01:45.600> available

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
upgrade available

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.570 
upgrade available
and<00:01:46.780> level<00:01:47.080> which<00:01:47.650> actually<00:01:48.160> puts<00:01:48.340> some

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
and level which actually puts some

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.910 
and level which actually puts some
brushless<00:01:48.820> motor<00:01:49.270> in<00:01:49.570> it<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:49.900> something<00:01:50.680> more

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
brushless motor in it and something more

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.070 
brushless motor in it and something more
that<00:01:51.220> you<00:01:51.370> have<00:01:51.580> to<00:01:51.730> add<00:01:51.970> for<00:01:52.360> stability<00:01:52.660> of

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
that you have to add for stability of

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.840 
that you have to add for stability of
this<00:01:53.230> helicopter<00:01:53.620> all<00:01:54.250> right<00:01:54.460> so<00:01:54.640> let<00:01:54.760> me
