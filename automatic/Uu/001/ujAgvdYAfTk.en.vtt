00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello dear friends, we continue 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.389
 play battlefield 3 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.550
 if not the price of max valerchik continue 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.559
 have fun cool map guys but 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.839
 I really like 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.500
 cool capture mode we need 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.490
 to capture 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.910
 the points blow them up next you have to do 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.439
 contribution you need to defend the point down 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.439
 command them to seize and blow up 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.559
 now just guys a lot of problems with 4 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.590
 approach I already on every Nikita says 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.970
 Well, you never know someone did not watch the video here 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.100
 servers lacquered 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.070
 I often throw out China glitches incomprehensible 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.829
 promise and soon patches and then we will be 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.949
 to sit in your glory, I will buy 4 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.890
 licensed magicians here and we will all this 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.230
 the thing we write down character is x1 guys 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.449
 Centavo 4 I didnâ€™t pass right away 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.739
 started to pass 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:03.910
 play multiplayer then what principle 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:10.310
 I bought a shawl for the sake of multiplayer 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:14.229
 want to join you don't run gone 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.229
 Well, in short, bend us to the full 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:29.350
 so a special move and better run 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.350
 right through 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:39.720
 book she run somewhere and there I already 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:39.720
 I will fight begi begi begi 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.160
 for I have already fully roll 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.479
 Well, at least there will be eating 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.470
 and so let's try all the same 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.030
 Sniper try and what if we have something 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.970
 it is unlikely we will win a pancake here 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:10.040
 you defend and of course now I know 1 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.110
 take and again but did we bummer eat 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.560
 bushes killed achivku 100 credits from 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.560
 water 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.590
 Yes 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.540
 understandably 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.620
 let me live ours at least were 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.920
 I'm guarded 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.580
 it is bad keeping it essentially i'm not 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:40.870
 go off successfully it is worth going to me then 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:43.580
 half a pack when suppressing the most important thing 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.870
 that got him a little not studying 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.930
 fall and I hit and not less horse 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.820
 survive survive 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.850
 shelling crouched 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:02.410
 or went to the magnetic moment until I remove 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:10.310
 here is next I do not kill gives died muscles 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:16.870
 i go shoot these guys kind 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.870
 hit and 50b on the running squad 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.849
 too fast - firing sniper -in-law 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.170
 Lech how do you use 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.170
 I'm generally against you guys 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.340
 now come and here 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.340
 and another knife worst so something like 6 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:50.900
 now really another snapper let the world 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:04.220
 fun played i won it 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.030
 learn a little of the railing so keeps coming 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.519
 for the time one lech 91 and this is to protect 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.099
 and what are these snipers by the way and you are not 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.459
