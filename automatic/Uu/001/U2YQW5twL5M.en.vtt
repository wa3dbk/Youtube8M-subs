00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 is let's see what he said 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.750
 Palermo when the match ended 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.890
 also making reference to these 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.929
 incidents that we do not understand where 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.090
 they had an angelic note lerena way 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.019
 ended the party speaks martín palermo 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.019
 a football allowed 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.820
 the pulsations are ameal for all 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.750
 but there are decisions is just 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.490
 will occasionally claim the criminal 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.010
 we time claim the criminal 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.379
 of dough but good if it comes is because 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.900
 like today we live and feel football and 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.000
 sometimes we obviously all of us 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.370
 we are responsible but we have to 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.470
 have a little more tranquility and 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.290
 head for this do not overflow because 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.600
 if we do not generate this to move 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.640
 outside and if people see these things 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.500
 we are also generating a 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.049
 little violence but you have to have a 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.400
 little bit of conscience all all yes 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:59.170
 we are guilty on Thursdays is 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.089
 a wires the referees are also blamed 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.100
 for mistakes but good is that 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.940
 have a margin of tranquility because 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.940
 this does not overflow 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.570
 good is right you have to have a 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.810
 margin of tranquility so that this does not 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.810
 be 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.300
 what happens that after everything was derived 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.830
 in the stands because it was men 2 and 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.830
 we know that I then a territory 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.050
 apart it is much more difficult to separate 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.120
 the sites is a reality do not tell me 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.120
 that there were no mouth fans juniors 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.360
 that there are no visitors that happened or what 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.310
 that does not have to happen what happens is 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.140
 that there is a visitor fan above all is 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.570
 more ridiculous still because those that are 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.930
 they fight the most assured I do not have a 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.150
 if we are going to add something that I assure you 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.160
 that of the last 20 fights and if 9 are 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.140
 inner bars of the same 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.119
 club and we're going to deny that the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:04.509
 visitors fight the two walls or 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:06.930
 another schoolboys on the court with 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.930
 visitor 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.990
 the years passed so that as 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.630
 execute the superclásico ablation of 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.670
 rude is one of the most classic 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.770
 attractiveness of Argentina is more I think 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.680
 that after the mouth-river the classic 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.750
 what else calls is central news is played 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.880
 no visiting public with a giant of 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.410
 little stream that exploded had been made 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.569
 a very big campaign in the city of 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.270
 rosary for the classic to be at peace 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.130
 was at peace finally and against all 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.709
 forecasts that had to do with the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.150
 numbers and previous results won 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.980
 the team of Miguel Angel Russo 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.980
 much emotion in Miguel we will see
