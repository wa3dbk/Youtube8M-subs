to<00:01:58.840> because<00:01:59.140> i<00:01:59.170> have<00:01:59.470> so<00:01:59.500> many<00:01:59.740> black<00:02:00.160> shoes

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
to because i have so many black shoes

black bears and pumps so i decided to

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.480 
black bears and pumps so i decided to
get<00:02:05.350> something<00:02:05.590> different<00:02:06.100> that<00:02:06.190> I<00:02:06.280> knew<00:02:06.460> I

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490
