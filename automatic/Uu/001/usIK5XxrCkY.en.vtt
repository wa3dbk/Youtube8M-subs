00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:05.859
 tuscany montepulciano in the province of siena terra dei minima here there is a 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.699
 ubaldini craft brewery 60 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.999
 see himself stefano canzio 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:13.759
 land of Montepulciano wines 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.050
 fireproof yet some people have decided to try feces with beer 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.480
 also managed very well what was created innately for promo 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.899
 a passion is ours 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.729
 let's start ad hoc for jokes at home as Naples was born verifice 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.229
 make beer cr. moreno is not difficult 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.140
 low mistakes in Venice you do everything in the air 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.930
 favorite names on this defines the model itself 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.350
 700 and product cakes per year 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.410
 which means about 80 thousand bottles 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.020
 a reality closely linked to the area 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.580
 because it is true that the various peggy glazes are mainly used 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.400
 countries 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.320
 but not just how we make a beer to recover the area where I use 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.449
 practically 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.380
 and then 35% of raw cereals do not turn around% of our area 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.250
 Val d'Orcia 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.000
 but how to make beer 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.940
 simple we said 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.080
 there are 4 faces in the whole they are called cooked that last about 8 hours 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.980
 the first phase is that of the exhibition when the malt is cooked in 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.820
 water 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.400
 the resulting trick 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.640
 it is filtered that it becomes so much beer 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.280
 at this point boiling chain 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.210
 add the wolf and possibly patty ingredients based on the type of 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.870
 beer that you can get 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.090
 and from this part tweetes and very fine 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.250
 which derive the two main characteristics of the activity 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.110
 the Rome 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.260
 and the bitter 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.400
 only the end is put on the yeasts 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.730
 which allow fermented rhodes 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.600
 a painting fermentation present hey 10 days 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.360
 and then 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.250
 certainly not the importance of maturing the market 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.570
 4 good feedbacks as works of crisis we do not complain network us to drown 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.479
 at this time the phoenix of craft beer then 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.479
 this mail is taking more and more 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.570
 in the foot we are working well all over Italy we are working slowly. with 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.290
 foreign 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.290
 but mainly microbrewery elevated to the area 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:22.759
