00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
bunches like those too this is the 18

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.339 
bunches like those too this is the 18
millimeter<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.610> 16<00:00:18.090> one<00:00:18.300> now<00:00:19.110> those

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
millimeter this is the 16 one now those

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.679 
millimeter this is the 16 one now those
punches<00:00:19.649> over<00:00:19.980> time<00:00:20.399> and<00:00:20.759> will<00:00:20.910> become<00:00:21.300> doubt

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
punches over time and will become doubt

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.690 
punches over time and will become doubt
they<00:00:21.930> won't<00:00:22.169> have<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.500> appropriate<00:00:22.770> edge<00:00:23.189> to

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
they won't have the appropriate edge to

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.269 
they won't have the appropriate edge to
cut<00:00:23.970> through<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.360> vinyl<00:00:24.599> so<00:00:25.169> you<00:00:26.009> need<00:00:26.160> to

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
cut through the vinyl so you need to

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.549 
cut through the vinyl so you need to
keep<00:00:26.399> them<00:00:26.610> nice<00:00:26.759> and<00:00:26.820> serve<00:00:27.329> so<00:00:28.079> much<00:00:28.290> so

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:28.559 
keep them nice and serve so much so

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:31.220 
keep them nice and serve so much so
you're<00:00:28.739> a<00:00:28.980> quick<00:00:29.360> tip<00:00:30.360> on<00:00:30.599> how<00:00:30.930> to<00:00:30.960> maintain

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
you're a quick tip on how to maintain

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.130 
you're a quick tip on how to maintain
them<00:00:31.680> put<00:00:32.489> those<00:00:32.610> aside<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
them put those aside just to be the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.540 
them put those aside just to be the
flower<00:00:34.380> strong<00:00:34.890> fits<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.580> foil<00:00:37.070> right<00:00:40.400> bit<00:00:41.400> of

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
flower strong fits in foil right bit of

00:00:41.550 --> 00:01:12.649 
flower strong fits in foil right bit of
any<00:00:41.820> kind<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.180> silicon-based<00:00:42.920> lubricant<00:01:11.659> so

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
any kind of silicon-based lubricant so

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.649 
any kind of silicon-based lubricant so
the<00:01:13.080> idea<00:01:13.440> here<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.190> foil<00:01:14.580> will<00:01:15.030> do

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the idea here is that the foil will do

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.500 
the idea here is that the foil will do
something<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.380> edge<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:18.150> punch<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:20.479> have<00:01:21.479> a

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
something the edge of the punch I have a

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:37.270 
something the edge of the punch I have a
little<00:01:21.810> bit<00:01:21.930> kind<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:23.780> lubricated<00:01:29.030> right<00:01:36.080> and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
little bit kind of lubricated right and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.840 
little bit kind of lubricated right and
makes<00:01:38.280> my<00:01:38.490> parts<00:01:38.850> stop<00:01:39.659> again<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.890> I'm<00:01:41.549> going

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
makes my parts stop again now I'm going

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.969 
makes my parts stop again now I'm going
to<00:01:41.940> have<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.330> go<00:01:42.600> here<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.650> cut<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.250> vinyls
