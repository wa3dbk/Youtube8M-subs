00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
the thing together so we'll see fingers

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.120 
the thing together so we'll see fingers
crossed<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.540> is<00:01:47.720> take<00:01:47.930> one<00:01:48.229> we'll<00:01:48.860> try<00:01:49.040> and

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
crossed this is take one we'll try and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.500 
crossed this is take one we'll try and
do<00:01:49.189> this<00:01:49.310> thing<00:01:49.460> continuous<00:01:49.939> take<00:01:50.180> if<00:01:50.360> it's

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
do this thing continuous take if it's

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.359 
do this thing continuous take if it's
broken<00:01:50.750> up<00:01:50.960> then<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.860> means<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.130> didn't

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
broken up then that means it didn't

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.390 
broken up then that means it didn't
start<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:53.229> we'll<00:01:54.229> we'll<00:01:54.710> do<00:01:54.830> some<00:01:55.040> editing

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
start and we'll we'll do some editing

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.789 
start and we'll we'll do some editing
and<00:01:55.580> some<00:01:55.729> splicing

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799
