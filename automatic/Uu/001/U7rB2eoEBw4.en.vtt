00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
like 32 just good this might be a little

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.020 
like 32 just good this might be a little
better<00:03:22.500> now<00:03:22.709> because<00:03:22.949> the<00:03:23.220> formats<00:03:23.669> can<00:03:23.819> slow

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
better now because the formats can slow

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.520 
better now because the formats can slow
down<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.239> mean<00:03:24.509> you<00:03:24.599> can<00:03:24.689> even<00:03:24.810> run<00:03:24.930> three<00:03:25.319> maybe

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
down I mean you can even run three maybe

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.589 
down I mean you can even run three maybe
if<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.739> wanted<00:03:25.979> to<00:03:26.069> but<00:03:26.099> I<00:03:26.310> think<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:27.329> just

if you wanted to but I think to just

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.929 
if you wanted to but I think to just

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
live the equip spells that's such a good

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.420 
live the equip spells that's such a good
broken<00:03:30.299> equip<00:03:30.629> spell<00:03:30.870> um<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.799> pandu<00:03:32.129> ality

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
broken equip spell um to pandu ality

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.149 
broken equip spell um to pandu ality

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
trying to lure again I didn't like a

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.159 
trying to lure again I didn't like a
luarin<00:03:55.469> testing<00:03:56.009> so<00:03:56.310> what<00:03:57.209> about<00:03:57.329> when<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.689> do

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
luarin testing so what about when you do

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.929 
luarin testing so what about when you do
ality<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.829> then<00:03:58.949> next<00:03:59.129> turn<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.459> draw<00:03:59.699> into

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
ality and then next turn you draw into

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.159 
ality and then next turn you draw into
duality<00:04:00.359> when<00:04:00.479> you<00:04:00.569> want<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.959> draw<00:04:01.109> to

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
duality when you want to draw to

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.020 
duality when you want to draw to
something<00:04:01.530> a<00:04:01.620> lot<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:02.430> thing<00:04:02.639> too<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:02.909> the

stopped you from going off which I
definitely<00:04:04.680> like<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:06.049> it's<00:04:07.049> just<00:04:07.169> too<00:04:07.349> i<00:04:07.379> find

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
definitely like so it's just too i find

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.770 
definitely like so it's just too i find
it's<00:04:07.799> too<00:04:07.919> slow<00:04:08.219> against<00:04:08.489> Exeter<00:04:08.759> faster<00:04:09.329> yeah

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
it's too slow against Exeter faster yeah

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.689 
it's too slow against Exeter faster yeah
I<00:04:10.049> do<00:04:10.439> still<00:04:10.709> like<00:04:10.829> I<00:04:10.889> said<00:04:11.069> I<00:04:11.129> do<00:04:11.189> still<00:04:11.489> really

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
the best deck in the game is going to be

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.590 
the best deck in the game is going to be

best deck so we'll see what happens I

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.300 
best deck so we'll see what happens I
kind<00:06:25.780> of<00:06:25.900> think<00:06:26.050> YCS<00:06:26.560> toronto's<00:06:26.920> give<00:06:27.130> you<00:06:27.220> a

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
kind of think YCS toronto's give you a

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.100 
kind of think YCS toronto's give you a
little<00:06:27.490> bit<00:06:27.580> of<00:06:27.640> a<00:06:27.700> trap

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
little bit of a trap

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.780 
little bit of a trap
stay<00:06:28.290> I<00:06:28.560> think<00:06:29.130> it<00:06:29.220> would<00:06:29.310> be<00:06:29.340> cool<00:06:29.520> because

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
stay I think it would be cool because

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.550 
stay I think it would be cool because
nobody<00:06:30.270> knows<00:06:30.450> the<00:06:30.630> best<00:06:30.780> deck<00:06:31.020> is<00:06:31.200> right<00:06:31.380> now

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
nobody knows the best deck is right now

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.170 
nobody knows the best deck is right now
like<00:06:31.710> everybody<00:06:32.130> has<00:06:32.250> to<00:06:32.280> test<00:06:32.610> and<00:06:32.820> find<00:06:33.000> out

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
like everybody has to test and find out

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.940 
like everybody has to test and find out
I<00:06:33.210> think<00:06:33.480> that's<00:06:33.600> really<00:06:33.840> neat<00:06:34.140> we<00:06:34.710> can't<00:06:34.890> just

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
I think that's really neat we can't just

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.760 
I think that's really neat we can't just
in<00:06:35.100> that<00:06:35.250> neck<00:06:35.490> the<00:06:35.850> ocg<00:06:36.810> shriek<00:06:37.200> anymore<00:06:37.620> and

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
in that neck the ocg shriek anymore and

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.900 
in that neck the ocg shriek anymore and
just<00:06:37.890> see<00:06:38.070> what's<00:06:38.250> waiting<00:06:38.370> over<00:06:38.670> there<00:06:38.700> we
