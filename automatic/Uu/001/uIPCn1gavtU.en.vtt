00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 if you could have missed part one 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.970
 you click the link on the screen 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.200
 or the link in the video description 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.330
 what is going on fitness friends heartily 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.759
 Welcome to part 2 of our chest 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.509
 have training on nils on the channel 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.980
 you've already seen part one that is 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.980
 Bench press and without further ado 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.789
 bench press 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.400
 then we are to the butterfly 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.470
 gone over as you can see 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.320
 and I like to train like that and 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.550
 when do they actually agree 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.320
 we do it that way 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.660
 they work out similar to the one on the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.600
 Do two heavy exercises at the beginning 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.149
 basic exercises or verbund exercises he for 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.510
 the breast to exercise power to order 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.539
 really to respect the commission 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.899
 during training and the last exercises 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.730
 are there just to the muscle too 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.620
 Feel again to pump 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.629
 to do several repetitions 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.579
 to really feel the muscle 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.680
 my mass connection and you have yes 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.559
 simply both aspects in it once the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.880
 provision and then if possible 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.890
 of course with the isolations 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.090
 Considerations the pro version but before 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.460
 all of which counts the feeling you are here 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.680
 I directly funds the depots of 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.420
 Nils is and how crass the breast 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.150
 this exercise works because of that is the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.689
 people do not fly at all 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.170
 do 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.970
 I love that because the right to play 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.460
 breast and in any exercises there is is 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.850
 my weak point is that too 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.280
 aim at me with each breast exercises the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.950
 post content and at butterfly 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.890
 especially with this machine I feel 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.850
 she was extremely as above all said 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.049
 this machine is there too 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.360
 machines where you can with the elbows 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.460
 squeezing as you go so I find 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.170
 not so good for the shoulder to 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.740
 shoulder fastest because of it on the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.930
 best 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.909
 and it is important here you see it 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.520
 actually wanted with every candidate 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.799
 I already say that with all of us 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.969
 we as well as we lead the most here too 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.130
 very nice to see by eyes 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.149
 are shoulder blades back fixed it 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 trying as it were with the 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.459
 then turn the back of the bank 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.450
 Hollow Cross is allowed 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.400
 just stretch out the breast and enter 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.849
 bit more negative to train them and 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.550
 So you should try to train like that 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.530
 me that's why i bring the exercise 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.950
 at not the elbows are not too high too 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.690
 hold 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.769
 otherwise you really train one 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.810
 bit on the front shoulder 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.550
 but so should the elbows 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.610
 get merged down like this 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.890
 one again a violent chest muscle 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.010
 contraction 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.319
 next exercise was or year next and 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.680
 The last one was already the breast 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.180
 we have only four press today 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.130
 done exercises enough for the yes 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.599
 Breast will cause the buses to refuse 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.470
 isolated trained without other muscle 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.870
 or 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.970
 other muscles are the triceps models 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.360
 are automatically always there but what 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.239
 I mean to say that focus was chest and 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.459
 without triceps isolation exercises afterwards 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.150
 or something else so no coach of his 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.489
 breast day 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.720
 now is also good with the explanation 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.730
 You know what I mean 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.109
 sometimes I repeat myself and 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.150
 in the exercise exactly the same 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.430
 shoulder blades fixed on the chest 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.350
 clear hollow can clear how to make 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.060
 it is also not let you no 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.590
 weight on the disc so it is 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.530
 not harmful in contrast to 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.200
 example where you push the head over 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:37.250
 Aunt or with with long or short 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.800
 stop and exercise is a hollow cross 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.870
 allowed the elbows I had had 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.400
 shoulder pain during this training 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.280
 That's why I did not weight that much 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.019
 made and you can see my radius 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.170
 or the angle 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.700
 I say the radius of the angle of 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.709
 elbow to body is small 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.180
 So I took the shoulder out 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.900
 and could very nicely the breast 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.030
 to edit 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.099
 thanks for watching it coming now 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.660
 another short posing from me and nils 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.730
 if you see our current form 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.480
 I wish you much fun and up 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.480
 to the next video 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.330
