 we fall innocent says all metal 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.340
 with a brick filling a kind 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.920
 tour turn to the best of the 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.010
 banana center a tower he goes 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.470
 then accommodate archived floors 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.110
 so it's a site that from the point of view 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.110
 patrimonial is exceptional good it's 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.700

 exceptional in the center of Asnières 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.080
 So from 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.520
 analysis of existing buildings and 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.380
 their potential we realized 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.950
 we make the houses that bank 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.830
 of France 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.810
 an old house of the notary grand'rue 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.459
 could easily be transformed into 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.230
 apartment since it was already a 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.350
 part of their functions there 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.450
 already lived from the beginning and that the 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.620
 ground floor is occupied by the apple 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.100
 could very well accommodate 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.910
 shops so the blue the project provides 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.690
 from us 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.010
 reuse of existing buildings and 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.100
 injury so she had to both 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.820
 buildings that are located in the big 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.160
 street the building renamed bassano life 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.020
 ercole go see the old ones 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.510
 apartments that exists in the building 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.300
 rehabilitate restore but each of 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.710
 buildings will be elevated and in this 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.780
 upper part so we will have some 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.150
 apartments created from scratch 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.480
 way to recreate a food and a 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.930
 built front homogeneous large hall the 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:10.230
 old world metal building 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:14.160
 bricks will be delivered to the surface 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.800
 adaptable to the extent that the way 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.690
 to live who will be able to take place there 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.360
 in a way of living a little specific 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.090
 helping students double height 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.780
 large windows a fluidity in the 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.360
 spaces and so we see so this 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.850
 project will allow to offer a variety 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.290
 absolutely amazing type of habitat 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:39.420
 by dwelling the apartment 9 the lof 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.520
 inhabitants to inhabitants who 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.100
 were watching the garden looking towards 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.930
 public space so it's a small 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.570
 world in itself if you want a piccolo 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.700
