00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
of your own so right here I click create

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.810 
of your own so right here I click create
and<00:00:30.439> I<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.679> all<00:00:31.800> these<00:00:31.920> different<00:00:32.399> templates

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and I have all these different templates

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.299 
and I have all these different templates
I<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.149> create<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:34.079> easiest<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:35.160> is

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
I can create the easiest one to do is

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.190 
I can create the easiest one to do is
use<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.700> blank<00:00:36.000> template<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.780> always

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
use the blank template you can always

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.069 
use the blank template you can always
change<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.860> later<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.600> make<00:00:39.600> certain<00:00:39.930> that

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
change it later and make certain that

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.590 
change it later and make certain that
the<00:00:40.260> name<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> your<00:00:40.739> site<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.520> unique<00:00:42.120> if<00:00:42.420> it's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the name of your site is unique if it's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.180 
the name of your site is unique if it's
not<00:00:42.780> unique<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.350> won't<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.680> able<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.980> create

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
not unique you won't be able to create

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.760 
not unique you won't be able to create
it<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.550> let's<00:00:45.239> say<00:00:45.510> Lane<00:00:46.260> Test<00:00:47.219> Drive<00:00:48.770> website

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
it so let's say Lane Test Drive website

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.110 
it so let's say Lane Test Drive website
let's<00:00:50.399> see<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.760> will<00:00:50.879> work

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
let's see if that will work

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.750 
let's see if that will work
down<00:00:52.110> here<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.710> course<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.280> type<00:00:53.520> in

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
down here of course I have to type in

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.340 
down here of course I have to type in
the<00:00:53.789> certain<00:00:55.910> encrypted<00:00:56.910> code<00:00:57.210> make<00:00:58.079> certain

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the certain encrypted code make certain

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.560 
the certain encrypted code make certain
that<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> robot<00:00:59.180> then<00:01:00.180> after<00:01:00.449> I've

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that I'm not a robot then after I've

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.000 
that I'm not a robot then after I've
done<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.780> watch<00:01:01.079> I've<00:01:01.260> already<00:01:01.590> named<00:01:01.829> the

I've already signed in here type the
code<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:09.000> watch<00:01:09.180> how<00:01:09.360> easy<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:10.080> take

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
code and watch how easy this will take

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.050 
code and watch how easy this will take
you'll<00:01:10.350> take<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> little<00:01:10.770> seconds<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:11.970> to

you'll take a little seconds for it to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.109 
you'll take a little seconds for it to
create<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> hit<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> create<00:01:13.350> button<00:01:13.830> and
