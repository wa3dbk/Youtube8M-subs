00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.080
 she alone at all welcome for art 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.450
 and old from the naruto shippuden episode 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.070
 375 super episode honestly I 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.529
 really really really enjoyed this 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.260
 episode one I think besides my 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.939
 naruto shippuuden's favorite up 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.680
 now here we go we'll do the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.180
 review immediately already as soon as the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.189
 beginning begins 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.320
 I see the graphics I had them 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.570
 already seen on the preview of the episode 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.010
 previous I had seen the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.890
 graphic designers so I had already told myself 60 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.680
 60 and very good since you have it 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.190
 surely noticed one is the one or the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.840
 designers anyway that I like 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.580
 so even for those who have 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.590
 badly to differentiate the graphics I 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.840
 think that in the fight that will oppose 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.920
 Kakashi in hospitals you had when 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.690
 even notice that the graphics 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.830
 were really different so well 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.860
 this is a good starting point 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.720
 so we start from the beginning of 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.190
 the episode with the hurdles 2nd in excuse 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.840
 me with the notebooks that were 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.690
 resuscitated hungry who have at least who 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.050
 were saved by orochimaru so here 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.990
 I named ghajar aycaguer worry because 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.700
 gaming aguets and tsunade that's and as 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.560
 to them after following the defeat 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.270
 that their defeat against madara he 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.649
 heads to the battlefield for 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.970
 help 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.490
 So that's it it starts for now 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.970
 they have not arrived but they are in 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.789
 path 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.080
 then we have the famous subject 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.050
 main of this episode namely 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.729
 kakashi vs obito then the fight and I 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.010
 found the game we are really really 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.690
 super simply why because 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.790
 I have the impression that at the end of the world 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.990
 in this fight we return to the basics to 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.880
 know the tai jutsu 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.890
 So here it was, it was really missing 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.299
 because it's true that right now 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.520
 fighting finds is that fighting 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.840
 of giants where monster fights 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.880
 so suddenly there are explosions 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.350
 everywhere more huge jutsu each 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.680
 that others and everything and I found 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.840
 that ben small a little fight like that 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.710
 to hide hospitals with tai jutsu 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.440
 well placed there was also 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.410
 dubourd of course to the belly fell under 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.580
 cape town kakashi accessories high which 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.250
 laugh even autumn when I think about it 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.340
 but still we will say that there was 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.690
 for 80% of the size of the fight 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.740
 everything here so the fight was really 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.110
 super there are really phases 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.819
 beautiful and more mix with the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.350
 flash back from previous fights 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.120
 I found the fight simply 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.000
 beautiful so I will try to their 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.800
 just posted the fight on youtube this 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.940
 weekend I think I'll try but 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.170
 good with all the new laws 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.520
 youtube I think it's still ok 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.739
 to be complicated so I advise you 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.820
 anyway you put them this month 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.790
 because he really is really 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.440
 interesting there are phases I found 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.970
 found really wanted and I found 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.280
 it's great it reminded me a little bit of 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.200
 the naruto sasuke fight at the time so 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.710
 swallowed hunger in season 1 of 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.630
 Naruto 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.850
 it made me think a bit about that 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.380
 so I found what we're really going 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.860
 super I hope you too 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.810
 leave me your comment of course 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.250
 blow for this fight so khakassie fate 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.980
 rather winner we'll say and 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.540
 unfortunately for him serious fault 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.280
 obito will seek help from 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.880
 madara here but we all know that 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.950
 madara is not at all his friend so 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.450
 Madame took advantage simply and 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.340
 your former one whoever they are weak 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.120
 to take possession of his body 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.370
 with the z wish his chakra so as to 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.320
 force him to do the raku technique 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.880
 must know the rin and hennessey for 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.630
 to be able to resurrect it then for those 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.690
 who remember more of this 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.730
 technique is the technique to use 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.980
 nagato if you remember well for 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.600
 resurrect all the people that penn had 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.400
 killed here is remember 1 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.350
 he finally has almost all by no because 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.090
 that I have nothing does not have them he has not 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.709
 thought he did not resist forgiveness 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.209
 but in any case he has risen full 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.100
 villagers and company remember 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.980
 this little sentence and well it's this 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.319
 technique here is that madara to force 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.610
 to run on behalf of 8 for beats for 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.959
 himself to congratulate himself 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.310
 that's it's full of madara since 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.769
 early I think you understood it 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.239
 but it was still useful to 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.519
 specify suddenly seeing all this small 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.220
 scenario 4 and wading docks so at 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.849
 know and dominate early and water achi rama 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.799
 and tommy rama and death and that s 4th 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.440
 announce we were not there good at all 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.030
 case the three notebooks decides to three 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.930
 slaps and decides to stop it here 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.120
 so they send clones and 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.280
 good company is not counting madara 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.570
 and who is very good at defending himself 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.610
 he is really madarail really 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.900
 powerful good for those who follow the 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.190
 scanners where you now know this 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.630
 that happened is not going to talk about it 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.370
 since people do not want and 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.560
 spoiler but in my eyes anyway 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.820
 madara it's really the real bad guy 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.070
 of history and I find it is 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.080
 really and charismatic and powerful 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.030
 so it's true that it's true that 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.880
 madara was really a character to 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.710
 share anyway it's minato that 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.940
 terminates the hospital ordeal here 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.710
 thanks to his little little one 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.010
 teleportation and at the same time 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.780
 so understands that this famous character 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.270
 that he has in front of him is none other than 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.940
 so his little pupil hospitals and that's 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.650
 so by inference him who had it 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.180
 attacked at the time in konoha as 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.039
 that masked man so here he understands 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.160
 everything since it teaches us minato too 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.510
 that fools who pose are definitive 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.979
 they are not innocent will never go 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.169
 so to know all the jumps he has 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.919
 posed so far are always on 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.660
 will say assets 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.780
 so he realizes a little that everything 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.910
 this all this great journey to fight 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.470
 tobin and everything finally seems all 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.389
 just a fake since his hobbies 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.340
 punched ars since the beginning of a who 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.979
 understand that he has a minato is a little 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.370
 we just sad that's normal is his 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.320
 high 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.900
 and there bombshell we think 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.930
 habito died unheard price naked makes us 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.400
 a kind of withdrawal techniques 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.260
 I do not know what it is in any case it 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.169
 absorbs all the djoudi and his body in 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.500
 same time is what makes hara hold 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.880
 you that habito becomes child the jin 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.070
 choi who play 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.830
 here and there the episode stops on his 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.180
 so in the z type really happened 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.740
 a lot of things and that's what I 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.080
 appreciated there was some fighting 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.460
 we saw our gags and we saw the teenagers 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.130
 and we lived had some of that 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.710
 what we saw so at goal or die and 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.200
 we saw him resurrected in a mouse that 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.990
 of really jubilee the episode was I 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.240
 found great with respect to the 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.680
 preview of the next episode this will be a 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.139
 out of series 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.150
 so it's a sin because of the end of this 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.860
 episode but it will be tightened on mecha 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.940
 naruto so that's it I think you 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.300
 have understood it is for the promotion 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.590
 of the game naruto storm revolution so 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.150
 listen I 'll do the review anyway 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.199
 on next week maybe 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.400
 with any luck it will be 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.740
 tighten rather nice I thought 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.539
 glimpse payne and and itachi which we do not 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.039
 never know anything really 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.590
 hurry to be the next week for 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.780
 resume the course of history and see 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.270
 a little in action and in video 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.440
 powers of obispo jim furyk this is in 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.729
 any case leave your opinion this episode 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.509
 although I do not doubt that he has 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.220
 very happy 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:46.289
 and then we meet again the week 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.680
