 hi Anton, my name is color cabinets 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.719
 Leonid and my rusty bucket behind me 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:15.509
 gazelle sable 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:20.539
 2000, almost none remained 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:33.320
 whole rust parts got to everything 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:33.320
 so here is the bottom of the door 2 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:45.030
 from the inside you can see what's going on 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:50.180
 outside this door is generally patched to 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.180
 rear doors hanging ordinary lock shed 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:01:01.280
 now salon salon for collective farm judge 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.409
 King 's Seats instead of three made two 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 electrically temporarily 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.630
 disabled the rest is all as usual 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.630
 newspapers 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.890
 the only thing in this car 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.820
 rarity is the austrian turbo diesel what 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.820
 them 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.280
 which was released about 8,000 on the go 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.430
 your area 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.140
 I only saw this one more neighbor 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.930
 would like to restore it purely because 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.869
 motor due to rarity 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.369
 working machine I love 0 power 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.100
 not enough time to stop 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:01.860
 most completely 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:04.340
 of course, thanks for 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.340
 Attention
