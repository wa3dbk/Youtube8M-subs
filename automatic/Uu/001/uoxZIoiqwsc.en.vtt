00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.280
 today we look at the series say 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.570
 Thai boxing business card this 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.000
 a series of elbows and knees to me not really 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.510
 complex series but very effective and 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.340
 very traumatic so start or 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.740
 must be very careful if you do 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.260
 do with a partner especially if you 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.460
 newbie 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.620
 be sure to review the basic course on 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.350
 strikes on the shock technique of Thai boxing 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.540
 could also hit elbows correctly 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.200
 the knees so that you got it 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.329
 as it should be here, that is, the whole 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.760
 Our series is today 3 more 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.610
 hitting this left elbow straight we 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.100
 we punch we push there we punch 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.520
 between the hands we try to break through the left straight 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.010
 right lateral side elbow or 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.970
 in jaw or weight depending on 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.460
 growth of the enemy's knee and then filter 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.450
 the enemy knee in the body cant and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.350
 knee ox 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.549

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.680
 left elbow straight 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.200
 very effective power on the opponent 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.700
 worth deaf protection we closed today 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.610
 without gloves so that they can 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.680
 see where the boats go already 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.229
 work gloves I could too 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.659
 debug protect yourself said the enemy 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.000

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.710
 crawl through will be a hole minimum you then 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.710
 he will stand minimum between hands 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.299

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.840
 pure hands 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.969
 close so fur coats 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.030
 skipping an elbow with you don't have enough 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.520
 strength leaks bow elbow will pass by 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.979
 any straight from when a defender translates 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.890

 punch your elbow straight ahead all 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.849

 break through and teeth can break 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.920
 but you can break your steel 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.630
 straight between the felling immediately passes to him 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.630

 same finds on his head 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.740
 lean all over for what 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.530
 to make his head parallel 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.620

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.890
 faces this is also a knockdown almost always 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.710
 that is , the series went first glove 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.919
 look neatly you start very 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.950
 carefully that is if you apply this 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.380
 series in battle 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.780
 working training fight with you work out 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.440
 and practice their elbow pads very 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.550
 neatly 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.350
 if you want to apply on the street something 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.720
 use so that you do not know not 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.419
 found later injuries will be very 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.419
 big and best don't do this at all 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.729
 that is, the series first started 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:28.430
 punched into the image immediately went to the clinch 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.430
 elbow side temple second arm 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.940
 They threw took him under control in the hair 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.670
 knee here hit and bent a little 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.400
 he bent his whole body on him by us 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.180
 if the right leg is loaded again from 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:47.530
 socks here in the head between the hands held 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:51.840
 son so a4 would be simple punches but very 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.960
 traumatic very dangerous series 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.250
 myself 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.650
 we considered how much we had 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.870
 4 5 video lessons 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.780
 separate hands separate legs hands legs and 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.630
 boats knees I just for example 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.540
 led such series in principle you series 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:14.650
 you can make them millions and billions 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:17.560
 combinations already have up to 6 basic hits 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:21.340
 four base elbows 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.230
 kicking too 8 beats and knees 4 beats 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.100
 that is, you have about 20 hits in total 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:30.820
 basic combining these beats you can 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.410
 series any think up the main thing i always 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.850
 on this accentuates in order for you 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:41.410
 thought the head is the most important until 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:43.270
 the most important part of the fight for the fight 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.550
 head if you think correctly 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.100
 you will be able to find the weak ones 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.070
 places to be nice its beautiful 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.200
 process, that is, do not learn there 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.780
 some kind of series is constant u crowd 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.790
 the enemy knows well from her as a 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.370
 protect yourself before set you up your elbows 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.740
 knees and you climb you are injuring 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.960
 imagine your legs and arms 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.180
 need you must think 1 episode thrown not 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.630
 passed you see that he has good protection 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.460
 he exhibited everything think differently 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.680
 show one hit the other that is 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.800
 combinations try to model yourself 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.569
 we will consider a couple of series well 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.129
 so on this 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:22.289
 even after the next lesson too we 

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:24.869
 some other topics will be considered 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.319
 the cry system is quite important 

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:29.009
 you 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:31.469
 exercises to increase the force of impact 

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:33.300
 impact speed for operating time that is 

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:35.449
 such exercises are basic which you 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:39.569
 must do after each workout 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:42.599
