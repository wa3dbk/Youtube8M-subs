How to make a slip cover for a chair

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
First measure the chair

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Decide where the seams will be, here they are marked in red.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now plan the pattern pieces

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Decide how they will best fit onto your fabric

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Draw the pattern on to the reverse side of your fabric

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Then add 1cm for the seams and 2cm for the hem

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
As every piece is symmetrical, you only need to draw out half, which you can then cut on the fold

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Cut out all the pieces

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Start with these two

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Place like this, making sure they are centred

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Pin and stitch

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Leave 1cm unstitched at each end

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Take the third piece, and place the other on it like this

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Pin it from here

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to here

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Bring this side up to be a straight line, then pin and stitch

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Open it out

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Bring point A

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
to point a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And B

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to b

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Pin and stitch

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Open the hole, find the centre of each side and mark it with a pin

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Align the two centres and pin. Pin all around the hole, and stitch

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Bring point A

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
to point a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And B

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
to b

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Pin and stitch

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Now the hem. Turn over 1cm all the way round

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Then turn it again

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Top stitch all the way round

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Now put it on your chair!
