what<00:00:06.720> we're<00:00:06.810> going<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.990> do<00:00:07.109> this<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.470> just<00:00:07.620> a

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
what we're going to do this is just a

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.280 
what we're going to do this is just a
really<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> really<00:00:09.240> interesting<00:00:09.719> demo

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
really this is a really interesting demo

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.350 
really this is a really interesting demo
to<00:00:10.469> show<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:11.309> capabilities<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.120> truck

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
to show the capabilities of the truck

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.780 
to show the capabilities of the truck
with<00:00:12.540> crawl<00:00:12.750> controls<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.429> we'll<00:00:14.429> get<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.670> up

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
with crawl controls so we'll get it up

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.240 
with crawl controls so we'll get it up
here<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.299> get<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.170> stucks<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.680> takes<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.010> little

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
here and get it stucks it takes a little

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.859 
here and get it stucks it takes a little
bit<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.550> doing<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.180> get<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.420> truck<00:00:18.630> actually

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
bit of doing to get the truck actually

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.320 
bit of doing to get the truck actually
stuck<00:00:19.320> but<00:00:19.619> we'll<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.760> stuck<00:00:21.000> we'll<00:00:21.210> get

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
stuck but we'll get it stuck we'll get

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.450 
stuck but we'll get it stuck we'll get
it<00:00:21.420> down<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.779> frame<00:00:22.080> rails<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.680> then<00:00:22.859> and

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
it down to the frame rails and then and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.640 
it down to the frame rails and then and
then<00:00:24.000> we're<00:00:24.090> gonna<00:00:24.210> back<00:00:24.539> out<00:00:24.779> using<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
then we're gonna back out using the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.210 
then we're gonna back out using the
crawl<00:00:25.890> control<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:27.029> really<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.949> thing

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
crawl control and the really the thing

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.009 
crawl control and the really the thing
that<00:00:29.250> makes<00:00:29.580> crawl<00:00:29.939> control<00:00:30.090> really<00:00:30.599> work<00:00:30.810> is

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that makes crawl control really work is

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.709 
that makes crawl control really work is
that<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.349> very<00:00:32.000> deliberate<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.149> very<00:00:33.360> slow

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
that it's very deliberate and very slow

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.319 
that it's very deliberate and very slow
about<00:00:34.140> how<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.250> turning<00:00:35.760> every<00:00:36.120> wheel

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
about how it's it's turning every wheel

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.780 
about how it's it's turning every wheel
so<00:00:37.170> what<00:00:37.559> it'll<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:37.980> it'll<00:00:38.280> stay<00:00:38.550> basically

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
so what it'll do is it'll stay basically

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.910 
so what it'll do is it'll stay basically
will<00:00:39.059> dig<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.510> all<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> sand<00:00:40.079> around<00:00:40.590> each

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
will dig out all the sand around each

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.400 
will dig out all the sand around each
wheel<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.520> then<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.300> will<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.600> slowly<00:00:42.989> start

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
wheel and then it will just slowly start

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.260 
wheel and then it will just slowly start
to<00:00:43.530> build<00:00:43.710> up<00:00:43.950> some<00:00:44.160> sand<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.670> subtraction

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
to build up some sand and subtraction

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.270 
to build up some sand and subtraction
and<00:00:45.770> should<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:46.950> hop<00:00:47.129> right<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:49.280> hitter

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and should just hop right out so hitter

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.050 
and should just hop right out so hitter

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.050 

you're<00:00:57.600> good<00:00:57.810> there
