00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
good I mean it started off slow and a

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.780 
good I mean it started off slow and a
bit<00:04:36.530> trouble<00:04:37.070> getting<00:04:37.250> into<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.490> at<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.610> start

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
bit trouble getting into it at the start

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:38.980 
bit trouble getting into it at the start
but<00:04:37.910> was<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.360> end<00:04:38.480> of<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.600> match<00:04:38.780> they

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
but was the end of the match they

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.750 
but was the end of the match they
started<00:04:39.320> really<00:04:39.500> putting<00:04:39.830> out<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.190> lot<00:04:40.400> of<00:04:40.639> a

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
started really putting out a lot of a

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.520 
started really putting out a lot of a
lot<00:04:41.060> of<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.300> good<00:04:41.450> stuff<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:42.050> you<00:04:42.380> know<00:04:42.500> I

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
lot of the good stuff and you know I

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.960 
lot of the good stuff and you know I
thought<00:04:42.740> this<00:04:42.830> was<00:04:42.950> generally<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.610> pretty

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
thought this was generally a pretty

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.820 
thought this was generally a pretty
decent<00:04:44.450> main<00:04:44.570> event<00:04:44.810> from<00:04:44.900> these<00:04:45.080> two<00:04:45.230> Barrett

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
decent main event from these two Barrett

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.800 
decent main event from these two Barrett
wins<00:04:46.070> with<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.580> bull<00:04:46.760> hammer<00:04:47.030> as<00:04:47.300> Bo<00:04:47.630> Dallas

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
wins with the bull hammer as Bo Dallas

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.140 
wins with the bull hammer as Bo Dallas
jumps<00:04:48.410> off<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.590> top<00:04:49.010> rope<00:04:49.160> I<00:04:49.550> thought<00:04:50.000> that

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
jumps off the top rope I thought that

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.120 
jumps off the top rope I thought that
was<00:04:50.240> a<00:04:50.300> good<00:04:50.750> way<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.230> a<00:04:51.320> different<00:04:51.830> way<00:04:51.950> as

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
was a good way in a different way as

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.190 
was a good way in a different way as
well<00:04:52.340> to<00:04:52.820> end<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.180> mandatory<00:04:53.600> in<00:04:53.810> these<00:04:53.960> two

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
well to end the mandatory in these two

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.800 
well to end the mandatory in these two
and<00:04:54.500> so<00:04:55.160> wade<00:04:55.760> barrett<00:04:55.940> keeps<00:04:56.210> doing<00:04:56.450> an<00:04:56.540> inter

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
and so wade barrett keeps doing an inter

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.390 
and so wade barrett keeps doing an inter
college<00:04:56.960> championship<00:04:57.169> that's<00:04:57.950> pretty<00:04:58.280> much

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
college championship that's pretty much

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.430 
college championship that's pretty much
what<00:04:58.790> I<00:04:58.820> expected<00:04:58.910> but<00:04:59.720> at<00:04:59.960> least<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.260> got<00:05:00.380> a

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
what I expected but at least I got a

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.870 
what I expected but at least I got a
good<00:05:00.650> match<00:05:00.830> out<00:05:01.100> of<00:05:01.190> it<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.370> again<00:05:01.610> it<00:05:01.730> was<00:05:01.820> a

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
good match out of it and again it was a

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.790 
good match out of it and again it was a
good<00:05:02.120> showcase<00:05:02.450> much<00:05:02.870> like<00:05:03.080> Adrian<00:05:03.530> Neville

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
good showcase much like Adrian Neville

good showcase much like Adrian Neville
earlier<00:05:04.130> a<00:05:04.310> really<00:05:04.940> good<00:05:05.120> showcase<00:05:05.419> of<00:05:05.930> Bo

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
earlier a really good showcase of Bo

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.530 
earlier a really good showcase of Bo
Dallas<00:05:06.919> and<00:05:07.280> what<00:05:07.400> he<00:05:07.580> can<00:05:07.790> actually<00:05:08.150> offer<00:05:08.300> to

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
my overall force on the show where there

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.770 
my overall force on the show where there
was<00:05:12.860> no<00:05:12.980> NXT<00:05:13.280> story<00:05:13.880> lines<00:05:14.180> or<00:05:14.390> anything<00:05:14.510> like

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780
