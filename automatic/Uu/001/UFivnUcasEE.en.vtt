00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:02.339
 U 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.120
 This time we will talk about the basic swing. 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:16.830
 First, I 'll explain it in seven steps. 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:22.800
 Yes, what you need is the first thing in a situation where you dress up 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:28.710
 Teiko is a tee-ko. There are many people who cause chaos. 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:31.859
 In an address to where you really do the job in the first clutch take-up on face 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.410
 The back part should be straight 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:43.260
 Now that the club from where that should be open to the general Ensenada More Edition 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:47.100
 When decorating at a location , I need to keep my right foot until the club face passes 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.379
 Straight to the opposite direction of the target 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:01:00.180
 At this time, the foreign hand will naturally cross the center of my body. 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:01.320
 In this situation, the left shoulder enters the pokey, the left shoulder the right heap 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.710
 to the center 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:14.670
 A natural rotation takes place at this time when the position of the two hands and the club ed is 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:20.090
 It's in the center of the chest, and the head keeps its first position. 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.090
 Especially in this situation, the right elbow 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:31.619
 And long stretches as if I turned the hair elbow stretched too coking time 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:38.430
 Because there is a phenomenon that clubs cover early 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:40.950
 When going to the caulking position past the right hand bar , the right elbow 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:48.360
 It's good to stick. 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:54.869
 At this time, both hands and the club pad are centered in the center, but on the center of the chest 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:02:00.030
 But the left shoulder will be in a slightly darker position on the body center point 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:06.569
 Then, in the motion that goes up to the tower , 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:09.989
 To go to the tower by force backswing The end of the grip so now I 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:13.080
 I'm plugging it in and showing it to you. 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.980
 If you go to the driving range and use the tee in this way, 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.980
 It'll be effective. 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:30.290
 The key at the end points to the opposite end of the target and the left shoulder 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:37.819
 Naturally within the axis of the base when the door to come up to the inside portion of the right foot 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:44.180
 In the center, the right side is bumped to the utmost in a situation where it does not come out with water. 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:48.530
 It will rotate more than 90 degrees about the center of the center . 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:52.579
 However, when you are doing this kind of movements, people who are older or have less flexibility 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.540
 I can tell you that my shoulders are almost gone. 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.019
 I have. 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:02.180
 Now here's the key, right in the head. 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:06.109
 If the high flexibility of the body is placed in a situation where the ball head intact 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:11.569
 You can rotate your shoulders naturally, but 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:18.889
 People with short or thick necks or lack of flexibility 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:24.410
 If you try to turn your shoulders hair going slightly back to the left, right, naturally 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:29.209
 This is not a mistake, but a natural one. 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:35.720
 So again, even if my head turns slightly to the right 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:41.599
 If you do not turn your head first, this phenomenon of the cheek returning to the right 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:46.489
 The tours in the current quiz are about three to four inches cheeky 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:51.409
 Do not be so frustrated, turn your cheek. 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:55.400
 But it is excessive if I return back along the heads of people with high flexibility 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.410
 The rotation of the shoulders of the swing may cause us to be rather more stubborn 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.360
 I was there. 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:05.160
 The body, depending on your flexibility upset Jia limited extent d of natural 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.160
 It is necessary to be absent.
