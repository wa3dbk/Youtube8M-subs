00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hi everyone, my name is roggero. 17 years e, city sant'angelo in 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.349
 province of pescara 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.069
 psg I sign up 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:12.799
 nice nice pool 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.209
 and as mom says 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:16.209
 my for and g 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.209
 well i am a person very since 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.829
 indeed 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.800
 if you see a person that dislikes me I say 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.289
 own mince 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.800
 porches x factor 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.400
 even if I am 17 years old 90 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.500
 because as at the beginning of the casting 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.739
 will allow a goal to reach this point at the beginning 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.000
 participants done 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.380
 for me now the goal and arrive in the final 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.500
 when ever you chose for the cast of x factor 4 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.250
 do not you believe it 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.850
 I thought I think a dream but made a joke of it 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.750
 great thing 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 I didn't believe it was an emotion 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 my family 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.820
 especially my father 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.210
 let's say the person who struck me the most because he is the first singer 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.790
 of the family because his dream 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.390
 we are doing the singer 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.890
 my mum 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.240
 let's say 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.110
 that a little angry because 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.800
 you prefer that I continue to school certain the climate I will continue the school 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 don't worry about renting iwata now 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.500
 exploit 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.310
 for music 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.950
 sincerely everything 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.360
 everything really 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.229
 of course the answer is too obvious though 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.310
 everything is won for Milan 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.880
 so anything 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.280
 before leaving 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.850
 I ate everything 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.960
 then the most important thing is a nice croissant with nutella 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.430
 I said never go out pimples and nun now during the broadcast 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.060
 the first thing I will do when I get home well 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.469
 stay with my family bracelets 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:14.010
 to talk about everything I did during the broadcast 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.470
 hyenas 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.379
 myspace music 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.010
 let's say that everything started from a marriage when I first got it 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.640
 sang in front of an audience at 5 years singing laura is not there - 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:28.749
 cellulite 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.879
 now I am a little bigger 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.369
 in the legs in quotation marks 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.889
 for now begin with the k is a musical group 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.769
 we do a lot of concerts and from there started studying I did a good one 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.799
 path already studying study for two years 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.959
 I sing 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.229
 let's say a little bit of everything 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.630
 let's say as genre I don't really like music very much 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.059
 commercial 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:03:01.969
 sans I prefer music where the merge is the fermented locality ie belen a 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:03.719
 hold up the voice 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.339
 my favorite singer 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.179
 symmetry 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.809
 at this time the paolo nutini 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:12.549
 why 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.919
 every time I hear him sing every time I go to see even a 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.349
 his concert 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:24.090
 he expresses everything on stage his emotions pureed as he sings expresses 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.589
 just oh. 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.360
 all you can hunt 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.669
 from music 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.679
 the first cd I bought 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:32.879
 movie 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.939
 red relative Titian iron 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.879
 a big jump 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.879
 the song I'd like to be the author of 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.449
 in my opinion 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:46.959
 of Michael Buble because he speaks in the song he wants to return home 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.969
 that does not make it more suited to being around the world 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:54.089
 if you want to meet his family 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:55.420
 omg song 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.509

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.189
 go out big where 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.120
 in this period I often listen to my ipod 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.659
 Maropati 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.629
 paolo nutini 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.209
 home michael bublÃ¨ 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.569
