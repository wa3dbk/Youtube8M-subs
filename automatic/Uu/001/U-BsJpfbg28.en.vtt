this<00:04:46.930> game<00:04:47.230> I<00:04:47.590> mean<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:48.460> should<00:04:48.490> really<00:04:49.390> go

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
this game I mean you should really go

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.450 
this game I mean you should really go
out<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:49.990> support<00:04:50.110> frictional<00:04:50.770> by<00:04:50.950> this<00:04:51.160> game

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
out and support frictional by this game

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.510 
out and support frictional by this game
because<00:04:51.970> I<00:04:52.420> mean<00:04:52.540> it's<00:04:52.690> only<00:04:52.840> uh<00:04:53.050> like<00:04:53.590> I<00:04:53.950> got

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
because I mean it's only uh like I got

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.010 
because I mean it's only uh like I got
it<00:04:54.640> for<00:04:54.790> ten<00:04:54.940> dollars<00:04:55.330> but<00:04:55.600> it's<00:04:55.720> probably<00:04:55.960> a

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
it for ten dollars but it's probably a

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.150 
it for ten dollars but it's probably a
bit<00:04:56.110> more<00:04:56.230> expensive<00:04:56.530> now<00:04:56.860> because<00:04:57.040> it's

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
bit more expensive now because it's

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.240 
bit more expensive now because it's
released<00:04:57.430> I<00:04:57.790> think<00:04:58.570> it's<00:04:58.720> really<00:04:59.680> worth<00:04:59.830> it

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
released I think it's really worth it

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.090 
released I think it's really worth it
it's<00:05:01.240> it's<00:05:01.450> really<00:05:01.840> fun<00:05:02.080> really<00:05:02.350> atmospheric

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
it's it's really fun really atmospheric

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.380
