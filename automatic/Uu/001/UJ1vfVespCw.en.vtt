00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:02.629 

so<00:00:01.050> here's<00:00:01.230> our<00:00:01.380> part<00:00:01.680> two<00:00:01.860> on<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.129> fog<00:00:02.370> light

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
so here's our part two on the fog light

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.640 
so here's our part two on the fog light
install<00:00:03.060> last<00:00:03.959> time<00:00:04.170> we<00:00:04.290> had<00:00:04.410> them<00:00:04.529> in<00:00:04.589> the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
install last time we had them in the

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.470 
install last time we had them in the
bumper<00:00:06.680> and<00:00:07.680> there's<00:00:07.919> just<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.250> spot<00:00:08.610> believe

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
bumper and there's just a spot believe

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.140 
bumper and there's just a spot believe
it's<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.160> upper<00:00:11.160> right<00:00:11.370> corner<00:00:11.580> upper<00:00:11.969> left

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
it's the upper right corner upper left

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.749 
it's the upper right corner upper left
corner<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.480> just<00:00:12.630> draw<00:00:12.780> home<00:00:13.370> pop<00:00:14.370> right<00:00:14.580> in

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
corner you just draw home pop right in

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.279 
corner you just draw home pop right in
there

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
there

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.120 
there
so<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.410> wiring<00:00:16.800> has<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.490> kind<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.910> funky

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
so the wiring has is kind of funky

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.720 
so the wiring has is kind of funky
so<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.730> may<00:00:20.880> get<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.180> yellow<00:00:21.480> wire<00:00:22.609> and<00:00:23.609> this

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
so you may get this yellow wire and this

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.310 
so you may get this yellow wire and this
is<00:00:23.880> actually<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> power<00:00:24.480> wire<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.140> is

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
is actually a power wire so this is

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.920 
is actually a power wire so this is
going<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.529> run<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:26.210> up<00:00:27.210> through<00:00:27.420> here<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.779> it's

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
going to run up up through here and it's

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.950 
going to run up up through here and it's
going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> connect<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:29.220> guy<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.960> and

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
going to connect to this guy here and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.630 
going to connect to this guy here and
you<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.199> ground<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.369> actually

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
you have a ground and this is actually

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.690 
you have a ground and this is actually
another<00:00:32.730> power<00:00:33.059> wire<00:00:34.309> I'm<00:00:35.309> working<00:00:35.610> on

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
another power wire I'm working on

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.760 
another power wire I'm working on
cooking<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.620> our

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
cooking that up and then this is our

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.340 
cooking that up and then this is our
relay<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.520> fuse<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:40.170> our<00:00:40.860> main<00:00:41.219> power<00:00:41.460> wire

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
relay in fuse and our main power wire

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.330 
relay in fuse and our main power wire
all<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> hook<00:00:43.739> up<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> better<00:00:44.160> it's

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
all going to hook up to the better it's

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.049 
all going to hook up to the better it's
pretty<00:00:44.550> simple<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.430> fire<00:00:47.760> I

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059

don't<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> spot<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> fire

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
don't really have a spot in the fire

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.060 
don't really have a spot in the fire
wall<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.430> don't<00:00:50.610> want<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.789> drill<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> hole<00:00:51.030> so

wall and don't want to drill a hole so

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.229 
wall and don't want to drill a hole so
pull<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> fender<00:00:53.460> down<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> little<00:00:53.760> bit<00:00:53.879> ran<00:00:54.120> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
pull the fender down a little bit ran it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.189 
pull the fender down a little bit ran it
under<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:58.070> just<00:00:59.070> tucked<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> through<00:00:59.550> here

under here just tucked it through here

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.020 
under here just tucked it through here
and<00:01:01.199> we'll<00:01:01.620> find<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.949> permanent<00:01:02.699> spot<00:01:02.820> for

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
and we'll find a permanent spot for

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.800 
and we'll find a permanent spot for
later<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.790> shuts<00:01:08.180> all<00:01:09.180> right<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.659> I
