00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello today we will look at the mod 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.580
 which adds 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.010
 unusual zombies of which will 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.480
 drop out different ores and so began to begin 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.250
 consider the mod and so let's 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.020
 consider all those zombies of which 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.050
 different ores will fall 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.090
 The first zombie is a colzon without which both 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.369
 you probably already understood 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.730
 kalyuzhna falls out sooner kill 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.300
 him 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.679
 the sun did not burn so did not understand why of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.420
 his ear did not fall out a second attempt so 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.399
 go out of it should fall now 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.250
 coal and did not understand where coal 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.250
 what's the problem okay let's make the night 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.020
 you see something in the villa but i hope 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.520
 that you still see something in this 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.090
 the darkness of them nothing falls why 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.829
 dang another jungle i said i don't 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.070
 said ask you 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.410
 where is coal what is that bullshit why is it not 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.170
 coal do not give oh out of it 2 pieces fell out 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.330
 coal it is unbelievable and so proceed to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.970
 next zombie so perhaps i'm here 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.920
 still or laura aim or just she 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.920
 just put the torch here 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.530
 Now another thing can now 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.990
 treat other zombies as worthwhile 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.080
 zombies this is the zombies which falls out 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.420
 iron ore iron bars go out 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.950
 he should fall out 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.660
 Now let's see what falls out of it like this 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.310
 it falls from the iron bars just 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.420
 those iron bars about which I and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.400
 said so kill another zombie 2 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.440
 iron ingot principle in general even 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.550
 profitable 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.920
 so the third time we kill so from 3 zombies 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.710
 nothing fell okay go to 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.600
 the next zombie is the zombie golden of 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.910
 which is supposed to be managed by gold 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:00.840
 We kill it as you can see from the 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.370
 This zombie is not 20 x 50 like this 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.400
 let's see how much hp y 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.930
 iron zombies have iron zombies and not 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.330
 I can make out how much hp they probably have 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.850
 also 50 to most likely he also has 50 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.810
 Takao coal zombies how many HP now 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.740
 we'll see coal 40 kn 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.510
 Interestingly so interesting 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.140
 kill coal zombie falls out of it 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.540
 tuvalet 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.640
 once again and now we consider 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.360
 that zombie from which will fall out 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.160
 red dust from the floor he has 60 hp so 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.770
 let's kill him and see what 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.800
 from him fall out of course from him 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.720
 fall red dust out of it so it fell 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.459
 red dust so next zombie 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.560
 which we look at is lapis lazuli 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.850
 zombies need to be started now 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.709
 the sun will rise and stop me 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.420
 consider this mod so zombies to 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.110
 go out of you must fall and lapis lazuli 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.700
 right i think 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.570
 so let us have it volumes and see 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.930
 hope that it will not fall out 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.460
 lapis lazuli then fall out of it 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.100
 azure let's go now i have it again 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:05.380
 I will sleep and see how much hp he has 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.840
 it's 60 fps so sleepy still 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.540
 zombie is such a zombie from which 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.010
 the diamonds are served are very cool so 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.560
 we kill him and I donâ€™t see the diamond 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.450
 I do not see the diamond is such irony 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.780
 I share some reason I fell out of it 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.270
 diamond until biscuits for catch 22 diamond 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.489
 yes if you stumbled upon such a zombie then 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.820
 you're lucky let's see 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.500
 how much hp he has 70s so give 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.480
 now consider the next zombie 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.880
 This is such a zombie from which in theory 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.500
 must fall out of smart people so 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.900
 let's see what he falls 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.680
 then I should drop emeralds from it before 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.239
 got out of it 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.980
 emeralds let's it one more time 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.950
 sleep and see how much hp he has 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.110
 he has 70 fps in principle exactly the same 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.810
 number of hp like a zombie from which 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.780
 falling diamonds so the next zombie is 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.850
 zombie navel zombie now let's see what of 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.560
 him I do not even remember what it is 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.150
 zombies to such interesting honestly 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.769
 saying i have no idea what of it 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.900
 falls now just check that out 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.180
 it will fall out so I looked on the site 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.220
 information about this zombie which we 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.650
 Now we are looking at that site. 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.780
 once and downloaded this mod but information 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.489
 About this zombie I did not find for what 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.769
 the reason I did not find this information there 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.320
 it's just not possible 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.300
 the zombies just changed his texture and 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.370
 added him another plus 20 kb 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.020
 but it's no use of him even 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.700
 rotten flesh does not fall out maybe this 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.650
 from a zombie from which nothing at all 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.750
 falls out you can call him a poor zombie 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.180
 so and the last zombie we 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.030
 today consider this zombie under 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.190
 called quartz zombies here such at 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.600
 him texture 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.310
 to be honest and i even get it from quartz and 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.729
 most likely not different so give us 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.010
 kill him 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.080
 and see what that chris fall out of him 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.050
 he fell out of quartz in principle of this and 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.290
 should have been expected since he has 60 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.150
 ok we kill him once again and 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.099
 pick up a quad of those zombies that we 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.700
 reviewed today you can find in 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.200
 the world so much that only create a 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.630
 will just spawn in 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.430
 random places possible even in caves 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.900
 Principle on this all with you was food forest 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.880
 Subscribe likes and bids
