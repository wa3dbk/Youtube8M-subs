00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.000
 Today I want to offer you to go for 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.650
 framework of traditional makeup and

 maximum dense and rich color 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.350
 start from the center of the lips and move to 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.269
 the edges of the straight lines try a little 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.410
 round and not draw too 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.600
 clearly another cupid 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.640
 lines should be more smoothly they 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.320
 drawing triangles otherwise your makeup 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.140
 will look rather retro than 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.550
 modern today a clear pencil 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.550
 contour is not relevant in makeup 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.780
 upper and lower lip must necessarily

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.680
 to avoid the effect of red teeth 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.030

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.680

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.770
 focus on visual continuation 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:11.610
 lines of the lower eyelid smoothly connect
