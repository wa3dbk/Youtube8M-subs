the exact pattern and cut of that canvas
to<00:01:18.090> fit<00:01:18.270> exactly<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.780> way<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.990> did<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> first

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
to fit exactly the way it did the first

first time you owned it so the only

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.109 
first time you owned it so the only
differences<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> colors<00:01:23.520> will<00:01:23.670> change<00:01:23.909> but

you<00:01:32.880> domed<00:01:33.750> roof<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.409> jig<00:01:34.829> was<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you domed roof to jig was one of the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.550 
you domed roof to jig was one of the
ones<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.520> truly<00:01:36.090> has<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.659> domed<00:01:37.170> roof<00:01:37.439> to

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
ones that truly has a domed roof to

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.109 
ones that truly has a domed roof to
everybody<00:01:37.829> else<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.070> goes<00:01:38.369> front<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.759> back<00:01:38.939> or

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
side to side with watershed so it's

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.969 
side to side with watershed so it's
another<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.509> great<00:01:42.630> feature<00:01:42.979> enclosed

underneath the tent trailer for most
other<00:01:54.509> manufacturers<00:01:54.930> your<00:01:55.200> cables<00:01:55.530> run

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
other manufacturers your cables run

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
other manufacturers your cables run
under<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.729> collect<00:01:56.969> all<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> debris<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
under and collect all the debris and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.840 
under and collect all the debris and
stuff<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.110> run<00:01:58.590> through<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.640> you're

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
stuff that run through that you're

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.340 
stuff that run through that you're
driving<00:02:00.270> down<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.420> road

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
driving down the road

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.810 
driving down the road
and<00:02:01.530> also<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.890> see<00:02:01.979> nylon<00:02:02.369> grommets

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
and also you can see nylon grommets

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.780 
and also you can see nylon grommets
there<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.509> keep<00:02:03.930> from<00:02:04.259> metal<00:02:04.500> from

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
there so keep from metal from

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.090 
there so keep from metal from
contact<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:05.510> we're<00:02:05.720> as<00:02:06.080> far<00:02:06.290> as<00:02:06.380> that<00:02:06.530> goes

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
contact and we're as far as that goes

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.790 
contact and we're as far as that goes
they<00:02:07.430> also<00:02:07.580> have<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:08.420> sealed<00:02:08.960> nice<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.590> sealed

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
they also have a sealed nice and sealed

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.530 
they also have a sealed nice and sealed
so<00:02:09.890> no<00:02:10.100> water<00:02:10.340> can<00:02:10.610> get<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:10.850> turmoil<00:02:11.150> sure<00:02:11.360> a

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
so no water can get in turmoil sure a

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.170 
so no water can get in turmoil sure a
lot<00:02:11.960> of<00:02:11.990> these<00:02:12.170> other<00:02:13.160> ones<00:02:13.370> have<00:02:13.580> these<00:02:13.700> big<00:02:13.910> C

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
lot of these other ones have these big C

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.760 
lot of these other ones have these big C
channels<00:02:14.570> are<00:02:14.720> open<00:02:14.990> on<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.170> back<00:02:15.380> they<00:02:15.560> drop

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
channels are open on the back they drop

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.740 
channels are open on the back they drop
all<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.040> way<00:02:16.070> through<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.460> floor<00:02:16.700> cables<00:02:17.540> run

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
all the way through the floor cables run

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.410 
all the way through the floor cables run
out<00:02:18.230> underneath<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:19.000> unit<00:02:20.000> there<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.300> it's

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
out underneath the unit there so it's

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.490 
out underneath the unit there so it's
driving<00:02:20.720> down<00:02:20.810> their<00:02:20.930> own<00:02:21.020> picking<00:02:21.290> up<00:02:21.380> all

kinds of debris running that through

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.950 
kinds of debris running that through
your<00:02:22.760> pulley<00:02:23.000> system<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.510> just<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.900> know

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
your pulley system and just you know

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.390 
your pulley system and just you know
wearing<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.470> down<00:02:24.680> breaking<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.130> down<00:02:25.280> over

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
all have the electric lifting systems

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.590 
all have the electric lifting systems
too<00:02:31.040> as<00:02:31.220> well<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.610> Jayco<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:32.090> one<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.390> last

too as well and Jayco is one of the last

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.580 
too as well and Jayco is one of the last
to<00:02:32.750> put<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.020> on<00:02:33.170> there<00:02:33.320> because<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.560> just

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
to put that on there because I just

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.560 
to put that on there because I just
wanted<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.070> test<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.580> make<00:02:34.760> sure<00:02:34.790> then

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
wanted to test it and make sure then

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.120 
wanted to test it and make sure then
we're<00:02:35.660> going<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.840> have<00:02:35.930> failures<00:02:36.380> like<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.860> lot

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
we're going to have failures like a lot

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.330 
we're going to have failures like a lot
where<00:02:37.310> when<00:02:37.459> they<00:02:37.550> first<00:02:37.790> came<00:02:37.940> out<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:39.350> in

have 32 to 64 pulleys in there you have
a<00:02:49.459> lot<00:02:49.640> more<00:02:49.670> cable<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.420> lot<00:02:50.750> more<00:02:50.930> things<00:02:51.470> that

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
a lot more cable a lot more things that

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.560 
a lot more cable a lot more things that
could<00:02:51.770> go<00:02:51.890> wrong<00:02:51.920> if<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.490> breaks<00:02:52.790> or<00:02:53.000> whatnot

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
could go wrong if it breaks or whatnot

you're<00:02:53.780> going<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:53.990> end<00:02:54.110> up<00:02:54.170> having<00:02:54.500> trying<00:02:55.280> to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
you're going to end up having trying to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.590 
you're going to end up having trying to

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
reroute it through all those pulley

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.880 
reroute it through all those pulley

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
they're lifting system is actually a

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.810 
they're lifting system is actually a
pushrod<00:03:06.440> system<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.160> they're<00:03:07.280> like<00:03:07.489> they<00:03:07.670> look

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
pushrod system so they're like they look

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.880 
pushrod system so they're like they look
like<00:03:07.850> big<00:03:08.150> springs<00:03:08.660> are<00:03:08.840> inside<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.650> these

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
like big springs are inside of these

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.710

minutes ago and they actually push the
roof<00:03:13.130> up<00:03:13.280> instead<00:03:13.550> of<00:03:13.670> pulling<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:14.690> was

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
roof up instead of pulling it so I was

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.300 
roof up instead of pulling it so I was
one<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.140> highest<00:03:15.440> carrying<00:03:15.739> capacities
