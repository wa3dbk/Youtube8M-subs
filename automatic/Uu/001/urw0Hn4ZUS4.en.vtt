00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
three times already on some different

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.860 
three times already on some different
songs<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:07.910> didn't<00:03:08.090> work<00:03:08.209> on<00:03:08.329> any<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.720> them

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
songs and it didn't work on any of them

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.259 
songs and it didn't work on any of them
it<00:03:09.140> paused<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.130> music<00:03:10.519> when<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.790> time<00:03:11.000> was<00:03:11.209> up

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
it paused the music when the time was up

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.240 
it paused the music when the time was up
but<00:03:11.930> then<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.230> music<00:03:12.290> just<00:03:12.680> started<00:03:13.069> right<00:03:13.220> up

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
but then the music just started right up

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.569 
but then the music just started right up
again<00:03:13.610> so<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:15.560> could<00:03:16.069> be<00:03:16.099> something<00:03:16.220> that

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
again so that could be something that

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.000 
again so that could be something that
Spotify<00:03:17.209> could<00:03:17.480> add<00:03:17.660> in<00:03:17.930> later<00:03:18.200> or<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.829> could

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
Spotify could add in later or it could

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.410 
Spotify could add in later or it could
be<00:03:19.160> just<00:03:19.190> something<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.760> just<00:03:19.910> can't<00:03:20.239> be

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
be just something that just can't be

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.050 
be just something that just can't be
