00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 then disembark the day of the facts a 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.450
 video about the accuracy of the figures messed up 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.460
 in the videos I got a little too much 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.800
 close so good I do not refuse very 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.150
 so there 's a lot of precision when you stop 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.179
 accuracy at the base of a maneuver that 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.719
 is a little bit marginal that takes from 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.130
 the importance 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.650
 so in theory so from reform 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.170
 of the permit that he has on August 1, 2014 in 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.349
 the September 1, see if it is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.660
 maintains with the strikes 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.740
 inspectors so it's the same if you 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.540
 becomes important because it has become 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.079
 now mandatory in both 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.079
 hands laid fingers 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.829
 do not panic this is an art is 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.640
 simple is not luck 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.640
 in theory then I gave you the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.079
 method I wanted to remind twice to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.230
 least one was taking notes if you 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.789
 so then want to see you and see 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.969
 in the previous video that now 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.050
 again said the president so 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.809
 the inspector the moody mike inspector 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.760
 kebby the post that washed out abandoned 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.530
 to the end 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.260
 you missed the bar so that it 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.970
 must you agree window 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.400
 the red band for a fire hydrant 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.130
 as Saint Gobain be between the brothers 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.320
 see the vehicle 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.060
 so there simply so we arrive 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.979
 so meet the morin meets the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.720
 interests from the outside blind spot on 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.310
 can do it 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.300
 so times to answer inside 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.180
 great death which these trains air m 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.910
 agree but really understand there is a 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.560
 early and distinctly 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.120
 so I'll see if I have that I'm doing 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.460
 several checks and I do a little 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.960
 around me within time and 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.550
 then then quietly at the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.870
 limit if I have a guy who sucks 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.970
 behind I will do for the six have 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.510
 counter coming I put a flashing that 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.480
 right 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.040
 and then then I adapt from my 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.080
 look me what I mean 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.170
 trajectories look wear the furthest 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.060
 possible I'm trying not to 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.590
 propose in the attic remitting 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.740
 not be too much on the road so that 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.660
 it's not obvious and then 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.180
 stop smoothly so at the place 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.070
 indicated and then dead point brake so 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.330
 I repeat my rabbit and words so 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.209
 oar row because no currency pair face 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.340
 turn adaptation of the lure 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.740
 trajectory look worn will arrive 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.220
 sweetness said here it's good point 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.470
 death just pretend play get back 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.540
 its next for if you want this 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.890
 who can draw a concept developed a 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.360
 little bit of everything that is art and 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.660
 simple of often the problems that can 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.750
 happen so she was claiming then so 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.489
 I said my hands so when it's stopped it's 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.320
 first prevent the gac and behind 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.970
 okay so you brake 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.160
 gradually to great are hardly the 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.980
 preventive brake to prevent or win 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.050
 d ok so you missed a part 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.660
 soft and hard part encompasses in the 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.210
 soft part 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.160
 the lights stop lights 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.670
 road you prevent the galley doing 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.110
 romont guard ferries or I stop 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.850
 then you can if you want so 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.860
 when you started to brake meters 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.720
 skating and / or complete trip 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.940
 points to walkouts all icaunais 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.310
 in freewheel the good opio makes a two 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.530
 or not a direct agreement and then 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.610
 you are more and more progressive 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.690
 in your so preventative light on this 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.720
 who walks a little behind 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.570
 then I fight tina and or walkouts 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.050
 I see there and then end without the 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.540
 progressive evening are the plates that get 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:39.760
 stick solist shape of jaws has 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:42.310
 gradually it's pretty preventive ok 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.080
 the accuracy of the pressure the one where is 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.480
 so in the suppression of revolt in 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.520
 spoke good Arabic and we specified 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.200
 the location is between two windows 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.880
 then a target in almost false 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.120
 movement this anticipatory work a 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.740
 same shot dosing precision braking 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.570
 the trajectory not to be smashed 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.950
 sidewalks obviously get to 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.390
 look worn dexterity of the hands here 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.310
 times of villards in position one 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.660
 little to gala tpir everywhere and show 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.210
 we promise this risk we are captain 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.710
 a rare capital and so that obviously 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.000
 it is to work a maximum of 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:18.160
 supervise and I hope it's a 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.160
 little audio video all that radio 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.680
 it's easy easy so do not take the 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.540
 head that's it you do not let yourself 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.670
 not crushed by the pressure of people 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.100
 behind or possibly the pressure 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.900
 possible that you 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.860
 histology see the rest apparently 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.590
 bt and 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.740
 face to face this is your schedule that she 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.740
 worth
