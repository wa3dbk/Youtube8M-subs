thinking I was having front brake issues

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.790 
thinking I was having front brake issues
it<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.309> actually<00:00:33.410> passenger<00:00:34.410> side<00:00:34.590> rear

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it was actually passenger side rear

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.100 
it was actually passenger side rear
wheel<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.160> was<00:00:35.280> locking<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.809> because<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
wheel that was locking up because the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.319 
wheel that was locking up because the
pass<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.800> rotor<00:00:38.010> excuse<00:00:38.730> me<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> pads<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
pass of the rotor excuse me the pads and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.690 
pass of the rotor excuse me the pads and
drum<00:00:39.629> work<00:00:40.110> glazed<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.280> those<00:00:41.489> will<00:00:41.610> be

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700

caliper off and the rotor comes off

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.270 
caliper off and the rotor comes off
really<00:01:59.790> easily<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.479> kind<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.500> slides

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.060 
really easily it just kind of slides
you're<00:02:02.670> gonna<00:02:02.960> walk<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.110> off

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
you're gonna walk it off

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.460 
you're gonna walk it off
behind<00:02:06.970> there<00:02:07.180> is<00:02:07.300> your<00:02:07.420> wheel<00:02:07.570> bearing<00:02:08.020> this

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
behind there is your wheel bearing this

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.870 
behind there is your wheel bearing this
is<00:02:08.649> where<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.890> drive<00:02:09.130> axle<00:02:09.550> goes<00:02:09.670> through<00:02:10.149> and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
is where the drive axle goes through and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.790 
is where the drive axle goes through and
yeah<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.270> calipers<00:02:13.690> back<00:02:13.900> there<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.680> let

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
yeah and the calipers back there so let

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
yeah and the calipers back there so let
me<00:02:14.890> go<00:02:14.980> get<00:02:15.130> my<00:02:15.190> new<00:02:15.460> rotor<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.150> put<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.450> on

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
me go get my new rotor and put that on

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.640 
me go get my new rotor and put that on
all<00:02:18.820> right<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.330> got<00:02:19.540> my<00:02:19.570> new<00:02:19.750> rotor<00:02:19.990> on<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.410> got

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
all right so I got my new rotor on I got

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.080 
all right so I got my new rotor on I got
a<00:02:20.680> lug<00:02:20.890> nut<00:02:20.980> holding<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.520> out<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:21.850> it's<00:02:21.970> in

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
a lug nut holding it out on so it's in

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.700 
a lug nut holding it out on so it's in
place<00:02:22.360> now<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.750> got<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.020> change<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.350> pads<00:02:23.560> in

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
place now I got to change the pads in

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.460 
place now I got to change the pads in
the<00:02:23.830> caliper<00:02:24.840> these<00:02:25.840> are<00:02:25.990> kind<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.230> hot<00:02:26.380> to

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
the caliper these are kind of hot to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.900 
the caliper these are kind of hot to
change<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.800> pads<00:02:27.010> in<00:02:27.250> because<00:02:27.670> there<00:02:27.880> are

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
change the pads in because there are

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.510 
change the pads in because there are
some<00:02:28.150> spring<00:02:28.450> clips<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.100> really<00:02:30.100> hard<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.400> get

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
some spring clips and really hard to get

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.070 
some spring clips and really hard to get
everything<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:31.000> line<00:02:31.030> up<00:02:31.330> correctly<00:02:31.690> at<00:02:31.870> once

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
everything to line up correctly at once

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.140 
everything to line up correctly at once
so<00:02:32.980> they<00:02:33.130> take<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.340> little<00:02:33.490> bit<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.730> practice<00:02:33.910> to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
so they take a little bit of practice to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.790 
so they take a little bit of practice to
do<00:02:34.360> I'm<00:02:34.600> still<00:02:34.870> not<00:02:35.020> great<00:02:35.230> at<00:02:35.440> them<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.680> takes

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
do I'm still not great at them it takes

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.130 
do I'm still not great at them it takes
me<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.040> little<00:02:36.250> bit<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.460> do<00:02:36.580> them<00:02:36.760> but<00:02:37.330> hopefully

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
me a little bit to do them but hopefully

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.140 
me a little bit to do them but hopefully
I'll<00:02:38.500> get<00:02:38.590> those<00:02:38.740> in<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.160> can<00:02:39.340> show<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.580> how

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
I'll get those in and I can show you how

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.720 
I'll get those in and I can show you how
to<00:02:40.270> change<00:02:40.480> them<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.920> here's<00:02:42.160> what<00:02:42.370> they<00:02:42.550> new

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
to change them so here's what they new

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.180 
to change them so here's what they new
Pharaoh<00:02:43.690> carbon<00:02:44.140> pad<00:02:44.320> looks<00:02:44.590> like<00:02:44.770> from<00:02:44.950> hawk

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
Pharaoh carbon pad looks like from hawk

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.590 
Pharaoh carbon pad looks like from hawk
see<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.120> other<00:02:46.240> ones<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.630> box<00:02:46.840> it's<00:02:47.560> very

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
see the other ones in the box it's very

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.920 
see the other ones in the box it's very
very<00:02:49.600> grippy<00:02:49.990> so<00:02:50.170> hopefully<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:51.370> will<00:02:51.930> help

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
very grippy so hopefully it will help

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.330 
very grippy so hopefully it will help
the<00:02:53.080> truck<00:02:53.260> stop<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.530> little<00:02:53.830> better<00:02:54.010> than<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
the truck stop a little better than the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.460 
the truck stop a little better than the
ceramic<00:02:54.640> pads<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.450> don't<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.200> sliding

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
ceramic pads I don't like the sliding

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.960 
ceramic pads I don't like the sliding
feeling<00:02:56.980> with<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.250> ceramic<00:02:57.520> pad<00:02:57.820> especially

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
feeling with the ceramic pad especially

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.870 
feeling with the ceramic pad especially
when<00:02:58.420> they<00:02:58.510> get<00:02:58.630> wet<00:02:59.310> so<00:03:00.310> hopefully<00:03:00.700> this

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
when they get wet so hopefully this

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.610 
when they get wet so hopefully this
helps<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.360> but<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:01.959> also<00:03:02.140> don't<00:03:02.380> like<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
helps it but I also don't like the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.070 
helps it but I also don't like the
semi-metallic<00:03:03.160> pads<00:03:03.700> because<00:03:04.570> they<00:03:04.780> tend<00:03:05.020> to

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
semi-metallic pads because they tend to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.170 
semi-metallic pads because they tend to
get<00:03:05.950> glazed<00:03:06.280> what<00:03:06.640> happens<00:03:06.940> with<00:03:07.090> the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
get glazed what happens with the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.910 
get glazed what happens with the
semi-metallic<00:03:07.510> pads<00:03:07.989> when<00:03:08.739> you<00:03:08.800> have

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
semi-metallic pads when you have

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.430 
semi-metallic pads when you have
squeaking<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.610> sometimes<00:03:10.390> in<00:03:10.840> my<00:03:11.019> case<00:03:11.260> in

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
squeaking and sometimes in my case in

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.420 
squeaking and sometimes in my case in
the<00:03:11.530> rear<00:03:11.739> tire<00:03:12.580> back<00:03:12.880> there<00:03:13.150> or<00:03:13.989> rear<00:03:14.140> wheel

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
the rear tire back there or rear wheel

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.759 
the rear tire back there or rear wheel
they<00:03:15.430> get<00:03:15.610> glazed<00:03:15.910> so<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.570> rotor<00:03:17.140> or<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.530> drum

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
they get glazed so the rotor or the drum

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.220 
they get glazed so the rotor or the drum
gets<00:03:18.220> glazed<00:03:18.610> along<00:03:19.120> with<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.360> pads<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:19.989> you

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
gets glazed along with the pads so you

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.470 
gets glazed along with the pads so you
have<00:03:20.890> two<00:03:21.070> shiny<00:03:21.370> surfaces<00:03:21.940> going<00:03:22.120> against

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
have two shiny surfaces going against

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.600 
have two shiny surfaces going against
one<00:03:22.660> another<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.110> they<00:03:23.410> squeak<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.130> they<00:03:24.459> can

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
one another and they squeak and they can

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.840 
one another and they squeak and they can
cause<00:03:24.820> lockup<00:03:25.360> and<00:03:25.890> it's<00:03:26.890> just<00:03:27.070> all<00:03:27.610> around

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
cause lockup and it's just all around

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.259 
cause lockup and it's just all around
bad<00:03:28.410> design<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:30.519> need<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.700> be<00:03:30.760> careful<00:03:31.180> when

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
bad design you need to be careful when

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.729 
bad design you need to be careful when
you<00:03:31.360> put<00:03:31.510> these<00:03:31.630> on<00:03:31.840> because<00:03:32.350> you<00:03:32.500> need<00:03:32.620> to

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
you put these on because you need to

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.050 
you put these on because you need to
make<00:03:32.890> sure<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:33.160> put<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.459> right<00:03:33.489> pad<00:03:33.820> on<00:03:33.970> the

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
make sure you put the right pad on the

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.550 
make sure you put the right pad on the
right<00:03:34.180> size<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.780> same<00:03:34.989> physical<00:03:35.200> size

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
right size to the same physical size

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.979 
right size to the same physical size
except<00:03:36.549> this<00:03:36.670> one<00:03:36.880> has<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.060> weir<00:03:37.299> indicator<00:03:37.780> on

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
except this one has a weir indicator on

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.810 
except this one has a weir indicator on
it<00:03:38.019> so<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.920> want<00:03:39.070> to<00:03:39.130> make<00:03:39.220> sure<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.519> goes<00:03:39.640> on

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
it so you want to make sure that goes on

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.699 
it so you want to make sure that goes on
the<00:03:39.940> front<00:03:39.970> or<00:03:40.570> in<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.750> front<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.260> caliper

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
the front or in the front of the caliper

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.070 
the front or in the front of the caliper
so<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.130> can<00:03:42.310> see<00:03:42.610> it<00:03:42.760> when<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:43.780> pull<00:03:43.989> the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
so that you can see it when you pull the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.600 
so that you can see it when you pull the
tire<00:03:44.260> these<00:03:44.530> are<00:03:44.650> my<00:03:44.739> old<00:03:44.920> pads<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.430> you<00:03:45.519> can

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
tire these are my old pads and you can

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.150 
tire these are my old pads and you can
see<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:45.880> pretty<00:03:46.150> worn<00:03:46.709> matter<00:03:47.709> of<00:03:47.830> fact<00:03:48.010> it

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
see that pretty worn matter of fact it

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.949 
see that pretty worn matter of fact it
was<00:03:48.190> so<00:03:48.459> worn<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:49.060> pull<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.330> wear<00:03:49.510> indicator

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
was so worn to pull the wear indicator

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.130 
was so worn to pull the wear indicator
off<00:03:50.670> because<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:52.150> just<00:03:52.180> didn't<00:03:52.630> have<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.870> extra

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
off because I just didn't have the extra

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.490 
off because I just didn't have the extra
cash<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.650> straighten<00:03:54.640> them<00:03:54.700> out<00:03:54.760> at<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:54.970> time

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
cash to straighten them out at the time

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.979 
cash to straighten them out at the time
but<00:03:56.500> they're<00:03:56.709> really<00:03:56.920> bad<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:58.780> is<00:03:58.900> all

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
but they're really bad and this is all

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.170 
but they're really bad and this is all
the<00:03:59.110> new<00:03:59.230> stuff<00:03:59.470> I'm<00:04:00.280> gonna<00:04:00.519> have<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.790> rebleed

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
the new stuff I'm gonna have to rebleed

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.180 
the new stuff I'm gonna have to rebleed
at<00:04:01.360> least<00:04:01.540> this<00:04:01.959> corner<00:04:02.290> because<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:02.680> had<00:04:03.070> to

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
at least this corner because I had to

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.100 
at least this corner because I had to
push<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:04.150> dual<00:04:05.049> Pistons<00:04:05.560> back<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:06.430> I<00:04:07.110> was

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
push the dual Pistons back and I was

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.470 
push the dual Pistons back and I was
trying<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.470> do<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.709> without<00:04:09.000> taking<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.239> clips

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
trying to do it without taking the clips

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.900 
trying to do it without taking the clips
out<00:04:10.630> here<00:04:11.380> because<00:04:11.799> these<00:04:11.920> are<00:04:11.980> really<00:04:12.700> tricky

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
out here because these are really tricky

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.280 
out here because these are really tricky
to<00:04:13.030> get<00:04:13.120> back<00:04:13.269> in<00:04:13.450> but<00:04:13.660> because<00:04:13.930> they're

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
to get back in but because they're

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.289 
to get back in but because they're
they've<00:04:14.829> been<00:04:15.010> in<00:04:15.130> there<00:04:15.280> for<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.519> few<00:04:15.579> thousand

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
they've been in there for a few thousand

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.400 
they've been in there for a few thousand
miles<00:04:16.419> now<00:04:16.750> um

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
miles now um

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.350 
miles now um
because<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.340> changed<00:04:19.640> his<00:04:19.730> caliper<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.150> little

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
because I changed his caliper a little

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.860 
because I changed his caliper a little
while<00:04:20.450> ago<00:04:21.490> they're<00:04:22.490> embedded<00:04:23.330> now<00:04:23.630> so

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
while ago they're embedded now so

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.090 
while ago they're embedded now so
they're<00:04:24.050> not<00:04:24.140> as<00:04:24.290> bad<00:04:24.500> as<00:04:24.620> they<00:04:24.770> were<00:04:24.920> when

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
they're not as bad as they were when

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.030 
they're not as bad as they were when
they<00:04:25.190> were<00:04:25.310> new<00:04:25.520> so<00:04:26.090> I<00:04:26.360> end<00:04:26.510> up<00:04:26.770> breaking<00:04:27.770> the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
they were new so I end up breaking the

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.340 
they were new so I end up breaking the
bleed<00:04:28.220> screw<00:04:28.430> open<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.150> here<00:04:29.600> just<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:29.990> push<00:04:30.230> the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
bleed screw open I here just to push the

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.310 
bleed screw open I here just to push the
Pistons<00:04:30.740> back<00:04:30.920> so<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.190> could<00:04:31.370> get<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> calipers

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
Pistons back so I could get the calipers

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.690 
Pistons back so I could get the calipers
so<00:04:33.320> they<00:04:33.440> get<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.800> Pistons<00:04:34.130> back<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:34.460> they<00:04:34.580> get

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
so they get the Pistons back so they get

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.850 
so they get the Pistons back so they get
the<00:04:34.820> pads<00:04:35.030> in<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:35.570> get<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.200> pads<00:04:36.440> around<00:04:36.590> the

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
the pads in and get the pads around the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.920 
the pads in and get the pads around the
rotor<00:04:37.060> because<00:04:38.060> they<00:04:38.210> obviously<00:04:38.360> had<00:04:38.720> a<00:04:38.750> lot

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
rotor because they obviously had a lot

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.810 
rotor because they obviously had a lot
more<00:04:38.960> meat<00:04:39.320> so<00:04:39.710> hopefully<00:04:40.520> this<00:04:40.640> will<00:04:40.760> help

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
more meat so hopefully this will help

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.760 
more meat so hopefully this will help
the<00:04:41.090> truck<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.510> stop<00:04:42.080> better<00:04:42.290> I've<00:04:42.470> got<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.680> do

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
the truck to stop better I've got to do

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.710 
the truck to stop better I've got to do
the<00:04:42.860> other<00:04:42.980> side<00:04:43.280> yet<00:04:43.520> all<00:04:44.240> right<00:04:44.390> so<00:04:44.600> we're

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
the other side yet all right so we're

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
the other side yet all right so we're
pretty<00:04:44.840> much<00:04:44.960> going<00:04:45.140> to<00:04:45.230> do<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.380> same<00:04:45.560> thing

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
pretty much going to do the same thing

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.760 
pretty much going to do the same thing
to<00:04:45.830> this<00:04:45.950> side<00:04:46.010> take<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.640> tire<00:04:46.820> off<00:04:47.650> take<00:04:48.650> the
