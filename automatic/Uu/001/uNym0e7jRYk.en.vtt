00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.570
 hello now let's prepare the aiolÃ¬ sauce 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.060
 or ions as you prefer 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.750
 the ingredients are pepper mayonnaise 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.810
 white and finely chopped garlic up to 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.020
 knife or by status in a mortar 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.169
 then we take garlic and go to 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.290
 finely chop it first operation for 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.300
 help you chop mash it in 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.649
 this way with the knife blade 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.559
 so it then remains easier for you to chop it 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:47.579
 then create small of the small 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.570
 filanci in this way 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.449
 in the other sense it is a piece of advice 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.059
 do not use the crescent do more 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.579
 effort learn to use the knife 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.309
 this type of knife is called 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.460
 cutting and it is an exceptional knife 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.740
 who in the kitchens now who has a bit of 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.700
 passion to cook can no longer miss 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.230
 see that you will do much sooner and the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:21.340
 product will definitely be even better 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:24.579
 very good when it will be discreetly 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.820
 shouted an operation that you can 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:31.090
 help and it's easy to take the blade of the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.390
 knife with the blade facing inward 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.850
 and press the yo doing 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.740
 sliding the knife is like us 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.259
 we went to crush the garlic because 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.009
 you know that there is also a 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:52.119
 appliance that serves to crush 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.880
 garlic and only the sauce comes out 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.979
 I wouldn't use this thing because the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.799
 very small piece of garlic 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.560
 finely and beautiful to hear them meanwhile 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:07.179
 the joly ohio sauce can be alone 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.869
 eaten by those who love garlic otherwise 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.400
 He can not 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.940
 we have created almost a pure and we go 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.480
 to incorporate it into mayonnaise 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.480
 in this way 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:34.060
 so let 's take the pepper and grind it 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.000
 we mix the whole together the quantity 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.080
 of pepper and garlic obviously a 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.080
 your discretion 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.379
 I love both pepper and garlic therefore 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:51.190
 I go quiet you will see the sauce myself 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.180
