00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
knife and it's my biggest pet peeve when

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.309 
knife and it's my biggest pet peeve when
I'm<00:01:42.579> buying<00:01:42.789> knives<00:01:43.119> is<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:43.810> fact<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.109> there

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
I'm buying knives is the fact that there

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.399 
I'm buying knives is the fact that there
is<00:01:44.469> no<00:01:44.920> wiggle<00:01:45.749> between<00:01:46.749> the<00:01:46.869> blade<00:01:47.079> and<00:01:47.109> the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
is no wiggle between the blade and the

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.010 
is no wiggle between the blade and the
handle<00:01:47.590> itself<00:01:48.219> which<00:01:49.149> is<00:01:49.329> very<00:01:49.509> key<00:01:49.749> for<00:01:49.929> me

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
handle itself which is very key for me

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.069 
handle itself which is very key for me
and<00:01:50.349> I'm<00:01:50.709> very<00:01:50.740> picky<00:01:51.249> when<00:01:51.369> it<00:01:51.429> comes<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.789> that

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
and I'm very picky when it comes to that

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.789 
and I'm very picky when it comes to that
so<00:01:53.079> that's<00:01:53.259> a<00:01:53.380> very<00:01:53.679> big<00:01:53.859> plus<00:01:54.359> now<00:01:55.799> there

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
so that's a very big plus now there

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.289 
so that's a very big plus now there
really<00:01:57.009> isn't<00:01:57.219> much<00:01:57.459> else<00:01:57.639> to<00:01:57.729> say<00:01:57.939> about<00:01:57.969> this

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
really isn't much else to say about this

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.690 
really isn't much else to say about this
