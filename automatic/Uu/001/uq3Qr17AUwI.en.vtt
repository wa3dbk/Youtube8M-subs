00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.660

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.970

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.119
 whole milk cup four slices of 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.449
 mold bread cacao sugar cream and 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.060
 ground cinnamon as we always do 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.800
 a space of the table we take the cup 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.020
 of milk and with a spoonful of the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.170
 small coffee we are going to throw two 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:37.190
 teaspoons of sugar a little bit of 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.530
 cinnamon and with film we cover and what 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.889
 let's put the micro now once 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.949
 past the time passed the time we remove 

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:48.379
 the paper and with a spoon we dissolve the 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.079
 sugar or we can one plate once 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.999
 dissolved and we add it to the plate we are 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.620
 doing the following we put paper 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:01:00.170
 absorbent we take a slice of bread the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.490
 we leave here a moment and here the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.860
 we put 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.480
 upside down and putting down what 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.090
 is doing is working the milk and going 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.310
 soaking all the bread always with the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.260
 face that had soaked up a 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.540
 Once well soaked with milk we take the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.030
 cocoa cream and we will add a 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.280
 spoon to each one and that is of this 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.530
 way that does not happen to the other half and 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.380
 Now what we do with this peak is 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.280
 taking it here and we would have the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.960
 first made like this with all the rest 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.640
 what do you want to take a quantity of 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.530
 Cocoa cream you throw more than you 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.009
 you want to take less than to throw less 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.619
 already to the taste of the consumer we put a 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.900
 pan to the fire and we give maximum 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.229
 power and once the egg is beaten 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.540
 we place a plate with blotting paper and 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.880
 let's go frying the torrijas go 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.630
 catching from a moon we both pray for 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.500
 the egg and very carefully we throw it 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.500
 in the oil 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.880
 when it is golden on one side we give it 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.880
 the turn 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.360
 we adore her for putting her on paper 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.650
 blotting once we have all the things 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.680
 ready made 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:15.130
 we add 4 large heaping tablespoons of 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.170
 sugar and another bit of cinnamon what 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.770
 we mix well and now what we're going 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:25.000
 to follow is passing them around here like this 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:30.970
 all and only will be left to place on top 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.590
 a little yogurt with the spoon and 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.880
 Now for you to see what it is about 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.880
 this is going to make a cut 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.040
 and you will see the result 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.630
 of all the chocolate inside cuddled 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.099

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.870
