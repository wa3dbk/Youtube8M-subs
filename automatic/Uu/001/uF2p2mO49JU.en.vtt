and dust support longevity but with Jose

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.040 
and dust support longevity but with Jose
who<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.219> get<00:00:59.460> not<00:01:00.090> only<00:01:00.359> very<00:01:00.629> similar

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
who you get not only very similar

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.139 
who you get not only very similar
components<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.039> resveratrol<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.969> get<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
components to resveratrol but you get a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.039 
components to resveratrol but you get a
whole<00:01:03.510> host<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.140> other<00:01:04.320> benefits

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
whole host of other benefits

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.480 
whole host of other benefits
specifically<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.380> ho<00:01:07.590> Shu<00:01:07.799> whose<00:01:07.950> ability

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
specifically like ho Shu whose ability

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.359 
specifically like ho Shu whose ability
to<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:08.970> boost<00:01:09.409> superoxide<00:01:10.409> dismutase<00:01:10.439> as

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
to really boost superoxide dismutase as

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.260 
to really boost superoxide dismutase as
well<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.390> slow<00:01:12.780> down<00:01:13.049> lipo<00:01:13.860> para<00:01:14.490> oxidation

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
well as to slow down lipo para oxidation

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.450 
well as to slow down lipo para oxidation
which<00:01:15.869> basically<00:01:16.200> means<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.710> ho<00:01:16.979> Shu<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
which basically means that ho Shu is a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.840 
which basically means that ho Shu is a
very<00:01:17.670> potent<00:01:18.180> antioxidant<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.580> top<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
very potent antioxidant on top of that

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
very potent antioxidant on top of that
ho<00:01:21.090> Shu<00:01:21.299> has<00:01:21.509> been<00:01:21.689> shown<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> potent<00:01:22.770> MAO

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
ho Shu has been shown to be a potent MAO

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.999 
ho Shu has been shown to be a potent MAO
inhibitor<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.180> what<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.290> means<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.799> this

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
inhibitor and what that means is this

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.090 
inhibitor and what that means is this
mao<00:01:26.970> stands<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.570> monoamine<00:01:28.200> oxidase<00:01:28.229> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
mao stands for monoamine oxidase and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.130 
mao stands for monoamine oxidase and
essentially<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.210> an<00:01:30.509> enzyme<00:01:30.930> in

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
essentially what this is is an enzyme in

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.520 
essentially what this is is an enzyme in
our<00:01:31.229> body<00:01:31.560> which<00:01:32.189> functions<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:33.140> recycle<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
our body which functions to recycle and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.950 
our body which functions to recycle and
break<00:01:34.829> down<00:01:35.270> neurotransmitters<00:01:36.270> things<00:01:36.780> like

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
break down neurotransmitters things like

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.530 
break down neurotransmitters things like
serotonin<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.890> dopamine<00:01:38.030> more<00:01:39.030> or<00:01:39.119> less<00:01:39.299> our

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
serotonin and dopamine more or less our

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.679 
serotonin and dopamine more or less our
youth<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.170> feel-good<00:01:40.799> hormones<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.689> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
youth or feel-good hormones and the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.830 
youth or feel-good hormones and the
aging<00:01:43.049> process<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.860> some<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.970> some<00:01:45.240> circles<00:01:45.659> in

aging process in some in some circles in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.569 
aging process in some in some circles in
some<00:01:46.049> theories<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.619> has<00:01:46.920> highly<00:01:47.430> been

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
some theories it has highly been

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.480 
some theories it has highly been
correlated<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.740> process<00:01:50.280> of

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
correlated to the the process of

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.389 
correlated to the the process of
monoamine<00:01:51.030> oxidase<00:01:51.320> meaning<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.829> age<00:01:53.070> our

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
monoamine oxidase meaning as we age our

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.209 
monoamine oxidase meaning as we age our
ability<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.149> inhibit<00:01:55.189> monoamine<00:01:56.189> oxidase

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
ability to inhibit monoamine oxidase

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.670 
ability to inhibit monoamine oxidase
becomes<00:01:57.180> diminished<00:01:57.360> thus<00:01:58.229> our<00:01:58.409> youth

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
becomes diminished thus our youth

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.440 
becomes diminished thus our youth
hormones<00:01:59.130> decrease<00:01:59.369> thus<00:01:59.880> our<00:02:00.149> feel-good

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
hormones decrease thus our feel-good

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.139 
hormones decrease thus our feel-good
neurotransmitters<00:02:01.409> decrease<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:02.969> want

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
neurotransmitters decrease so if we want

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.940 
neurotransmitters decrease so if we want
to<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.360> potent<00:02:03.810> anti-aging<00:02:04.110> strategy<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to have a potent anti-aging strategy a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.850 
to have a potent anti-aging strategy a
potent<00:02:05.570> longevity<00:02:06.570> rejuvenation<00:02:07.409> strategy

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
potent longevity rejuvenation strategy

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.100 
potent longevity rejuvenation strategy
then<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:08.459> should<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:09.000> look<00:02:09.720> at<00:02:09.929> this

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
then we should really look at this

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.140 
then we should really look at this
capability<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:11.009> really<00:02:11.250> keep<00:02:11.520> monoamine

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
capability and really keep monoamine

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.100 
capability and really keep monoamine
oxidase

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
oxidase

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.960 
oxidase
check<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:13.770> we<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:14.010> then<00:02:14.160> have<00:02:14.340> more<00:02:14.610> serotonin

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
check so we can then have more serotonin

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.510 
check so we can then have more serotonin
more<00:02:15.480> dopamine<00:02:15.840> or<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.860> growth<00:02:17.070> hormones

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
more dopamine or the growth hormones

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.130 
more dopamine or the growth hormones
more<00:02:17.820> of<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.030> youth<00:02:18.240> hormones<00:02:18.720> circulating

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
more of the youth hormones circulating

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.880 
more of the youth hormones circulating
in<00:02:19.470> our<00:02:19.560> body<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:21.180> there's<00:02:22.140> one<00:02:22.410> other<00:02:22.440> thing

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
in our body so there's one other thing

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.590 
in our body so there's one other thing
that<00:02:22.920> really<00:02:23.310> makes<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:23.730> herb<00:02:23.940> super<00:02:24.360> famous

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
that really makes this herb super famous

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.630 
that really makes this herb super famous
and<00:02:24.930> really<00:02:25.470> where<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.800> herb<00:02:25.950> gets<00:02:26.220> its<00:02:26.400> name

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and really where the herb gets its name

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.610 
and really where the herb gets its name
that's<00:02:27.240> essentially<00:02:27.720> referring<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.380> its

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
that's essentially referring to its

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.460 
that's essentially referring to its
ability<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:30.270> able<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.630> slow<00:02:31.050> down<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
ability to be able to slow down the
