don't know we'll figure out purchasing
new<00:01:11.100> software<00:01:11.490> later<00:01:11.790> because<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.090> might<00:01:12.270> still

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
new software later because I might still

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.210 
new software later because I might still
check<00:01:12.960> out<00:01:13.110> Fantasia

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
childhood which is almost certainly a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.430 
childhood which is almost certainly a
bad<00:01:34.610> sign<00:01:35.000> because<00:01:35.330> you<00:01:35.930> know<00:01:36.020> what<00:01:36.170> helps<00:01:36.260> you

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
bad sign because you know what helps you

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.260 
bad sign because you know what helps you
remember<00:01:36.590> things<00:01:37.180> repetition<00:01:38.180> but<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:41.060> far

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
remember things repetition but so far

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.930

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
it's going pretty well now i'm not sure

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.190 
it's going pretty well now i'm not sure
if<00:01:44.060> you<00:01:44.180> can<00:01:44.210> jump<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.690> your<00:01:44.750> full<00:01:45.020> height

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
if you can jump to your full height

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.850 
if you can jump to your full height
there<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.590> knock<00:01:45.740> at<00:01:45.890> those<00:01:46.100> spikes<00:01:50.560> but<00:01:51.560> i'm

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
there and knock at those spikes but i'm

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.200 
there and knock at those spikes but i'm
not<00:01:52.100> keen<00:01:52.400> on<00:01:52.550> finding<00:01:52.760> them<00:01:53.060> now<00:01:54.250> all<00:01:55.250> right

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:07.930 

oh<00:02:04.030> come<00:02:05.030> on<00:02:05.240> there<00:02:05.750> we<00:02:05.900> go<00:02:06.460> these<00:02:07.460> guys<00:02:07.670> I

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
oh come on there we go these guys I

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.460 
oh come on there we go these guys I
don't<00:02:08.179> think<00:02:08.270> there's<00:02:08.660> any<00:02:08.810> right<00:02:09.050> like<00:02:09.350> I

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
don't think there's any right like I

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.760 
don't think there's any right like I
think<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.800> tempo<00:02:10.130> varies<00:02:10.550> somewhat<00:02:10.970> so

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
think the tempo varies somewhat so

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.000 
think the tempo varies somewhat so
there's<00:02:12.770> no<00:02:12.890> easy<00:02:13.069> way<00:02:13.160> gaming<00:02:13.670> oh<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.270> hey

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
there's no easy way gaming oh and hey

no<00:02:24.230> more<00:02:24.440> energy<00:02:24.590> tanks<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.030> wire

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
no more energy tanks so this is the wire

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.000 
no more energy tanks so this is the wire
it's<00:02:26.690> pretty<00:02:26.930> cool<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.410> can't<00:02:27.650> turn<00:02:27.830> around

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010

rush<00:02:41.690> Marie<00:02:43.390> hey<00:02:44.390> why<00:02:44.600> not

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.560 

all<00:02:53.520> right<00:02:53.700> now<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.240> part<00:02:54.330> that's

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
all right now this is the part that's

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.120 
all right now this is the part that's
actually<00:02:55.080> super<00:02:55.410> hard<00:02:55.650> because<00:02:55.830> as<00:02:56.100> he

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
actually super hard because as he

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.450 
actually super hard because as he
approached<00:02:56.610> those<00:02:57.380> they<00:02:58.380> grow<00:02:58.740> up<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.920> rock<00:02:59.160> on

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
approached those they grow up a rock on

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.550 
approached those they grow up a rock on
you<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:02.480> if<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.660> back<00:03:03.870> off<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.260> just<00:03:04.410> keep

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
you and if you back off it just keep

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.380 
you and if you back off it just keep
spawning<00:03:04.800> more<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.280> more<00:03:05.460> of<00:03:05.490> them<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:06.060> on

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390

this<00:03:07.260> playthrough<00:03:07.620> just<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.520> few<00:03:08.700> moments

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
this playthrough just a few moments

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.140 
this playthrough just a few moments
earlier<00:03:09.540> today<00:03:10.050> I<00:03:10.470> got<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.370> idea<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.670> do<00:03:11.850> ferro

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
earlier today I got the idea to do ferro

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.850 
earlier today I got the idea to do ferro
shot<00:03:12.450> which<00:03:12.630> is<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.960> guess<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.140> pretty<00:03:13.440> obvious

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
shot which is I guess a pretty obvious

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.910 
shot which is I guess a pretty obvious
idea<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:14.520> maybe<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:14.940> even<00:03:15.450> have<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:15.840> as<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.020> kid<00:03:17.180> I

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
idea and maybe I even have it as a kid I

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.590 
idea and maybe I even have it as a kid I
don't<00:03:19.920> remember<00:03:20.070> doing<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.790> though<00:03:21.030> but<00:03:21.540> I

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
don't remember doing it though but I

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.280 
don't remember doing it though but I
mean<00:03:22.760> there<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:23.970> go<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.690> makes<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.020> stage

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
mean there we go it just makes the stage

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.850 
mean there we go it just makes the stage
significantly<00:03:26.250> easier<00:03:30.290> one<00:03:31.290> other<00:03:31.380> thing<00:03:31.500> if

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
significantly easier one other thing if

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.440 
significantly easier one other thing if
you<00:03:31.980> don't<00:03:32.220> hit<00:03:32.400> those<00:03:32.550> switches<00:03:32.880> they're<00:03:33.330> not

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
you don't hit those switches they're not

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.330 
you don't hit those switches they're not
like<00:03:33.510> lights<00:03:34.080> in<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.380> mine<00:03:34.620> shaft<00:03:34.650> because<00:03:35.130> it

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
like lights in a mine shaft because it

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.970 
like lights in a mine shaft because it
seems<00:03:35.520> like<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.670> bit<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:36.000> mineshaft<00:03:36.540> stage

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
seems like a bit of a mineshaft stage

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.450 
seems like a bit of a mineshaft stage

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
they make the ground actually appear so

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.770 
they make the ground actually appear so
you<00:03:50.090> will<00:03:50.390> die<00:03:50.690> if<00:03:51.050> you<00:03:51.080> don't<00:03:52.570> flip<00:03:53.570> those
