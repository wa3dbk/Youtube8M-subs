00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.359
 exactly 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.359

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:23.939
 in water 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.269

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.419
 we'll say on the screen for the most rated hard-aware 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.419
 then 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.090
 5 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.140

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.600
 3 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.450

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.450
 there were three seconds in the world catching 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.380
 then 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.780
 now 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.830
 We have 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.930
 delaine delegate three seconds and we have 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.770
 easy layers it closes the pointer 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.940

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.940
 Okay 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.490

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.630
 for capturing this window as if to see it 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.290

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.540
 We have 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.750
 capture 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.750
 this letter 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.670
 so the 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.670
 we did to capture the file browser 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.940
 see far 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.280
