looks like once you put all the parts
together<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.000> basically<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.539> huge

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870

itself which is obviously that unit
right<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:30.210> total<00:01:30.810> there's<00:01:31.409> five<00:01:31.890> rows

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
right there in total there's five rows

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.740 
right there in total there's five rows
of<00:01:32.689> LEDs<00:01:33.689> three<00:01:34.470> rows<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.979> white<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.030> two<00:01:36.570> of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
months warranty so let's just have a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.429 
months warranty so let's just have a
quick<00:01:58.770> look<00:01:58.829> at<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.640> actual<00:02:00.270> frame<00:02:00.960> itself

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
quick look at the actual frame itself

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.440 
quick look at the actual frame itself
and<00:02:01.770> then<00:02:02.430> I'll<00:02:02.640> show<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.909> guys<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.930> lighting

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
and then I'll show you guys the lighting

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.779 
and then I'll show you guys the lighting
so<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> actual<00:02:06.659> top<00:02:06.990> race<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.550> side

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
so the actual top race and the side

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.960 
so the actual top race and the side
brace<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.270> clipping<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:10.229> each<00:02:10.950> corner<00:02:11.250> using

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
brace is clipping on each corner using

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.890 
brace is clipping on each corner using
these<00:02:12.090> plastic<00:02:12.599> thick

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
these plastic thick

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.809 
these plastic thick
just<00:02:13.079> and<00:02:13.319> then<00:02:13.560> screw<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:13.980> two<00:02:14.099> places<00:02:14.310> and

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
just and then screw in two places and

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.940 
just and then screw in two places and
these<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.480> plastic<00:02:16.230> screws<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.709> are<00:02:16.769> heavy

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
these like plastic screws that are heavy

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.160 
these like plastic screws that are heavy
duty<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:18.150> he<00:02:18.269> just<00:02:18.420> pushed<00:02:18.599> them<00:02:18.720> all<00:02:18.840> up<00:02:18.989> all

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
duty and he just pushed them all up all

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.589 
duty and he just pushed them all up all
the<00:02:19.260> way<00:02:19.379> in<00:02:19.560> basically<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:21.239> it's<00:02:21.390> all<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.569> way

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
the way in basically so it's all the way

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.420 
the way in basically so it's all the way
into<00:02:21.900> there<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.709> all<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.829> way<00:02:22.920> up<00:02:23.159> and<00:02:23.280> then

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
into there and all the way up and then

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.280 
into there and all the way up and then
you<00:02:23.489> just<00:02:23.640> tie<00:02:23.819> them<00:02:23.970> all<00:02:24.120> up<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.450> same<00:02:25.079> with<00:02:25.110> a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
you just tie them all up and same with a

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.050 
you just tie them all up and same with a
mounting<00:02:25.739> bracket<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.879> bit<00:02:27.030> that

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
mounting bracket this is the bit that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.589 
mounting bracket this is the bit that
actually<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:28.439> glass<00:02:28.680> will<00:02:29.359> fit<00:02:30.359> underneath

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
actually the glass will fit underneath

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.970 
actually the glass will fit underneath
all<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.109> will<00:02:31.260> put<00:02:31.379> it<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.650> top<00:02:31.769> of<00:02:31.829> it

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
all this will put it on top of it

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.710 
all this will put it on top of it
basically<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:33.299> then<00:02:33.420> also<00:02:34.010> screwing<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.720> GQ

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
basically and then also screwing in GQ

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.929 
basically and then also screwing in GQ
pair<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.140> secure<00:02:37.409> it<00:02:37.530> into<00:02:37.650> place<00:02:37.939> and

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
pair to secure it into place and

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.020 
pair to secure it into place and
obviously<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.079> same<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.319> this<00:02:40.650> side<00:02:41.030> now

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
obviously the the same on this side now

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.399 
obviously the the same on this side now
this<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.659> the<00:02:42.780> actual<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.560> hanging<00:02:44.430> mechanism

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
this is the actual the hanging mechanism

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.530 
this is the actual the hanging mechanism
it's<00:02:46.409> a<00:02:46.500> wire<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.069> if<00:02:47.879> you<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:48.180> press<00:02:48.359> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
it's a wire and if you just press the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.110 
it's a wire and if you just press the
top<00:02:48.750> here<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.560> basically<00:02:49.829> so<00:02:50.700> just<00:02:50.940> here

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
top here you can basically so just here

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.309 
top here you can basically so just here
it<00:02:51.659> will<00:02:51.930> increase<00:02:52.560> sir<00:02:53.480> or<00:02:54.480> bait<00:02:54.840> lower<00:02:55.170> it

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
it will increase sir or bait lower it

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.860 
it will increase sir or bait lower it
down<00:02:55.349> I<00:02:55.530> just<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:56.010> really<00:02:56.340> more<00:02:56.489> than<00:02:56.579> anything

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
down I just so really more than anything

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.729 
down I just so really more than anything
these<00:02:57.870> bits<00:02:58.200> here<00:02:58.290> are<00:02:58.709> they<00:02:59.519> are<00:02:59.670> screwed<00:03:00.000> on

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
these bits here are they are screwed on

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.020 
these bits here are they are screwed on
so<00:03:01.739> basting<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.310> put<00:03:02.430> into<00:03:02.549> place<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.970> then

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
so basting to put into place and then

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.030 
so basting to put into place and then
just<00:03:03.299> tighten<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.049> keep<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.409> firm<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.799> place

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
just tighten it so keep it firm in place

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.300 
just tighten it so keep it firm in place
these<00:03:06.030> are<00:03:06.299> adjustable<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.859> they<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:08.099> slide

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
these are adjustable so they can slide

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.610 
these are adjustable so they can slide
just<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:09.329> best<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.840> put<00:03:10.230> them<00:03:10.319> into<00:03:10.439> position

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
just it's best to put them into position

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.259 
just it's best to put them into position
before<00:03:11.010> putting<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.519> light<00:03:11.639> you<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:11.879> just<00:03:12.150> in

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
before putting the light you on just in

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.449 
before putting the light you on just in
case<00:03:12.439> you<00:03:13.439> don't<00:03:13.560> want<00:03:13.739> any<00:03:13.859> heavy<00:03:14.069> scratches

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
case you don't want any heavy scratches

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.869 
case you don't want any heavy scratches
or<00:03:14.700> anything<00:03:14.730> from<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.540> actual<00:03:16.790> from<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
or anything from the actual from the

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.369 
or anything from the actual from the
spit<00:03:18.090> basically<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.660> there<00:03:19.019> are<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
spit basically and there are the

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.720 
spit basically and there are the
external<00:03:19.739> ballast<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.519> mentioned

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
external ballast that I mentioned

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.770 
external ballast that I mentioned
earlier<00:03:20.970> now<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.750> left<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:24.030> wire<00:03:24.299> on<00:03:24.540> is

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
earlier now I left the the wire on is

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.170 
earlier now I left the the wire on is
the<00:03:24.900> CD<00:03:25.109> just<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.560> show<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.739> guys<00:03:25.859> how<00:03:26.280> long<00:03:26.669> it

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
the CD just to show you guys how long it

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.099 
the CD just to show you guys how long it
is<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.599> now<00:03:27.989> LED<00:03:28.500> lighting<00:03:29.069> is<00:03:29.930> it's<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.989> bit

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
is so now LED lighting is it's a bit

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.000 
is so now LED lighting is it's a bit
costly<00:03:31.560> in<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.609> afferent<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.650> know<00:03:34.739> in

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
costly in the afferent but you know in

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.379 
costly in the afferent but you know in
the<00:03:35.040> long<00:03:35.340> run<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.849> can<00:03:36.060> save<00:03:36.359> you

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
the long run it can save you

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.270 
the long run it can save you
considerable<00:03:36.780> amounts<00:03:37.349> of<00:03:37.440> money<00:03:37.590> because

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
considerable amounts of money because

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.020 
considerable amounts of money because
obviously<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.760> lifespan<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.209> LED<00:03:40.220> units<00:03:41.220> on

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
obviously the lifespan of LED units on

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.520 
obviously the lifespan of LED units on
credible<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.720> mean<00:03:42.900> you're<00:03:43.049> looking<00:03:43.260> for<00:03:43.379> years

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
credible I mean you're looking for years

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.599 
credible I mean you're looking for years
and<00:03:43.650> years<00:03:43.709> before<00:03:44.099> you<00:03:44.190> need<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.400> change

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
and years before you need to change

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.409 
and years before you need to change
anything<00:03:44.940> out<00:03:45.409> regarding<00:03:46.409> no<00:03:46.949> t<00:03:47.250> 5<00:03:47.459> bowls<00:03:48.150> and

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
anything out regarding no t 5 bowls and

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.699 
anything out regarding no t 5 bowls and
stuff<00:03:48.479> you<00:03:48.659> changing<00:03:49.079> probably<00:03:49.349> every<00:03:49.500> six

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
stuff you changing probably every six

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.649 
stuff you changing probably every six
months<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:50.190> there<00:03:50.609> isn't<00:03:50.790> money<00:03:50.879> to<00:03:51.060> say<00:03:51.269> but

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
months so there isn't money to say but

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:52.969 
months so there isn't money to say but
you<00:03:51.750> just<00:03:51.900> got<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.109> fork<00:03:52.530> out<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.709> bit<00:03:52.859> more

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
you just got to fork out a bit more

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.189 
you just got to fork out a bit more
money<00:03:53.190> in<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.449> beginning<00:03:54.930> when<00:03:55.079> you

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
money in the in the beginning when you

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.589 
money in the in the beginning when you
buy<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.440> LED<00:03:55.949> unit<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.940> let's<00:03:57.120> flip<00:03:57.329> this<00:03:57.359> over

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
buy the LED unit so let's flip this over

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.750 
buy the LED unit so let's flip this over
I'll<00:03:58.049> plug<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.440> in<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:59.010> we'll<00:03:59.190> have<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> look<00:03:59.609> at

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
I'll plug it in and we'll have a look at

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.849 
I'll plug it in and we'll have a look at
the<00:03:59.909> the<00:03:59.940> whites<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.139> blues<00:04:01.379> all<00:04:01.650> turned

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
the the whites and the blues all turned

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.490 
the the whites and the blues all turned
on<00:04:02.069> so<00:04:02.819> now<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.000> unit<00:04:03.389> is<00:04:03.540> flipped<00:04:04.079> over<00:04:04.229> you

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
on so now the unit is flipped over you

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.430 
on so now the unit is flipped over you
can<00:04:04.680> see<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.919> five<00:04:05.099> rows<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.579> LEDs<00:04:06.030> and

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
can see the five rows of LEDs and

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.909 
can see the five rows of LEDs and
covering<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.590> LEDs<00:04:07.949> is<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.310> perp<00:04:08.849> x<00:04:09.919> sheeting

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
covering the LEDs is a perp x sheeting

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.610 
covering the LEDs is a perp x sheeting
like<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.790> drip<00:04:12.090> tray<00:04:12.120> stops<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:13.019> conversation

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
like a drip tray stops a conversation

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.319 
like a drip tray stops a conversation
get<00:04:13.739> into<00:04:13.889> leds<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.340> any<00:04:14.669> splash<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.150> water

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
get into leds and any splash of water

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.960 
get into leds and any splash of water
get<00:04:15.659> inside<00:04:15.989> as<00:04:16.169> well<00:04:16.250> so<00:04:17.250> what<00:04:17.400> I'll<00:04:17.519> do<00:04:17.669> first

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
get inside as well so what I'll do first

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.839 
get inside as well so what I'll do first
i'll<00:04:18.389> turn<00:04:18.720> on<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.049> whites<00:04:19.289> and<00:04:20.190> then<00:04:20.579> we<00:04:20.699> will

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
i'll turn on the whites and then we will

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:29.340 
i'll turn on the whites and then we will
have<00:04:20.969> a<00:04:21.029> look<00:04:21.239> at<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.479> blue

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.469 

you<00:04:30.350> just<00:04:30.560> adjust<00:04:30.680> that<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.400> there's<00:04:32.120> actual

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
you just adjust that so there's actual

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.010 
you just adjust that so there's actual
three<00:04:32.780> switches<00:04:33.199> on<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:34.070> side<00:04:34.430> of<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.900> actual

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
three switches on the side of the actual

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.840 
three switches on the side of the actual
unit<00:04:36.530> three<00:04:36.800> independence<00:04:37.310> which<00:04:37.490> is<00:04:37.669> one

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
unit three independence which is one

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.060 
unit three independence which is one
controls<00:04:38.210> one<00:04:38.479> strip<00:04:39.380> which<00:04:39.650> is<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.860> middle

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
controls one strip which is the middle

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.560 
controls one strip which is the middle
strip<00:04:40.250> here<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.610> white<00:04:40.790> and<00:04:41.210> next<00:04:41.449> one

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
strip here the white and next one

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.240 
strip here the white and next one
controls<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.169> next<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.680> which<00:04:42.860> I'll<00:04:43.040> show<00:04:43.190> you

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
controls the next to which I'll show you

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:51.310 
controls the next to which I'll show you
now<00:04:47.949> keep<00:04:48.949> it<00:04:49.070> just<00:04:49.220> in<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:50.630> light<00:04:50.810> so<00:04:51.169> it's

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
now keep it just in the light so it's

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.740 
now keep it just in the light so it's
not<00:04:51.410> too<00:04:51.590> bright<00:04:51.889> on<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.130> camera<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:53.570> that's

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
not too bright on the camera so that's

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.090 
not too bright on the camera so that's
where<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.930> three<00:04:54.139> White's<00:04:54.320> turned<00:04:54.680> on<00:04:54.860> and

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
where the three White's turned on and

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.770 
where the three White's turned on and
that's<00:04:55.190> two<00:04:55.490> switches<00:04:55.940> being<00:04:56.150> turned<00:04:56.389> on<00:04:56.539> and

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
that's two switches being turned on and

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:05.450 
that's two switches being turned on and
that's<00:04:56.900> turn<00:04:57.229> on<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:57.440> blue

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.260

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
you can see it goes white blue white

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.339 
you can see it goes white blue white
blue<00:05:09.660> white<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:11.930> you<00:05:12.930> can<00:05:13.080> just<00:05:13.289> take<00:05:13.410> thee

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
blue white and you can just take thee

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.629 
blue white and you can just take thee

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
see how your moon-like effect as well as

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.129 
see how your moon-like effect as well as
a<00:05:17.729> soft<00:05:17.970> corals<00:05:18.389> bringing<00:05:18.750> out<00:05:18.870> you<00:05:19.020> know

enhancing the colors and stuff like that

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.570 
enhancing the colors and stuff like that
as<00:05:20.729> well<00:05:21.800> so<00:05:22.800> let's<00:05:22.949> get<00:05:23.039> this<00:05:23.130> on<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.310> tank

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
as well so let's get this on the tank

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.100 
as well so let's get this on the tank
and<00:05:23.759> I'll<00:05:23.880> show<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.060> what<00:05:24.300> it<00:05:24.360> looks<00:05:24.419> like<00:05:24.630> by

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
and I'll show you what it looks like by

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.240 
and I'll show you what it looks like by
the<00:05:25.169> tank<00:05:25.470> with<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.710> different<00:05:26.039> lights

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
the tank with the different lights

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.930 
the tank with the different lights
turned<00:05:26.789> on<00:05:28.039> right<00:05:29.039> then<00:05:29.220> so<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.430> unit<00:05:29.699> is<00:05:29.789> back

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
turned on right then so the unit is back

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.390 
turned on right then so the unit is back
onto<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.449> tank<00:05:30.690> and<00:05:30.930> you<00:05:31.110> can<00:05:31.259> see<00:05:31.500> how<00:05:31.740> nice

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
onto the tank and you can see how nice

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.450 
onto the tank and you can see how nice
and<00:05:32.430> snug<00:05:32.970> it<00:05:33.150> fits<00:05:33.479> on<00:05:37.039> and<00:05:38.039> it's<00:05:38.190> basically

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
and snug it fits on and it's basically

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.749 
and snug it fits on and it's basically
just<00:05:38.699> placed<00:05:39.210> it<00:05:39.479> down<00:05:40.410> to<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:40.800> to<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.490> glass

on its securely into position now for

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.020 
on its securely into position now for
those<00:05:46.919> are<00:05:47.099> watch<00:05:47.190> my<00:05:47.340> video<00:05:47.639> she<00:05:47.699> obviously

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
those are watch my video she obviously

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.050 
those are watch my video she obviously
no<00:05:48.419> this<00:05:48.660> is<00:05:48.810> my<00:05:48.990> shelled<00:05:49.860> water<00:05:50.130> tank<00:05:50.400> I'm

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
no this is my shelled water tank I'm

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.610 
no this is my shelled water tank I'm
sort<00:05:51.300> of<00:05:51.330> a<00:05:51.419> see<00:05:51.570> it's<00:05:51.720> a<00:05:51.750> tropical<00:05:51.900> tank<00:05:52.410> and

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
sort of a see it's a tropical tank and

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.730 
sort of a see it's a tropical tank and
at<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.310> moment<00:05:53.460> I<00:05:53.699> have<00:05:53.729> all<00:05:54.150> strips<00:05:54.960> of<00:05:55.229> LEDs

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
at the moment I have all strips of LEDs

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.860 
at the moment I have all strips of LEDs
on<00:05:56.099> so<00:05:56.370> that's<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.669> three<00:05:56.940> white<00:05:57.210> and<00:05:57.479> the<00:05:57.690> two

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
on so that's the three white and the two

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.379 
on so that's the three white and the two
blue<00:05:58.199> so<00:05:59.039> what<00:05:59.159> I'll<00:05:59.280> do<00:05:59.520> I'll<00:05:59.849> start<00:06:00.150> turning

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
blue so what I'll do I'll start turning

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:08.710 
blue so what I'll do I'll start turning
them<00:06:00.479> off<00:06:00.830> first<00:06:01.830> I'll<00:06:02.039> turn<00:06:02.250> the<00:06:02.370> blues<00:06:02.550> off

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.120 

now<00:06:09.720> it's<00:06:09.960> just<00:06:10.139> got<00:06:10.349> the<00:06:10.470> whites<00:06:10.740> let<00:06:11.009> me

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
now it's just got the whites let me

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.510 
now it's just got the whites let me
adjust<00:06:11.220> adjust<00:06:11.520> the<00:06:11.789> camera<00:06:12.000> because<00:06:12.479> I'm

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
adjust adjust the camera because I'm

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.499 
adjust adjust the camera because I'm
mind<00:06:14.520> cameras<00:06:14.909> are<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.060> best<00:06:15.240> for<00:06:15.389> white

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
mind cameras are the best for white

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.760 
mind cameras are the best for white
balance<00:06:15.930> so<00:06:16.169> that<00:06:16.380> is<00:06:16.919> now<00:06:18.020> three<00:06:19.020> strips<00:06:19.530> of

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
balance so that is now three strips of

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.640 
balance so that is now three strips of
