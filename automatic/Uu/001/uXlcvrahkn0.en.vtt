slow<00:02:02.380> roll<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:02.770> like<00:02:03.729> I<00:02:03.849> said<00:02:04.060> that's<00:02:04.239> how<00:02:04.390> I

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
slow roll it like I said that's how I

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.900 
slow roll it like I said that's how I
usually<00:02:04.869> start<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.380> day<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.610> can<00:02:06.729> see
