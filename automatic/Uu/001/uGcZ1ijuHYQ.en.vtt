deflection<00:03:33.049> for<00:03:33.470> chicago<00:03:33.980> but<00:03:34.370> let's<00:03:34.519> see<00:03:34.640> if

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
deflection for chicago but let's see if

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.130 
deflection for chicago but let's see if
they<00:03:34.820> can<00:03:34.970> get<00:03:35.060> points<00:03:35.450> off<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.600> it<00:03:35.840> because

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
they can get points off of it because

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.070 
they can get points off of it because
every<00:03:36.709> single<00:03:37.040> one<00:03:37.190> I'll<00:03:37.400> turnovers<00:03:38.080> until

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
every single one I'll turnovers until

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.900 
every single one I'll turnovers until
that<00:03:39.290> one<00:03:39.470> right<00:03:39.620> there<00:03:39.860> has<00:03:40.010> led<00:03:40.280> two<00:03:40.519> points

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
that one right there has led two points

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.150 
that one right there has led two points
instant<00:03:41.600> points<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.560> they<00:03:42.709> don't<00:03:42.799> get<00:03:42.950> points

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
instant points so they don't get points

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.000 
instant points so they don't get points
off<00:03:43.400> of<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:44.390> means<00:03:44.600> nothing<00:03:45.049> late<00:03:45.769> in<00:03:45.950> the
