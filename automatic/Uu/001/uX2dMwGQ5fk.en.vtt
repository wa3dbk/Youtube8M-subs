out of stainless steel on top of that so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.400 
out of stainless steel on top of that so
the<00:00:57.030> easiest<00:00:57.300> way<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.840> sit<00:00:58.230> down<00:00:58.350> on

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
into the bottom of it once the legs are

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.420 
into the bottom of it once the legs are

the chainmail gloves on our hands it's

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.370 
the chainmail gloves on our hands it's
difficult<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.270> get<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.420> perfect<00:02:03.870> fit<00:02:03.900> out<00:02:04.260> of

on<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> surface<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.920> bit<00:02:14.100> much<00:02:14.280> once<00:02:14.580> you

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
on the surface it's a bit much once you

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.010 
on the surface it's a bit much once you
hit<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> water<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.330> looks<00:02:15.480> usually<00:02:15.840> piece

might show quite a lot of interest which

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.360 
might show quite a lot of interest which
is<00:02:24.600> why<00:02:24.720> we<00:02:24.900> assign<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> safety<00:02:25.740> diver<00:02:25.890> every

time we're in the water someone who's

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.560 
time we're in the water someone who's
watching<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> animals<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:28.710> their<00:02:28.830> behavior

one of our biggest concerns that using

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.330 
one of our biggest concerns that using
the<00:02:52.750> chainmail<00:02:52.990> suits<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.860> when<00:02:54.190> we're

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
the chainmail suits is when we're

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.490 
the chainmail suits is when we're
working<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.060> acrylic<00:02:55.300> window<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
working on the acrylic window the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.800 
working on the acrylic window the
acrylic<00:02:56.830> window<00:02:57.070> is<00:02:57.190> made<00:02:57.220> out<00:02:57.490> of<00:02:57.520> plastic

it's<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.900> hard<00:02:59.110> plastic<00:02:59.320> but<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.220> will<00:03:00.340> scratch

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
it's a hard plastic but it will scratch

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.970 
it's a hard plastic but it will scratch
in<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.690> past<00:03:01.900> we've<00:03:02.140> tried<00:03:02.410> things<00:03:02.710> like

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
in the past we've tried things like

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.670 
in the past we've tried things like
plastic<00:03:03.610> suits<00:03:03.910> on<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.180> outside<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:05.380> all<00:03:05.560> of

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
this gear and those suits were actually

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.160 
this gear and those suits were actually
really<00:03:08.170> really<00:03:08.260> difficult<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.920> get<00:03:09.070> on<00:03:09.250> top<00:03:09.760> of

one of the simplest pieces of gear that
we<00:03:16.420> use<00:03:16.690> it's<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.380> black<00:03:17.860> suction<00:03:18.310> cup<00:03:18.490> around

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
we use it's a black suction cup around

we use it's a black suction cup around
four<00:03:19.270> inches<00:03:19.450> in<00:03:19.720> diameter
