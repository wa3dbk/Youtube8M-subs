 weird but I do not have to do it then

 Winter 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.430
 the level of team spirit runs in the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.600
 bobsled fidel spix and union jack that I 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.410
 I still do not know the relationship with 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.020
 winter games 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.940
 the super jacques cassard at the festival 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.440
 tweet from vila nevada and veiga carli 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.440
 Look, I'm a fan of the Winter Olympics. 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.969
 I light the fuck but the ones that are 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.340
 too ugly 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.800
 I think you have to buy the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.539
 vehicle lins O I like not carli 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.579
 because who is cool because I found 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.589
 all of them much more or less 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.110
 and I say that 15 in one of the updates 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.090
 from bp this week we had the splash of 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.580
 new schin of the deadly joke hit that I 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.530
 I spoke here last week I want to know 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 Are you ready to see the splash? 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.580
 the most beautiful art that Haiti has ever done 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.000
 last week when it showed 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.009
 a lot of people commented 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.380
 how tight cassady though he 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.540
 was banned in 100% of matches 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.740
 this week the static site commented that 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.110
 they are working on some 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.880
 change for hunting jeans and one of them is 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.590
 that the case will now be obliged to 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.400
 hand to hand if he wants to 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.619
 gargano 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.360
 he said he saw the changes is 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.130
 enjoying quite like is getting me 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.869
 I want to see you, what do you think? 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.259
 They think this is enough to hunt 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.570
 dinho turn back to be a hat that you 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.460
 Can play against one does not want to do 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.740
 something else completely different in it 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.780
 Will you remember that last week I 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.820
 I put here the player icons of 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.890
 football in which they were to vote for 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.570
 each of the regions win with one of them 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.880
 and I was very sad to know that 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.710
 here in brazil who is winning is the 30 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.420
 merck is the power icon 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.739
 haddad is much more beautiful people you 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.540
 Are you thinking why are you coming back? 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.250
 in time 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.260
 it is the most interesting is that the light 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.000
 disseminated from all regions 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.219
 and here it comes it is not winning in any 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.620
 no one liked the live in poor thing 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.359
 finally general manager of right brasil 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.280
 well the forum talk a little about the 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.629
 stability of servers or 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.890
 unfortunately little was the one that the 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.930
 We already know he's still working. 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.760
 day and night to solve the problem more 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.040
 that they can not deliver the strategy 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.540
 of them because if not who attacks the server 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.280
 will know the strategy and everything 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.220
 It goes by the water down I understand this 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.840
 position and unfortunately we will have 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.219
 wait to see what happens 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.409
 because they gave no deadline for 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.909
 that this is resolved they ask the 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.639
 our conscience also ask that the 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.530
 people are reporter players with suspicion 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.810
 attack and gave this or any other 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.000
 suspicious attitude the right round until 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.609
 posted a link with a guide on how you 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.290
 makes to import are players with 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.629
 wes suspected of attack to stay 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.919
 easier to identify and this 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.650
 I business I hope they solve 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:08.510
 soon because it's very difficult to play 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.310
 game so more than two matches per day 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.019
 which gives time and one of them is 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.689
 They always fall, it's getting very difficult. 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.159
 to play lotam light please try 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.299
 much the way you are 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.629
 telling the people that you are 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.090
 striving and correcting this problem is a 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.709
 quick notice Tuesday 11 of 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.959
 February at four-thirty in the morning the 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.889
 rows are driven will be disabled and 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.569
 six in the morning 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.400
 every server goes separate to receive 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.379
 an update they estimate that the 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.940
 service should last about 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.579
 six hours are there for noon is 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.859
 all back normal i hope n 7 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.199
 that 4.2 will finally be a formator of 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.079
 team because I do not have pb and I'm crazy 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:46.699
 for testing and on February 4, 2014 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.620
 became known as the day the 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.639
 His Brazilian competitive the flash 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.079
 shot 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.120
 I do not know if you 're with us. 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.919
 My mother's madness of halimi rack 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.389
 rack here next guy said 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.409
 year when golf when the plan was 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.329
 positive for the other 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.500
 it was a complete madness for us today 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.699
 obviously has a lot of information 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.109
 concrete 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.790
 so I 'll summarize what 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.260
 happened to you the first 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.090
 official information we had was 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.780
 that cnb is indispensable and three of its 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.000
 members 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.829
 the goal and drec players and the 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.489
 coaching luna had fallen out of the 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.090
 cnb 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:20.269
 thereafter there to midnight on that day 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.190
 actually midnight on 5 always 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.620
 this problem does not work anyway 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.220
 much more connected to the rumor of a 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.620
 prove 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.650
 in the new team a squadron class that 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.620
 would have ecc soulsilver players and 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.060
 former goalkeeper and giant kiss who knows this 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.490
 enemy rumor and talk nothing more about 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.890
 At least not that I 've seen 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.320
 that I researched for now that 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.180
 time is still just a rumor something else and 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.460
 It happened that this left me as good as 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.300
 was started with a rumor that the 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.010
 gifts and revolt had come out of that 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.290
 then it is the next day the new shaft 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.150
 confirm what actually happened 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.670
 explained a little how the knots happened 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.530
 said that it all started when the revolt 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.840
 I talk to the team and say that it's 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.060
 doing tests to be the new year gives 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.980
 follow up when trying not to do tests 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.730
 to make to be the new one of hangu da 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.500
 cnb 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.480
 The team ends up talking and solves it. 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.370
 the more logical would be that the and then back 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.050
 just this from here 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.600
 after that apparently the meeting 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.280
 continued without the goals and one of the heads 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.270
 said that he would like to form a 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.130
 new lineup of the cage without the new one 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.900
 refused to do so since it would be 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.580
 one our the betrayal learned of 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.280
 what happened and decided to leave the team 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.010
 on your own then really snow 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.840
 revolt are no longer in the cage the snow already 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.960
 is hired with cyber millene 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.090
 games that also hired by santinhos 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.270
 which is the top of the Rock series was Neotop's 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.750
 horse series and the code that's that 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.750
 middle game wheel unfortunately has not passed 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.880
 unharmed from all its confusion its dna 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.180
 kiezos left the team probably 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.070
 negotiating with cnb the top leaders before 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.140
 I also went out to go to cyber games eeo 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.660
 team could not hold back and eventually 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.630
 undoing what I find a huge pity 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.919
 because the team did well in ena after that 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.169
 they surprised a lot of people 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.090
 unfortunately they have not been able to 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.040
 stabilize and the team disbanded 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.070
 but the news that impressed most 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.960
 It was all when btt announced in his 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.390
 facebook was leaving fei 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.680
 This is something I do not know who 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.520
 I was waiting because it was so much for me. 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.320
 shocking 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.270
 He said he left in a good way. He left by 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.930
 Nobody will take it, nobody gives it. 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.910
 cliff 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.250
 but from what he gave to understand he arrived 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.690
 on the highest level of faith he wants 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.580
 grow and he felt he did not 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.950
 I could get one more bad signal so he 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.139
 He left the team he did not send competitive 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.060
 from gledson 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.819
 already under negotiation with some 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.409
 other teams and after all the confusion 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.180
 Let's see how the scenario goes. 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:47.889
 competitive I think this shows that 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.129
 We are very volatile. 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:54.610
 still has much touch switching between 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:58.029
 players but who likes that I'm going to talk 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:00.819
 I hope so but here the 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:02.759
 competitive way to stay stable 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:04.779
 because it's too complicated for some 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:07.029
 investor wants to invest in a team 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:09.099
 that he does not know if in two weeks' time 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:10.449
 one month will still be active then 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:12.669
 Let's hope this is all 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.500
