there's a couple of limits that give

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.899 
there's a couple of limits that give
this<00:01:19.170> board<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.680> little<00:01:19.860> bit<00:01:19.979> more<00:01:20.220> strength

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this board a little bit more strength

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.749 
this board a little bit more strength
there's<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.900> salt<00:01:22.250> impact<00:01:23.250> plates<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.640> have

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
there's a salt impact plates that have

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.340 
there's a salt impact plates that have
been<00:01:23.790> laid<00:01:24.090> underneath<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> bindings<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.259> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
been laid underneath the bindings so you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.859 
been laid underneath the bindings so you
won't<00:01:25.530> pick<00:01:25.650> those<00:01:25.799> stress<00:01:26.159> fractures<00:01:26.869> under

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
won't pick those stress fractures under

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.230 
won't pick those stress fractures under
your<00:01:28.020> feet<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.470> then<00:01:29.040> there's<00:01:29.189> um<00:01:29.490> hot<00:01:29.939> rods

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
your feet and then there's um hot rods

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.149 
your feet and then there's um hot rods
as<00:01:30.450> well<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.140> core<00:01:31.409> has<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:31.979> been

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
as well the core has actually been

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
as well the core has actually been
milled<00:01:32.610> out<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.390> then<00:01:33.990> there's<00:01:34.229> been

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
milled out and then there's been

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.640 
milled out and then there's been
actually<00:01:34.680> glass<00:01:35.280> inlaid<00:01:36.060> down<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> center<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
actually glass inlaid down the center of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.410 
actually glass inlaid down the center of
the<00:01:37.799> board<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.490> ends<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.939> contact

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the board to the ends of the contact

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.030 
the board to the ends of the contact
points<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.900> start<00:01:40.200> pretty<00:01:40.680> much<00:01:40.829> right

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
points that start pretty much right

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.700 
points that start pretty much right
underneath<00:01:41.369> each<00:01:41.729> binding<00:01:42.180> insert<00:01:42.810> pack<00:01:43.110> now

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
underneath each binding insert pack now

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.170 
underneath each binding insert pack now
the<00:01:43.770> reason<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.250> they<00:01:44.430> put<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> hot<00:01:44.909> rods

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the reason that they put the hot rods

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.749 
the reason that they put the hot rods
there<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.159> board<00:01:47.399> will<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.729> a

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
there is so that the board will have a

edges<00:02:03.369> that<00:02:03.579> give<00:02:03.850> this<00:02:04.090> board<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.479> ability

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
edges that give this board the ability

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
to make large or small arcing turns

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.029 
to make large or small arcing turns
pretty<00:02:07.600> much<00:02:07.780> at<00:02:07.929> any<00:02:08.080> speed<00:02:08.500> because<00:02:08.890> there's

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
pretty much at any speed because there's

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.620 
pretty much at any speed because there's
a<00:02:09.099> combination<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.729> three<00:02:10.000> different<00:02:10.030> sidecut
