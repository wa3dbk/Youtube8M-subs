 and how about guys welcome a tutorial 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.819
 over minecraft mods and if it says that 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.179
 upload a video today but I want to upload 2 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.489
 because channel has to be very active 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.889
 if I want it to grow a little bit not for 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:17.420
 help them and to help myself and because 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.950
 I have fun making these videos 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.870
 making me bourgeois wrong but 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.150
 well we will not extend it much because it is 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.590
 Enjoy the mold next Tuesday if you 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.480
 like explorations and 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.520
 nuclear explosions and missiles then 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.990
 this one of the mountain will love too much 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.180
 we have to do is what we do in 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.210
 all of the videos in the start bar 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:40.219
 put percentage percent to data 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.469
 percentage then we enter then we're going to 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.659
 decree point mini craft because we have 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.329
 to have a mini craft force I leave it 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.850
 annotation anywhere on the screen that 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.530
 will suffer from the video an annotation a 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.420
 little green box you touch it and you 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.430
 another window will appear with mimic force 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.210
 that I also made a video about him 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.200
 It's the only thing you have to do if 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.880
 install it and that's it and then 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.190
 we will enter also then mini 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.500
 craft 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.250
 this heart file called mini coffee lo 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.200
 we open with a file and then all this 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.690
 well we also open the explosive mold 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.110
 and with saving files 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:21.200
 and these folders are for the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.030
 black of our mini craft 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.409
 that would be the whole installation no no 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.939
 let's see if it works and do not 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.220
 I will show all this explosives because I 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.610
 it would take more than 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.490
 15 minutes and I do not intend to make the videos 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.490
 so long because I do not reverendo 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.170
 one 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.030
 I want this thing to make me sick 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.750
 open up for etc 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.750
 that opened 234 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.750
 good 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.759
 as I know 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.729
 as well I graphs say tithe 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.840
 activated I will tell a pack of motorcycles to 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.840
 who want it 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.370
 what 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.000
 one is the one I 'm playing myself and one and 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.830
 one is the one that then stops for motorcycles 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.330
 this is the one that arrives to mounts good 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.290
 As we will see here they will add rays 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.290
 are the explosives 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.170
 good no no no no 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:55.020
 the expressives are will be going to remove 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:59.430
 this would be flowers smoke grenades 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.190
 in this cobs the instructions more 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.660
 nuclear and that you will have fun 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.180
 looking for things there with flowers 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.890
 they only do that on the night of alum 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:14.200
 the smoke grenades are thus pulling 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.910
 and the gems and you would like a 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.100
 nuclear bomb and to do more 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.500
 interesting let's put a 2 and the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.610
 let's explode with a missile 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.710
 but a nuclear missile 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.590
 they will decide how we are going to do that 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.620
 but we put to say in its place then 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.370
 we see the coordinates 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.370
 the coordinates are 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:48.250
 70 and 195 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:53.540
 70 and 195 we're going to put the 70 and 125 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:56.960
 because he is creative because this missile 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.910
 even blow up how hard book guys 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.819

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.640
 nuke are here rightly 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.620
 you have to see the expression 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.710
 to see why it is and it's always 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.710
 there 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.099

 although everything is I have very say and the 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.719
 explosion 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.440
