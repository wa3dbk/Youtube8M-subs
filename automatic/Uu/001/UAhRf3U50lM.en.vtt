found<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:59.000> students<00:00:59.420> were<00:00:59.540> seven<00:01:00.050> times<00:01:00.350> more

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620

how to take notes we're taught from a
very<00:01:10.640> young<00:01:11.030> age<00:01:11.210> that<00:01:11.630> when<00:01:11.749> a<00:01:11.780> teacher

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
very young age that when a teacher

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.260 
very young age that when a teacher
starts<00:01:12.530> delivering<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:13.249> load<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.670> information

Julius love as star-crossed that we
should<00:01:20.539> start<00:01:20.689> writing<00:01:20.960> down<00:01:20.990> as<00:01:21.229> much<00:01:21.350> as

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
should start writing down as much as

this<00:01:24.560> is<00:01:24.920> an<00:01:25.130> incredibly<00:01:25.819> inefficient<00:01:26.270> way<00:01:26.659> to

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
this is an incredibly inefficient way to

this is an incredibly inefficient way to
