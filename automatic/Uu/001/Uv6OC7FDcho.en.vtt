00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
older zones were just meant to be

if<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.459> could<00:03:04.760> fly<00:03:05.030> in<00:03:05.359> vanilla<00:03:05.689> well<00:03:05.959> you

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
if you could fly in vanilla well you

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.170 
if you could fly in vanilla well you
wouldn't<00:03:06.799> see<00:03:06.980> anything<00:03:07.250> above<00:03:07.700> most<00:03:07.879> of<00:03:08.090> the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
wouldn't see anything above most of the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.059 
wouldn't see anything above most of the
trees<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:08.689> especially<00:03:08.930> above<00:03:09.319> stormwind<00:03:09.920> and

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
trees and especially above stormwind and

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.740 
trees and especially above stormwind and
some<00:03:10.189> other<00:03:10.340> zones<00:03:10.609> so<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.299> was<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.450> lot<00:03:11.690> of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
some other zones so that was a lot of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.319 
some other zones so that was a lot of
work<00:03:12.049> it<00:03:12.500> may<00:03:12.709> not<00:03:12.859> look<00:03:13.040> as<00:03:13.220> much<00:03:13.430> like<00:03:13.790> we<00:03:14.209> did

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
work it may not look as much like we did

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.210 
work it may not look as much like we did
as<00:03:14.450> much<00:03:14.599> for<00:03:14.840> storm<00:03:15.079> wind<00:03:15.260> especially<00:03:15.409> but

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
as much for storm wind especially but

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.369 
as much for storm wind especially but
that<00:03:16.280> was<00:03:16.670> almost<00:03:17.329> as<00:03:17.510> much<00:03:17.659> work<00:03:17.900> as<00:03:18.019> we<00:03:18.200> did

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
that was almost as much work as we did

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.410 
that was almost as much work as we did
in<00:03:18.409> ogre<00:03:18.769> Mar<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.190> especially<00:03:19.730> any<00:03:20.060> tree<00:03:20.389> that

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
in ogre Mar and especially any tree that

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.030 
in ogre Mar and especially any tree that
was<00:03:20.750> just<00:03:21.019> meant<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.290> be<00:03:21.349> seen<00:03:21.709> from<00:03:21.889> the
