00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
be comin to shelter but what do you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.880 
be comin to shelter but what do you
think<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> galaxy<00:01:25.110> s3<00:01:25.680> I

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
think that we can see in the galaxy s3 I

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.490 
think that we can see in the galaxy s3 I
mean<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.700> galaxy<00:01:27.360> s<00:01:27.420> right<00:01:27.689> now<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:28.200> sick

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
mean the galaxy s right now it's sick

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.429 
mean the galaxy s right now it's sick
dual<00:01:29.189> core<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.240> are<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.409> a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
dual core so are we going to see a

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.440 
dual core so are we going to see a
quad-core<00:01:32.100> galaxy<00:01:33.060> s3<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:34.100> am<00:01:35.100> yeah<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:36.240> could

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
quad-core galaxy s3 I am yeah we could

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.810 
quad-core galaxy s3 I am yeah we could
we<00:01:36.600> could<00:01:36.720> sit<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.229> think<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> Riggin<00:01:38.280> seat<00:01:38.549> or

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
we could sit I think the Riggin seat or

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.990 
we could sit I think the Riggin seat or
hopefully<00:01:39.540> we<00:01:40.140> will<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.950> mean<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
hopefully we will see because I mean the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.289 
hopefully we will see because I mean the
quad<00:01:42.270> core<00:01:42.600> processor<00:01:43.500> kal-el<00:01:44.280> from<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.180> new

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
quad core processor kal-el from a new

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.600 
quad core processor kal-el from a new
video<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.439> tone<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.340> way

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
video it's on the tone and on this way

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.179 
video it's on the tone and on this way
and<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.329> already<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.290> tablets

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
and we can already see you know tablets

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.520 
and we can already see you know tablets
in<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.780> smartphones<00:01:51.780> come<00:01:52.170> out<00:01:52.290> with<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
in the smartphones come out with a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.219 
in the smartphones come out with a
particle<00:01:53.009> processor<00:01:53.430> at<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.119> end<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.450> 2012

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
particle processor at the end here 2012

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.760 
particle processor at the end here 2012
so<00:01:55.680> no<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> mean<00:01:56.640> Justin<00:01:57.210> 11<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.469> definitely

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
so no I mean Justin 11 so I definitely

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.530 
so no I mean Justin 11 so I definitely
think<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.280> are<00:01:59.369> going<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.820> quad<00:02:00.149> core

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
think that we are going to quad core
