00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the first thing that you're going to do

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.140 
the first thing that you're going to do
is<00:01:12.570> you're<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.140> soak<00:01:13.530> your<00:01:14.130> cashew<00:01:14.880> nuts

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.210 
is you're going to soak your cashew nuts
and<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.380> soak<00:01:16.590> them<00:01:16.799> overnight

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and I like to soak them overnight

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.640 
and I like to soak them overnight
because<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.840> does<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.380> job

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
because that really does the job

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.580 
because that really does the job
thoroughly<00:01:20.430> if<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.420> forget<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.960> but

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
thoroughly if you forget to but

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.070 
thoroughly if you forget to but
sometimes<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.450> soak<00:01:24.689> them<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
sometimes I do you can soak them for a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.630 
sometimes I do you can soak them for a
couple<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.439> hours<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:25.860> two<00:01:26.159> hours<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
couple of hours but two hours is the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.789 
couple of hours but two hours is the
absolute<00:01:27.210> minimum<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.049> want<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> show<00:01:28.740> you

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
absolute minimum I want to show you

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.620 
absolute minimum I want to show you
something<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> difference

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
something here this is the difference

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.499 
something here this is the difference
here<00:01:30.930> between<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.560> soaked<00:01:32.070> cashew<00:01:33.000> nut<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
here between is soaked cashew nut and

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.050 
here between is soaked cashew nut and
one<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.869> hasn't<00:01:34.170> been<00:01:34.380> soaked<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:35.850> you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
one that hasn't been soaked and as you

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.149 
one that hasn't been soaked and as you
can<00:01:36.240> see<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.259> has<00:01:37.380> been<00:01:37.560> soaked<00:01:37.920> has

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
can see the one that has been soaked has

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.390 
can see the one that has been soaked has
absorbed<00:01:38.759> all<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.210> water<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.770> does<00:01:41.070> is

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
absorbed all that water what it does is

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.399 
absorbed all that water what it does is
that<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.640> makes<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.030> very<00:01:42.270> digestible<00:01:42.630> much

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
that it makes it very digestible much

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.050 
that it makes it very digestible much
we're<00:01:43.770> all<00:01:43.920> nuts<00:01:44.220> when<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.610> soak<00:01:44.820> them<00:01:44.939> they

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
we're all nuts when you soak them they

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.179 
we're all nuts when you soak them they
make<00:01:45.210> more<00:01:45.450> digestible<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.890> makes<00:01:47.070> it

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
make more digestible and it makes it

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.160 
make more digestible and it makes it
easier<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.759> blend<00:01:47.880> into<00:01:48.299> these<00:01:48.450> cheeses<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
easier to blend into these cheeses and

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.310 
easier to blend into these cheeses and
sauces<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.670> let's<00:01:50.909> get<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.420> we're<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.200> to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
sauces so let's get going we're going to

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.260 
sauces so let's get going we're going to
take<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.130> round<00:01:53.399> about<00:01:53.670> two<00:01:54.090> cups<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.840> my

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270
