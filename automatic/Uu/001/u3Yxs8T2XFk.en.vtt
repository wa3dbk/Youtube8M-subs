00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello now i want to show you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.290
 the card you took for yourself 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.280
 I took a couple of things one for myself 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:17.340
 then I will tell why this is a sandisk 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.410
 ultra Grade 10 plus it well more 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.859
 higher then there is one 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.260
 speed up to 30 mb with 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.460
 i.e. megabyte per second accelerated 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.149
 enlarged but I initially cut off 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.820
 and when took the card and checked and and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.280
 Smartphone inserted in order to later 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.500
 do not bathe no walk there she works 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.530
 does not work that is, I immediately checked that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.750
 she works and so she cut me 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.050
 now show you goes to kit it is not 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.180
 dedicated to the card + adapter I think 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.230
 what makes sense now to check 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.030
 speed 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.550
 how well it transmits there and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.339
 Well, in general, I can say that here 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.070
 Such a plan of the card must be taken for 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.360
 their devices 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.330
 the first time you need 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.390
 pay attention this is grade 4 or 10 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.820
 especially it is worth paying attention 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.680
 if your smartphone records video in 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.229
 full hd 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.509
 because if your smart writes flash drives 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.280
 you will have grade 4 you can 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.650
 face the problem that you have 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.170
 will knock out or slow down the video 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.090
 there is just not physically able to keep up 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.130
 will not be in time writes down on himself 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.100
 video material that you are recording 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.070
 therefore, it is necessary that what was 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.610
 would be 10 class and you can even such 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.399
 accelerated cards plus still coming 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.979
 usual you card 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.170
 of course looks pretty good 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.750
 very small by the way 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.119
 sandisk one of the first to release such 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.760
 here's a miniature card for only 128 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.350
 gigabyte is convenient that there is an adapter 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.900
 can for example this card be used in 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.250
 camera that is also really 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.870
 okay so we now put the card 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.450
 memory card reader 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.600
 plus everything I have installed such 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:25.820
 a program called black magic 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.820
 design des pieds in the settings I choose 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.210
 directly to the memory card she already 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.710
 selected and doing speedtest now on 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:40.710
 reading and 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:50.240
 on record so record 7 and 8 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:50.240
 read 20 write 7 and 3 7 971 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.180
 so the tests are already over and let's 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.560
 look at the average results 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.830
 very different videos 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.780
 different-different-different videos and medium 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.050
 the results for this video are 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.090
 that 17 and 9 are read and write 6 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.209
 half is enough less than 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.510
 indicated on the cover of the memory card packaging 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.640
 but still good speed i can 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.900
 say that this is enough to 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.820
 to record in full hd format also 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.390
 let's check directly 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:41.290
 transmission rate as it will to 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:45.700
 eg some sort of file here we go 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:50.550
 map nouneym and here we have a file 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:54.580
 which weighs 386 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:58.510
 there is another one that weighs 217 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.440
 let's 18 and see in time 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.829
 how much will we have 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.370
 transfer 2 with something gigan on this 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.370
 memory card 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.620
 all of them 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.830
 passed I can say that 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.970
 it was copied clearly for five minutes what 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.170
 a bit too big for both 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.820
 file transfer well as for 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.340
 directly memory card then this 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.320
 more or less good indicator I'm here 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.990
 imagine what it would be like if it were 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.500
 fourth grade then it would be much 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.680
 much longer and therefore had to 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.500
 I would have been much much longer to wait for that 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.270
 they are quite comfortable moment 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.090
 in general, thank you all for 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.270
 watched this video this was a video by 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.860
 about the memory card and some tips 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.960
 don't forget about it 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.840
 subscribe to the channel here's an extra stack 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.460
 Also zatit your memory card and in 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.760
 comments write your results 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.670
 if you want to carry out this procedure 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.670
 all yet see you again in new videos
