00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 the reality is that today within the 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:09.469
 Mexican soccer team 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:17.250
 what has happened rafa marquez 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:25.890
 good for me is one of the many that 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:27.539
 can fail as a leader as a leader 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.090
 to give from a group you would give the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:36.649
 responsibility of the captain's armband 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.649
 team soccer 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:01:05.820
 I do not criticize arguing with someone 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:01:10.860
 I do not know who your choice is to shine 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:17.380
 independent thought has been the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:21.760
 channel 40 another guy also changing me 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:26.250
 we also all change but also me 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.250
 to achieve a follower of yours 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.440
 but I'm interested in being followed by 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.240
 nobody nobody are the classes of 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.430
 journalism that we were throwing them at 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.040
 the garbage to debate but to you 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.340
 they bother to beat they are used 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.110
 to the cries of the Lord and applaud him and if 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.110
 He says he sings toy world 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:56.920
 it takes away the courage that can 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.930
 run if you do not have efficient work to 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.660
 throw it not right now to put on the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.390
 place of magallanes to see to see Luis 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.850
 what conditions an act of dignity to the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.520
 decision of another look at my data that is 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.200
 saying here they have not been published in the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.550
 half of them hector ortiz in the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.800
 hobby today 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.290
 if you have to applaud what they are 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.990
 important data and nothing else because 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:27.240
 here they are in disciplined catering 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:27.240
 data that they have to bring 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.190
 it is a paper 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:56.310
 Rafael Marquez is there at the stake 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:59.700
 in the bonfire the perfect ones are in the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.500
 it is better that the assumes the criticisms had 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.510
 on that sum the definitely 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.750
 when one is a follower of a team and 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.120
 well I saw it not what 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.490
 They are nervous because the lion was going 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.700
 losing a great failure of the lion yesterday 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.860
 the abbot 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.080
 and when you hear comments like that of 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.269
 today they also totally contradict 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.099
 what you write because really 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:31.500
 someone think a gram different from you 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:33.959
 it's not that you're used to having 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.209
 both leadership with a team of forums and 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.700
 all not sorry because now it turns out that 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.610
 if someone says a gram of difference 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.680
 of yours then one of the great faith does not 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.120
 field for the moment there is that if things 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.590
 clear and strong the lion failure 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.049
 everyone is wrong because of marquez 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.060
 shown again a grotesque face 3 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.060
 grotesque because it does not say that here
