00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
so this is now basically the main street

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.080 
so this is now basically the main street
to<00:01:12.280> our<00:01:12.370> left<00:01:12.580> main<00:01:13.270> grandstand<00:01:14.790> country<00:01:15.790> Pat

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090

first<00:03:14.450> impressions<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.550> venue<00:03:16.550> here<00:03:16.730> I

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
first impressions of the venue here I

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.420 
first impressions of the venue here I
think<00:03:17.300> it's<00:03:17.390> pretty<00:03:17.900> cool<00:03:18.140> I<00:03:18.530> really<00:03:19.130> like<00:03:19.280> the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
think it's pretty cool I really like the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.960 
think it's pretty cool I really like the
stadium<00:03:19.820> section<00:03:20.170> I've<00:03:21.170> never<00:03:21.410> really<00:03:21.970> racing

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
stadium section I've never really racing

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.370 
stadium section I've never really racing
anything<00:03:23.300> like<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:23.960> that's<00:03:24.110> that's

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
anything like that so that's that's

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.040 
anything like that so that's that's
unique<00:03:24.740> I<00:03:25.670> know<00:03:26.450> there's<00:03:26.750> some<00:03:26.870> similarities

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
unique I know there's some similarities

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.050 
unique I know there's some similarities
throughout<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.950> place<00:03:28.160> in<00:03:28.430> terms<00:03:28.820> of<00:03:28.910> other

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
throughout the place in terms of other

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.880 
throughout the place in terms of other
circuits<00:03:29.540> this<00:03:29.750> some<00:03:30.050> some<00:03:30.440> parts<00:03:30.710> going

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
circuits this some some parts going

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.050 
circuits this some some parts going
through<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.160> park<00:03:31.370> which<00:03:31.610> is<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.760> bit<00:03:31.940> like

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
through the park which is a bit like

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.810 
through the park which is a bit like
Monza<00:03:33.010> especially<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.070> long<00:03:34.220> street<00:03:34.580> and

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
Monza especially the long street and

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.790 
Monza especially the long street and
then<00:03:35.300> a<00:03:35.330> little<00:03:35.450> bit<00:03:35.660> like<00:03:35.810> Korea<00:03:36.140> I<00:03:36.380> feel<00:03:36.770> a

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
then a little bit like Korea I feel a

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.290 
then a little bit like Korea I feel a
little<00:03:37.010> bit<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.580> circuit<00:03:37.940> towards<00:03:38.240> the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
little bit of the circuit towards the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.350 
little bit of the circuit towards the
back<00:03:38.450> there<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:38.870> yeah<00:03:39.770> interesting<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.760> was<00:03:40.970> it

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
back there so yeah interesting it was it

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.940 
back there so yeah interesting it was it
was<00:03:41.420> cool<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.840> know<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:42.020> get<00:03:42.500> on<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.710> track

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
was cool you know to get on the track

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.550 
was cool you know to get on the track
and<00:03:42.980> it's<00:03:43.610> still<00:03:43.820> quite<00:03:44.060> dusty<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:44.660> even<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
and it's still quite dusty and even the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.350 
and it's still quite dusty and even the
completed<00:03:46.070> parts<00:03:46.340> are<00:03:46.430> still<00:03:46.580> quite<00:03:46.760> dusty<00:03:46.970> so

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
completed parts are still quite dusty so

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.080 
completed parts are still quite dusty so
yeah<00:03:48.080> had<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.290> bit<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.470> fun<00:03:48.620> in<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:48.830> q50<00:03:49.310> but<00:03:49.490> I

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
yeah had a bit of fun in the q50 but I

yeah had a bit of fun in the q50 but I
started<00:03:50.990> Sylvia<00:03:51.320> see<00:03:51.440> understand<00:03:51.920> a<00:03:52.040> little

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
bit of the flow and the lines of the

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.440 
bit of the flow and the lines of the
track<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.380> there's<00:03:55.370> this<00:03:55.670> sort<00:03:55.880> of<00:03:55.940> s<00:03:56.090> the

track and there's this sort of s the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.090 
track and there's this sort of s the
fastest<00:03:56.960> section<00:03:57.320> which<00:03:57.470> looks<00:03:57.650> really<00:03:57.920> cool

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
fastest section which looks really cool

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.920 
fastest section which looks really cool
so<00:03:58.340> looking<00:03:59.000> forward<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.300> that<00:03:59.450> part<00:03:59.480> in<00:03:59.840> the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
so looking forward to that part in the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.790 
so looking forward to that part in the
f1<00:04:00.200> car<00:04:00.640> it's<00:04:01.640> nice<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:02.300> mean<00:04:02.540> nice<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:03.020> to<00:04:03.680> go

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
f1 car it's nice I mean nice to to go

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.980 
f1 car it's nice I mean nice to to go
back<00:04:03.980> on<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.190> track<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.460> yeah<00:04:05.150> many<00:04:05.570> many<00:04:05.870> of

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
back on the track that yeah many many of

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.660 
back on the track that yeah many many of
my<00:04:06.050> heroes<00:04:06.380> drove<00:04:06.650> on<00:04:06.830> back<00:04:07.130> in<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.340> 80s<00:04:07.610> and

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
my heroes drove on back in the 80s and

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.300 
my heroes drove on back in the 80s and
90s<00:04:08.800> it's<00:04:09.800> going<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:09.980> be<00:04:10.070> a<00:04:10.100> little<00:04:10.190> bit

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
90s it's going to be a little bit

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.040 
90s it's going to be a little bit
different<00:04:10.730> but<00:04:10.850> already<00:04:11.510> going<00:04:11.810> through<00:04:11.870> like

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
different but already going through like

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.660 
different but already going through like
the<00:04:12.320> last<00:04:12.500> corner<00:04:12.830> the<00:04:13.070> old<00:04:13.220> part<00:04:13.460> of<00:04:13.610> the

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
the last corner the old part of the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.870 
the last corner the old part of the
track<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.360> few<00:04:14.540> areas<00:04:14.690> like<00:04:14.930> this<00:04:15.880> yeah

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
track and a few areas like this yeah

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.120 
track and a few areas like this yeah
it's<00:04:17.390> pretty<00:04:17.570> special<00:04:17.870> but<00:04:18.200> I<00:04:18.410> guess<00:04:18.859> a<00:04:18.950> lots

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
it's pretty special but I guess a lots

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.700 
it's pretty special but I guess a lots
changed<00:04:19.220> as<00:04:19.670> well
