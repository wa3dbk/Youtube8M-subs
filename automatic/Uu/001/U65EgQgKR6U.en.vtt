now<00:01:26.140> in<00:01:26.290> just<00:01:26.500> one<00:01:26.770> minute<00:01:26.950> we<00:01:27.220> were<00:01:27.250> able<00:01:27.430> to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
now in just one minute we were able to

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.610 
now in just one minute we were able to
make<00:01:27.730> something<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:28.300> looks<00:01:28.330> great<00:01:28.870> now

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
let's build upon that and create a

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.690 
let's build upon that and create a
simple<00:01:31.480> game<00:01:31.780> in<00:01:31.960> our<00:01:32.080> world<00:01:32.260> step<00:01:32.950> one<00:01:33.220> our

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
simple game in our world step one our

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.450 
simple game in our world step one our
home<00:01:34.000> base<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.290> we'll<00:01:35.410> choose<00:01:35.590> this<00:01:35.800> village<00:01:36.160> I

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
home base so we'll choose this village I

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.580 
home base so we'll choose this village I
can<00:01:37.180> place<00:01:37.330> this<00:01:37.480> anywhere<00:01:37.780> I'd<00:01:37.930> like<00:01:38.110> I'll

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
can place this anywhere I'd like I'll

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.530 
can place this anywhere I'd like I'll
put<00:01:38.770> it<00:01:38.860> right<00:01:38.950> here<00:01:39.010> this<00:01:39.790> will<00:01:39.940> be<00:01:40.030> our<00:01:40.060> town

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
put it right here this will be our town

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.740 
put it right here this will be our town
square<00:01:41.700> alright<00:01:42.700> step<00:01:43.060> 2<00:01:43.270> let's<00:01:43.570> add<00:01:43.720> some

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
square alright step 2 let's add some

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.840 
square alright step 2 let's add some
behaviors<00:01:44.440> now<00:01:44.680> everything<00:01:45.250> in<00:01:45.370> projects

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
behaviors now everything in projects

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.880 
behaviors now everything in projects
part<00:01:46.090> has<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.660> brain<00:01:46.990> that<00:01:47.140> can<00:01:47.290> be<00:01:47.410> changed

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
part has a brain that can be changed

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.010 
part has a brain that can be changed
let's<00:01:48.550> bring<00:01:48.729> something<00:01:49.150> to<00:01:49.180> life<00:01:49.479> take<00:01:49.870> this

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
let's bring something to life take this

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.770 
let's bring something to life take this
rock<00:01:50.320> for<00:01:50.560> instance<00:01:50.950> its<00:01:51.760> brains<00:01:52.060> empty<00:01:52.570> and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
rock for instance its brains empty and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.660 
rock for instance its brains empty and
Claude<00:01:53.500> could<00:01:53.710> go<00:01:53.830> in<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.130> add<00:01:54.250> behaviors

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
Claude could go in and add behaviors

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.640 
Claude could go in and add behaviors
line<00:01:54.910> by<00:01:55.060> line<00:01:55.270> but<00:01:55.540> for<00:01:55.720> now<00:01:55.870> we<00:01:56.350> can<00:01:56.500> make

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
line by line but for now we can make

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.440 
line by line but for now we can make
this<00:01:56.800> rock<00:01:57.040> become<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.430> pet<00:01:57.820> with<00:01:58.000> something<00:01:58.360> we

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
this rock become a pet with something we

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.850 
this rock become a pet with something we
already<00:01:58.600> built<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.810> brain<00:02:01.990> says<00:02:02.290> when<00:02:02.830> the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
already built so the brain says when the

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.830 
already built so the brain says when the
rock<00:02:03.130> detects<00:02:03.550> me<00:02:03.729> it'll<00:02:04.240> move<00:02:04.360> towards<00:02:04.690> me

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
rock detects me it'll move towards me

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
rock detects me it'll move towards me
and<00:02:05.050> jump<00:02:05.470> pretty<00:02:06.220> simple<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:08.470> just<00:02:08.649> like

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
and jump pretty simple and just like

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.550 
and jump pretty simple and just like
that<00:02:08.890> I've<00:02:09.610> made<00:02:09.790> myself<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.240> new<00:02:10.360> friend<00:02:10.660> come

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
that I've made myself a new friend come

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.630 
that I've made myself a new friend come
