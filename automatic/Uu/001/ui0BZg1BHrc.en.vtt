00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.770 
I'll get a piece of bread now I will
turn<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.960> heater<00:03:03.320> off<00:03:04.120> mobile<00:03:05.120> warming<00:03:05.630> and

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
turn the heater off mobile warming and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.400 
turn the heater off mobile warming and
all<00:03:05.900> that<00:03:06.080> you're<00:03:06.620> not<00:03:06.770> burning<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.250> egg<00:03:08.410> and

all that you're not burning the egg and
basically<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.580> should<00:03:10.850> lift<00:03:11.270> off<00:03:11.510> fairly

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290
