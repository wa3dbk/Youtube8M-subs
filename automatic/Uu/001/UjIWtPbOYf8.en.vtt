00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
now you can either leave it to air dry

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.680 
now you can either leave it to air dry
or<00:02:25.410> sit<00:02:25.770> under<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.100> dryer<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.790> up<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.390> but

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
take down pretty much I don't have any

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.630 
take down pretty much I don't have any
process<00:02:33.900> for<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:34.530> open<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.280> flexi

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
process for this I just open the flexi

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.550 
process for this I just open the flexi
rod<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.090> pull<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.780> way<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.410> was

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
rod and pull it the way that it was

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.340 
rod and pull it the way that it was
rolled<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.280> then<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.360> use<00:02:39.480> my<00:02:39.690> fingers<00:02:40.110> to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
rolled and then I just use my fingers to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:03:09.170 
rolled and then I just use my fingers to
put<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.950> curl<00:02:41.190> back<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.580> place

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.880 

now<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.420> they're<00:03:10.570> all<00:03:10.600> help<00:03:11.050> I'm<00:03:11.290> grabbing

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
now that they're all help I'm grabbing

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.800 
now that they're all help I'm grabbing
my<00:03:11.980> main<00:03:12.310> choice<00:03:12.580> again<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.210> I'm<00:03:13.390> gonna<00:03:13.540> use

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
my main choice again and I'm gonna use

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.130 
my main choice again and I'm gonna use
this<00:03:14.080> while<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.740> suffer<00:03:15.280> with<00:03:15.370> my<00:03:15.550> curls<00:03:19.140> for

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
this while I suffer with my curls for

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.840 
this while I suffer with my curls for
separating<00:03:20.710> I<00:03:20.890> don't<00:03:21.100> have<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.280> specific

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
separating I don't have a specific

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.360 
separating I don't have a specific
method<00:03:22.240> I<00:03:22.420> just<00:03:22.720> separate<00:03:23.170> based<00:03:23.470> on<00:03:23.710> how<00:03:24.340> I

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
method I just separate based on how I

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.910 
method I just separate based on how I
feel<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.880> curl<00:03:25.120> looks<00:03:25.420> if<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.380> curl<00:03:26.650> that

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
feel the curl looks if it's a curl that

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.860 
feel the curl looks if it's a curl that
is<00:03:27.040> really<00:03:27.370> defined<00:03:27.760> I'll<00:03:28.060> separate<00:03:28.600> it<00:03:28.660> into

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
is really defined I'll separate it into

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.020 
is really defined I'll separate it into
really<00:03:29.260> small<00:03:29.380> curls<00:03:29.860> but<00:03:30.550> if<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.820> curl

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
really small curls but if the curl

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.450 
really small curls but if the curl
doesn't<00:03:31.390> look<00:03:31.570> so<00:03:32.200> defined<00:03:32.740> then<00:03:33.160> I'll<00:03:33.280> just

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
doesn't look so defined then I'll just

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.220 
doesn't look so defined then I'll just
