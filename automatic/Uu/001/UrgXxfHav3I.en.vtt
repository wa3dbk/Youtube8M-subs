now<00:02:41.780> it's<00:02:42.110> it's<00:02:43.040> fashioned<00:02:43.400> away<00:02:43.610> at<00:02:43.850> about

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
now it's it's fashioned away at about

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.260 
now it's it's fashioned away at about
600<00:02:45.500> mega<00:02:45.770> hash<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> second<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:47.090> can<00:02:47.150> see

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
600 mega hash in a second you can see

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.660 
600 mega hash in a second you can see
there<00:02:47.600> was<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.840> an<00:02:48.880> accepted<00:02:51.460> block<00:02:52.460> right

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
there was a an accepted block right

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.620 
there was a an accepted block right
there<00:02:56.020> just<00:02:57.020> at<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.380> top<00:02:57.560> here

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.190 

things<00:03:01.140> are<00:03:01.320> still<00:03:01.530> chugging<00:03:02.070> along<00:03:03.110> we<00:03:04.110> got

so<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.670> get<00:03:11.819> this<00:03:11.969> working<00:03:13.129> basically<00:03:14.129> I<00:03:14.670> had

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
so to get this working basically I had

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.709 
so to get this working basically I had
to<00:03:15.719> download<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.980> CyanogenMod<00:03:17.310> source<00:03:17.849> and

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:18.719 
to download the CyanogenMod source and

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.920 
to download the CyanogenMod source and
be<00:03:18.900> able<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.079> build<00:03:19.319> it<00:03:19.469> and<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.629> build<00:03:21.629> lip

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
be able to build it and the build lip

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.270 
be able to build it and the build lip
curl<00:03:22.579> had<00:03:23.579> to<00:03:23.790> create<00:03:24.709> Android<00:03:25.709> build<00:03:26.040> files

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
curl had to create Android build files

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.420 
curl had to create Android build files

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
the CG - source a little bit because

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.869 
the CG - source a little bit because
there's<00:03:31.920> some<00:03:32.040> functions<00:03:32.430> with<00:03:32.579> different

there's some functions with different

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
USB host mode working initially I tried

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.250 
USB host mode working initially I tried
this<00:03:57.090> on<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.329> Galaxy<00:03:57.930> S<00:03:58.109> or<00:03:59.099> sorry<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.549> Nexus<00:04:00.030> S

this on a Galaxy S or sorry a Nexus S

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.500 
this on a Galaxy S or sorry a Nexus S
and<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.439> didn't<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.799> USB<00:04:02.760> host<00:04:03.000> mode<00:04:03.209> didn't

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
and I didn't the USB host mode didn't

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.750 
and I didn't the USB host mode didn't
really<00:04:03.689> work<00:04:03.870> on<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.340> couldn't<00:04:05.639> get

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
really work on that so I couldn't get

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.699 
really work on that so I couldn't get
that<00:04:05.879> working<00:04:06.209> but<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.840> Galaxy<00:04:07.169> Nexus<00:04:07.349> does

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
that working but the Galaxy Nexus does

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:14.030 
that working but the Galaxy Nexus does
work<00:04:09.290> so<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:10.950> is<00:04:11.219> valid
