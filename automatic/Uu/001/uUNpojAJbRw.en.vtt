00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.420
I'm going to share with you guys how I get ready when I film videos.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.880
When I sleep for more than 8 hours, my left eye will become a monolid.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.880
I'll press a few times to figure out when I should stick the double eyelid tape.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.080
I hate how you can't apply eyeshadow over the double eyelid tape

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.800
so I would use a small pair of scissors to trim it.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.180
When you use double eyelid tape, you really only need a little piece....

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.700
Why is it so fast?!?! D:

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.980
...only need a little piece of tape in the front of your eye.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.920
Then I applied a moisturizer and primer.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.820
When I film, I usually wear thicker makeup so I'll be using foundation and concealer.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.800
On camera, my dark circles are horrifyingly dark -_-

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.520
Regardless of how much sleep I get, my dark circles are dark 365 days a year...sob TT^TT

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.760
I'm going to set my makeup with some powder since my lighting usually makes my face look extra oily.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.060
It's time to fill in my brows~

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.280
I had exams for a few weeks so *sigh*

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.960
so I haven't even bothered to groom my brows. Don't mind them being messy xD

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.040
I filled them in according to my natural shape, then used some brow gel.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.920
When I film lookbook videos, I usually film for at least 6 hours

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.260
so eyeshadow primer is a must.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.240
I mixed these 2 brown / bronze colours and applied it all over my eyelid.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.440
Then I used a dark brown colour.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.180
If you're like me and don't have much eyelid space,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.500
you can apply the brown eyeshadow along your lash line then blend upwards.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.980
I was out of frame when I applied eyeliner.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.700
All I did was a simple cat eye.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.900
I just got mascara on my nose.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.540
I'm going to use this eye stick I got from Korea to highlight my eyes.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.540
It is so convenient!

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.280
You guys know I love my red lipstick!

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.820
When I film, I like to contour my nose.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.640
Although my nose bridge is decently high,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.520
the lighting makes my face look as flat as a piece of paper xD

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.740
That's why I'm going to contour, highlight, and apply blush.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.480
You guys saw that I like to use my fingers to blend things in.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.020
My mom was scared I would get my camera dirty so she gave me these gloves LOL

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.320
Honestly, I'm not good at styling hair at all.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.720
So I simply twisted my hair to one side then added this fascinator.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.900
My hair looked a bit oily so I sprayed some dry shampoo and massaged it.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.740
I sprayed some heat protectant then straightened my hair.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.400
My hair looked flat so I sprayed some hairspray and teased it a bit.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.000
I seriously hate my baby hairs!! It's so freaking annoying -___-

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.780
I sprayed some hairspray on my fingers then fixed them.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.760
My hair looked dry so I sprayed this oil on the ends of my hair.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.740
Time for the second look~ When I film lookbook videos,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.220
I don't remove all my makeup. I simply layer my eyeshadow.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.660
I usually start with brown, then add any colour, and finish it off with black eyeshadow.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.540
I just apply it on like this. Then I used some highlighter on my eyes.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:28.160
When I layer the eyeshadow on, it usually falls onto my mascara and eyeliner.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160
That's why I will reapply it.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.460
I added a bit of dark blue to my lower lashline.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.680
Every time I film at home, my mom would give me food.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.860
Today's menu has this papaya and snow fungus dessert.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.540
I love this dessert â™¥ It's good for your skin too!

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.320
Time for the 3rd look. Like I mentioned before, I'm going to use black eyeshadow now.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.960
To make my eyes pop, I'm going to apply the black eyeshadow on my outer V.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.620
Then I'm applying a highlighter, blue eyeshadow, and touching up my liquid liner.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.260
To achieve a kind of messy look, I'm going to curl my hair.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.880
I simply wrapped my hair around the iron then ran my fingers through it.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.760
I'm done getting ready now!

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.880
This is how I usually get ready for filming.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.740
I hope you guys liked this video. I'll talk to you next time.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.860
Bye bye~
