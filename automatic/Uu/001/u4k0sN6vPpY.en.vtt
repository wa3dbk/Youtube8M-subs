00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
rather quickly just learn to compensate

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.050 
rather quickly just learn to compensate
for<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> height<00:01:19.350> doesn't<00:01:20.009> bother<00:01:20.130> you

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
for in the height doesn't bother you

also<00:01:23.060> it's<00:01:23.359> a<00:01:23.570> heavy<00:01:23.899> bike<00:01:24.229> I<00:01:24.649> think<00:01:25.490> I've

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
also it's a heavy bike I think I've

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.959 
also it's a heavy bike I think I've
weighed<00:01:26.149> mine<00:01:26.420> with<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.630> full<00:01:26.869> tank<00:01:27.079> of<00:01:27.229> gas<00:01:27.969> and

better<00:04:05.090> for<00:04:05.299> pavement<00:04:05.750> riding<00:04:06.639> I<00:04:07.720> don't<00:04:08.720> tend

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
better for pavement riding I don't tend

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.770 
better for pavement riding I don't tend
to<00:04:09.109> ride<00:04:09.349> him<00:04:09.530> more<00:04:09.769> than<00:04:09.950> maybe<00:04:10.159> a<00:04:10.579> hundred<00:04:11.480> or

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
to ride him more than maybe a hundred or

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.170 
to ride him more than maybe a hundred or
so<00:04:11.810> miles<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.530> was<00:04:12.680> shot<00:04:12.920> when<00:04:13.639> I<00:04:13.670> one<00:04:13.939> time<00:04:14.120> I

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
so miles I was shot when I one time I

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.089 
so miles I was shot when I one time I
think<00:04:14.389> we<00:04:14.480> did<00:04:14.629> about<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.900> 200<00:04:15.409> mile<00:04:15.590> day<00:04:15.859> one

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
think we did about a 200 mile day one

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.949 
think we did about a 200 mile day one

mountain roads and stuff
and<00:04:28.330> it<00:04:28.420> did<00:04:28.570> pretty<00:04:28.780> good<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:29.050> haven't<00:04:29.350> I

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
and it did pretty good I haven't I

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.380 
and it did pretty good I haven't I
haven't<00:04:29.830> loaded<00:04:30.250> it<00:04:30.490> down<00:04:30.700> yet<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.030> take<00:04:31.210> like

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
haven't loaded it down yet to take like

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.870 
haven't loaded it down yet to take like
a<00:04:31.540> long<00:04:31.750> droning<00:04:32.470> ride<00:04:32.680> we<00:04:33.460> live<00:04:33.640> in<00:04:33.790> the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
a long droning ride we live in the

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.110 
a long droning ride we live in the
Portland<00:04:34.330> area<00:04:34.800> Oregon<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.040> I'm<00:04:36.820> thinking

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
Portland area Oregon and I'm thinking

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.150 
Portland area Oregon and I'm thinking
about<00:04:37.330> riding<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:37.780> up<00:04:37.900> north<00:04:38.200> of<00:04:38.410> Seattle<00:04:38.980> this

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
about riding it up north of Seattle this

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.870 
about riding it up north of Seattle this
summer<00:04:39.630> but<00:04:40.630> I'll<00:04:40.750> take<00:04:41.650> back<00:04:41.950> roads<00:04:42.190> if<00:04:42.490> I<00:04:42.610> can

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
summer but I'll take back roads if I can

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.550 
summer but I'll take back roads if I can
rather<00:04:43.210> than<00:04:43.450> droning<00:04:43.870> down<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.200> freeway<00:04:44.530> I

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
rather than droning down the freeway I

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.870 
rather than droning down the freeway I
don't<00:04:44.800> think<00:04:45.010> it'd<00:04:45.100> be<00:04:45.250> a<00:04:45.310> fun<00:04:45.640> day<00:04:45.820> with<00:04:45.850> that

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
don't think it'd be a fun day with that

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.180 
don't think it'd be a fun day with that
so<00:04:48.360> all<00:04:49.259> in<00:04:49.470> all<00:04:49.560> if<00:04:49.740> I<00:04:49.800> mean<00:04:49.979> if<00:04:50.099> you're

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190

a great bike I read it I've written the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.920 
a great bike I read it I've written the

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
I will have to stay that the XR 650 L

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.490 
I will have to stay that the XR 650 L
falls<00:05:04.500> right<00:05:04.860> in<00:05:05.130> between<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.759> KLR<00:05:06.240> 650<00:05:06.720> and

the<00:05:11.769> KLR<00:05:12.279> is<00:05:12.429> way<00:05:12.669> better<00:05:13.029> for<00:05:14.039> commute<00:05:15.039> I

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
the KLR is way better for commute I

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:16.739 
the KLR is way better for commute I
don't<00:05:15.549> allow<00:05:15.669> commuting<00:05:16.179> commuting<00:05:16.509> this<00:05:16.599> be

sections<00:05:18.879> and<00:05:19.139> comfortable<00:05:20.139> ride<00:05:20.199> that'd<00:05:20.829> be

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:22.379

the<00:05:21.129> one

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
the one

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.899 
the one

that<00:05:29.409> I've<00:05:29.559> written<00:05:29.769> has<00:05:29.979> great<00:05:30.309> suspension

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
that I've written has great suspension

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:36.059 
that I've written has great suspension
nothing<00:05:32.129> fantastic<00:05:34.439> this<00:05:35.439> bikes<00:05:35.739> a<00:05:35.889> little

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
nothing fantastic this bikes a little

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.249 
nothing fantastic this bikes a little
heavy<00:05:36.399> in<00:05:36.519> the<00:05:37.059> tight<00:05:37.269> stuff<00:05:37.569> off-road<00:05:38.049> like

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
heavy in the tight stuff off-road like

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.979 
heavy in the tight stuff off-road like
the<00:05:38.349> single<00:05:38.619> track<00:05:38.949> and<00:05:39.159> stuff<00:05:39.989> probably

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:40.989 
the single track and stuff probably

00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:43.049 
the single track and stuff probably
because<00:05:41.529> it's<00:05:41.709> tall<00:05:41.949> probably<00:05:42.369> because<00:05:42.879> it's

00:05:43.049 --> 00:05:43.059 
because it's tall probably because it's

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.409 
because it's tall probably because it's
heavy<00:05:43.300> and<00:05:43.569> probably<00:05:43.959> because<00:05:44.289> it's<00:05:44.529> got<00:05:44.769> a

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
heavy and probably because it's got a

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.179 
heavy and probably because it's got a
big<00:05:46.419> engine<00:05:46.839> in<00:05:47.259> it<00:05:47.439> and<00:05:47.619> it's<00:05:47.769> a<00:05:47.889> lot<00:05:48.129> of

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:48.189 
big engine in it and it's a lot of

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:50.100 
big engine in it and it's a lot of
rotating<00:05:48.879> mass<00:05:49.089> so<00:05:49.329> it<00:05:49.419> just<00:05:49.629> doesn't<00:05:49.779> like<00:05:49.989> to

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
rotating mass so it just doesn't like to

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.499 
rotating mass so it just doesn't like to
turn<00:05:50.379> but<00:05:50.649> you<00:05:50.709> do<00:05:51.639> anything<00:05:51.819> like<00:05:51.939> that

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:52.509 
turn but you do anything like that

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:54.509 
turn but you do anything like that
plus<00:05:53.079> the<00:05:53.319> all<00:05:53.589> of<00:05:53.619> that<00:05:53.860> guy<00:05:54.009> yeah<00:05:54.249> see<00:05:54.489> that

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:54.519 
plus the all of that guy yeah see that

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:57.449 
plus the all of that guy yeah see that
thanks<00:05:55.029> for<00:05:55.119> being<00:05:55.329> in<00:05:55.419> my<00:05:55.449> lane<00:05:56.039> at<00:05:57.039> any<00:05:57.219> rate

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:57.459 
thanks for being in my lane at any rate

00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:59.729 
thanks for being in my lane at any rate
so<00:05:57.489> this<00:05:58.179> is<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:58.629> suspension<00:05:59.050> isn't<00:05:59.349> the<00:05:59.499> best

00:05:59.729 --> 00:05:59.739 
so this is the suspension isn't the best

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:02.159 
so this is the suspension isn't the best
on<00:05:59.949> it<00:06:00.099> I<00:06:00.159> did<00:06:00.339> put<00:06:00.519> a<00:06:00.550> superb<00:06:00.939> race<00:06:01.149> fork<00:06:01.899> brace

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
on it I did put a superb race fork brace

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.979 
on it I did put a superb race fork brace
on<00:06:02.409> it<00:06:02.559> and<00:06:03.550> that<00:06:03.909> made<00:06:04.119> a<00:06:04.149> big<00:06:04.389> difference<00:06:04.449> but

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:04.989 
on it and that made a big difference but

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:07.090 
on it and that made a big difference but
I<00:06:05.019> got<00:06:05.199> a<00:06:05.229> lot<00:06:05.439> more<00:06:05.499> feet

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
I got a lot more feet

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.210 
I got a lot more feet
riding<00:06:07.760> on<00:06:07.850> the<00:06:07.970> pavement<00:06:08.450> so<00:06:08.660> off-road<00:06:09.650> it

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
riding on the pavement so off-road it

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.040 
riding on the pavement so off-road it
really<00:06:10.490> helps<00:06:10.760> keep<00:06:11.690> the<00:06:11.870> bike<00:06:12.020> from

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
really helps keep the bike from

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.360 
really helps keep the bike from
wandering<00:06:12.680> so<00:06:13.010> badly<00:06:13.690> but<00:06:14.690> yeah<00:06:15.470> on<00:06:15.740> road<00:06:16.010> yeah

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
wandering so badly but yeah on road yeah

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.310 
wandering so badly but yeah on road yeah
you<00:06:16.520> definitely<00:06:16.790> get<00:06:17.210> more<00:06:17.510> feedback<00:06:17.870> which

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
you definitely get more feedback which

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.750 
you definitely get more feedback which
at<00:06:18.620> first<00:06:19.070> can<00:06:19.250> be<00:06:19.370> a<00:06:19.400> little<00:06:19.640> unnerving<00:06:21.760> so

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
at first can be a little unnerving so

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.740 
at first can be a little unnerving so
