upgrading to an SSD the same process
will<00:00:20.070> be<00:00:20.189> used<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.850> replacing<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.720> hard

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
will be used for replacing the hard

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.470 
will be used for replacing the hard
drive<00:00:22.260> with<00:00:23.010> just<00:00:23.519> another<00:00:23.760> normal<00:00:24.300> hard

the battery this will help us avoid

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
the battery this will help us avoid
electrical<00:00:58.739> problems<00:00:59.100> while<00:00:59.280> we're<00:00:59.489> working

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
electrical problems while we're working

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.090 
electrical problems while we're working
inside<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.270> machine<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:01.379> remove<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> battery

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
inside the machine to remove the battery

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.680 
inside the machine to remove the battery
you<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.430> flip<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.640> over<00:01:02.850> pull<00:01:03.359> these<00:01:03.510> two

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
you just flip it over pull these two

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.870 
you just flip it over pull these two
tabs<00:01:03.930> apart<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.650> then<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> battery<00:01:05.640> just

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
tabs apart and then the battery just

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.780 
tabs apart and then the battery just
lifts<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:12.619> okay<00:01:13.619> now<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:14.040> get<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
lifts right out okay now to get to the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.580 
lifts right out okay now to get to the
hard<00:01:15.030> drive<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.990> take<00:01:16.170> off<00:01:16.380> this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
hard drive we have to take off this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.219 
hard drive we have to take off this
little<00:01:16.890> play<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:17.810> this<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.020> little

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
little play right here this is a little

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.940 
little play right here this is a little
nicer<00:01:19.560> than<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.890> some<00:01:20.310> other<00:01:20.490> laptops<00:01:21.030> because

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
nicer than on some other laptops because

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.080 
nicer than on some other laptops because
on<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.159> machines<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.729> take<00:01:23.909> off

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
on some machines you have to take off

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.460 
on some machines you have to take off
the<00:01:24.240> whole<00:01:24.390> bottom<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.290> there's

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the whole bottom on this one there's

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.770 
the whole bottom on this one there's
just<00:01:25.680> two<00:01:25.830> two<00:01:26.280> screws<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.970> take<00:01:27.150> out

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.480 

these<00:01:33.780> screws<00:01:34.229> won't<00:01:34.710> come<00:01:35.009> all<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> way<00:01:35.369> out

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
these screws won't come all the way out

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.460 
these screws won't come all the way out
because<00:01:35.970> they<00:01:36.119> stay<00:01:36.390> attached<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.140> plate

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
because they stay attached to this plate

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.550 
because they stay attached to this plate
right<00:01:37.680> here<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.750> unscrew<00:01:39.750> them<00:01:40.200> until

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
right here so just unscrew them until

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.170 
right here so just unscrew them until
there<00:01:40.829> they<00:01:41.280> seem<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:41.670> loose<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.030> they're

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
there they seem as loose as they're

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.480 
there they seem as loose as they're
going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> go

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.710 

okay<00:01:47.490> now<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> plate<00:01:47.970> still<00:01:48.270> doesn't<00:01:48.600> come

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
okay now the plate still doesn't come

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.139 
okay now the plate still doesn't come
out<00:01:48.930> because<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.560> held<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:50.009> by<00:01:50.369> tabs<00:01:50.729> along

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
out because it's held in by tabs along

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.870 
out because it's held in by tabs along
the<00:01:51.210> edges<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:51.810> well<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.860> tabs<00:01:53.159> along<00:01:53.399> this

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the edges as well the tabs along this

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.969 
the edges as well the tabs along this
edge<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.659> edge<00:01:54.930> are<00:01:55.320> significantly

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
edge and this edge are significantly

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.160 
edge and this edge are significantly
longer<00:01:56.310> than<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.880> tabs<00:01:57.149> along<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.719> edge<00:01:57.960> in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
longer than the tabs along this edge in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.980 
longer than the tabs along this edge in
this<00:01:58.350> edge<00:01:59.090> so<00:02:00.090> we're<00:02:00.270> going<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> pop<00:02:00.659> these

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
this edge so we're going to pop these

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.179 
this edge so we're going to pop these
edges<00:02:01.380> out<00:02:01.530> first

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
edges out first

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.609 
edges out first
to<00:02:02.729> avoid<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.270> possibility<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.930> breaking<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
to avoid the possibility of breaking the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.690 
to avoid the possibility of breaking the
longer<00:02:05.040> tabs<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.640> are<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.030> these<00:02:06.210> sides<00:02:06.570> here

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
longer tabs that are on these sides here

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.770 
longer tabs that are on these sides here
there's<00:02:08.700> still<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> little<00:02:09.209> bit<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.539> force

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
there's still a little bit of force

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.199 
there's still a little bit of force
required<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.800> kind<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.150> pry<00:02:12.150> it

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
required you just have to kind of pry it

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.730 
required you just have to kind of pry it
up<00:02:12.480> until<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.110> pops

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
up until it pops

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.330 
up until it pops
you'll<00:02:13.860> hear<00:02:14.040> each<00:02:14.220> little<00:02:14.520> tap<00:02:14.730> pop<00:02:15.060> out<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
you'll hear each little tap pop out and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:30.100 
you'll hear each little tap pop out and
you<00:02:17.460> just<00:02:17.580> go<00:02:17.760> along<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.090> edge<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.930> do<00:02:19.110> that

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.240 

okay<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.200> then<00:02:31.350> once<00:02:31.560> those<00:02:31.740> edges<00:02:32.130> are

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
okay and then once those edges are

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.580 
okay and then once those edges are
popped<00:02:32.520> out<00:02:32.730> it's<00:02:33.450> real<00:02:33.900> easy<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.200> get<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
popped out it's real easy to get the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.070 
popped out it's real easy to get the
rest<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.010> out

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
rest of it out

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.750 
rest of it out
okay<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.350> see<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> longer<00:02:38.100> tabs<00:02:38.400> along

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
okay you can see the longer tabs along

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.630 
okay you can see the longer tabs along
this<00:02:38.910> edge

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
this edge

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.250 
this edge
those<00:02:41.640> might<00:02:41.880> break<00:02:42.120> off<00:02:42.330> whereas<00:02:42.810> these<00:02:42.990> are

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
those might break off whereas these are

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260 
those might break off whereas these are
almost<00:02:43.470> just<00:02:43.890> straight<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.700> there's<00:02:45.090> not<00:02:45.210> much

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
almost just straight so there's not much

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.590 
almost just straight so there's not much
to<00:02:45.480> break<00:02:45.840> there<00:02:46.940> all<00:02:47.940> right<00:02:48.090> put<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.300> aside

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
to break there all right put that aside

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.470 
to break there all right put that aside
okay<00:02:49.440> here<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.190> our<00:02:50.490> hard<00:02:50.700> drive<00:02:50.970> right<00:02:51.240> here

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
okay here is our hard drive right here

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.850 
okay here is our hard drive right here
so<00:02:51.720> we're<00:02:51.870> going<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.080> take<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.410> guy<00:02:52.590> out<00:02:52.740> and

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
so we're going to take this guy out and

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.770 
so we're going to take this guy out and
replace<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.340> over<00:02:53.580> here<00:02:53.880> you'll<00:02:54.150> see<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.570> RAM

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
replace it over here you'll see the RAM

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.840 
replace it over here you'll see the RAM
I<00:02:55.020> also<00:02:55.200> did<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.560> video<00:02:55.740> on<00:02:55.950> how<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.250> upgrade<00:02:56.490> the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
RAM on this machine it comes with four

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.270 
RAM on this machine it comes with four
gigs<00:02:59.160> but<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.090> can<00:03:00.270> upgrade<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.840> eight<00:03:01.280> so

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
gigs but you can upgrade it to eight so

to disconnect from that connector we
need<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.360> push<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:49.810> hard<00:03:49.989> drive<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:50.410> way<00:03:50.650> and

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
need to push the hard drive this way and

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.460 
need to push the hard drive this way and
then<00:03:52.120> we<00:03:52.330> need<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.599> pull<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.930> little<00:03:53.049> plastic

pulling<00:03:56.049> it<00:03:56.290> out<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:58.569> that<00:03:58.870> will<00:03:58.989> get<00:03:59.170> us<00:03:59.230> out

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
pulling it out and that will get us out

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.059 
pulling it out and that will get us out
from<00:03:59.739> underneath<00:03:59.980> this<00:04:00.280> guy<00:04:04.379> okay<00:04:05.379> there<00:04:05.980> we

so we need to remove that it's held in
by<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.500> screw<00:04:17.949> on<00:04:18.130> each<00:04:18.280> side<00:04:18.579> so<00:04:18.880> we'll<00:04:19.000> just<00:04:19.150> go

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
by a screw on each side so we'll just go

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:29.040 
by a screw on each side so we'll just go
ahead<00:04:19.329> and<00:04:19.660> remove<00:04:19.810> those<00:04:27.780> okay<00:04:28.780> with<00:04:28.930> those

mounting bracket push it all the way

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:06.969 
mounting bracket push it all the way
back<00:05:04.509> until<00:05:05.509> we<00:05:05.629> have<00:05:05.840> clearance<00:05:06.500> over<00:05:06.830> the

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
back until we have clearance over the

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.830 
back until we have clearance over the
electrical<00:05:07.400> connector<00:05:07.819> then<00:05:08.090> use<00:05:08.419> our<00:05:08.599> pull

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
electrical connector then use our pull

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.260 
electrical connector then use our pull
tab<00:05:09.189> to<00:05:10.189> pull<00:05:10.400> towards<00:05:10.759> the<00:05:10.819> electrical

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
tab to pull towards the electrical

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.510 
tab to pull towards the electrical
connector<00:05:11.689> and<00:05:11.870> line<00:05:12.020> it<00:05:12.050> up<00:05:12.259> we<00:05:13.250> can<00:05:13.400> just

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
connector and line it up we can just

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.279 
connector and line it up we can just
pull<00:05:13.699> it<00:05:13.729> in<00:05:13.909> place<00:05:14.150> until<00:05:14.479> it's<00:05:14.840> connected

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
pull it in place until it's connected

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.800 
pull it in place until it's connected
and<00:05:16.009> then<00:05:16.490> once<00:05:16.699> that's<00:05:16.969> done<00:05:17.240> these<00:05:17.569> two

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
and then once that's done these two

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.010 
and then once that's done these two
screw<00:05:18.139> holes<00:05:18.349> should<00:05:18.590> be<00:05:18.650> lined<00:05:18.949> up<00:05:19.159> so<00:05:19.400> we<00:05:19.520> can

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
screw holes should be lined up so we can

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.209 
screw holes should be lined up so we can
screw<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.139> hard<00:05:21.349> drive<00:05:21.560> back<00:05:21.830> into<00:05:21.889> the

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219 
screw the hard drive back into the

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:31.480 
screw the hard drive back into the
machine<00:05:28.690> okay<00:05:29.690> there<00:05:30.110> we<00:05:30.259> go<00:05:30.289> hard<00:05:31.190> drive

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
machine okay there we go hard drive

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.890 
machine okay there we go hard drive
installed<00:05:31.940> now<00:05:32.180> we'll<00:05:32.300> just<00:05:32.419> put<00:05:32.479> on<00:05:32.750> the

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
installed now we'll just put on the

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.790 
installed now we'll just put on the
mounting<00:05:33.259> the<00:05:33.819> faceplate<00:05:34.819> again<00:05:35.500> this<00:05:36.500> time

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
mounting the faceplate again this time

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.459 
mounting the faceplate again this time
we'll<00:05:37.039> start<00:05:37.310> with<00:05:37.940> the<00:05:38.270> long<00:05:38.449> connectors<00:05:39.110> and

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:39.469 
we'll start with the long connectors and

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:57.279 
we'll start with the long connectors and
then<00:05:39.979> do<00:05:40.250> the<00:05:40.400> short<00:05:40.639> connectors<00:05:56.289> you'll

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
then do the short connectors you'll

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.959 
then do the short connectors you'll
probably<00:05:57.500> have<00:05:57.770> to<00:05:57.800> screw<00:05:58.190> these<00:05:58.340> screws<00:05:58.699> in<00:05:58.879> a

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
probably have to screw these screws in a

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.969 
probably have to screw these screws in a
little<00:05:59.210> bit<00:05:59.360> before<00:05:59.840> the<00:06:00.259> connectors<00:06:00.680> on<00:06:00.830> this

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
little bit before the connectors on this

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:09.850 
little bit before the connectors on this
side<00:06:01.219> will<00:06:01.430> want<00:06:01.610> to<00:06:01.699> pop<00:06:01.940> into<00:06:02.210> place<00:06:08.770> and<00:06:09.770> you

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
side will want to pop into place and you

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:17.079 
side will want to pop into place and you
just<00:06:09.979> push<00:06:10.190> them<00:06:10.310> down<00:06:10.520> until<00:06:10.729> they<00:06:10.940> snap<00:06:16.089> and

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:17.089 
just push them down until they snap and

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:26.170 
just push them down until they snap and
finish<00:06:17.629> screw<00:06:17.930> on<00:06:18.080> the<00:06:18.169> screws<00:06:18.440> in<00:06:24.819> and<00:06:25.819> we

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
finish screw on the screws in and we

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.709 
finish screw on the screws in and we
reinstall<00:06:26.719> our<00:06:26.750> battery<00:06:28.150> and<00:06:29.150> we're<00:06:29.569> done

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:29.719 
reinstall our battery and we're done
