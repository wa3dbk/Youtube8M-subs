00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:07.850
 between the tree and the forest 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.520
 is commonplace among analysts of 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.100
 different type and gender using the 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.300
 expression that by looking at the tree it 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.430
 loses sight of the forest or vice versa 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:23.230
 in front of that is the option to look at 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.930
 both or look something else 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.420
 in this war of conquest is that in 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.960
 the analysis is chosen to look at the tree or the 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.850
 forest the conclusion is the same but 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.690
 there is something according to us the zapatistas 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.610
 that makes this war something special and 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.190
 is that the effects that is producing 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.010
 on the earth and the territory is to say in 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.519
 nature are definitive and 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.800
 irreversible is to say that the planet 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.559
 whole is being destroyed and not 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.350
 we have another place to live so the 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.320
 entire human species is the victim of 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.520
 this war that's why we say it's a 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.520
 war against humanity 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.220
 one for us zapatistas towns 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.369
 Indians of Mexico from America and the world 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.040
 the earth is the mother the life the memory 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.340
 and the rest of our previous the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.100
 house of our culture and our way 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.820
 the earth is our identity in it 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.390
 for her and for her we are without her 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.080
 we die even though we still live 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.260
 2 the earth for us is not only the 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.380
 soil that we tread we sow and on the 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.000
 which our descendants grow the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.260
 earth is also the air that I have made 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.930
 low wind and up our mountains 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.750
 the water that the springs rivers lagoons 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.900
 and life rains are made in our 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.900
 you plant the trees and forests that fruit 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.600
 and shadow are born the birds that dance in 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.270
 the wind and the branches sing the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.910
 animals that grow with us live and 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.260
 they feed the earth is all that 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.379
 we live and die 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.959
 3 the earth for us is not a 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.299
 merchandise in the same way that they are not 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.760
 merchandise human beings nor 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:29.000
 memories or the greetings we give and 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.810
 we receive the earth from our dead 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.459
 it does not belong to us we belong to it 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.690
 we have received the job of being your 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.000
 guardians to take care of protecting her 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.880
 just as she has taken care of us and protected us 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.530
 in these 515 years of pain and resistance 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:53.560
 fourth we are warriors not for 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.730
 defeat and subjugate the different one 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.460
 another place inhabits the other way 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.200
 we are warriors to defend the earth 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:07.840
 our mother our life for us 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.260
 this is the final battle if the earth 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.860
 dies we die we do not have tomorrow 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.110
 for us without the earth 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.610
 he who wants to destroy the earth is all 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.030
 a system 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.210
 that is the enemy to overcome capitalism 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.120
 it's called the enemy 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.860
 fifth we think it is not 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.170
 possible to succeed in this battle 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.120
 if we do not join in the struggle with 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.840
 the other peoples who are like us 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.610
 the color that we are of the earth if not 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.490
 we fight together with others others 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.160
 colors times and modes have but they 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.170
 the same pains hurt 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.380
 we made a word to that thought in the 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.600
 sixth declaration of the Lacandon jungle 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.060
 that's why we walk with the ear and the 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.140
 heart open in the corners of 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.740
 our country to seek and find 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.770
 the wings they say do not mean anymore 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.260
 enough to those who have found that the 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.010
 Your enemy's name is the same as 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.720
 we kill and it hurts 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.810
 sixth 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.290
 we think it is no longer enough 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.320
 just resist and wait for each other 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.480
 command attack or money we believe 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.270
 that the strength that is now needed for 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.569
 surviving is also enough to 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:33.639
 end with the threats is the time 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:37.270
 seventh neither to the tree nor to the forest 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.409
 us as Zapatistas that we are for 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.679
 understand and know what to do 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:45.639
 we look down not in sign of 

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:48.770
 humility not to surrender our dignity 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.319
 but to read and learn what is not 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.229
 has written for which there is no word 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:57.409
 without the feelings to be able to see in 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:00.589
 the earth the roots that hold there 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.930
 up high to the stars freedom and 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:05.680
 justice for attentive freedom and justice 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.680
 for oaxaca
