00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
I think in terms of four new items from

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.100 
I think in terms of four new items from
applebees<00:02:12.239> time<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.780> think

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
applebees time I think

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.020 
applebees time I think
the<00:02:15.110> one<00:02:15.319> that<00:02:15.469> might<00:02:15.680> be<00:02:15.829> the<00:02:16.189> top

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
the one that might be the top

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.050 
the one that might be the top
alternative<00:02:17.629> this<00:02:17.870> time<00:02:18.140> at<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.439> moment<00:02:19.060> will

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
alternative this time at the moment will

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.789 
alternative this time at the moment will
be<00:02:20.090> whether<00:02:21.790> password<00:02:22.790> nano<00:02:23.379> but<00:02:24.379> there<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.650> a

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
be whether password nano but there is a

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.610 
be whether password nano but there is a
big<00:02:24.980> chance<00:02:25.010> in<00:02:25.730> nano<00:02:26.269> because<00:02:26.689> this<00:02:26.959> time<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
big chance in nano because this time the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.990 
big chance in nano because this time the
Nano<00:02:27.829> doesn't<00:02:28.250> have<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.519> cliq<00:02:28.760> wheels

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
Nano doesn't have the cliq wheels

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.470 
Nano doesn't have the cliq wheels
anymore<00:02:29.599> it's<00:02:30.140> very<00:02:30.439> important<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:32.180> nano

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
anymore it's very important the nano

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.380 
anymore it's very important the nano
doesn't<00:02:33.109> have<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.379> cliq<00:02:33.650> drill<00:02:33.890> anymore<00:02:34.390> so

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
doesn't have the cliq drill anymore so

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.890
