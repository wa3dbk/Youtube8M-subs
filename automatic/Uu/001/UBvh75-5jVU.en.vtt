00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
they have it in navy as well now my top

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.220 
they have it in navy as well now my top
is<00:00:46.670> in<00:00:46.819> the<00:00:46.879> size<00:00:47.059> medium<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:47.659> I<00:00:47.809> think<00:00:48.109> it

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
is in the size medium and I think it

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.470 
is in the size medium and I think it
fits<00:00:48.440> pretty<00:00:48.679> well<00:00:48.800> I<00:00:49.249> would<00:00:49.699> say<00:00:49.909> if<00:00:50.059> I<00:00:50.179> got<00:00:50.329> it

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
fits pretty well I would say if I got it

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.329 
fits pretty well I would say if I got it
any<00:00:50.629> smaller<00:00:50.870> I<00:00:51.109> wouldn't<00:00:51.499> want<00:00:51.649> it<00:00:51.739> to<00:00:51.949> be<00:00:52.100> any

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
any smaller I wouldn't want it to be any

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.910 
any smaller I wouldn't want it to be any
shorter<00:00:52.819> because<00:00:53.210> it's<00:00:53.449> pretty<00:00:53.719> um<00:00:54.019> it's<00:00:54.710> kind

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
shorter because it's pretty um it's kind

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.529 
shorter because it's pretty um it's kind
of<00:00:54.949> cropped<00:00:55.339> it's<00:00:55.640> definitely<00:00:56.059> right<00:00:56.269> below

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
of cropped it's definitely right below

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.779 
of cropped it's definitely right below
my<00:00:56.749> belly<00:00:56.960> button<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.530> then<00:00:58.100> I<00:00:58.399> also<00:00:58.609> think

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
my belly button and then I also think

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.239 
my belly button and then I also think
that<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.239> back<00:00:59.449> is<00:00:59.659> a<00:00:59.690> nice<00:00:59.929> size<00:01:00.649> because<00:01:01.129> it

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
that the back is a nice size because it

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.549 
that the back is a nice size because it
has<00:01:01.429> this<00:01:01.699> stretchy<00:01:02.030> elastic<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.289> it<00:01:03.409> can

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
has this stretchy elastic so it can

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.590 
has this stretchy elastic so it can
stretch<00:01:03.859> and<00:01:04.190> I<00:01:04.430> can<00:01:04.610> easily<00:01:04.760> fit<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.239> swimsuit

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
stretch and I can easily fit a swimsuit

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.899 
stretch and I can easily fit a swimsuit
top<00:01:05.990> underneath<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:06.650> as<00:01:06.860> well<00:01:07.070> because<00:01:07.700> it's

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
top underneath this as well because it's

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.640 
top underneath this as well because it's
a<00:01:07.970> little<00:01:08.240> bit<00:01:08.360> looser<00:01:08.780> in<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.049> chest<00:01:09.320> but<00:01:09.620> I

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
a little bit looser in the chest but I

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.320 
a little bit looser in the chest but I
like<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:10.040> that<00:01:10.159> way<00:01:10.280> because<00:01:10.490> again<00:01:10.640> I<00:01:10.909> like<00:01:11.210> to
