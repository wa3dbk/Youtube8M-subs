00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.600 
ahead and create your bow
so<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.959> create<00:02:17.170> your<00:02:17.349> bow<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.680> need<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.190> make<00:02:18.370> a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
so to create your bow you need to make a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.270 
so to create your bow you need to make a
loop<00:02:18.940> with<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.420> strand<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.800> loop<00:02:21.040> with

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
loop with this strand and a loop with

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.309 
loop with this strand and a loop with
this<00:02:21.400> strand<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.720> just<00:02:22.870> wrap<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.140> around

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
this strand so you just wrap it around

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.390 
this strand so you just wrap it around
your<00:02:23.650> fingers<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.819> create<00:02:25.180> two<00:02:25.660> loops<00:02:26.340> now<00:02:27.340> you

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
your fingers to create two loops now you

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.699 
your fingers to create two loops now you
want<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.760> tie<00:02:27.970> balloons<00:02:28.239> into<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.840> knot<00:02:29.140> now<00:02:29.500> I'm

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
want to tie balloons into a knot now I'm

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.100 
want to tie balloons into a knot now I'm
sure<00:02:29.950> all<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.940> already<00:02:31.120> know<00:02:31.420> how<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.660> create

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
sure all you already know how to create

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.520 
sure all you already know how to create
a<00:02:32.459> boo<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:34.030> with<00:02:34.450> your<00:02:34.569> hijab<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.110> lot<00:02:35.290> hot

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
a boo and with your hijab it's a lot hot

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.740 
a boo and with your hijab it's a lot hot
but<00:02:35.800> just<00:02:36.069> do<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.849> same<00:02:37.090> way<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.360> would<00:02:37.599> do

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
but just do it the same way you would do

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.010 
but just do it the same way you would do
it<00:02:37.780> with<00:02:37.900> any<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.530> our<00:02:38.680> ribbon<00:02:39.340> or<00:02:39.700> lace<00:02:40.030> or

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
it with any of our ribbon or lace or

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.400 
it with any of our ribbon or lace or
whatever

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
whatever

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.710 
whatever
once<00:02:42.129> it's<00:02:42.310> hide<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:42.819> you<00:02:43.000> shouldn't<00:02:43.360> end<00:02:43.569> up

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
once it's hide that you shouldn't end up

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.330 
once it's hide that you shouldn't end up
with<00:02:43.900> something<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.440> looks<00:02:44.590> nothing<00:02:45.069> like

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
with something that looks nothing like

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.940 
with something that looks nothing like
it's<00:02:45.879> boo<00:02:46.120> but<00:02:46.840> then<00:02:46.989> you<00:02:47.080> just<00:02:47.230> want<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.470> turn

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
it's boo but then you just want to turn

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.580 
it's boo but then you just want to turn
around<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.000> your<00:02:49.300> bow<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.720> on<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.260> front

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
around so that your bow is on the front

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.820 
around so that your bow is on the front
you'll<00:02:51.220> loop<00:02:51.430> side<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.819> front<00:02:52.530> nice<00:02:53.530> shutting

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
you'll loop side the front nice shutting

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.130 
you'll loop side the front nice shutting
ups<00:02:54.010> with<00:02:54.160> something<00:02:54.519> like<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.360> this<00:02:55.959> is

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
ups with something like this and this is

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.360 
ups with something like this and this is
the<00:02:56.230> point<00:02:56.410> where<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.769> want<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.010> just<00:02:57.129> play

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
the point where you want to just play

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.339 
the point where you want to just play
around<00:02:57.400> with<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.120> loops<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.660> make<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.050> into<00:02:59.319> a

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
around with the loops and make it into a

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.479 
around with the loops and make it into a
perfect<00:02:59.650> boat

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
perfect boat

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.509 
perfect boat
I'm<00:03:01.030> just<00:03:01.239> gonna<00:03:01.360> roughly<00:03:02.040> play<00:03:03.040> around<00:03:03.340> with

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
I'm just gonna roughly play around with

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.320 
I'm just gonna roughly play around with
it<00:03:03.730> get<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.390> way<00:03:04.510> our<00:03:04.660> like<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:07.030> can<00:03:07.209> make

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
it get it the way our like you can make

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.910 
it get it the way our like you can make
the<00:03:07.480> loops<00:03:07.780> as<00:03:07.989> big<00:03:08.170> or<00:03:08.260> as<00:03:08.319> small<00:03:08.440> as<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:08.890> like

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
the loops as big or as small as you like

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.009 
the loops as big or as small as you like
put<00:03:09.819> your<00:03:09.940> finger<00:03:10.269> through<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.630> loop<00:03:10.810> and

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
put your finger through the loop and

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.630 
put your finger through the loop and
sort<00:03:11.410> of<00:03:11.470> spread<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.069> open<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.459> bit<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.519> is

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
sort of spread it open a bit so this is

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.670 
sort of spread it open a bit so this is
just<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:16.000> rough<00:03:16.299> though<00:03:16.690> that<00:03:16.989> I'm<00:03:17.080> using<00:03:17.290> with

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
just a rough though that I'm using with

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.949 
just a rough though that I'm using with
half<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.849> mirror<00:03:20.340> okay<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:21.510> that's<00:03:22.510> pretty<00:03:22.780> much

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
half a mirror okay so that's pretty much

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.140 
half a mirror okay so that's pretty much
it<00:03:23.200> guys<00:03:23.230> it's<00:03:23.530> really<00:03:23.739> simple<00:03:24.340> but<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.849> just

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
it guys it's really simple but it just

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.759 
it guys it's really simple but it just
depends<00:03:25.510> on<00:03:25.690> how<00:03:25.750> much<00:03:26.200> time<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:26.500> actually

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
depends on how much time you actually

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.890 
depends on how much time you actually
have<00:03:27.099> to<00:03:27.250> create<00:03:27.549> this<00:03:27.790> style<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.660> hope<00:03:28.780> you
