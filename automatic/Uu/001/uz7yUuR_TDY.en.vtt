00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and F number six we have the unicorn now

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.499

Elvis<00:01:49.140> pose<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.590> oblivion<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.670> guess<00:01:50.850> this

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
Elvis pose for oblivion and I guess this

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.300 
Elvis pose for oblivion and I guess this
is<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.450> its<00:01:51.630> descendant<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.320> something<00:01:52.770> but

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
is like its descendant or something but

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.850 
is like its descendant or something but
it's<00:01:53.759> actually<00:01:54.119> very<00:01:54.390> beautiful<00:01:54.540> very<00:01:55.110> pale

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it's actually very beautiful very pale

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
like having this one around enough

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.029 
like having this one around enough
number<00:02:05.610> five<00:02:05.820> we<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.930> dark<00:02:07.380> version<00:02:07.710> of

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
number five we have the dark version of

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.669 
number five we have the dark version of
the<00:02:08.129> unicorn<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:09.119> black<00:02:09.569> armored<00:02:10.170> unicorn

now<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.489> one<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.670> guess<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> more

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
now this one I guess is a more

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.900 
now this one I guess is a more
more<00:02:13.150> demonic<00:02:13.569> more<00:02:14.560> warlike<00:02:14.920> version<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.819> the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
more demonic more warlike version of the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.000 
more demonic more warlike version of the
unicorn<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.599> that<00:02:17.290> actually<00:02:17.769> looks<00:02:17.920> pretty

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
unicorn and that actually looks pretty

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.540 
unicorn and that actually looks pretty
cool<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:19.090> goes<00:02:19.599> very<00:02:19.840> very<00:02:20.260> fast<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.129> you

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
cool and it goes very very fast so you

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.100 
cool and it goes very very fast so you
know<00:02:21.670> if<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.910> prefer<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.330> have<00:02:22.360> more<00:02:22.660> evil

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
know if you prefer to have more evil

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.350 
know if you prefer to have more evil
pets<00:02:23.410> around<00:02:23.620> then<00:02:24.430> yeah<00:02:24.879> that's<00:02:25.000> going<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.300> be

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
pets around then yeah that's going to be

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.210 
pets around then yeah that's going to be
a<00:02:25.390> good<00:02:25.569> bet<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.080> that's<00:02:26.500> number<00:02:26.709> 4<00:02:27.099> we<00:02:27.190> have

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
a good bet and that's number 4 we have

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.540 
a good bet and that's number 4 we have
Seth<00:02:27.849> I<00:02:28.090> which<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.750> another<00:02:29.380> armored<00:02:29.920> horse

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
Seth I which is another armored horse

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.059 
Seth I which is another armored horse
and<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.420> one<00:02:31.690> kind<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.260> makes<00:02:32.470> me<00:02:32.650> think<00:02:32.950> of

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
and this one kind of makes me think of

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.910 
and this one kind of makes me think of
the<00:02:33.550> Tyrells<00:02:34.090> from<00:02:34.690> Game<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.900> Thrones<00:02:35.019> I<00:02:35.560> don't

know<00:02:35.980> why<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.190> think<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.670> because<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.269> the

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
know why I think it's because of the

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.110 
know why I think it's because of the
sigil<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.620> its<00:02:38.799> saddle<00:02:39.190> it's<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.700> know<00:02:39.819> green
