00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.190 
stomach and then up so then your beads
flop<00:02:14.340> over<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.240> it's<00:02:15.360> all<00:02:15.540> about<00:02:15.569> having<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
flop over so it's all about having the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.470 
flop over so it's all about having the
little<00:02:16.410> bits<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.830> hang<00:02:17.010> off<00:02:17.130> your<00:02:17.700> beads<00:02:17.880> so

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
little bits that hang off your beads so

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.390 
little bits that hang off your beads so
you<00:02:18.569> can<00:02:18.720> make<00:02:18.840> more<00:02:18.990> sound<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:20.100> do<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
you can make more sound and you do the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.020 
you can make more sound and you do the

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
you first see that first group is ever

you first see that first group is ever
as<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.760> say<00:03:06.000> here's<00:03:06.569> so<00:03:06.750> much<00:03:06.900> about<00:03:07.200> Grevy's

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
as I say here's so much about Grevy's

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.680 
as I say here's so much about Grevy's
zebras<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.280> apply<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.180> things<00:03:09.450> and

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
zebras in and apply it and things and

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.240 
zebras in and apply it and things and
working<00:03:09.840> here<00:03:10.140> with<00:03:10.290> planes<00:03:10.560> ever<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.040> stuff

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
working here with planes ever and stuff

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.460 
working here with planes ever and stuff
to<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:12.120> see<00:03:12.330> one<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.720> sort<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.959> had<00:03:13.079> to<00:03:13.170> double

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
to to see one you sort of had to double

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.930 
to to see one you sort of had to double
take<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.680> make<00:03:13.920> sure<00:03:14.100> hang<00:03:14.280> one<00:03:14.400> no<00:03:14.519> no<00:03:14.670> no<00:03:14.730> it

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
take to make sure hang one no no no it

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.580 
take to make sure hang one no no no it
is<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> Grevy's<00:03:15.450> zebra<00:03:15.720> I'm<00:03:15.780> seeing<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.320> you

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
is a Grevy's zebra I'm seeing and you

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.930 
is a Grevy's zebra I'm seeing and you
know<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:16.920> just<00:03:16.950> sort<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.280> get<00:03:17.400> lost<00:03:17.610> with<00:03:17.820> it

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
know it just sort of get lost with it

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.670 
know it just sort of get lost with it
for<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.150> second<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.959> think<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.380> probably<00:03:19.470> took

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
for a second so I think I probably took

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.990 
for a second so I think I probably took
about<00:03:19.739> three<00:03:20.130> hundred<00:03:20.160> photos<00:03:20.549> of<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.820> first

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
about three hundred photos of the first

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.880 
about three hundred photos of the first
one<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.150> saw<00:03:21.360> sir<00:03:21.720> livestock's<00:03:22.410> reduced<00:03:22.739> quite

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
one I saw sir livestock's reduced quite

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.370 
one I saw sir livestock's reduced quite
a<00:03:22.950> bit<00:03:23.100> over<00:03:23.190> last<00:03:23.430> year's<00:03:23.640> with<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.940> drought

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
a bit over last year's with the drought

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.600 
a bit over last year's with the drought
and<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:25.560> for<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> long<00:03:26.100> time<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.310> was<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.519> only

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
and that for a long time I was the only

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.550 
and that for a long time I was the only
way<00:03:26.730> people<00:03:26.760> could<00:03:27.090> earn<00:03:27.390> an<00:03:27.480> income<00:03:27.600> but<00:03:28.350> now

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
way people could earn an income but now

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.560 
way people could earn an income but now
with<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.280> beads<00:03:29.610> coming<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.120> there's

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
with the beads coming in there's

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
with the beads coming in there's
probably<00:03:30.660> not<00:03:30.930> as<00:03:31.079> much<00:03:31.110> pressure<00:03:31.440> on

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
probably not as much pressure on

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.870 
probably not as much pressure on
families<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.190> try<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.489> increase<00:03:32.670> their

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
families to try and increase their

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.210 
families to try and increase their
livestock<00:03:33.209> numbers<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.380> means<00:03:34.769> reduced

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
livestock numbers so that means reduced

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.970 
livestock numbers so that means reduced
livestock<00:03:35.670> lorem<00:03:36.600> grazing<00:03:37.440> area<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.799> more

livestock lorem grazing area in more

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.949 
livestock lorem grazing area in more
water<00:03:38.160> for<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.459> wildlife<00:03:38.880> now<00:03:39.120> add<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:39.660> more

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
water for the wildlife now add a more

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.750 
water for the wildlife now add a more
permanent<00:03:40.260> income<00:03:40.739> source<00:03:41.040> for<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.340> families

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
permanent income source for the families

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.970 
permanent income source for the families
as<00:03:41.910> well<00:03:41.940> using<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> beads<00:03:42.829> basically<00:03:43.829> the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
as well using the beads basically the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.310 
as well using the beads basically the
money<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.579> women<00:03:44.880> get<00:03:45.060> as<00:03:45.750> part<00:03:46.109> of<00:03:46.200> the
