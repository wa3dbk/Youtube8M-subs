 I wanted to start the video of a 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.779
 way a little bit more special not 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.610

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.410

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.440
 I hope you stay to see it and that you 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:43.070
 like it or not because I want to teach some 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.289
 how many things from different stores and 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.300
 well I'll start with sheen site days 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.570
 in sight I will show you two coats 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.160
 two jackets coats good but it's that 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.750
 I'm completely in love 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.489
 the first thing is this coat that good that 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.260
 Although it does not look good here, you will see it 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.760
 everything and everything, nothing more than a coat 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.160
 very very beautiful although there is still no 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.450
 come here the cold I do not know if it has 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.829
 thought about getting there because he's doing 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.570
 better than in summer but good what 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.280
 phenomenal encounter when cool 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.350
 more has little lamb here and in the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.780
 hat from two colors of navy blue and 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.930
 green and military the details have them 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.700
 golden and I think it's very beautiful and 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.620
 then this other one that is the one that most 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.450
 like it's like a parka 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.509
 but instead of military green 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.759
 in a color like khaki and the sleeves are 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.710
 of leatherette and then we have the hat 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.590
 with pelito also a detail that 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.990
 like to teach is that in the part of 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.539
 the waist inside after these two 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.700
 ropes on both sides with which 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.860
 you can adjust the waist and then to that 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.869
 do the way we see super super 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.659
 nice this is a little less warm 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.479
 that the other and then in new from I picked up 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.420
 this other jacket and everything all everything 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.920
 lined with a super soft little hair is 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.470
 pretty chubby I think it 's 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.750
 first it will not be great and good 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.380
 you can adjust it with these strings to the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.909
 waist like the other and for fabrics have 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.679
 very cool details that you are going to 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.679
 see now then also these brushes 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:09.380
 what are these five brushes we have the 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.180
 to apply powders or blushers we have 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.420
 this one that ends in tip that I use it 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.019
 for the bronzer then we also have 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.510
 the skunk we also have as if it were 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:24.209
 a beveled skunk and then we have 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.760
 the same but tiny as 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.239
 we have the iced vis the skunk one for 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.860
 blend and good if they these 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.250
 I asked for gaps because for example 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.319
 this brush came great to blur 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.530
 when you do a makeup with 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.620
 shadows and because to blur it had no 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.780
 none and has also asked me because I 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.840
 came the skunk I had the skunk before 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.870
 of deliplus but one day without wanting to 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.430
 burn a little bit do not ask how the 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.099
 intention cut with the keys to 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.230
 activity looks good and now this one is 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.450
 wrong then it would be a skunk in 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.840
 conditions and like this one so they came 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.060
 lots of super cool brushes 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.040
 I decided to catch me I'm delighted they are 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.989
 super soft I washed them and they were not 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.970
 the hairs fall, squeezing and they do not fall 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.900
 the hairs and also the price is 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.030
 amazing 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.040
 these are recommended and more and by 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.920
 last in iufro he asked me this 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.660
 you will ask if you want them kiss and how 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.850
 now 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.490

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.420

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.340

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.910
 on the wall that serves as your calendar 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.800

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.270
