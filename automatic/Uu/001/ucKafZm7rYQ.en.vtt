 for Monday's game of this game 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.250
 we had opportunities because we did not go 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.250
 forceful 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.230
 I think that operation was not the 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.869
 appropriate the changes came in too 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.529
 very good but good when it is not reflected 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.840
 what you do on the court on the scoreboard 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.620
 unfortunately no no no no one can not 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.790
 qualify it as good 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.790
 they remain soler df 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.460
 hello good night I wanted to know how 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.559
 is Marquez who seemed to be 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.170
 retired with new physical problems and 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.540
 if you are concerned about a possible lowering of the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.980
 face the next matches given the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.930
 experience that has the importance in 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.360
 the admiral grau because see what 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.680
 results of the ticket doctor felt 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.340
 there is a discomfort in the left leg 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 when he stretched to score a ball and 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.019
 good did not want to risk more and what 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.300
 let's go let's wait for the verdict of 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.040

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.979
 a study to find out how it is 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.410
 One night is Miguel 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.900
 it is good or bad the point against 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.760
 Bolivia that was taken for granted 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.249
 of course we did not win no 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.869

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.670
 have to play against Chile and against 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.929
 Ecuador are all the rivals that are 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.069
 on average 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.219
 we come to look for the result 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:39.799
 try that we tried the whole game 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:43.069

 we were forceful we are very 

00:01:55.129 --> 00:02:00.459
 aware of that and that's what we 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.170
 lack of forcefulness the form of 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:05.629

 or because his anger is with the way 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.250
 that you come to a tournament that is important 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.360
 which is that the teams have to leave 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.070
 to win if you are going to look for a point and 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.410
 the two teams are left with the times 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.410
 strong of the other teams especially 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.660
 the strongest is the local 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.790
 only in this game are you supposed to 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.940

 reiterated we rate our our 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.570
 today he went through not having the forcefulness 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.850
 we wanted roberto carrasco from usb 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.160
 radio 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.140

 consult you regarding the next 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.550
 match to the Chilean team that yesterday 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.590
 won 2 to 0 the opening a result 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.120
 that complicated the selection enough 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.550
 of jorge sampaoli as analyst that 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.340
 next game and this Monday we are going 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.190
 to first pass them the bitter drink of 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.920
 today to be unable to get the result 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.170
 that we came to look for but above all 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.990
 raise the boy I see it well the 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.080
 attitude are very good and I reiterate all 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.300
 they are very committed to taking out is the 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.740
 commitment that we were looking for is going to 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.640
 be a difficult match with partners 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.930
 local a strong team but not 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.610
 we have another more to keep adding 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.989
 points 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.030
 Gonzalo Perez lived 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.120
 good night teacher that is what 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.940
 he is more concerned about his team facing 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.019
 commitment to the Chilean team that in 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.450
 the lack of goal 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.269
 the problem in the midfield the injury 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.940
 Maybe Marquez is not the lack of 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.180
 forcefulness because he arrived arrived the 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.100
 front shots were there had 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.500
 to kick from a distance of 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.810
 enduring we did not hit the goal there 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.650
 out there two or three hand balls to 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.710
 hand that instead of making the conclusion 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.690
 of the play as it was suddenly seen 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.220
 we failed to throw it on one side 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.830
 archer gave is a couple of balls 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.510
 neither was the figure us sure 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.479
 that we fail mode the headbutt gets up 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.660
 just raul and when it seems to be that already bad 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:51.919
 for inside the ball goes to one side 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.919
 to the Núñez de Babel Mexico 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.260
 Miguel Goodnight during the 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.510
 yesterday's conference you mentioned that the 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.870
 midfield was the doubt that most you 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.090
 I jumped you're from this one you thought 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.460
 satisfied what I javier when 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.510
 I left today very good very good boy 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:15.250
 I remove balls neighborhood and passed the ball 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.390
 well did a great job labaque and the 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.520
 doubt is that both of them had been doing it 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.770
 pretty good and good at the end we 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.200
 we decided on javier and I think he did 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.530
 well that's fine it's a great job in the 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.510
 recovery of the ball and the truth 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:33.100
 that out there did not pass the game went through 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:35.590
 reiterated the last the last the last 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.140
 pass or the last shot to the goal 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.750
 so he did not jump one last question 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:44.360
 gonzález gálvez from adn radio 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.979
 minutes 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.979
 this radio adn 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.310
 Thank you 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:01.810
 your press conference 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.810
 we realize just at the moment in which 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.310
 something more familiar encounter having 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.810
 in front of mexico considering since he saw 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.020
 its directed that day 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:15.319
 I think we're going to really work 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:18.229
 for how he is playing chile they are 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:20.750
 teams have skilled players in 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:25.539
 the situation of alexis which is a type 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:28.130
 very very unbalancing that I think today 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:31.430
 it complicated us a little bit the aerial ball 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.590
 in him in the divided because bolivia 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.389
 has very high people thing that out there 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.569
 Chilean is very similar to us 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:40.340
 then we will try to try to 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.139
 overcome a bit but he reiterated a 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.539
 very difficult match and we are going to 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.940
 concentrate very well to take away the 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.550
 ball the important thing will be able to be 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.690
 forceful 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.690
 thanks nights
