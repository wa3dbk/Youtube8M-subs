ready<00:01:59.120> 3<00:01:59.720> 2<00:01:59.780> 1<00:02:00.050> go

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
ready 3 2 1 go

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.260 
ready 3 2 1 go
we'll<00:02:00.890> have<00:02:01.010> one<00:02:01.220> figure<00:02:01.550> for<00:02:01.850> each<00:02:01.970> computer

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
we'll have one figure for each computer

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.840 
we'll have one figure for each computer
MIT<00:02:02.570> can<00:02:02.659> compare<00:02:02.930> between<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.200> three<00:02:03.470> great

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
MIT can compare between the three great

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.330 
MIT can compare between the three great
so<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.180> Sony<00:02:05.540> with<00:02:05.870> its<00:02:06.020> speedy<00:02:06.560> core<00:02:06.800> i7

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
so the Sony with its speedy core i7

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.790 
so the Sony with its speedy core i7
processor<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.330> a

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
processor and a

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.210 
processor and a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
Rahm appeared unfazed by our test see if

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.910 
Rahm appeared unfazed by our test see if

video the mp3 fathers don't know it's

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.680 
video the mp3 fathers don't know it's
two<00:02:19.300> minutes<00:02:19.450> 53<00:02:19.930> seconds<00:02:20.490> okay<00:02:21.600> we<00:02:22.600> don't

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
two minutes 53 seconds okay we don't

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.260 
two minutes 53 seconds okay we don't
know<00:02:22.810> whether<00:02:22.930> that's<00:02:23.080> good<00:02:23.380> or<00:02:23.410> bad

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270

yeah<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.060> Sony<00:02:28.330> had<00:02:28.600> been<00:02:28.840> pretty<00:02:29.140> fast

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
yeah that the Sony had been pretty fast

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.860 
yeah that the Sony had been pretty fast
we<00:02:29.950> moved<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.400> our<00:02:30.580> next<00:02:30.730> contender<00:02:31.510> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
we moved on to our next contender the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.410 
we moved on to our next contender the
27-inch<00:02:32.590> iMac<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.400> that's<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.940> course<00:02:33.970> I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
27-inch iMac and that's of course I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.200 
27-inch iMac and that's of course I
meant<00:02:34.630> moving<00:02:34.900> on<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:35.140> apple<00:02:35.470> HQ<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:37.090> you're

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
meant moving on to apple HQ so you're

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.840 
meant moving on to apple HQ so you're
looking<00:02:37.270> at<00:02:37.480> 2.7<00:02:38.440> gigahertz<00:02:38.740> Intel<00:02:39.580> i5

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
looking at 2.7 gigahertz Intel i5

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.790 
looking at 2.7 gigahertz Intel i5
processor<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:40.810> also<00:02:40.960> got<00:02:41.230> full<00:02:41.440> gig<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.770> ram

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
processor it's also got full gig of ram

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.860 
processor it's also got full gig of ram
and<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.910> has<00:02:43.180> two<00:02:44.910> it's<00:02:45.910> two<00:02:46.330> times<00:02:46.570> faster

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
and it has two it's two times faster

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.590 
and it has two it's two times faster
than<00:02:47.620> USB<00:02:47.800> 3<00:02:48.310> which<00:02:48.550> is<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.790> fastest<00:02:49.210> we've

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
than USB 3 which is the fastest we've

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.020 
than USB 3 which is the fastest we've
seen<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.080> just<00:02:50.920> be<00:02:51.070> free<00:02:51.370> yeah<00:02:53.700> just<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> size

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
seen so just be free yeah just the size

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.970 
seen so just be free yeah just the size
of<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.240> screen<00:02:55.420> it's<00:02:56.080> actually<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.560> clarity

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
of the screen it's actually the clarity

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.160 
of the screen it's actually the clarity
of<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.220> actually<00:02:57.820> higher<00:02:58.000> than<00:02:58.030> HD<00:02:58.570> quality

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
of it actually higher than HD quality

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.910 
of it actually higher than HD quality
it's<00:02:59.650> to<00:03:00.370> 560<00:03:00.880> by<00:03:01.000> 1600<00:03:01.810> pixels<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.800> you're

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
it's to 560 by 1600 pixels so you're

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.260 
it's to 560 by 1600 pixels so you're
looking<00:03:02.980> at<00:03:03.160> something<00:03:03.220> that's<00:03:03.670> pretty

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
looking at something that's pretty

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.250 
looking at something that's pretty
special

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.320 

so<00:03:11.260> back<00:03:11.710> in<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:12.010> van<00:03:12.220> we<00:03:12.550> put<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.910> iMac

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
so back in the van we put the iMac

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.510 
so back in the van we put the iMac
through<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.690> same<00:03:13.900> test<00:03:14.200> as<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.590> sony<00:03:14.950> but

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
through the same test as the sony but

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.020 
through the same test as the sony but
how

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
how

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.770 
how
I'd<00:03:16.420> go<00:03:16.750> visit<00:03:18.060> dismiss<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.270> video<00:03:19.569> been

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
I'd go visit dismiss that video been

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.870 
I'd go visit dismiss that video been
jittery<00:03:20.230> little<00:03:20.560> bit<00:03:20.950> so<00:03:21.220> I<00:03:21.280> think<00:03:21.550> some<00:03:21.700> sat

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
jittery little bit so I think some sat

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.030 
jittery little bit so I think some sat
on<00:03:22.060> something<00:03:22.300> it<00:03:22.900> was<00:03:23.050> kind<00:03:23.350> of<00:03:23.410> struggling<00:03:23.770> a

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
on something it was kind of struggling a

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.160 
on something it was kind of struggling a
little<00:03:24.250> bit<00:03:24.430> with<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.270> processor<00:03:25.810> intensive

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
little bit with the processor intensive

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.130 
little bit with the processor intensive
applications<00:03:26.860> how<00:03:27.490> many<00:03:27.670> bad<00:03:27.880> days<00:03:28.120> one<00:03:28.990> to

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
applications how many bad days one to

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.760 
applications how many bad days one to
make<00:03:29.260> sense

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
make sense

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.510 
make sense
stop

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
stop

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.690 
stop
three<00:03:32.450> minutes<00:03:32.750> 23<00:03:33.130> really<00:03:34.130> yeah<00:03:34.430> I'm<00:03:34.550> really

surprised to you quicken that with an

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.990 
surprised to you quicken that with an
older<00:03:41.600> Core<00:03:41.810> i5<00:03:41.990> processor<00:03:42.260> an<00:03:43.160> inferior<00:03:43.700> 4

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
older Core i5 processor an inferior 4

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.090 
older Core i5 processor an inferior 4
gig<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.330> ram<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.780> iMac<00:03:45.230> was<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.440> full<00:03:45.770> 30

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
gig of ram the iMac was a full 30

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.990 
gig of ram the iMac was a full 30
seconds<00:03:46.640> slower<00:03:46.910> than<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.240> Sony<00:03:48.070> so<00:03:49.070> test<00:03:49.610> 2

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
seconds slower than the Sony so test 2

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.710 
seconds slower than the Sony so test 2
completed<00:03:50.930> but<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.860> appears<00:03:52.310> we<00:03:52.700> had<00:03:52.880> company

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
completed but it appears we had company

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.590 
completed but it appears we had company
only<00:03:54.440> on<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:55.250> Apple<00:03:55.520> Campus<00:03:55.730> did<00:03:56.420> we

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
only on the Apple Campus did we

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.990 
only on the Apple Campus did we
encounter<00:03:57.170> security<00:03:57.950> guards<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.460> just<00:03:58.910> thought

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
encounter security guards I just thought

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.880 
encounter security guards I just thought
it<00:03:59.120> was<00:03:59.180> very<00:03:59.450> interesting<00:04:00.110> look<00:04:00.680> when

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
it was very interesting look when

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.850 
it was very interesting look when
compass<00:04:01.310> within<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:02.240> iPhone<00:04:02.750> all<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.470> iPad

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
compass within the iPhone all the iPad

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.160 
compass within the iPhone all the iPad
is<00:04:04.460> exactly<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.240> same<00:04:05.510> obsession<00:04:06.110> of

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
is exactly the same obsession of

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.900 
is exactly the same obsession of
security<00:04:06.710> that<00:04:06.860> we've<00:04:06.950> found<00:04:07.160> physically

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
security that we've found physically

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.270 
security that we've found physically
visiting<00:04:08.750> Apple's<00:04:09.080> Silicon<00:04:09.650> Valley<00:04:09.770> HQ

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
visiting Apple's Silicon Valley HQ

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.520 
visiting Apple's Silicon Valley HQ
extraordinary<00:04:11.120> it's<00:04:12.020> been<00:04:12.200> good

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
nice on paper the Zeus was the least

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.150 
nice on paper the Zeus was the least

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
powerful of our three computers but how

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.520 
powerful of our three computers but how
would<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:10.340> cope<00:05:10.610> with<00:05:10.850> our<00:05:10.970> test<00:05:11.270> three<00:05:11.810> two

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
would it cope with our test three two

would it cope with our test three two
one<00:05:13.130> go

I<00:05:14.400> look<00:05:14.940> at<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.090> video<00:05:17.300> so<00:05:18.300> its<00:05:18.420> ability<00:05:18.600> to

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
I look at the video so its ability to

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.980 
I look at the video so its ability to
multitask<00:05:19.980> is<00:05:20.580> been<00:05:21.090> compromised<00:05:21.540> yeah<00:05:21.780> yeah

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
multitask is been compromised yeah yeah

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.980 
multitask is been compromised yeah yeah
ninety-four<00:05:22.770> percent<00:05:22.970> but<00:05:23.970> already<00:05:24.270> it

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
ninety-four percent but already it

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.360 
ninety-four percent but already it
hasn't<00:05:25.260> finished<00:05:25.440> yet<00:05:25.680> and<00:05:25.830> it's<00:05:26.100> it's

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
hasn't finished yet and it's it's

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.370 
hasn't finished yet and it's it's
already<00:05:26.670> the<00:05:26.790> slowest<00:05:27.210> at<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.450> free<00:05:27.720> well

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
already the slowest at the free well

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.600 
already the slowest at the free well
that<00:05:28.530> has<00:05:28.740> to<00:05:28.890> be<00:05:28.980> because<00:05:29.250> it's<00:05:29.400> got<00:05:29.520> the

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
that has to be because it's got the

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.520 
that has to be because it's got the
least<00:05:29.760> powerful<00:05:30.000> processor<00:05:30.600> yeah<00:05:30.960> I<00:05:31.170> think<00:05:31.440> I

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
least powerful processor yeah I think I

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.520 
least powerful processor yeah I think I
think<00:05:31.680> that's<00:05:31.770> what<00:05:31.980> it's<00:05:32.100> at<00:05:32.250> 99%

that video is it from the time I was

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.990 
that video is it from the time I was
still<00:05:58.500> moving<00:05:58.650> but<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.340> video<00:05:59.580> itself<00:05:59.850> is

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
still moving but the video itself is

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.250 
still moving but the video itself is
frozen<00:06:00.270> its<00:06:00.660> killed<00:06:00.930> it

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260
