 offers a siri test on iphone 5 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.150
 you know maybe but since ayo and 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.890
 6 syria has been made available on 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.109
 a lot of new devices and he has 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.460
 been greatly improved here you see 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.900
 that I can select a language 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.390
 among a large list 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.039
 I selected French and we 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.050
 will be interested in this video 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.000
 the new features of syria 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.739
 who came with a bone 6 compared 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.250
 to the one that was already available on 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.450
 iphone 4s with ios 5 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.340
 first novelty of syria that I you 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.329
 presents the possibility of opening 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.860
 applications opens the settings and sees 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.660
 Syria has indeed opened the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.860
 settings and so we can use this 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.870
 function for all applications 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.250
 opens tiny wings up the application 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.960
 opens so you can really 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.280
 ask Siri to open any 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.630
 what application of your device 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.490
 it comes from the app store or 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.560
 whether it is native and you can also 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.580
 ask him for sports results 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:20.670
 I'll give you a small example how 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.939
 is league rank 1 then the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.590
 French league championship 1 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.210
 that's what it gives if rim displays the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 table with the team ranking 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.240
 of the French league 1 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.070
 and of course we can use this 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.020
 function with other sports by 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:40.040
 example the basketball when and the next 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.040

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.550
 here is the calendar of games broken 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.380

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.810
 again it works and others 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.760
 news from syria with ayo and if the one 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.380
 asked for restaurant locations 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.160
 for example I want to do everything from 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.930
 following a small demonstration that she 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.930
 is the nearest Italian restaurant 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.970
 this is Siri's answer a map like 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.800
 this one with four restaurants 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.150
 italians close to my location with 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.700

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.680
 we can display details as per 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.390
 example the phone number or even 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.470
 the map to get to this 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.180
