now you've got the Sony right here then
it's<00:03:59.319> um<00:04:00.099> I<00:04:00.940> think<00:04:01.450> it's<00:04:01.930> all<00:04:02.109> plastic<00:04:03.030> but<00:04:04.030> the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
it's um I think it's all plastic but the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.089 
it's um I think it's all plastic but the
question<00:04:04.269> is<00:04:04.810> very<00:04:05.909> soft<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:08.470> very<00:04:08.590> stuff<00:04:08.920> I

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
question is very soft it's very stuff I

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.410 
question is very soft it's very stuff I
think<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.519> it's<00:04:09.790> it's<00:04:10.209> around<00:04:10.690> shaped<00:04:12.420> maybe

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
think and it's it's around shaped maybe

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.250 
think and it's it's around shaped maybe
let<00:04:13.690> me<00:04:13.840> try<00:04:14.049> to<00:04:14.609> fit<00:04:15.609> in<00:04:15.849> my<00:04:16.060> head<00:04:16.299> it's<00:04:17.079> very

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
let me try to fit in my head it's very

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.360 
let me try to fit in my head it's very
comfortable<00:04:17.799> it's<00:04:18.070> not<00:04:18.539> maybe<00:04:19.539> a<00:04:19.660> little<00:04:19.840> bit

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
comfortable it's not maybe a little bit

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.920 
comfortable it's not maybe a little bit
like<00:04:21.370> what<00:04:21.639> do<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:21.820> call<00:04:22.000> moving<00:04:22.720> or

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
like what do you call moving or

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.430 
like what do you call moving or
something<00:04:23.340> yeah<00:04:24.389> so<00:04:25.389> for<00:04:26.130> $85<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:28.320> think<00:04:29.320> this

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
something yeah so for $85 I think this

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.279 
something yeah so for $85 I think this
is<00:04:29.500> really<00:04:30.039> worth<00:04:30.849> it<00:04:31.060> not<00:04:31.419> like<00:04:31.630> for<00:04:32.200> the

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
is really worth it not like for the

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.719 
is really worth it not like for the
headphones<00:04:32.680> under<00:04:33.270> one<00:04:34.270> hundred<00:04:34.690> dollars<00:04:35.729> if

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
headphones under one hundred dollars if

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.089 
headphones under one hundred dollars if
you<00:04:36.910> can<00:04:37.120> buy<00:04:37.330> some<00:04:37.750> beads<00:04:38.050> or<00:04:38.410> you<00:04:38.680> can<00:04:38.919> buy
