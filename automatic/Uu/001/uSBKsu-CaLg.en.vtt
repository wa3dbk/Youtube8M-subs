for this example I got pokemon crystal
down<00:05:10.620> here<00:05:10.889> and<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.669> just<00:05:11.699> also<00:05:12.270> just<00:05:12.509> drag

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
this in right here it might take a bit

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.730 
this in right here it might take a bit
long<00:05:15.090> because<00:05:15.210> it's<00:05:15.570> a<00:05:15.630> pretty<00:05:15.840> big<00:05:15.990> file<00:05:18.740> then

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
long because it's a pretty big file then

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.100

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
just like the GBC 4 inspire you have to

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.029 
just like the GBC 4 inspire you have to
rename<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.490> pokemon<00:05:29.880> crystal<00:05:30.030> at<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.449> end<00:05:31.039> so
