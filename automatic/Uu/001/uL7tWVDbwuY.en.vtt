00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.789 

hello<00:00:12.630> today<00:00:12.870> I'm<00:00:13.019> going<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.290> show<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.559> how<00:00:13.620> to

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
hello today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.810 
hello today I'm going to show you how to
create<00:00:14.129> this<00:00:14.340> volumetric<00:00:15.180> light<00:00:15.870> effect<00:00:16.230> and

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
create this volumetric light effect and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.460 
create this volumetric light effect and
it's<00:00:17.820> basically<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.689> burst<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.050> light<00:00:19.259> and

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
it's basically just a burst of light and

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.760 
it's basically just a burst of light and
it<00:00:19.680> makes<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.720> nice<00:00:21.720> slight<00:00:22.140> break<00:00:22.380> effect

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
it makes this nice slight break effect

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.980 
it makes this nice slight break effect
when<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.070> put<00:00:23.509> objects<00:00:24.509> in<00:00:24.630> front<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
when you put objects in front of it and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.580 
when you put objects in front of it and
so<00:00:27.990> yeah<00:00:28.560> let's<00:00:28.830> get<00:00:28.949> started<00:00:30.350> go<00:00:31.350> to<00:00:31.410> your

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
so yeah let's get started go to your

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.100 
so yeah let's get started go to your
under<00:00:31.859> settings<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.640> down<00:00:32.879> I'm<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:33.930> going

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
under settings and down I'm just going

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.930 
under settings and down I'm just going
to<00:00:34.199> use<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.370> 1080p<00:00:36.890> sitting<00:00:37.890> here<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
to use my 1080p sitting here and go to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.880 
to use my 1080p sitting here and go to
your<00:00:39.090> anti<00:00:39.540> aliasing<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.199> change<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.650> best

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
your anti aliasing and change the best

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.439 
your anti aliasing and change the best
then<00:00:41.250> right<00:00:41.400> off<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.699> bat<00:00:41.879> you're<00:00:42.180> probably

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
then right off the bat you're probably

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.170 
then right off the bat you're probably
going<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.870> at<00:00:43.140> am<00:00:43.440> diffusion<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.400> global

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
going on at am diffusion and global

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.799 
going on at am diffusion and global
animation<00:00:45.629> effects<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:47.210> chose<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.479> now

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.180 

so<00:00:51.809> let's<00:00:52.650> create<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.430> crew<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.449> cube

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
so let's create with the crew to cube

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.030 
so let's create with the crew to cube
and<00:00:56.190> then<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.760> about<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.949> create<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
and then it's not about the create a

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.700 
and then it's not about the create a
cube<00:01:00.979> create<00:01:01.979> an<00:01:02.190> array<00:01:02.460> effect<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.210> not

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.050 

particular<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:09.000> your<00:01:09.299> ray<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.820> make

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
particular to your ray and I just make

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.970 
particular to your ray and I just make
it<00:01:12.090> bigger<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:15.020> make<00:01:16.130> about<00:01:17.930> 17<00:01:18.930> copies<00:01:19.710> or

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
it bigger here make about 17 copies or

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.300 
it bigger here make about 17 copies or
so<00:01:20.190> depends<00:01:20.940> on<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:22.160> just<00:01:23.160> make<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:25.310> amplitude

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
so depends on here just make a amplitude

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.350 
so depends on here just make a amplitude
and<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.730> you<00:01:26.910> can<00:01:27.150> see<00:01:28.700> different<00:01:29.700> this

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and if you can see different this

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.280 
and if you can see different this
creates<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.810> go<00:01:30.960> random<00:01:32.510> and<00:01:33.510> here<00:01:33.870> in<00:01:34.020> just

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.840 

little<00:01:37.290> control<00:01:37.890> C<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.880> ctrl<00:01:39.210> v<00:01:40.400> jovi<00:01:41.400> control

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
little control C and ctrl v jovi control

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.960 
little control C and ctrl v jovi control
feat<00:01:42.120> control<00:01:43.610> make<00:01:44.610> mo<00:01:44.850> four<00:01:45.420> copies<00:01:45.690> and

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
feat control make mo four copies and

00:01:46.970 --> 00:02:01.190 
feat control make mo four copies and
just<00:01:47.970> want<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.300> rotate<00:01:48.600> them<00:01:50.840> yeah

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:12.290 

okay<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:04.829> make<00:02:05.829> it<00:02:06.100> um<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.979> smaller<00:02:09.879> apt<00:02:10.720> order

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
okay a make it um so smaller apt order

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.770 
okay a make it um so smaller apt order
copies<00:02:15.390> unchanged<00:02:16.390> it's<00:02:16.599> really<00:02:16.900> up<00:02:17.019> to<00:02:17.230> you

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
copies unchanged it's really up to you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.199 
copies unchanged it's really up to you
that<00:02:19.780> looks<00:02:19.930> pretty<00:02:20.140> good<00:02:20.260> n<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.970> just<00:02:21.970> want

that looks pretty good n I just want
lick<00:02:22.450> on<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.629> light<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:25.890> make<00:02:26.890> sure<00:02:26.920> it's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400

want<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.879> do<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.299> click<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.440> light<00:02:32.650> make

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
want to do is click on the light make

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.100 
want to do is click on the light make
the<00:02:33.489> intensity<00:02:34.000> about<00:02:34.269> 250<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:37.049> go<00:02:38.049> to

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
the intensity about 250 and go to

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.750 
the intensity about 250 and go to
visible<00:02:38.500> light<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.890> change<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.340> call<00:02:39.610> new

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
visible light and change it to call new

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.589 
visible light and change it to call new
metric<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:45.459> now<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:45.670> see<00:02:45.970> little<00:02:46.360> ball

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
metric and so now you see little ball

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.390 
metric and so now you see little ball
here<00:02:47.519> want<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.640> bring<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:49.120> out<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.099> fits

is the show so you can also go changed

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.920 
is the show so you can also go changed
outer<00:03:03.519> distance<00:03:04.060> here<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:04.450> visibility<00:03:05.489> so

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
outer distance here and visibility so

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.599 
outer distance here and visibility so
it's<00:03:07.930> about<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.410> for<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.829> surrender<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.489> up

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
it's about it for that surrender it up

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:22.559 
it's about it for that surrender it up
renders<00:03:10.239> pretty<00:03:10.480> quickly<00:03:12.480> um<00:03:15.389> yeah<00:03:21.450> see<00:03:22.450> you

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
renders pretty quickly um yeah see you

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.420 
renders pretty quickly um yeah see you
when<00:03:22.750> it's<00:03:22.930> done<00:03:23.489> okay<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:24.549> that<00:03:24.819> took<00:03:26.430> 57

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
when it's done okay so that took 57

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.720 
when it's done okay so that took 57
seconds<00:03:28.030> or<00:03:28.180> under<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:30.160> looks<00:03:30.459> pretty

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
seconds or under and that looks pretty

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.059 
seconds or under and that looks pretty
pretty<00:03:31.329> good<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.660> that's<00:03:34.660> how<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.799> do<00:03:36.040> it

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
pretty good so that's how you do it

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.710 
pretty good so that's how you do it
basically<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:38.500> want<00:03:38.819> in<00:03:39.819> track<00:03:40.209> with<00:03:40.480> some

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
basically you want in track with some

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.650 
basically you want in track with some
text<00:03:41.109> maybe<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:43.030> want<00:03:43.299> to<00:03:43.389> do<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:44.760> create<00:03:45.760> for

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.750 

can<00:03:49.660> delete<00:03:49.930> this<00:03:50.169> light<00:03:52.230> make<00:03:53.230> some<00:03:53.440> text<00:03:53.950> go

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
can delete this light make some text go

that the big one you know what to do you
can<00:04:30.400> volumetric<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.660> increase<00:04:32.650> the

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
can volumetric and increase the

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:40.890 
can volumetric and increase the
intensity<00:04:36.840> it's<00:04:37.840> good<00:04:38.880> so<00:04:39.880> I<00:04:39.910> move<00:04:40.720> it

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
intensity it's good so I move it
