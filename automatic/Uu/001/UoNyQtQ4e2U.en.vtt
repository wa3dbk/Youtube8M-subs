so<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:19.260> starters<00:00:19.680> why<00:00:20.039> do<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.279> move<00:00:20.430> chain

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
so for starters why do we move chain

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.390 
so for starters why do we move chain
well<00:00:21.090> keep<00:00:21.510> friction<00:00:21.960> down<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.439> your<00:00:23.220> chain

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
well keep friction down and your chain

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.220 
well keep friction down and your chain
from<00:00:23.640> breaking<00:00:24.090> or<00:00:24.210> wearing<00:00:24.510> out<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.019> that's

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
from breaking or wearing out so that's

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.040 
from breaking or wearing out so that's
my<00:00:25.410> change<00:00:25.740> I'm<00:00:26.099> frickin<00:00:26.580> nerd<00:00:26.760> II<00:00:26.869> did<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
my change I'm frickin nerd II did that

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.250 
my change I'm frickin nerd II did that
so<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.460> would<00:00:30.300> recommend<00:00:32.120> Lube<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.079> bike

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
so I would recommend Lube for the bike

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560 
so I would recommend Lube for the bike
itself<00:00:34.710> don't<00:00:35.100> don't<00:00:35.550> go<00:00:35.700> use<00:00:35.969> like<00:00:36.210> old

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
itself don't don't go use like old

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.080 
itself don't don't go use like old
engine<00:00:36.989> oil<00:00:37.140> or<00:00:37.350> something<00:00:37.640> because<00:00:38.640> that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
engine oil or something because that

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.069 
engine oil or something because that
causes<00:00:39.829> licking<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> when<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.690> got<00:00:42.870> your

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
causes licking so when you got your

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.229 
causes licking so when you got your
chain<00:00:43.559> spinning<00:00:43.980> really<00:00:44.340> fast<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.969> see<00:00:45.120> these

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
chain spinning really fast you see these

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.080 
chain spinning really fast you see these
lines<00:00:45.570> right<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.250> that's<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.640> over

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
lines right here that's because I over

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.060 
lines right here that's because I over
lubricated<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:48.840> anyways<00:00:49.140> you'll<00:00:49.410> flick<00:00:49.770> oil

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
lubricated but anyways you'll flick oil

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.119 
lubricated but anyways you'll flick oil
everywhere<00:00:50.640> all<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:53.039> just

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
everywhere all up in here and it's just

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.729 
everywhere all up in here and it's just
a<00:00:53.309> bad<00:00:53.460> scenario<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.329> don't<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.600> using<00:00:54.750> crappy

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
a bad scenario so don't be using crappy

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.310 
a bad scenario so don't be using crappy
oil<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.219> stuff<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.719> stickier<00:00:57.719> oil<00:00:58.050> more

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
oil this stuff is stickier oil more

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.220 
oil this stuff is stickier oil more
discuss<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.789> when<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.000> spray<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.109> want

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
discuss so when you spray it on you want

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.280 
discuss so when you spray it on you want
to<00:01:01.379> keep<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.190> nice<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.430> thin<00:01:03.049> I'm<00:01:04.049> actually

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
to keep it nice and thin I'm actually

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
to keep it nice and thin I'm actually
gonna<00:01:04.500> spray<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> gate<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.640> should<00:01:05.820> be

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
gonna spray it the gate you should be

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.179 
gonna spray it the gate you should be
wiping<00:01:06.299> down<00:01:06.420> your<00:01:06.630> chain<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:07.619> crêpes<00:01:08.010> on

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189

before<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.830> spray<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.479> also<00:01:12.479> spray<00:01:12.869> after<00:01:13.110> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
before you spray I also spray after I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
I do it so pay attention this thing's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.069 
I do it so pay attention this thing's
got<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> spray<00:01:36.540> radius<00:01:36.960> or<00:01:37.560> distance<00:01:37.820> like<00:01:38.869> yeah

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
got a spray radius or distance like yeah

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.280 
got a spray radius or distance like yeah
pretty<00:01:40.409> far<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.600> spray<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.110> there

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
pretty far so I just spray it in there

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.929 
pretty far so I just spray it in there
that's<00:01:43.590> way<00:01:43.799> too<00:01:43.860> much<00:01:44.159> don't<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.790> I'm

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
that's way too much don't do that I'm

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.999 
that's way too much don't do that I'm
just<00:01:45.119> giving<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.360> example<00:01:45.990> I'll<00:01:46.649> wipe<00:01:46.860> that

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
just giving you example I'll wipe that

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.230 
just giving you example I'll wipe that
off<00:01:47.159> later<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.549> anyways<00:01:48.200> you<00:01:49.200> want<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.500> get

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
off later but anyways you want to get

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.940 
off later but anyways you want to get
right<00:01:51.240> back<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.689> there<00:01:51.930> that's<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> easiest

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
right back in there that's the easiest

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.270 
right back in there that's the easiest
way<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.189> do<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:57.710> loop<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:58.920> chain<00:01:59.250> a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
way to do it you can loop your chain a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.980 
way to do it you can loop your chain a
bit<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.790> then<00:02:00.180> cycle<00:02:00.479> your<00:02:00.810> bike<00:02:01.020> forward<00:02:02.990> and

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
bit and then cycle your bike forward and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.899 
bit and then cycle your bike forward and
loop<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.799> again<00:02:05.040> that's<00:02:05.369> what<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.670> would

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
loop it again that's what I would

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.639 
loop it again that's what I would
recommend<00:02:05.939> doing<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.469> quick

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
recommend doing this is just a quick

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.609 
recommend doing this is just a quick
lube<00:02:07.950> I'd<00:02:08.910> recommend<00:02:09.420> doing<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.810> every<00:02:10.020> 5000

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
lube I'd recommend doing it every 5000

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.020 
lube I'd recommend doing it every 5000
kilometers

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030
