00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
of the sneaker but the suede they use is

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
really nice it has it has a great

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.560 
really nice it has it has a great
texture<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.880> guess<00:01:27.090> you'd<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> nice

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
texture to it I guess you'd be the nice

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
texture to it I guess you'd be the nice
way<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> saying<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.290> buttery<00:01:28.650> smooth<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> then

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
way of saying is buttery smooth and then

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.520 
way of saying is buttery smooth and then
this<00:01:29.970> outsole<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.500> a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
this outsole is kind of like a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.890 
this outsole is kind of like a
combination<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.430> dumb<00:01:32.729> color<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.570> salmon

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
combination of a dumb color and a salmon

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.899 
combination of a dumb color and a salmon
color<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.619> makes<00:01:34.829> sense<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.369> it's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
color if that makes sense so it's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.580 
color if that makes sense so it's
different<00:01:36.180> than<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> pure<00:01:36.780> bone<00:01:36.990> color<00:01:37.290> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
different than a pure bone color I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
different than a pure bone color I

they're<00:03:46.010> super<00:03:46.190> comfortable<00:03:46.610> like<00:03:46.940> when

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
they're super comfortable like when

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.820 
they're super comfortable like when
you're<00:03:47.270> walking<00:03:48.050> you<00:03:48.170> can<00:03:48.200> kind<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.590> feel<00:03:48.800> it

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
you're walking you can kind of feel it

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.710 
you're walking you can kind of feel it
like<00:03:49.100> propelling<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.150> forward<00:03:50.180> if<00:03:50.570> that

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
like propelling you forward if that

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.280 
like propelling you forward if that
makes<00:03:50.900> sense

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
makes sense

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.350 
makes sense
and<00:03:51.530> these<00:03:52.010> won't<00:03:52.280> crease<00:03:52.580> based<00:03:53.060> on<00:03:53.240> the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
and these won't crease based on the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.880 
and these won't crease based on the
materials<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.960> know<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.200> canvas<00:03:54.560> on<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.770> toe

materials you know the canvas on the toe

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.290 
materials you know the canvas on the toe
box<00:03:55.100> they'll<00:03:55.340> stay<00:03:55.490> looking<00:03:55.790> nice<00:03:56.000> for<00:03:56.270> a

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
box they'll stay looking nice for a

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.110 
box they'll stay looking nice for a
while<00:03:56.650> alright<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:57.920> this<00:03:58.250> is<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.550> last<00:03:58.790> pair

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
and I've mistaken that I've been

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.520 
and I've mistaken that I've been
reviewing<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.910> wrong<00:04:02.120> shoe<00:04:02.990> they<00:04:03.170> actually

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
do have extra laces I just kept picking

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.450 
do have extra laces I just kept picking
up<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.110> right<00:04:06.470> sneaker<00:04:06.890> instead<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.250> left

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
up the right sneaker instead of the left

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.700 
up the right sneaker instead of the left
this<00:04:08.240> one<00:04:08.450> came<00:04:08.660> in<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.870> different<00:04:09.020> box<00:04:09.320> and<00:04:09.590> all

the other shadow six thousands I'm not
sure<00:04:12.260> if<00:04:12.380> that's<00:04:12.530> because<00:04:12.890> it's<00:04:13.070> a<00:04:13.160> sample

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
sure if that's because it's a sample

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.220 
sure if that's because it's a sample
colorway<00:04:13.970> I<00:04:14.000> haven't<00:04:14.540> seen<00:04:14.750> these<00:04:14.930> yet<00:04:15.170> so
