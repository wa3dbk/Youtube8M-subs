spoke with him on the Lego Cuusoo
website<00:00:19.700> this<00:00:20.210> is<00:00:20.450> his<00:00:20.720> project<00:00:21.080> called

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
website this is his project called

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.000 
website this is his project called
realistic<00:00:22.580> trees<00:00:23.050> and<00:00:24.050> I<00:00:24.500> think<00:00:24.740> this<00:00:24.859> is<00:00:24.980> a

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
realistic trees and I think this is a

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.310 
realistic trees and I think this is a
really<00:00:25.310> cool<00:00:25.490> project<00:00:25.789> he's<00:00:26.750> got<00:00:26.930> a<00:00:26.960> lot<00:00:27.199> of

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
really cool project he's got a lot of

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.320 
really cool project he's got a lot of
different<00:00:27.650> designs<00:00:28.369> for<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:28.789> trees

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
different designs for the trees

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.049 
different designs for the trees
different<00:00:29.930> types<00:00:30.170> of<00:00:30.350> trees<00:00:30.650> also<00:00:31.070> different

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
different types of trees also different

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.450 
different types of trees also different
colors<00:00:32.419> there's<00:00:32.809> even<00:00:33.080> some<00:00:33.769> bushes<00:00:34.040> that

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
colors there's even some bushes that

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.689 
colors there's even some bushes that
you'll<00:00:34.670> see<00:00:35.379> some<00:00:36.379> bushes<00:00:36.620> with<00:00:37.100> no<00:00:37.280> flowers

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
you'll see some bushes with no flowers

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.240 
you'll see some bushes with no flowers
some<00:00:37.940> bushes<00:00:38.150> with<00:00:38.510> flowers<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.230> think<00:00:40.100> he's

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
some bushes with flowers I think he's

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.360 
some bushes with flowers I think he's
got<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.579> really<00:00:40.820> great<00:00:41.120> concept<00:00:41.450> going<00:00:42.079> on

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
got a really great concept going on

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.520 
got a really great concept going on
there's<00:00:43.370> even<00:00:43.670> one<00:00:44.000> tree<00:00:44.540> that's<00:00:44.719> got<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:45.110> tree

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
there's even one tree that's got a tree

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.190 
there's even one tree that's got a tree
swing<00:00:45.590> in<00:00:45.890> it<00:00:45.980> which<00:00:46.550> I<00:00:46.790> personally<00:00:47.420> like<00:00:47.930> a

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
swing in it which I personally like a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.350 
swing in it which I personally like a
lot<00:00:48.290> I<00:00:48.829> think<00:00:49.190> that<00:00:49.489> was<00:00:49.610> probably<00:00:49.820> my

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
lot I think that was probably my

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.470 
lot I think that was probably my
favorite<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:51.379> one<00:00:51.469> with<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:51.739> tree<00:00:51.950> swing<00:00:52.480> and

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
favorite the one with the tree swing and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.720 
favorite the one with the tree swing and
this<00:00:54.320> project<00:00:54.559> already<00:00:55.100> has<00:00:55.280> over<00:00:55.579> a

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
this project already has over a

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
out with this he posted this project

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.060 
out with this he posted this project
back<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:18.260> February

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
back in February

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.210 
back in February
so<00:01:19.670> he's<00:01:20.030> been<00:01:20.500> you<00:01:21.500> know<00:01:21.590> he's<00:01:21.830> been<00:01:22.009> waiting

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
so he's been you know he's been waiting

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.580 
so he's been you know he's been waiting
on<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:22.640> for<00:01:22.700> a<00:01:22.939> little<00:01:23.000> while<00:01:23.150> now<00:01:23.570> but<00:01:24.380> I

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
on this for a little while now but I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.249 
on this for a little while now but I
think<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:25.430> project<00:01:25.880> has<00:01:26.180> great<00:01:26.659> potential

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
think this project has great potential

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.890 
think this project has great potential
to<00:01:27.470> reach<00:01:28.040> 10,000<00:01:28.820> especially<00:01:29.360> since<00:01:29.600> it's

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
to reach 10,000 especially since it's

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.429 
to reach 10,000 especially since it's
already<00:01:30.200> over<00:01:30.530> 1,000<00:01:31.509> that's<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:32.810> real<00:01:33.259> big

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
already over 1,000 that's a real big

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.429 
already over 1,000 that's a real big
mile<00:01:33.979> marker<00:01:34.490> on<00:01:34.640> coup<00:01:34.909> so<00:01:35.150> if<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:35.960> most

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
mile marker on coup so if you most

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.649 
mile marker on coup so if you most
people<00:01:36.740> say<00:01:36.950> if<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:37.130> can<00:01:37.430> reach<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.939> thousand

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
people say if you can reach a thousand

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.870 
people say if you can reach a thousand
supporters<00:01:38.810> in<00:01:39.380> time<00:01:40.159> you'll<00:01:40.490> certainly

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
supporters in time you'll certainly

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.350 
supporters in time you'll certainly
reach<00:01:41.299> 10,000<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.549> really<00:01:44.030> hope<00:01:44.210> this

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
reach 10,000 so I really hope this

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.660 
reach 10,000 so I really hope this
project<00:01:44.810> does<00:01:44.990> because<00:01:45.380> I<00:01:45.409> think<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.979> these

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
project does because I think that these

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.770 
project does because I think that these
trees<00:01:47.030> would<00:01:47.689> be<00:01:47.750> great<00:01:48.140> for<00:01:48.500> people<00:01:48.560> who<00:01:49.780> like

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
trees would be great for people who like

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.440 
trees would be great for people who like
to<00:01:50.810> build<00:01:51.110> mocks<00:01:51.530> you<00:01:52.340> know<00:01:52.460> mock<00:01:52.790> houses<00:01:53.299> and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
to build mocks you know mock houses and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.480 
to build mocks you know mock houses and
things<00:01:53.659> like<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:54.770> know<00:01:54.860> these<00:01:55.100> trees

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
things like that you know these trees

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.149 
things like that you know these trees
would<00:01:55.670> go<00:01:55.790> great<00:01:56.000> with<00:01:56.119> things<00:01:56.570> like<00:01:56.720> that

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
would go great with things like that

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.499 
would go great with things like that
there's<00:01:58.159> all<00:01:58.340> sorts<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.759> different<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.390> know

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
there's all sorts of different you know

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.620 
there's all sorts of different you know
projects<00:02:00.110> that<00:02:00.259> you<00:02:00.350> could<00:02:00.560> do<00:02:01.299> with<00:02:02.299> mocks

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
projects that you could do with mocks

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.160 
projects that you could do with mocks
that<00:02:02.990> use<00:02:03.500> these<00:02:03.799> kinds<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.219> trees<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.700> things

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
that use these kinds of trees and things

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.959 
that use these kinds of trees and things
they<00:02:06.170> could<00:02:06.380> also<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:07.100> know<00:02:07.130> incorporate

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
they could also you know incorporate

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.449 
they could also you know incorporate
these<00:02:08.209> trees<00:02:08.600> into<00:02:09.200> sets<00:02:10.040> that<00:02:10.280> they're

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
these trees into sets that they're

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.259 
these trees into sets that they're
making<00:02:10.640> anyway<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.260> think<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.400> really

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
making anyway so I think it's a really

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.600 
making anyway so I think it's a really
really<00:02:14.450> good<00:02:14.720> idea<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.190> has<00:02:16.310> great

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
really good idea and it has great

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.460 
really good idea and it has great
potential<00:02:17.000> it's<00:02:17.330> much<00:02:17.780> much<00:02:18.110> better<00:02:18.319> than

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
potential it's much much better than

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.640 
potential it's much much better than
just<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.069> know

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
just you know

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.160 
just you know
the<00:02:19.800> plane<00:02:20.160> little<00:02:21.000> bitty<00:02:21.209> plastic<00:02:21.870> trees

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
the plane little bitty plastic trees

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.910 
the plane little bitty plastic trees
that<00:02:22.410> they<00:02:22.560> give<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:24.410> note<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.560> they're<00:02:25.739> bad

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
that they give you note that they're bad

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.150 
that they give you note that they're bad
but<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:27.019> really<00:02:28.019> really<00:02:28.349> like<00:02:28.500> these<00:02:28.709> realistic

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
but I really really like these realistic

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.080 
but I really really like these realistic
trees<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.330> Paul<00:02:30.569> has<00:02:30.750> made<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.319> think<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:31.860> a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
trees that Paul has made I think it's a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.360 
trees that Paul has made I think it's a
spectacular<00:02:33.090> idea<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.769> I<00:02:34.860> think<00:02:34.920> I've<00:02:35.160> got

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
spectacular idea and I think I've got

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.460 
spectacular idea and I think I've got
about<00:02:35.610> 35<00:02:36.120> pictures<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.930> were<00:02:37.110> going
