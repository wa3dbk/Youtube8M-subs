00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
scoop designs where both speakers

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.870 
scoop designs where both speakers
perform<00:00:34.040> really<00:00:34.520> well

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.229 

a<00:00:37.410> big<00:00:38.410> factor<00:00:38.890> in<00:00:38.920> this<00:00:39.220> is<00:00:39.280> they<00:00:39.610> both<00:00:39.940> have

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
a big factor in this is they both have

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.319 
a big factor in this is they both have
five<00:00:40.750> inch<00:00:41.020> plus<00:00:41.320> voice<00:00:41.530> calls<00:00:41.920> and<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:43.030> very

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
five inch plus voice calls and a very

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.350 
five inch plus voice calls and a very
large<00:00:43.600> magnet<00:00:44.170> motor<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:45.430> makes<00:00:45.730> them<00:00:46.059> very

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
large magnet motor that makes them very

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.140 
large magnet motor that makes them very
capable<00:00:46.809> of<00:00:46.930> handling<00:00:47.200> very<00:00:47.739> low<00:00:48.040> bass<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.700> very

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
capable of handling very low bass a very

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.220 
capable of handling very low bass a very
high<00:00:49.420> power

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.050 

in<00:00:55.230> general<00:00:55.620> scoops<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> very<00:00:56.400> open<00:00:56.730> design

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
in general scoops of a very open design

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.390 
in general scoops of a very open design
that<00:00:57.390> puts<00:00:57.630> a<00:00:57.750> high<00:00:57.930> demand<00:00:58.380> on<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> driver<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
that puts a high demand on a driver and

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.980 
that puts a high demand on a driver and
because<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> large<00:01:00.150> voice<00:01:00.450> coil<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
because of the large voice coil and

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.140 
because of the large voice coil and
magnet<00:01:01.050> senders<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.800> both<00:01:01.950> drivers<00:01:02.400> have<00:01:02.610> it

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
magnet senders that both drivers have it

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.670 
magnet senders that both drivers have it
means<00:01:03.360> they<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.630> handle<00:01:04.050> these<00:01:04.199> extreme

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
means they can handle these extreme

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.620 
means they can handle these extreme
situations

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.300 

why<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:08.690> a<00:01:08.810> large<00:01:09.080> magnet<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.650> voice<00:01:09.800> call<00:01:10.070> so

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
why is a large magnet and voice call so

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.780 
why is a large magnet and voice call so
important<00:01:10.900> well<00:01:11.900> high<00:01:12.590> quality<00:01:13.100> low<00:01:13.520> base

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
important well high quality low base

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.390 
important well high quality low base
demands<00:01:14.510> increased<00:01:15.140> watts<00:01:15.410> and<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:16.190> bigger

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
demands increased watts and the bigger

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.190 
demands increased watts and the bigger
the<00:01:16.490> magnet<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.030> coil<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.810> more<00:01:17.990> power

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
the magnet and coil the more power

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.380 
the magnet and coil the more power
speaker<00:01:18.620> can<00:01:18.920> handle<00:01:19.280> without<00:01:19.940> compromise

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
speaker can handle without compromise

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.300 
speaker can handle without compromise
both<00:01:23.390> speakers<00:01:23.990> use<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.290> triple<00:01:24.530> roll<00:01:24.830> surround

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
both speakers use a triple roll surround

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.340 
both speakers use a triple roll surround
this<00:01:25.940> helps<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.450> keep<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.720> comb<00:01:26.930> linear

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
this helps to keep the comb linear

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.960 
this helps to keep the comb linear
whilst<00:01:27.800> moving<00:01:28.070> through<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.640> large

whilst moving through the large

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:40.630 
whilst moving through the large
movements<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:29.720> its<00:01:29.870> cycle

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.980 

we<00:01:41.640> would<00:01:41.820> recommend<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.420> minimum<00:01:42.570> distance

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
we would recommend a minimum distance

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.260 
we would recommend a minimum distance
between<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.950> front<00:01:44.189> baffle<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.790> second

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
between the front baffle and second

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.230 
between the front baffle and second
baffle<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> scoop<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.680> around<00:01:47.240> 240
