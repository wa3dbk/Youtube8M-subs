00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.240
 I'll show you again in your vw today 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.759
 lupo for example vw lupo that 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.800
 Tail light could change 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.450
 her following stuff either on support 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.980
 or talks screwdriver I'll take in 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.620
 slot screwdriver why me that 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.130
 explain later and a cross 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.080
 screwdriver as perfect first 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.210
 First he got your career 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.630
 that makes the whole thing clear 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.630
 lighter 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.420
 by the way, my car is 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.420
 around a vw lupo at 14 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.030
 something I have to line up this way now 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.820
 yes, if you have your car then first 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:49.520
 you got the first one 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:52.040
 trunk is on your trunk 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.930
 then the screw comes to 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.980
 solve their equal the fore the need to 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.480
 the right side of the spotlight me 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.250
 I did not have that easy to express 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.950
 But I think the pictures say more 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.820
 So it is said as one 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.450
 talks screw which one can solve now 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.920
 but that at the same time with a cross 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.430
 screwdriver with a bunch of yes 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.560
 solve completely easily 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.119
 the screw is somehow bad 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:27.200
 get out pretty thin fingers 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:30.229
 take them out and spike them outside 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.899
 Okay, that's how the screw looks like 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.550
 Hold this step because it is wonderful so 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.050
 if you do not hold a top screwdriver 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.229
 or too lazy to look for it as well 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.320
 I'll hand it out next 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.729
 you pull the spot from the spotlight 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.060
 a piece to you where you screw 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.710
 that's enough 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.240
 and then squeeze him if you have the left 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.450
 Spotlight found detached from the 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.680
 Driver's side pushes the left outside 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:00.200
 so I would release him first up left 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:08.149
 and then below again looks like later 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:09.229
 the headlight is moored and 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.090
 then you see why you turn left 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.650
 must pull so must pull outward 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.140
 and how to look outward then what 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.880
 that is already understood below 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.519
 solved above are the two pins 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.090
 one then draws as finished 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.090
 next 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.019
 pull the cable off what between the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.310
 car and the headlight is still 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.420
 actually relatively easy 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.340
 I think I just say pull 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.500
 finished and that seems 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.080
 what's up so as we look to us 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.879
 headlights so you have to see it 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.030
 by the way, from the back of two screws 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.349
 once here and once here with me 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.110
 the previous owner I have the warm 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.400
 bought used 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.110
 somehow a slut a screw 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.110
 already muddy so I just have to 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.620
 to loosen a screw 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.680
 the screw is solved zack finished 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.910
 Incidentally, believes only briefly in the art space 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.170
 at first just like that, yes I have just now 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.329
 shown where you solved the click above 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.709
 the plastic part makes that a piece 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.150
 return the piece to you and 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.680
 pull it off and then you have the pears 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.049
 such a stage to change the relative 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.730
 Just press down and then 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.400
 turn counterclockwise and 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:33.190
 pull out and there is here and elsewhere 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.160
 plug in again, press down 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.780
 and then press down again and then 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.000
 finished when we make the screw 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.739
 have changed pear then that comes 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.840
 whole again runs around rhine first 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.700
 plug it in again below 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.519
 then pull forward and fall up 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.389
 Do not forget to snap the screw 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.389
 to screw to the rhine 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.389
 the two screws I forgot 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:06.250
 after I then both screw in 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.250
 I screwed or whatever 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:15.910
 you first connect again in buckow 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.910
 over the cable with the tail light 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:24.770
 then you click that again 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.070
 I have a bit longer 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.090
 used with the cable and themes 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.240
 already stuck but okay so as 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.270
 next well, there you can see 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.500
 times perfect these two places where you 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.630
 the pacifier I would now reinsteckt 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.940
 exactly the other way around when you solve it 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.130
 do you start by clicking up and up 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.330
 then click and 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.550
 and if you fix him I would 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.550
 you recommend to bend down first 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.880
 then without clicking you should now 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.050
 See you soon and then clark up 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.760
 and then it is actually again 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.600
 then you can do it again 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.090
 Press firmly 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.480
 and next screwed the screw 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.480
 Clear again 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:18.810
 and then you are already 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:21.420
 you're ready to go that easy 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.060
 tail lamp to change a vw lupo 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:28.080
 So right at the taillights with me 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.880
 the brake light was broken like that now 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.290
 works then you make normal 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.580
 I can test it all but everything 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.820
 By the way , it works by the way 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:40.290
 sport exhaust what a sound yes 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.310
 does not work that works 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.750
 was broken with me that was it then 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.010
 I hope you liked it I hope 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.950
 I could one or the other with 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.220
 help my difficult explanation 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.220
 See you
