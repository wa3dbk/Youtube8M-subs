00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.110
 is just a little less handsome though 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.940
 no less talented son who 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.529
 decides to take the criminal path 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.900
 once you see a little bit and now there is 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.970
 a third part from a slow deodor 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.840
 you are played i am not i have a ball 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.840

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.330
 ronneby gt window with a kind of hip hop 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.800
 jacket 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.680
 because you really feel like they are 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.660
 try yes yes very much but would 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.760
 two of the valid up to 100,000 would be the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.950
 fuck fuck it we throw everything the window 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.460
 nice and crazy go over 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.770
 the top 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.379
 what about part 3 i am sorry 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.300
 nice that while gta in my opinion something 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.949
 go too serious way I must have 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.440
 pick up a fucking phone 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.180
 I think I found GTA v you not so whole 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.530
 yet also very right you are one of the 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.110
 few but i just didn't find it either 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.860
 I get a lot more from that absurd shit 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.630
 yes and that is a bit genius what that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.160
 censorship answer is probably three 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.140
 they just draw that line through it 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.780
 word tear and absurd and I had 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.729
 understood from jurrien they come view 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.619
 yes that there is always someone during 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.979
 a presentation make your heart laugh 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.320
 but I'm going to tell that person anyway 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.369
 I really have two or three times 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.020
 noisy have to laugh during 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.430
 playing that you could tell by what 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.040
 succeed you now I have to do 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.500
 moment you can put a brake or do it must 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.630
 the like a loop 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.280
 and then you can stand out by jumping yes me 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.810
 know that it is just wrestling to do 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.270
 and then you go pretty cool 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.620
 He is there next to the person who has just been 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.470
 kicked ass 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.020
 go super dry next to it and 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.000
 while I did that looked left and right 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.910
 I am my colleague 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.680
 yes who had one and made the green help 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.930
 very muscular guy with a cowboy hat 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.880
 on cowboy boots 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.490
 and and tangas circle and you may think 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.610
 that looks bizarre was still street 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.600
 we he had done was a prostitute who 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.220
 walked down the street 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.410
 which had also create very few who 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.300
 So a pilot took their powerchute hostage 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.970
 had super gay 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.070
 we go on the street with such tongs 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.630
 so it was really such 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.060
 average day in Amsterdam so let's say 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.250
 if i really got i started i just 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.650
 laughed and the other side is really there 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.239
 can see what is the humor and the about 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.980
 the top is good 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.630
 yes I mean I have a half who 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.760
 Played against pure and I have alone 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.739
 but laughed only pleasantly about it 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.230
 what the disadvantage was my censure o2 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.510
 was technically in terms of graphics we 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.820
 clearly goes inferior gtl yes it 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.400
 seemed and pointed out that the pc is already there 1 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.470
 and 2 we same angel engine hanne 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.790
 now that has become much more beautiful and 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.480
 bad it doesn't have me this 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.430
 stop motion that doesn't but it looks 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.290
 much better and 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.930
 the more feeling with is at aa two 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.939
 that you really do take a step back and how 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.769
 is it with the gangster level of the 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.810
 game jam video machine itself click on one 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.060
 little texts for this video I'm going 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.200
 never to live jenks came after me 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.409
 I think level yes well that's just it 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.519
 it 's over the top and in that I yes I do 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.689
 think museum itself too much too 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.739
 serious 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:24.209
 I take that off my glasses 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.000
 yes look then you can see i am not 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.099
 games yes i am church and they take it themselves 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.650
 also very seriously ok so the humor is there 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.139
 well about the carpet feel good technically 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.579
 looks better what about the 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.919
 content with that the actual missions the 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.230
 gameplay and it was sad to know to 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:43.650
 the second one is your cream poop and stuff 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.299
 all those houses are very braking and that's what it is 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.159
 still in the is just fish or movie too 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.439
 cause damage 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.450
 ready to the interns ie it is so hard 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.209
 fashion needs something to promote to promote you 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.680
 cash 'which I really liked is now the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.799
 new mr 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.799
 doctor think show piet paulusma 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.370
 look at it and there is some sort of it here 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.049
 game show and isolated the mission I had 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.879
 a lookin building inside and then you have to 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.950
 just gas through as cold as possible 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.120
 give them the headshot and if you do too 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.799
 get into multiplayer 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.810
 greasy klutz make greasy kills 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.530
 searching that is a multiplayer 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.560
 mode 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.479
 no multiplayer mode just has to rise 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.729
 I am kind of type army multiplayer as 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.289
 so you get 20 of the guys killed 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.169
 you kind of a multiplayer 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.419
 wonderful extra experiment and behind 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.210
 say mother problems to each other 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.620
 This is the family game own mobile 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.490
 games and they are all awful 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.900
 fun mini games 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.520
 and so I have something extra on again 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.570
 added as your favorite mini-game that 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.400
 have seen 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.940
 no, I find spraying house under pooping 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.940
 I still want to 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.770
 gangster humor 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.480
 shit spray gta but then nice over the 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.790
 top you played it will be 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.140
 ditches or the cake 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.350
 I think it will be sad 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.370
 the director is the terror in 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.370
 November that developed
