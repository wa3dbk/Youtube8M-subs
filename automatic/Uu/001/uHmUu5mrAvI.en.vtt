00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
here and we do this on all our machines

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.920 
here and we do this on all our machines

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
we have a three inch connector that goes

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.970 
we have a three inch connector that goes
from<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.530> front<00:03:15.709> waste<00:03:16.100> tank<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:18.709> the

from the front waste tank to the to the
blower<00:03:19.700> stack<00:03:20.120> now<00:03:20.390> this<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:20.720> two<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:21.109> half

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
blower stack now this is two and a half

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.230 
blower stack now this is two and a half
inch<00:03:21.530> here<00:03:21.769> but<00:03:21.980> we<00:03:22.040> put<00:03:22.100> 3-inch<00:03:22.760> here
