00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
there and then use area loop now I'd

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.700 
there and then use area loop now I'd
advise<00:01:00.539> using<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.079> I've<00:01:01.320> used<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
advise using this I've used this a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.740 
advise using this I've used this a
couple<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.100> times<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.550> far<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.090> it's

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
couple of times so far and it's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.329 
couple of times so far and it's
definitely<00:01:04.140> makes<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> lot<00:01:04.799> easier<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.220> pick

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
definitely makes it a lot easier to pick

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.640 
definitely makes it a lot easier to pick
it<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.479> that's<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.840> good<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.500> you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
it up and so that's really good if you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.109 
it up and so that's really good if you
basically<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.520> if<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.760> click<00:01:09.000> on

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
basically what you do is if you click on

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.690 
basically what you do is if you click on
a<00:01:09.180> drop<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.689> there's<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.590> drop<00:01:11.010> within<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
a drop and there's a drop within a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.510 
a drop and there's a drop within a
three-tail<00:01:12.420> radius<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.500> you'll<00:01:14.100> also<00:01:14.280> be

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
three-tail radius of that you'll also be

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.070 
three-tail radius of that you'll also be
a<00:01:14.549> pick<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.030> drop<00:01:15.299> as<00:01:15.450> well<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.960> it's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
a pick up that drop as well so it's

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.440 
a pick up that drop as well so it's
really<00:01:16.320> good<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.820> definitely<00:01:17.820> advise<00:01:18.180> using

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
really good I definitely advise using

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.249 
really good I definitely advise using
that<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:21.000> as<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.479> see<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
that so as you can see just that the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.690 
that so as you can see just that the
Ascension<00:01:22.890> dungeon<00:01:23.220> at<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> minute<00:01:23.610> I'm

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700

going to test out this new looting

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.960 
going to test out this new looting
system<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.340> let<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.520> know<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.640> haven't

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
system just to let you know I haven't

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.480

added<00:01:27.750> any<00:01:27.990> sort<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.350> customization<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.250> this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
added any sort of customization to this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.429 
added any sort of customization to this
so<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> basic<00:01:30.720> new<00:01:31.110> luton

can<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.619> drops<00:01:43.860> are<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.159> floor<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.640> a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
can see the drops are on the floor in a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.510 
can see the drops are on the floor in a
certain<00:01:45.899> radius<00:01:46.079> around<00:01:46.409> me<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:47.310> three

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
certain radius around me I think three

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.389 
certain radius around me I think three
tails<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.329> where<00:01:48.780> those<00:01:49.290> drops<00:01:50.159> are

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
tails is just where those drops are

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.870 
tails is just where those drops are
right<00:01:50.640> there<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:52.079> yeah<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.380> not<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.880> big

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
right there and so yeah it's not a big

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.149 
right there and so yeah it's not a big
radius<00:01:54.329> around<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.140> player<00:01:55.380> where<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.009> will

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
radius around the player where it will

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.130 
radius around the player where it will

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
pick up a few drops on the floor so I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.569 
pick up a few drops on the floor so I
just<00:01:58.320> turn<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.680> split<00:01:59.009> off<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> look

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
just turn to split off and have a look

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.370 
just turn to split off and have a look
so<00:01:59.729> if<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.880> click<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.960> see<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.200> new

lootenant<00:02:08.399> speed<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.940> up<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.119> lot<00:02:09.330> now<00:02:09.750> if<00:02:09.869> you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
lootenant speed it up a lot now if you

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.930 
lootenant speed it up a lot now if you

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
move around you'll be able to see that

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.790 
move around you'll be able to see that
it'll<00:02:12.150> picks<00:02:12.360> up<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.690> few<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.200> drops<00:02:13.440> that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800

it'll picks up a few of the drops that
on<00:02:13.890> included<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.700> radius<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:16.020> because

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
on included in that radius just because

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.110 
on included in that radius just because
it's<00:02:16.380> outside<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.040> three-tailed<00:02:17.610> margin

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
it's outside of the three-tailed margin

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.450 
it's outside of the three-tailed margin
and<00:02:18.300> but<00:02:19.140> basically<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.920> get<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.190> pick<00:02:20.310> up

and but basically you get to pick up

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.120 
and but basically you get to pick up
everything<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.420> sort<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.810> area<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.320> it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
everything in that sort of area and it

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.980 
everything in that sort of area and it
makes<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.490> much<00:02:23.550> easier<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.120> definitely<00:02:24.900> I

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
makes it so much easier so definitely I

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.450 
makes it so much easier so definitely I
do<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.500> feature<00:02:25.770> now<00:02:26.190> I'm<00:02:26.280> going<00:02:26.370> to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
do like this feature now I'm going to

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.100 
do like this feature now I'm going to
move<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.760> talk<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.450> about<00:02:27.630> the

move on to talk to you about the
customization<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.220> can<00:02:29.340> have<00:02:29.550> with

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
customization that you can have with

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.150 
customization that you can have with
this<00:02:30.240> looting<00:02:30.480> system<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.110> exactly<00:02:31.920> what

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
this looting system and exactly what

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.330 
this looting system and exactly what
that<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.550> do<00:02:32.700> itself<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.980> now<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.220> I've

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
that can do itself so now that I've

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.660 
that can do itself so now that I've
tested<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.120> mayon<00:02:36.720> luton<00:02:37.650> system<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.280> the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
tested the mayon luton system and the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.280 
tested the mayon luton system and the
update<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.360> I'm<00:02:39.810> going<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.990> be<00:02:40.080> showing

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
update to that I'm going to be showing

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.950 
update to that I'm going to be showing
you<00:02:40.560> how<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:40.920> can<00:02:41.310> customize<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.780> can

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
you how you can customize it so you can

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.780 
you how you can customize it so you can
loop<00:02:43.200> by<00:02:43.380> monetary<00:02:43.830> value<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.610> want<00:02:44.760> a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
loop by monetary value so if you want a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.750 
loop by monetary value so if you want a
100k<00:02:45.240> drops<00:02:45.510> only<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.350> can<00:02:46.530> select<00:02:46.830> 100k<00:02:47.520> and

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
100k drops only you can select 100k and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.610 
100k drops only you can select 100k and
you'll<00:02:48.180> get<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.480> i'm<00:02:49.080> going<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.290> set<00:02:49.470> mine<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
you'll get that i'm going to set mine to

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.910 
you'll get that i'm going to set mine to
1k<00:02:50.160> because<00:02:50.460> 1k<00:02:50.850> adds<00:02:51.060> up<00:02:51.300> after<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.690> while<00:02:51.930> and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
1k because 1k adds up after a while and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.560 
1k because 1k adds up after a while and
that's<00:02:53.160> useful<00:02:53.460> for<00:02:53.820> Slayer<00:02:54.060> because<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> lot

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
that's useful for Slayer because a lot

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.990 
that's useful for Slayer because a lot
of<00:02:54.600> drops<00:02:54.840> are<00:02:55.020> just<00:02:55.200> under<00:02:55.440> 1k<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.790> they<00:02:56.940> do

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
of drops are just under 1k and they do

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.330 
of drops are just under 1k and they do
add<00:02:57.270> up<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.350> depends<00:02:58.710> on<00:02:58.800> what<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.070> want<00:02:59.100> a

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
add up so it depends on what you want a

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.790 
add up so it depends on what you want a
look<00:02:59.520> you<00:02:59.730> can<00:02:59.880> tick<00:03:00.090> each<00:03:00.300> option<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.710> I'm

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
look you can tick each option and I'm

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.220 
look you can tick each option and I'm
going<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.070> take<00:03:02.490> each<00:03:02.700> one<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:04.050> will

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
going to take each one and this will

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.930 
going to take each one and this will
allow<00:03:04.410> me<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.830> loot<00:03:05.010> everything<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.910> on

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
allow me to loot everything that is on

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.940 
allow me to loot everything that is on
the<00:03:06.120> ground<00:03:06.300> within<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.170> radius<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.830> I've

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.490 
it's going to make Luton a lot easier
still<00:04:29.670> for<00:04:29.880> example<00:04:30.270> one<00:04:30.660> kid<00:04:30.960> did<00:04:31.170> not<00:04:31.350> get

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
still for example one kid did not get

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.830 
still for example one kid did not get
picked<00:04:31.710> up<00:04:31.830> because<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.280> coins<00:04:32.580> were<00:04:32.880> under

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
picked up because the coins were under

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.490 
picked up because the coins were under
1k<00:04:35.210> so<00:04:36.210> yeah<00:04:36.360> overall<00:04:36.690> this<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:36.930> a<00:04:37.080> really<00:04:37.380> good

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
1k so yeah overall this is a really good

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.870 
1k so yeah overall this is a really good
update<00:04:37.650> it's<00:04:37.950> going<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.130> be<00:04:38.220> very<00:04:38.250> useful<00:04:38.550> for

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
update it's going to be very useful for

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.090 
update it's going to be very useful for
people<00:04:39.210> doing<00:04:39.570> Slayer<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.110> any<00:04:40.830> type<00:04:41.070> of

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
people doing Slayer and any type of

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.490 
people doing Slayer and any type of
Boston<00:04:42.090> really<00:04:42.390> that<00:04:42.780> requires<00:04:43.170> you<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.380> pick

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
Boston really that requires you to pick

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.440 
Boston really that requires you to pick
up<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:43.710> lot<00:04:43.860> of<00:04:43.950> drops<00:04:44.160> in<00:04:44.340> a<00:04:44.730> short<00:04:45.180> amount<00:04:45.240> of

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
up a lot of drops in a short amount of

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.260 
up a lot of drops in a short amount of
time<00:04:45.540> and<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:46.740> think<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.340> only<00:04:47.490> thing<00:04:47.580> i'd<00:04:47.820> like

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
time and I think the only thing i'd like

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.900
