00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 people of the eduardo olympic committee 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.099
 álvarez of some supposed gifts that 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.990
 had done the organizing committee 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.660
 precisely from Lima perú to the members 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.420
 of the International Olympic Committee 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.010
 forward juan jose 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.720
 many of us are here with the president 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.900
 of the olympic committee of rosalba 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.180
 supposedly with the bitterness of not 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.349
 get a result maybe out of 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.539
 expected that not only these 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.699
 teachers we asked 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.699
 it seems a little strange to us that neither 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.469
 even a second round lima takes out the 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.710
 candidacy in the first convention or 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:40.480
 something but of course we expected that 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.760
 the vote was more distributed 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.329
 however, we realize that the 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.950
 sum of the three Argentine countries 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.630
 we got 26 votes 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.190
 lima the case more than 30 votes need 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.710
 first round not giving the opportunity 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.809
 of a second round 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.390
 well I think that this suit all these 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.300
 things are 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.070
 what we announced today with the 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.870
 first instance economic resources 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.640
 that are being handled above what 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.970
 ethical however we do not accept the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.080
 result and we will analyze it with 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.910
 with enough depth 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.980
 we will continue trying to make a 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.370
 clean game will change what you have to 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.830
 see with the route the sport us 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.780
 we did an excellent demonstration we 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.520
 we prepare for the candidacy between 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.680
 Venezuela and the people of Bolívar must 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.080
 be proud of how we made the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.470
 presentation we were the best 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.970
 technical presentation we had the best 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.220
 results in all meetings that 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.970
 we are here however can not be seen 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.850
 this result there are votes that is a 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.060
 minority that added this are great and 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.460
 is in most countries that are going to 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.440
 Pan-American games with 45 consell to 30 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.090
 without making decisions and those countries 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.850
 good are those who are most favored 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.170
 with life is giving that as methods 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.180
 and Lima Peru 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.560
 well guys we have also to the 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.759
 minister I cut it Alejandra Benitez 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.179
 Expert in us, of course 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.030
 that sharing this let's say pain 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.170
 Alejandro because I think I'm staying with 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.880
 the words of one of the boys 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.959
 we did what we had to do and 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.800
 well unfortunately in other 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.800
 results 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.560
 yes good it 's amazing what not even 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.100
 have tried a second round that I 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.370
 He missed us more with the 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.070
 Caribbean pages thinking that there 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.710
 We have strength throughout the port of 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.820
 your unconditional support that we have had 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.850
 at the political, economic, social and 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.450
 sports is a great link that we have 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.850
 had 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.750
 let's hope it's always more from 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.660
 commander you know he came and spoke and he 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.150
 felt part of that libya today we think 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.820
 that we can tell how it goes without 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.150
 however when we saw here affected with 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.470
 others like everything with other factors that 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.470
 we regret not
