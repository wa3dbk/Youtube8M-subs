it<00:02:41.360> with<00:02:41.450> these<00:02:42.010> just<00:02:43.010> because<00:02:43.250> it's<00:02:43.430> it's

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
it with these just because it's it's

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.970 
it with these just because it's it's
gonna<00:02:43.850> look<00:02:44.660> like<00:02:44.720> her<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:45.410> much<00:02:45.590> more<00:02:45.830> with

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
gonna look like her so much more with

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.420 
gonna look like her so much more with
those<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:47.780> also<00:02:47.930> came<00:02:48.260> with<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.830> jacket<00:02:52.280> which

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
those it also came with the jacket which

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.280 
those it also came with the jacket which
I<00:02:52.549> think<00:02:52.790> she<00:02:52.940> wore<00:02:53.150> in<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.390> cold<00:02:53.630> in<00:02:54.080> the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
I think she wore in the cold in the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.820 
I think she wore in the cold in the
colder<00:02:55.040> sections<00:02:55.400> of<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.610> movie<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:57.230> probably

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
colder sections of the movie I probably

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.130 
colder sections of the movie I probably
won't<00:02:58.040> use<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:58.489> but<00:02:58.819> it<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.239> still<00:02:59.690> cool<00:02:59.870> I

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
won't use this but it is still cool I

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.420 
won't use this but it is still cool I
just<00:03:00.170> think<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.650> takes<00:03:00.680> away<00:03:01.100> from<00:03:01.130> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
just think it takes away from the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.670 
just think it takes away from the
costume<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.299> she<00:03:02.450> comes<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.230> I'll<00:03:03.650> show

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
costume that she comes in and I'll show

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.620 
costume that she comes in and I'll show
you<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.069> in<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.190> moment<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:05.090> she<00:03:05.299> also<00:03:05.390> comes

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
you that in a moment and she also comes

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.900 
you that in a moment and she also comes
with<00:03:06.400> an<00:03:07.400> extra<00:03:07.660> sort<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.720> hair<00:03:08.900> basically<00:03:09.910> and

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
with an extra sort of hair basically and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.220 
with an extra sort of hair basically and
I'll<00:03:11.030> try<00:03:11.269> this<00:03:11.329> out<00:03:11.600> as<00:03:11.750> well<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.019> see<00:03:12.140> if

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
I'll try this out as well and see if

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.150 
I'll try this out as well and see if
it's<00:03:12.350> an<00:03:12.530> improvement

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
it's an improvement

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.460 
it's an improvement
or<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.970> takes<00:03:14.209> away<00:03:14.450> from<00:03:14.480> what<00:03:14.900> what<00:03:15.320> already

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
or it takes away from what what already

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.860 
or it takes away from what what already
is<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.220> figure<00:03:16.489> so<00:03:17.420> I'll<00:03:17.510> show<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.750> the

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
Evil I definitely think it looks like

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.270 
Evil I definitely think it looks like
Milla<00:03:25.340> Jovovich<00:03:25.430> as<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.420> character<00:03:26.750> Alice

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
Milla Jovovich as the character Alice

arms turn around
there<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:56.989> go<00:03:57.109> and<00:03:57.350> as<00:03:57.440> you<00:03:57.500> can<00:03:57.680> see<00:03:58.090> this

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
there you go and as you can see this

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.479

pouch<00:03:59.359> is<00:03:59.389> on<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.750> back<00:03:59.900> too<00:04:00.109> I<00:04:00.410> dare<00:04:01.190> say<00:04:01.220> the

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
pouch is on the back too I dare say the

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.789 
pouch is on the back too I dare say the
middle<00:04:01.639> ones<00:04:01.819> for<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.060> sword<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:03.440> two<00:04:03.590> side

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
middle ones for the sword the two side

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.870 
middle ones for the sword the two side
ones<00:04:03.980> would<00:04:04.220> be<00:04:04.250> for<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:04.579> Gurkha<00:04:04.850> blades<00:04:05.650> the

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
ones would be for the Gurkha blades the

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.430 
ones would be for the Gurkha blades the
under<00:04:07.880> arm<00:04:08.030> holsters<00:04:08.510> would<00:04:08.840> be<00:04:09.019> for<00:04:09.319> the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
under arm holsters would be for the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.130 
under arm holsters would be for the
revolvers<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.579> guess<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:11.480> MV<00:04:11.720> fires<00:04:11.959> just

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
revolvers and I guess the MV fires just

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
revolvers and I guess the MV fires just
have<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.380> be<00:04:13.500> carried<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.870> pretty<00:04:16.739> good<00:04:16.769> figure

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
have to be carried so pretty good figure

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.800 
have to be carried so pretty good figure
I<00:04:19.130> like<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.310> I'll<00:04:21.120> just<00:04:21.180> give<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.480> a<00:04:21.570> bit<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.720> a

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
I like it I'll just give you a bit of a

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:34.410 
I like it I'll just give you a bit of a
quick<00:04:21.930> pin

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.030 

and<00:04:34.960> we'll<00:04:35.170> just<00:04:35.320> do<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.470> bit<00:04:35.590> of<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.740> close-up

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
and we'll just do a bit of a close-up

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.670 
and we'll just do a bit of a close-up
for<00:04:36.580> comparison<00:04:37.240> just<00:04:37.480> to<00:04:38.140> see<00:04:38.290> if<00:04:38.440> you<00:04:38.530> think

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
for comparison just to see if you think

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.200 
for comparison just to see if you think
that<00:04:38.920> you<00:04:39.520> know<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:39.760> looks<00:04:39.910> like<00:04:39.970> the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
that you know it looks like the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.430 
that you know it looks like the
character<00:04:40.600> I<00:04:40.720> think<00:04:40.750> they<00:04:41.020> did<00:04:41.200> pretty<00:04:41.230> good

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
character I think they did pretty good

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.060 
character I think they did pretty good
