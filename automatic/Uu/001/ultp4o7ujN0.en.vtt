00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
into this but I think all in all the WWE

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.859 
into this but I think all in all the WWE
did<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.740> right<00:01:52.950> thing<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.479> Roman

reigns<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.229> know<00:01:55.350> quite<00:01:55.530> frankly<00:01:56.630> although<00:01:57.630> I

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
reigns you know quite frankly although I

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.780 
reigns you know quite frankly although I
think<00:01:57.930> he's<00:01:58.020> improved<00:01:58.409> maybe<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.460> wasn't

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
think he's improved maybe it just wasn't

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.340 
think he's improved maybe it just wasn't
in<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.119> cards<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.719> know<00:02:00.810> Vince<00:02:01.049> McMahon

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
in the cards and you know Vince McMahon

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.170 
in the cards and you know Vince McMahon

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
into place pretty good but that's just

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.520 
into place pretty good but that's just
my<00:03:18.489> feeling<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:18.940> just<00:03:19.209> my<00:03:19.359> opinion<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:19.959> have

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
my feeling that just my opinion I have

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.379

no<00:03:20.769> problem<00:03:21.250> with<00:03:21.639> the<00:03:21.729> way<00:03:21.819> Triple<00:03:22.180> H<00:03:22.269> and

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
no problem with the way Triple H and

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:23.819 
no problem with the way Triple H and
stings<00:03:22.750> match<00:03:22.930> when<00:03:23.169> a<00:03:23.199> little<00:03:23.440> bit<00:03:23.530> longer

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
stings match when a little bit longer

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.920
