00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.469 
mohawk style Velcro setup for my back I
really<00:01:09.240> need<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:10.010> counterweight<00:01:11.299> because<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
really need a counterweight because the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.210 
really need a counterweight because the
night<00:01:12.990> vision<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.680> weighs<00:01:13.830> down<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
night vision really weighs down in the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.370 
night vision really weighs down in the
front<00:01:14.450> I'm<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:15.600> saying<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.200> heavy

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
front I'm not saying that it's heavy

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.039 
front I'm not saying that it's heavy
because<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.830> not<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.310> heavy<00:01:17.460> actually

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
because it's not that heavy actually

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.170 
because it's not that heavy actually
it's<00:01:19.049> pretty<00:01:19.290> lightweight<00:01:19.880> but<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.939> really

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
it's pretty lightweight but I really

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.140 
it's pretty lightweight but I really
need<00:01:21.299> someone<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:22.549> counteract<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.970> yeah

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
need someone to counteract that so yeah

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.480
