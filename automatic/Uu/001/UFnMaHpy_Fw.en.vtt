00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.860
 but how nice please look 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.640

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.960
 what preciousness hello guys and girls that 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.840
 as they are 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.250
 I'm out consumer and this is a video 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.169
 informative you know that normally 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.910
 I prefer to upload creative videos or 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.219
 humorous but sometimes the occasion 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.960
 requires that you upload something informative like 

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:34.750
 is the case and is I want to report how 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.579
 you can win a cat catcher 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.290
 gaming that is a cat catcher 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.090
 gaming you sew this there you have it 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.579
 beautiful how beautiful that is what I use 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.910
 for almost three years and how can you 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.679
 winning it is not a raffle but a contest 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.210
 and now I'm going to explain how it works 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.530
 Where does this come from, what did you see? 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.280
 my last video of the canijo up to 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.749
 final 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.699
 you know that for a few weeks 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:56.769
 sponsors the cat gaming and this what 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.510
 means to you means two 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.399
 things the first is that you are going to see your 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.559
 logo in some places on my channel without 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.909
 that comes to bother of course and the 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.070
 another one that I find much more interesting 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.940
 for us is that twice a month 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.950
 I'm going to draw or give away in a contest 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.479
 because a catch cat link is the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.130
 capturing that to me sincerely what 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.930
 you know the ones that follow me I like 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.850
 I have been using it for three years 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.920
 went to the market and I have not used any 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.780
 I assure you that others have offered me 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.020
 to use them but this is the one that 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.909
 like more for me it has the best quality 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.159
 the best compression the files weigh 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.140
 little they look great at 1080 and so on 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.439
 has of course by far the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.140
 better software that will improve it very 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.149
 often then make direct with youtube 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.460
 with tweets directly from the 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.289
 capturing you can add your comment 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.119
 of voice in the last update that 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.670
 It is about to leave can 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.890
 record your voice apart well in order what 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.259
 what the pc capturers offer 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.060
 but in this case it 's external and so 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.740
 it's so good for consoles 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.720
 for play 4 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.439
 you have to use spleeters unless 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.450
 within nothing are and will update the 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.069
 software of the playstation 4 then it 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.360
 you can perfectly record with 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:12.180
 playstation 4 which is as I do 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.190
 xbox 360 xbox one playstation 3 wii 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.799
 any little console that you have 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.870
 iPad whatever it is that serves you this 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.950
 capturing the truth is that I insist 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.120
 for me it's the best ones that have long 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.409
 that you follow me 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.810
 is that I 've always said that always 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.879
 I thought that I have always used it and in 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.500
 end which is what I think so this 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.940
 sponsorship then it comes out naturally 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.159
 because we have been working for a long time 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.659
 together it's worth but let's focus on what's more 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.549
 important I do not want to make an announcement 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.230
 although here you see how well it captures 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.299
 well that looks at 1,080 a game like 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.340
 infamous second are for playstation 4 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.659
 okay and there are the split is for 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.519
 I think it will look a little better 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.319
 When you do the update, the ones are 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.849
 and good to the point as you can win the 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.530
 capturing that you have to do good 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.790
 what's important also the ones that 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.099
 you know you know that I always do it like that 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.019
 you do not have to write the courses 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.670
 you need to like you do not need 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.109
 Follow me on twitter on Facebook 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.819
 nothing nothing does not need anything of that no 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.859
 you do not even need to know who 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.359
 I am equally agree in the 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.370
 description is like this you have to read it 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.920
 because there is the link where it is explained 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.450
 all the details of the contest is worth 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.609
 important that you read them all for 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.379
 participate appropriately worth 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.510
 basically you have to send me a video 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.000
 made by you with a mobile phone with a 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.430
 professional camera I do not care what 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.680
 you want a maximum of 10 seconds if you have 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.879
 more than 10 seconds I will not accept it in the 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.010
 to explain to me why you want a 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.930
 capturing according to the three that I 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.790
 like that more in each draw 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.040
 two a month the three that I like the most 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.109
 I'm going to post them on my facebook 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.640
 agreement are going to be there I will advise by 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.290
 agreement twitter and buenavista por 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.930
 facebook also for a week 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.370
 you whoever you want can vote the 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.049
 that you like more the one that has more 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.909
 you like at the end of the week you take the 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.560
 capturing that simple in agreement 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.629
 can participate people from outside 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.879
 Spain from outside Europe in principle 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.530
 if the captor sends it to the people 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.269
 Cat gaming and have told me not 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.920
 There is a problem that they are going to try to send it 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.930
 Spain also outside it means that 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.030
 fantastic you can participate all 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.470
 you just have to send a video and 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.329
 say hey I want the captor to 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.239
 this for it and for the one beyond 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.579
 As you know how I am if you have humor and 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.379
 it's funny and it's original, there's more 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.480
 possibilities for me to choose between 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.980
 the three finalists and then the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.630
 people are going to vote simply with the me 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.190
 you like it, it seems to me the most 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.079
 it just seems more fair to me to make a 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.090
 draw I know I will receive criticism 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.280
 always critical because they have chosen this 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.900
 idol other than I already know but still 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.370
 it's worth it, I think it's something fun 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.169
 I think it's something that 's fine I think that 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.669
 it's something that if you want to be youtubers or 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.930
 you want to start uploading videos or 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.060
 you simply want to record our 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.500
 games with quality or simply 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.750
 you want to spend your videos 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.460
 of vhs when you were little what 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.690
 you want to go digital also serves as 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.310
 agreement the truth is that it is a 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.710
 very powerful tool for mac for 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.900
 windows the only thing that works for us is 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.240
 you always need a computer you can not 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.650
 put an external hard drive needs 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.200
 a computer to work worth is the 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.030
 only stick in quotation marks that has 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.950
 agreement then here you are seeing 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.650
 now need for speed drivers that is another 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.900
 game that looks luxurious on playstation 4 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.340
 of Carlos in all the textures all 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.500
 the particles that fly through the air 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.240
 etcetera all these things in short this 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.850
 has been the explanation I hope that you 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.950
 I hope that this sponsorship with the 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.780
 cat gaming I wanted it to be something 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.640
 good for you both for you 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.290
 as for me that it was not something annoying 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.000
 that sometimes happens not with sponsorships 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.680
 that somehow bothers you or not 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.330
 brings nothing to the followers, not because I 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.580
 I wanted to give you something and I think that 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.320
 these draws are pretty cool and 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.090
 they can help who knows what 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.560
 then what you start to be youtubers 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.910
 to get away with this or 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.810
 just enjoy recording 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.510
 your games 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.520
 eye to the jump well so in the end that's 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.890
 That is the theme I hope you like it 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.260
 that you go to the description to read all 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.490
 the exact details of how you have to 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.319
 participate in agreement 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.300
 I'm not going to make a video 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.680
 is following a helicopter there I'm not going 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.419
 to make a video for each draw this 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.590
 is going to be the only informative video since 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.900
 from now on twitter and on facebook 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.250
 is where I'm going to explain when you're going to see 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.199
 new raffles and when you can 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.729
 participate you can participate more than one 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.009
 If you can obviously participate 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.630
 in all the drawings until you have 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.979
 the captor and you can receive it in 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.110
 your house without any expense 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.880
 obviously for you it's worth 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.530
 finally I wanted to share this with 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.150

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.940
 cool that I'm excited and also 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.410

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.030
 sponsored by a company that 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.889
 I like that I have always worked with her 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.780
 and that I really appreciate your 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.250
