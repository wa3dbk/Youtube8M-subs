circulation to occur for example with
folic<00:01:01.600> acid<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:03.129> is<00:01:03.160> an<00:01:03.670> enzyme<00:01:04.560> mutation

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
folic acid there is an enzyme mutation

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.370 
folic acid there is an enzyme mutation
which<00:01:06.700> affects<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.299> enzyme<00:01:07.689> called<00:01:07.959> methyl

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
which affects the enzyme called methyl

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.739 
which affects the enzyme called methyl
tetrahydrofolate<00:01:09.159> reductase<00:01:09.909> which<00:01:10.630> is

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:10.749 
tetrahydrofolate reductase which is

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.599 
tetrahydrofolate reductase which is
quite<00:01:10.929> common<00:01:11.289> in<00:01:11.350> Caucasian<00:01:11.709> populations<00:01:12.490> I

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:12.609 
quite common in Caucasian populations I

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:16.069 
quite common in Caucasian populations I
think<00:01:12.999> I<00:01:14.069> think<00:01:15.069> it's<00:01:15.280> something<00:01:15.459> like<00:01:15.670> why

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
think I think it's something like why

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.999 
think I think it's something like why
15%<00:01:17.079> up<00:01:17.829> to<00:01:18.069> 50%<00:01:18.340> in<00:01:18.729> some<00:01:19.029> Caucasian<00:01:19.630> groups

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
15% up to 50% in some Caucasian groups

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.239 
15% up to 50% in some Caucasian groups
and<00:01:21.009> in<00:01:21.399> these<00:01:21.579> groups<00:01:21.909> if<00:01:22.179> you<00:01:22.329> have<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.950> gene

how existing is in general it does not
appear<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.119> be<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.299> very<00:01:46.539> good<00:01:46.689> thing<00:01:47.069> the<00:01:48.069> nice

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
appear to be a very good thing the nice

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.730 
appear to be a very good thing the nice
thing<00:01:48.759> about<00:01:48.819> betaine<00:01:49.329> is<00:01:49.539> that<00:01:49.929> it<00:01:50.259> gets

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
thing about betaine is that it gets

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.120 
thing about betaine is that it gets
around<00:01:51.009> those<00:01:51.669> enzyme<00:01:52.119> problems<00:01:52.539> and<00:01:53.039> it's<00:01:54.039> a

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
around those enzyme problems and it's a

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.309 
around those enzyme problems and it's a
way<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.549> even<00:01:55.419> if<00:01:55.509> you<00:01:55.599> have<00:01:55.749> been<00:01:55.899> dealt<00:01:56.079> an

way of even if you have been dealt an

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.379 
way of even if you have been dealt an
unfortunate<00:01:56.859> genetic<00:01:57.340> hand<00:01:57.609> of<00:01:57.759> cards<00:01:58.149> if<00:01:58.299> you

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
unfortunate genetic hand of cards if you

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.149 
unfortunate genetic hand of cards if you
like<00:01:58.569> this<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.229> way<00:01:59.409> of<00:01:59.439> short-circuiting

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
like this is a way of short-circuiting

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.949 
like this is a way of short-circuiting
that<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.729> nice<00:02:00.909> thing<00:02:01.119> about<00:02:01.179> b10<00:02:01.689> is<00:02:01.840> that

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
that the nice thing about b10 is that

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.649 
that the nice thing about b10 is that
it's<00:02:02.079> cheapest<00:02:02.499> chips<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:04.119> waste<00:02:04.329> product

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
it's cheapest chips it's a waste product

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.209 
it's cheapest chips it's a waste product
if<00:02:04.989> you<00:02:05.079> can<00:02:05.229> believe<00:02:05.349> that<00:02:05.619> from<00:02:05.919> the<00:02:06.189> sugar

compound it's not only present in sugar
beet<00:02:12.820> but<00:02:13.510> also<00:02:13.720> in<00:02:14.170> freshwater<00:02:14.650> shrimp<00:02:15.100> and

spin it
a<00:02:16.010> variety<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.490> other<00:02:16.670> foods<00:02:16.970> but<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.420> quite

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
a variety of other foods but in quite

a variety of other foods but in quite
low<00:02:17.840> levels<00:02:18.200> what<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.340> veterinarians<00:02:19.910> have

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
low levels what the veterinarians have

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.540 
low levels what the veterinarians have
found<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.600> that<00:02:20.630> by<00:02:20.810> adding<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.100> diet

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
found is that by adding this to the diet

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.780 
found is that by adding this to the diet
of<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:23.170> number<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.290> economically<00:02:25.280> important

productivity and it's pretty obvious
