00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.769
 channel 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.019

 car and I want to share with you 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.320
 technique 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.990
 this is not a difficult task and to whom 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.119
 interesting stay with me and in this 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.490
 easy action lead roles 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.099
 The following items are such 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.360
 small basin 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:36.030
 medical gloves sponge and cloth well 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.270
 and of course cleaners where without 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.700
 i have it frosch soda and 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.260
 gel for washing baby supplies 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.410
 eared nannies with antibacterial 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.180
 The effect of these tools is in detail. 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.699
 will not stop as I have 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.039
 there are already videos dedicated to this 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.890
 If you are interested, go 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.180
 by reference and watch these videos 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.339
 Now let's proceed to the actual cleaning 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.400
 washing machines and so here she is mine 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.960
 helper indispensable in creating clean 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.970
 of things this washing machine here i am not 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.610
 I will open you to show here I 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.090
 quite recently, all cleaned and soap 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.220
 see me here all clean here 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.780
 principle too 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.450
 Black dial no dust nothing more than 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.130
 because every day I have somehow 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.229
 I used to say every day 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.420
 wipe the dust from all speakers 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.299
 surfaces in particular from the machine 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.119
 side too that is on top and here with here 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.040
 this panel here here wipe here 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.090
 here and here and therefore here as if 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.360
 everything is clean and 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.780
 and does not require additional cleaning 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.500
 sorry for the tautology here 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.210
 see what a raid on the glass is inside 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.719
 here too 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.299
 dusty, dirty, well, of course 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.640
 please see from the powder going on 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.440
 ice that is rubber inside 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.380
 yes clean here clean well and 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.009
 Naturally the drum itself is also necessary 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.140
 to clean 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.220
 Well, let's get down to cleaning washing 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.630
 cars and so this one here i go 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:31.739
 I will try to clean the soda with frosch 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:34.890
 now i sprinkle well i'm pouring on and 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.310
 I can say that you can immediately see how the glass 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.730
 cleared becomes transparent again 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.239
 means frosch soda justified itself on 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.709
 all 100 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.050
 I washed the cleaning products with water 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.140
 it was enough for me to wipe once 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.430
 wet cloth to clean 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.890
 actually all cleaner with 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.830
 surfaces and I did it on purpose 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.080
 to show you how you see in principle 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.410
 perfectly clear glass was cleaned 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.900
 now that is great cleaning 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.420
 I managed the funds now I'm alone 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.250
 glove and I will wash these here 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.620
 rubber 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.070
 surface and drum for this i'm 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.110
 the basin did not take some water and added 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.680
 here this gel wash 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.060
 baby supplies eared babysitters 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.400
 Added and and somewhere here roughly 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.269
 so much water added and about a third 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.450
 glass to the solution was so foamy 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.730
 by richer and to be 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.280
 antibacterial effect and interesting 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.350
 fact of washing machine the other day 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.190
 literally watched a program in which 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.660
 We had experience and found out what 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.030
 washing machine 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.610
 germs here here on surfaces 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.620
 accumulates much more than 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.049
 the fridge and even on the toilet 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.380
 imagine unbelievable but true 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.870
 How much do these experiments correspond 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.630
 I really don’t know but in 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.420
 anyway washing machine of course 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.569
 need to periodically wash some tonal 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.400
 by means 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.829
 sometimes I use the usual economic 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.499
 soap that is also economic sodium 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:17.079
 soap and a sponge strictly speaking 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:19.479
 now i will do the same i will apply here 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.380
 this is the means for all surfaces 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.690
 I'll clean well and already rinse I don't 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.300
 I will not spend time on it I 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.900
 close the machine will turn on the rinse mode and 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.449
 the machine will do everything for me, she herself 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.849
 fell shield wash wash away all remnants 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.330
 detergent and I will only 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:43.990
 open and air dry the washing 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:50.340
 car, let's get down to cleaning 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:54.099
 rubber surfaces and so i sponge 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:59.430
 lather on money and here you are 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:59.430
 raznoshu on gum 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.649
 I applied all the surface and 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.349
 notice 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:22.949
 all this foam that was in the beginning at 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.479
 applying instantly as it dissolves 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:31.389
 straight as if evaporates from the surface 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:34.809
 and don't forget this part too 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:37.629
 be sure to go through it cleaning 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:41.409
 by means of carefully here carefully 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:44.019
 zalazim here in all the guts 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:49.689
 in fact, I soaped everything 

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:53.909
 cleaned up now I close the washing 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:59.459
 I don’t even wash the car myself now 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:06:03.309
 turn on the machine expose 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:07.629
 mode here it is exposing the rinsing mode 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:08.079
 and spin so that all the water is gone this 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.329
 foam 

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:14.889
 I'll clean it all up now with a cloth 

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:18.399
 okay and now turn on 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:20.669
 the machine itself is now all rinse everything 

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:24.689
 will wash about getting how much she needs and 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:29.589
 will be clean well here rinse cycle 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:35.069
 ended and now I open the left 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:36.249
 a little bit of foam i'm a rag it's all simple 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:39.189
 wipe out 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:41.859
 Well, look no plaque from 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:44.159
 powder rubber is clean it is water marks 

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:48.309
 because it is still wet 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:51.039
 here too the water remains wet and so everything 

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:53.949
 clean in this area was dust and dirt 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:56.439
 also now everything is pure machine for me 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:58.839
 cleaned up I hope all the bacteria 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:01.559
 I destroyed and actually I am 

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:05.079
 pretty simple simple technique 

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:07.300
