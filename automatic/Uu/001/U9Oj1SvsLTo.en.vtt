Welcome to Home care at Home

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.560
We have received a mail of Ms. Neeta Saravani from Madhya Pradesh, who says

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.380
Her palms have got too hard and rough

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.400
The skin has got too hard and rough

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.880
She cannot even wear bangles properly

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.740
I had over worked few days back, may be because of that the skin has got rough

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.340
Earlier my palms were very smooth

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.080
Please suggest me a good home remedy which can give bring back my smooth palms

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.700
Ms. Neeta you don't need to worry at all, I'll give you very easy remedies for it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.440
First of all what you have to do is

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.020
Take a hot water in a plate

00:00:52.106 --> 00:00:54.106
And add little rock salt into it

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.980
After adding rock salt make sure you have taken enough water, you can dip both your hands into it

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.400
Then add 1-2 drops of lemon juice into it

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.160
And keep your hands like this in the plate for 10 min

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.020
After 10 min, take out your hands

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.480
And tap dry towel on your hands and wipe it off

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.940
Then massage caster oil on your hands nicely

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.820
And you'll see that the bangles which were not moving up in your hands earlier has fluently slides in.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.260
And the hardness in your skin will also get away

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.300
Apart from this you have also mentioned that your skin has got too rough and hard

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.900
I'll suggest you a remedy for this, you can take 1 lemon and cut it into 2 pieces

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:46.540
Take 1 piece and massage it thoroughly on palms, fingures, nails and on wrist only in the night

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.380
Repeat same on other hand also

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.740
Then dry your hands in the open space and keep it that way for whole night,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.640
Let the lemon juice remain on your hands whole night, and wash it off in the morning

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:06.420
Do this remedy for a week and you'll see that the roughness in your skin has smooth now

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.120
Apart from this I'll give you one more remedy

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.120
Take a little milk cream, add pinch of turmeric powder into it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.720
It will be great if you have saffron, if not you can add sandalwood powder too

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.680
Mix it well and in the morning, massage it on your hands

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.600
Massage it so thoroughly that the cream should enter in your pores

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.320
Then wash your hands with a luke warm water

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.760
You'll find that your wrist have got smooth skin like it was before

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.680
