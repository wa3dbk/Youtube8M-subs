fall<00:03:23.209> off<00:03:23.359> yet<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.840> then<00:03:24.380> also<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.799> reason

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
fall off yet and then also the reason

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.740 
fall off yet and then also the reason
why<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.160> made<00:03:25.519> it<00:03:25.609> was<00:03:25.760> because<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.269> was<00:03:26.389> bored

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
why I made it was because I was bored

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.690 
why I made it was because I was bored
and<00:03:27.019> so<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:27.680> just<00:03:27.859> felt<00:03:27.980> like<00:03:28.130> making<00:03:28.340> something

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
and so I just felt like making something

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.379 
and so I just felt like making something
and<00:03:29.299> I<00:03:29.359> also<00:03:29.540> felt<00:03:29.780> like<00:03:29.900> making<00:03:30.109> a<00:03:30.260> video<00:03:30.380> and

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
and I also felt like making a video and

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.550 
and I also felt like making a video and
so<00:03:32.389> that's<00:03:32.569> like<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.870> third<00:03:33.019> reason<00:03:33.380> why<00:03:33.500> you

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
so that's like the third reason why you

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.940 
so that's like the third reason why you
would<00:03:34.160> want<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.459> make<00:03:34.579> it<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:36.260> basically<00:03:36.560> this

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
would want to make it so basically this

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.650 
would want to make it so basically this
is<00:03:37.130> like<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.280> new<00:03:37.489> section<00:03:37.910> for<00:03:37.940> my<00:03:38.209> channel

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
is like a new section for my channel

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.599 
is like a new section for my channel
just<00:03:38.930> basically<00:03:39.500> on<00:03:39.739> like<00:03:40.100> how<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.340> make

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
just basically on like how to make

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.720 
just basically on like how to make
things<00:03:40.940> so<00:03:41.750> basically<00:03:41.870> like<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.739> how<00:03:43.040> 2.0

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
things so basically like this how 2.0

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.789

though<00:03:44.150> if<00:03:44.480> I<00:03:44.660> find<00:03:44.930> things<00:03:45.170> I<00:03:45.350> like<00:03:45.560> in

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
though if I find things I like in

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.710 
though if I find things I like in
popular<00:03:46.519> science<00:03:46.730> I'll<00:03:47.060> probably<00:03:47.329> just<00:03:47.600> like

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
popular science I'll probably just like

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.910 
popular science I'll probably just like
make<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.930> video<00:03:48.230> about<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.709> then<00:03:49.250> um<00:03:49.600> I'll

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
make a video about it and then um I'll

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.319 
make a video about it and then um I'll
go<00:03:51.920> see<00:03:52.130> how<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.250> works<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.819> see<00:03:52.940> if<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.120> works

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
go see how it works and see if it works

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.390 
go see how it works and see if it works
nicely<00:03:53.599> then<00:03:53.959> I'll<00:03:54.110> say<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.159> it<00:03:55.250> works

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
nicely then I'll say that it works

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.580 
nicely then I'll say that it works
honestly<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:55.939> so<00:03:56.480> basically<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.379> screen

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
honestly and so basically and the screen

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.110 
honestly and so basically and the screen
protector<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:58.129> works<00:03:58.310> nicely

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
protector it works nicely

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.660 
protector it works nicely
I<00:03:59.150> guess<00:03:59.540> depended<00:04:00.020> on<00:04:00.110> what<00:04:00.890> tape<00:04:01.520> you<00:04:01.640> have

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
I guess depended on what tape you have

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.270 
I guess depended on what tape you have
