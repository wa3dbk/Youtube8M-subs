hi<00:00:01.620> this<00:00:01.680> time<00:00:02.070> I<00:00:02.190> want<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.399> show<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.730> using

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hi this time I want to show you using

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.510 
hi this time I want to show you using
for<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.689> fields<00:00:04.020> we<00:00:04.200> put<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:04.620> it<00:00:04.770> in<00:00:04.980> Fremont

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
for the fields we put on it in Fremont

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.560 
for the fields we put on it in Fremont
let's<00:00:06.270> create<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:07.109> cylinder<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:08.450> shattered<00:00:09.450> it

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
let's create a cylinder and shattered it

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.770 
let's create a cylinder and shattered it
in<00:00:10.110> about<00:00:10.440> 500<00:00:11.900> fragment<00:00:14.330> getting<00:00:15.330> treated

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
in about 500 fragment getting treated

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.980 
in about 500 fragment getting treated
produce<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.320> fly<00:00:18.680> okay<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:20.010> done

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
produce on the fly okay it's done

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.570 
produce on the fly okay it's done
after<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.170> color<00:00:22.350> back<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.570> let<00:00:24.740> swimming<00:00:25.740> to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
after the color back and let swimming to

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.510 
after the color back and let swimming to
check<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.240> famines<00:00:27.769> okay<00:00:29.449> and<00:00:30.449> now<00:00:30.630> let

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
check the famines okay and now let

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.220 
check the famines okay and now let
simulate<00:00:32.520> there<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.660> testing<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:35.960> famine<00:00:36.960> in

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
simulate there for testing the famine in

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:49.180 
simulate there for testing the famine in
dynamics<00:00:40.399> okay<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.850> collapsing

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.800 

okay<00:00:49.910> let<00:00:50.239> us<00:00:50.420> stop<00:00:50.660> this<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.200> now<00:00:52.720> we<00:00:53.720> are

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
okay let us stop this and now we are

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.100 
okay let us stop this and now we are
going<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.380> add<00:00:55.150> for<00:00:56.150> selfies<00:00:56.540> to<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.410> sink<00:00:59.110> in

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
going to add for selfies to the sink in

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.830 
going to add for selfies to the sink in
this<00:01:00.320> case<00:01:01.059> vortex<00:01:02.059> field<00:01:03.070> you<00:01:04.070> cannot<00:01:04.309> really

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
this case vortex field you cannot really

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.600 
this case vortex field you cannot really
use<00:01:05.840> any<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:06.320> them<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:07.450> let<00:01:08.450> increase<00:01:09.610> orbital

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
use any of them and let increase orbital

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.330 
use any of them and let increase orbital
speed<00:01:12.190> to<00:01:13.750> 1000<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:14.840> need<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.590> make<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.070> much

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
speed to 1000 you need to make it much

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.060 
speed to 1000 you need to make it much
more<00:01:16.670> strong<00:01:18.100> let<00:01:19.930> check<00:01:20.930> effect<00:01:21.410> field<00:01:21.680> for

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
more strong let check effect field for

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.279 
more strong let check effect field for
the<00:01:22.220> front<00:01:22.460> end<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:24.320> simulate<00:01:25.540> again<00:01:26.540> the

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
the front end and simulate again the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.200 
the front end and simulate again the
fertile<00:01:27.649> fields<00:01:28.420> okay<00:01:29.420> now<00:01:29.660> you<00:01:29.720> can<00:01:29.930> see<00:01:31.210> how

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
fertile fields okay now you can see how

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.700 
fertile fields okay now you can see how
the<00:01:33.110> front<00:01:33.470> man<00:01:34.030> spin<00:01:35.030> very<00:01:35.930> fast<00:01:36.170> because<00:01:36.500> of

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
the front man spin very fast because of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:45.010 
the front man spin very fast because of
the<00:01:36.890> vortex<00:01:37.490> field

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:53.130 

and<00:01:45.560> now<00:01:45.920> they<00:01:47.140> fall<00:01:48.430> because<00:01:50.079> of<00:01:51.220> gravity

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
and now they fall because of gravity

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.889 
and now they fall because of gravity
okay<00:01:54.140> nice<00:01:54.409> now<00:01:55.399> let's<00:01:55.670> create<00:01:56.390> some

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
okay nice now let's create some

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:05.310 
okay nice now let's create some
obstacles<00:01:59.899> for<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:01.240> front<00:02:02.240> meant<00:02:03.460> rocks<00:02:04.460> here

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320

OK<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.870> checked<00:02:56.710> by<00:02:56.830> switch<00:02:57.310> on<00:02:57.550> view<00:02:58.480> and

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
OK and it checked by switch on view and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.140 
OK and it checked by switch on view and
with<00:02:59.440> some<00:03:00.520> parameters<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.660> make<00:03:01.840> it

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
with some parameters to make it

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:12.830 
with some parameters to make it
easier<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.890> break<00:03:06.150> okay<00:03:10.440> now<00:03:11.440> select<00:03:11.980> the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
easier to break okay now select the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.180 
easier to break okay now select the
vortex<00:03:13.840> field<00:03:14.280> but<00:03:15.280> then<00:03:16.410> set<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.740> in<00:03:18.010> the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
vortex field but then set it in the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.180 
vortex field but then set it in the
window<00:03:21.840> yeah

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
window yeah

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.090 
window yeah
okay<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:25.060> tweak<00:03:25.750> some<00:03:26.200> parameter<00:03:28.290> after<00:03:29.290> the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
okay and tweak some parameter after the

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.980 
okay and tweak some parameter after the
time<00:03:30.400> of<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.920> 150<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.370> let's<00:03:34.030> animate<00:03:34.450> the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
time of to 150 and let's animate the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.770 
time of to 150 and let's animate the
orbital<00:03:35.440> speed<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:37.060> it's<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.780> star<00:03:39.000> with<00:03:40.000> 10<00:03:40.540> you

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
orbital speed so it's a star with 10 you

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.720 
orbital speed so it's a star with 10 you
need<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.530> after<00:03:42.340> one<00:03:42.730> second<00:03:43.300> and<00:03:44.050> it<00:03:44.980> becomes

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
need and after one second and it becomes

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.640 
need and after one second and it becomes
the<00:03:46.210> strong<00:03:47.080> 1000<00:03:47.920> units<00:03:49.290> okay

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
the strong 1000 units okay

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:59.010 
the strong 1000 units okay
it<00:03:51.190> is<00:03:51.340> animated<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:52.710> now<00:03:56.130> let<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.570> switch<00:03:58.570> the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
it is animated and now let a switch the

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.570 
it is animated and now let a switch the
color<00:03:59.340> to<00:04:00.340> yellow<00:04:00.550> for<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.090> salad<00:04:01.540> for<00:04:02.580> better

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
color to yellow for the salad for better

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.310 
color to yellow for the salad for better
visualization<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:06.280> let's<00:04:06.520> compute<00:04:07.320> dynamics

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
visualization and let's compute dynamics

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:19.979 
visualization and let's compute dynamics
again<00:04:11.430> back<00:04:12.430> in<00:04:12.610> case<00:04:12.790> is<00:04:13.000> time

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:29.029 

okay<00:04:20.789> the<00:04:21.789> segunda<00:04:22.660> start<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:25.470> spin<00:04:27.270> factoring

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
okay the segunda start to spin factoring

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:39.120 
okay the segunda start to spin factoring
while<00:04:30.240> tower<00:04:31.979> span

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.170 

and<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:40.960> supposed<00:04:41.520> when<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.730> frontman

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
and it is supposed when the frontman

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.510 
and it is supposed when the frontman
reach<00:04:43.930> dead<00:04:44.530> boxes<00:04:45.000> they<00:04:46.000> are<00:04:46.360> going<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.520> start

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
reach dead boxes they are going to start

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
reach dead boxes they are going to start
to<00:04:48.840> too<00:04:49.840> fat<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.830> me<00:04:50.920> because<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:52.060> the

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
to too fat to me because of the of the

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:06.740 
to too fat to me because of the of the
impact<00:04:55.320> let's<00:04:56.320> see

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.910 

okay<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.940> tour<00:05:09.810> on<00:05:10.170> the<00:05:10.380> left<00:05:11.370> side<00:05:11.580> is<00:05:11.910> a<00:05:12.920> fad

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
okay the tour on the left side is a fad

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.410 
okay the tour on the left side is a fad
doing<00:05:14.720> very<00:05:15.720> nice<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:16.950> the<00:05:17.460> others<00:05:17.850> start<00:05:18.330> to

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
doing very nice and the others start to

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:46.690 
doing very nice and the others start to
try<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:18.990> as<00:05:19.590> well<00:05:22.040> now<00:05:23.040> it's<00:05:23.370> collapsing

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.060 

okay<00:05:47.300> that<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:47.840> world<00:05:48.080> is<00:05:48.290> collapsing<00:05:48.620> as

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
okay that the world is collapsing as

00:05:49.070 --> 00:06:00.600 
okay that the world is collapsing as
well<00:05:51.970> and<00:05:55.690> you<00:05:56.690> can<00:05:56.720> see<00:05:57.050> the<00:05:58.210> box<00:05:59.210> behind<00:05:59.450> is<00:06:00.140> a

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
well and you can see the box behind is a

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.630 
well and you can see the box behind is a
damn<00:06:01.610> elite<00:06:01.910> but<00:06:02.180> not<00:06:02.420> called<00:06:02.810> Colosseum<00:06:03.800> this

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
damn elite but not called Colosseum this

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.690 
damn elite but not called Colosseum this
is<00:06:04.790> because<00:06:05.830> factoring<00:06:06.830> with<00:06:07.190> Putin<00:06:07.580> it

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
is because factoring with Putin it

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.990 
is because factoring with Putin it
depends<00:06:08.240> on<00:06:08.360> an<00:06:08.690> empath<00:06:09.080> and<00:06:09.350> in<00:06:09.530> this<00:06:09.620> case

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
depends on an empath and in this case

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.220 
depends on an empath and in this case
the<00:06:11.000> heat<00:06:13.180> stone<00:06:14.180> of<00:06:14.330> the<00:06:14.450> heat<00:06:14.660> hasn't<00:06:15.110> been

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
the heat stone of the heat hasn't been

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.850 
the heat stone of the heat hasn't been
enough<00:06:15.740> to<00:06:16.370> make<00:06:16.580> it<00:06:16.610> collapse<00:06:17.200> and<00:06:18.200> you<00:06:18.230> can

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
enough to make it collapse and you can

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.920 
enough to make it collapse and you can
make<00:06:21.860> it<00:06:23.410> collapsing<00:06:24.410> by<00:06:25.180> taking<00:06:26.180> some<00:06:26.510> fatty

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
make it collapsing by taking some fatty

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.480 
make it collapsing by taking some fatty
parameters<00:06:27.560> if<00:06:27.860> you<00:06:28.040> like<00:06:28.420> let<00:06:29.420> play<00:06:29.960> back<00:06:30.490> the

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
parameters if you like let play back the

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.730 
parameters if you like let play back the
assault<00:06:32.270> okay

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:45.320 

another<00:06:39.750> point<00:06:40.750> of<00:06:40.900> view

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:55.960 

okay<00:06:46.099> on<00:06:47.099> the<00:06:47.250> top<00:06:47.509> and<00:06:48.860> plug<00:06:49.860> in<00:06:50.039> real-time

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:02.260 

okay<00:06:56.540> spinning<00:06:57.260> and<00:06:58.270> baking<00:06:59.830> this<00:07:00.830> is<00:07:01.270> using

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
okay spinning and baking this is using

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.520 
okay spinning and baking this is using
for<00:07:02.540> the<00:07:02.570> kids<00:07:02.840> with<00:07:03.140> put<00:07:03.320> on<00:07:03.470> it<00:07:03.590> much
