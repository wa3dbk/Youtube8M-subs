nothing too unusual to see there but you

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.160 
nothing too unusual to see there but you
put<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.310> of<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.550> into<00:00:32.910> an<00:00:33.090> esper<00:00:33.630> shell<00:00:33.899> that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
put all of this into an esper shell that

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.870 
put all of this into an esper shell that
looks<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.560> basically<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.310> a<00:00:35.340> hybridization

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
looks a basically like a hybridization

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.729 
looks a basically like a hybridization
of<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.540> monopod<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.960> ocean<00:00:37.170> deck<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.470> esper

of the monopod of ocean deck and esper
control<00:00:37.770> pretty<00:00:38.489> much<00:00:38.670> pretty<00:00:38.940> much

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
control pretty much pretty much

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.900 
control pretty much pretty much
basically<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:40.559> stemmed<00:00:40.829> from<00:00:40.950> absolute

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
basically it all stemmed from absolute

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.580 
basically it all stemmed from absolute
love<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.060> drawing<00:00:42.240> cards<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.260> really

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
love of drawing cards and I really

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.380 
love of drawing cards and I really
wanted<00:00:43.830> to<00:00:43.890> put<00:00:44.190> Nick<00:00:44.640> tosylate<00:00:45.060> back<00:00:45.240> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
wanted to put Nick tosylate back to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.000

shrinks<00:00:45.630> his<00:00:45.720> revelation<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:46.890> trying

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
shrinks his revelation and I was trying

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.800 
shrinks his revelation and I was trying
to<00:00:47.130> figure<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.430> how<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.210> so

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
to figure out how to do that and so

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.240 
to figure out how to do that and so
we've<00:00:49.260> started<00:00:49.410> with<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> 10<00:00:49.830> blue<00:00:50.010> shell

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
we've started with the 10 blue shell

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.740 
we've started with the 10 blue shell
just<00:00:50.520> because<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.240> best<00:00:51.420> way

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
just because it's the best way

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.020 
just because it's the best way
absolutely<00:00:51.930> draw<00:00:52.260> cards<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> blue<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.550> we

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
absolutely draw cards in the blue and we

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.280 
absolutely draw cards in the blue and we
started<00:00:54.270> out<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.570> tinkering<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:54.990> a<00:00:55.140> little

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
started out with tinkering with a little

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.470 
started out with tinkering with a little
bit<00:00:55.380> of<00:00:55.440> white<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.770> they're<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.580> there<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.030> we

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
bit of white and they're in there and we

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.580 
bit of white and they're in there and we
found<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.840> were<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.110> money<00:00:58.290> into<00:00:58.530> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
found that we were so money into a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.410 
found that we were so money into a
little<00:00:58.950> bit<00:00:59.040> of<00:00:59.130> problem<00:00:59.310> matchups<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.300> had

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
little bit of problem matchups we had

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.610 
little bit of problem matchups we had
for<00:01:00.600> detention<00:01:00.840> spirits<00:01:01.200> in<00:01:01.260> there<00:01:01.380> but<00:01:01.500> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
for detention spirits in there but that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.690 
for detention spirits in there but that
sometimes<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.040> just<00:01:02.160> wasn't<00:01:02.579> good<00:01:02.610> enough

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
sometimes it just wasn't good enough

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.069 
sometimes it just wasn't good enough
when<00:01:03.450> you're<00:01:03.570> dealing<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
when you're dealing with the

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:05.929 
when you're dealing with the
planeswalkers<00:01:04.619> sure<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.549> decided<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
planeswalkers sure and so we decided to

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.280 
planeswalkers sure and so we decided to
just<00:01:06.210> throw<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.689> back<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.020> there<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.259> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
just throw in the back in there for a

really in the deck originally was

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.910

because<00:03:08.659> when<00:03:09.140> we<00:03:09.260> played<00:03:09.439> against<00:03:09.650> want<00:03:09.829> to

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
because when we played against want to

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.039 
because when we played against want to
black<00:03:10.069> we<00:03:10.519> determined<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.150> when<00:03:11.540> we<00:03:11.629> really

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
black we determined that when we really

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.449 
black we determined that when we really
tried<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.260> do<00:03:12.409> we<00:03:12.560> tried<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.859> move<00:03:12.980> into<00:03:13.250> more

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
tried to do we tried to move into more

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.280 
tried to do we tried to move into more
of<00:03:13.519> a<00:03:13.670> controllers<00:03:14.150> s<00:03:14.329> square<00:03:14.540> type<00:03:14.750> build<00:03:15.019> and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
of a controllers s square type build and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.140 
of a controllers s square type build and
that<00:03:15.859> really<00:03:16.010> just<00:03:16.250> wasn't<00:03:16.579> working<00:03:16.819> out<00:03:16.909> for

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
that really just wasn't working out for

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.220 
that really just wasn't working out for
us<00:03:17.180> that's<00:03:17.420> just<00:03:17.629> kind<00:03:17.780> of<00:03:17.810> what<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.989> neck<00:03:18.200> is

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
us that's just kind of what the neck is

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.050 
us that's just kind of what the neck is
designed<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.680> just<00:03:18.859> be<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.189> then<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:19.939> we've

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
designed to just be and then so we've

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.190 
designed to just be and then so we've
decided<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.450> we<00:03:20.569> want<00:03:20.599> to<00:03:20.810> become<00:03:21.049> as<00:03:21.170> much

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
decided that we want to become as much

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.580 
decided that we want to become as much
as<00:03:21.620> threatened<00:03:22.069> it's<00:03:22.189> as<00:03:22.340> possible<00:03:22.819> and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
as threatened it's as possible and

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.509 
as threatened it's as possible and
basically<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.799> know<00:03:24.889> the<00:03:24.980> first<00:03:25.189> turn<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.400> use

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
basically you know the first turn to use

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.890 
basically you know the first turn to use
actual<00:03:25.879> yok<00:03:26.000> if<00:03:26.150> you're<00:03:26.299> lucky<00:03:26.389> enough<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.780> hit

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.920 
a desecration demon you can immediately
slam<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.970> into<00:03:29.090> play<00:03:29.299> which<00:03:29.540> will<00:03:29.720> help<00:03:29.810> you

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930
