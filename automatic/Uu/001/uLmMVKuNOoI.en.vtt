00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.950
 hello my name is boozer pÃ©rez we are 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.440
 here at the training center of 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.470
 big man this time we're going to talk about 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.050
 golden trial bolillo integral 100% mix 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.000
 the benefit of the integral bolillo is that 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.430
 100 percent whole wheat so 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.430
 which is much healthier the bolillo 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.760
 integral is a complete mix only 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.310
 you have to add water and yeast and 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.870
 as you see here we have 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:56.440
 the dough already ready to make bobbin 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.640
 as you can see is a workable mass 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.170
 let's do a little bit of bolillo here 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.800
 to see 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.560
 how easy it is to stretch the dough and make 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.720
 the bolillo we are going to make bolillos and 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.210
 then we are going to make some teleras like 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.360
 come flexible and now I'm going to show you 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.060
 how to make a telera also with him 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.210
 with this next with this mass already here that 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.210
 we have 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.070
 you can see here we have the teleras 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.170
 the procedure to know it is the same 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.520
 that the regular bolillo 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:41.320
 we 're going to put it in our own for about 45 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:45.909
 one hour is going to be sewn at 400 degrees 15 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.220
 steam seconds and 12 to 14 minutes of 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.200
 time in the oven the integral roll 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.720
 you can only cut it from this 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.190
 before putting it into the steamer the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.140
 integral roll does not have to open 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.850
 normally like the traditional bobbin 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.310
 only what you have to do nothing else 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.260
 cut it and let it get to what 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.330
 more than you can 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.150
 the integral roll is much more 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.220
 healthy for that reason you have 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.770
 that charge a little more money for 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.900
