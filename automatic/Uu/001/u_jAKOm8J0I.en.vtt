next<00:00:08.059> week<00:00:08.660> um<00:00:08.840> maybe

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
next week um maybe

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.910 
next week um maybe
if<00:00:10.630> we<00:00:10.840> don't<00:00:11.019> want<00:00:11.170> to<00:00:11.230> just<00:00:11.410> plain<00:00:11.650> like<00:00:11.769> that

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
if we don't want to just plain like that

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.950 
if we don't want to just plain like that
we<00:00:11.980> can<00:00:12.099> add<00:00:12.190> some<00:00:12.400> depth<00:00:12.730> to<00:00:13.090> this

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
we can add some depth to this

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.220 
we can add some depth to this
I<00:00:15.020> think<00:00:15.910> if<00:00:16.910> I<00:00:17.150> take<00:00:17.480> a<00:00:17.750> look<00:00:18.140> at<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:20.230> border

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
I think if I take a look at the border

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.700 
I think if I take a look at the border
if<00:00:21.650> I<00:00:21.860> put<00:00:22.100> my<00:00:22.220> layer<00:00:22.400> on<00:00:22.610> the<00:00:22.700> border<00:00:23.029> and<00:00:23.060> then

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
if I put my layer on the border and then

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.950 
if I put my layer on the border and then
use<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:24.860> magic<00:00:25.189> wand<00:00:25.400> to<00:00:26.090> trace<00:00:26.360> the<00:00:26.540> outline

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
use the magic wand to trace the outline

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.499 
use the magic wand to trace the outline
of<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.410> original<00:00:29.320> border

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
of the original border

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.349 
of the original border
if<00:00:32.509> you<00:00:32.660> see<00:00:32.870> one<00:00:33.079> mean<00:00:33.410> here

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:42.720 

if<00:00:37.359> I<00:00:37.510> just<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.920> rid<00:00:39.430> of<00:00:39.730> these<00:00:41.579> border<00:00:42.579> I'll

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
if I just get rid of these border I'll

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:51.799 
if I just get rid of these border I'll
that<00:00:43.149> is<00:00:43.390> there<00:00:43.660> and<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:46.079> invert<00:00:47.159> this<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:49.780> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
that is there and I invert this then I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.260 
that is there and I invert this then I
am<00:00:52.809> on<00:00:52.989> here<00:00:54.930> I've<00:00:55.930> inverted<00:00:56.760> this

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
am on here I've inverted this

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.970 
am on here I've inverted this
and<00:00:59.690> create<00:01:00.020> another<00:01:00.290> layer<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:02.890> put<00:01:03.890> an

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
and create another layer and put an

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.180 
and create another layer and put an
effect<00:01:04.280> on<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:04.730> 3d<00:01:05.600> effects<00:01:06.140> drop<00:01:06.500> shadow<00:01:09.190> we

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
effect on this 3d effects drop shadow we

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.300 
effect on this 3d effects drop shadow we
could<00:01:10.340> have<00:01:10.550> a<00:01:10.580> little<00:01:11.360> bit<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.570> depth<00:01:11.840> to

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
could have a little bit of depth to

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.020 
could have a little bit of depth to
whole<00:01:13.310> thing<00:01:13.700> here<00:01:14.210> Oh<00:01:15.850> some<00:01:16.850> shadow<00:01:19.030> vertical

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
whole thing here Oh some shadow vertical

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.470 
whole thing here Oh some shadow vertical
three<00:01:20.330> horizontal<00:01:20.570> friends<00:01:22.180> follow<00:01:23.180> path

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
three horizontal friends follow path

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.650 
three horizontal friends follow path
city<00:01:24.520> it<00:01:25.520> doesn't<00:01:25.820> matter<00:01:26.030> about<00:01:26.150> that<00:01:26.270> now

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
city it doesn't matter about that now

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.270 
city it doesn't matter about that now
we've<00:01:26.810> got<00:01:26.990> some<00:01:27.320> blur<00:01:28.390> 7.25<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.070> I'll<00:01:31.070> show

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
we've got some blur 7.25 and I'll show

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.610 
we've got some blur 7.25 and I'll show
you<00:01:31.310> how<00:01:31.490> we<00:01:31.550> can<00:01:31.790> just<00:01:32.630> save<00:01:32.870> while<00:01:33.350> it's<00:01:33.500> on

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
you how we can just save while it's on

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.400 
you how we can just save while it's on
its<00:01:33.740> own<00:01:33.860> layer<00:01:34.479> so<00:01:35.479> if<00:01:35.540> I<00:01:35.630> put<00:01:35.840> that<00:01:35.870> but<00:01:36.229> where

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
its own layer so if I put that but where

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.490 
its own layer so if I put that but where
you<00:01:36.530> can<00:01:36.710> see<00:01:36.950> what<00:01:37.420> we<00:01:38.420> have<00:01:38.780> here<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.140> take

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
you can see what we have here and take

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.980 
you can see what we have here and take
the<00:01:39.619> selection<00:01:40.130> off<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:42.350> take<00:01:43.310> off<00:01:43.550> the

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
the selection off and take off the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.880 
the selection off and take off the
border<00:01:44.990> we<00:01:45.590> have<00:01:45.619> some<00:01:47.200> maybe<00:01:48.200> it's<00:01:48.380> too<00:01:48.530> harsh

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
border we have some maybe it's too harsh

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.149 
border we have some maybe it's too harsh
at<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.220> moment<00:01:49.550> we<00:01:49.640> could<00:01:49.790> check<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.090> down

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.770 

slight<00:01:53.939> depth<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.510> that<00:01:56.150> if<00:01:57.150> we<00:01:57.360> were<00:01:57.420> happy

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
slight depth like that if we were happy

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.270 
slight depth like that if we were happy
with<00:01:57.900> for<00:01:58.140> that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.090 

I<00:02:00.369> like<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.450> from<00:02:01.570> now

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.999 

so<00:02:05.700> 600<00:02:06.630> pixels<00:02:07.320> I'm<00:02:07.440> gonna<00:02:07.650> save<00:02:07.950> that

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
so 600 pixels I'm gonna save that

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.530 
so 600 pixels I'm gonna save that
or<00:02:10.580> my<00:02:11.060> map<00:02:11.540> because<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.260> next<00:02:12.620> thing<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:13.540> will

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
or my map because the next thing I will

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.399 
or my map because the next thing I will
do<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.860> save<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.220> as<00:02:16.549> a<00:02:16.939> gif<00:02:17.420> image<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:20.409> take

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
do is save this as a gif image and take

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:26.410 
do is save this as a gif image and take
it<00:02:21.590> straight<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:23.650> software<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.769> have<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:26.180> plot

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
it straight to software I have to plot

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.559 
it straight to software I have to plot
coordinates<00:02:27.459> therefore<00:02:28.459> we<00:02:28.549> can<00:02:28.760> use<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
coordinates therefore we can use the

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.869 
coordinates therefore we can use the
coordinates<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.590> click<00:02:30.890> through<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:32.170> URL<00:02:33.879> so

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
coordinates to click through to a URL so

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:44.110 
coordinates to click through to a URL so
what<00:02:35.239> I'll<00:02:35.390> do<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:36.069> I'll<00:02:37.069> save<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:42.790> I'll<00:02:43.790> save

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
what I'll do is I'll save this I'll save

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.880 
what I'll do is I'll save this I'll save
it<00:02:44.299> like<00:02:45.079> it<00:02:45.319> is

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
it like it is

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.600 
it like it is
and<00:02:46.640> as<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.180> pinch<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:48.049> pro<00:02:48.319> image<00:02:49.269> USA

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.760 

my

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.300 

and<00:02:57.770> I<00:02:57.950> also<00:02:58.250> will<00:02:58.940> save<00:02:59.570> it<00:02:59.840> as<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.850> GIF<00:03:01.850> image

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
and I also will save it as a GIF image

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:11.850 
and I also will save it as a GIF image
just<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.460> straight<00:03:05.060> get<00:03:05.900> image

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:20.320 

for<00:03:12.460> my<00:03:13.390> blog

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:28.070 

okay<00:03:21.330> I've<00:03:21.600> got<00:03:21.630> my<00:03:23.090> map<00:03:24.530> edit<00:03:25.820> software<00:03:27.080> if

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
okay I've got my map edit software if

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.640 
okay I've got my map edit software if
you<00:03:28.140> want<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:29.270> create<00:03:30.270> coordinates<00:03:30.990> for<00:03:31.200> image

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
you want to create coordinates for image

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.960 
you want to create coordinates for image
maps<00:03:32.570> like<00:03:33.570> what<00:03:34.020> I'm<00:03:34.170> doing<00:03:34.470> now<00:03:34.710> then<00:03:35.610> you

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
maps like what I'm doing now then you

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.600 
maps like what I'm doing now then you
need<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.300> find<00:03:36.540> this<00:03:36.990> software<00:03:37.440> map<00:03:37.830> edit<00:03:38.310> and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
need to find this software map edit and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.030 
need to find this software map edit and
get<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.090> best<00:03:39.300> version<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.530> think<00:03:40.890> it's<00:03:40.980> only

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
get the best version I think it's only

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.940 
get the best version I think it's only
about<00:03:41.210> $25<00:03:43.040> just<00:03:44.040> look<00:03:44.190> for<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.400> on<00:03:44.490> Google<00:03:45.030> and

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
about $25 just look for it on Google and
