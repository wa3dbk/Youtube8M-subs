00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.130
 yesterday everyone is found 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.130
 today for a video in zambia 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.250
 to show you the three places that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.040
 I prefer on the buried map for 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.609
 turn that I find the three places 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.710
 the simplest ones to make two more 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.869
 sleeves so we go right away 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.830
 started with the first place 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.130
 it's here at the box I think it's 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.669
 finally me it's my favorite place for 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.250
 turn on this manna knowing that my 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.780
 record on this map is thirty 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.559
 five rounds solo I shot here I 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.620
 did exactly like that during my 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.210
 thirty five innings which means that 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.210
 we actually turn in a circle a 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.860
 little you just have to be a 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.180
 player 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.670
 the experienced biker after we will say 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.559
 that I'm bragging you just have to know a 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.750
 can dodge that's all nothing 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.809
 difficult and you have to have a weapon 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.189
 light and have the paralyzed hours for 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.060
 have infinite ammo 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.979
 it was enough to go under the porch to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.710
 right or so pass like that did 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.960
 no importance and turn around 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.390
 every time to make a size the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.900
 kill at paralyzed hours in the small 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.670
 corridor 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.350
 finally in the sort of going that joins 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.130
 both 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.920
 the other two main ones of the map because 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.990
 it's not going to sound behind us and 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.150
 so we can not get killed by 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.450
 behind that is the advantage in fact of 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.400
 to turn here is that we can not 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.670
 to kill back from behind 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.530
 when we exterminate nota and that's what 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.110
 I find rather good for this 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 technique to turn the zombies 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.899
 So here I go I turn 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.450
 regroups went up entirely I take the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.070
 paralyzes hours after and I hope but 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.960
 the pile and institutes and the manges passes 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.200
 very quickly because it is a technique man 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.840
 which is still very fast and we have to 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.540
 each time ammunition to infinity because 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.190
 we have the paralyzing so the second 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.460
 technique is a technique that I have 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.310
 it was frankly for to do 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.480
 turn the zombies I wanted to show 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.770
 three places for it to do when 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.540
 even a pretty long video 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.500
 so I looked for places on the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.290
 map I managed to find this place in 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.660
 did I fail to find really 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.130
 a good place to turn I change 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.740
 a little each time I did not pass 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.000
 exactly in the same place but it's 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.250
 always about the same technique 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.530
 it's trying to have each time the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.540
 maximum of zombies behind and 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.210
 turn them around in a circle undo the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.700
 rotate them together in one big 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.770
 heap and after shoot them at 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.420
 paralyzes hours so as not to use 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.770
 ammunition so there it's the same I 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.220
 were spinning I passed under the 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.130
 porches 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.060
 I try to group them together 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.770
 after that I pulled that out so that's it 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.520
 it's still a year you have enough 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.080
 therefore I thought it's good I 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.730
 can I go kill them I did 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.610
 blocking elsewhere by group must 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.010
 be careful when he's here I 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.440
 do this to bring them together roland 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.600
 kill as much as possible at once and 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.610
 veiling exterminates heap I found that 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.200
 this technique was not bad but I 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.370
 do not think we can go far 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.150
 with this one after for the third 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.150
 place yet a place where I have never 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.350
 tried to turn it's just 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.920
 a place I looked for appears that 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.310
 the other is here next to the 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.600
 candy store etc that's it 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.190
 always the same, you have to turn 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.290
 round you have to find a place 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.940
 where we do not risk getting caught by 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.660
 zombies coming in front of us 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.120
 and alas once nobody finally and 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.269
 that no zombies the two ponies in front 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.470
 we can almost finally not do 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.820
 fly ended because we die 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.500
 always a moment but it's a lot 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.180
 easier in fact that's what it takes 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.700
 you would have to find a place where 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.470
 we can kill his taf easily indre on 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.910
 risk of being killed is a 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.130
 where there are not too many things 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.480
 to block us so here is where 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.430
 I killed the heap quite simply it was 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.320
 a fairly simple technique so the video 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.049
 it takes a little longer is 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.560
 a little longer than expected you 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.630
 could see at the beginning I put you the 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.240
 success I managed to make the success I 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:35.900
 so dominates the success to 60 kg which the 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.889
 sugar is buried I'm not going here it's 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.960
 everything I think I told you everything 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.220
 for this video if you have any 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.960
 comments or if you call 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.880
 places you think best for 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.289
 to turn the zombies say the self 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.120
 if you want to make a zombie with me 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.889
 tell me I'm not having very 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.340
 experienced in zombies I'm not very 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:55.960
 strong and then that's all at the 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.960
 next video to go to more
