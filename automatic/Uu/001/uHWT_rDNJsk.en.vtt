making<00:00:18.619> improvements<00:00:19.279> to<00:00:19.400> our<00:00:19.430> vehicle<00:00:19.880> where

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
making improvements to our vehicle where

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.400 
making improvements to our vehicle where
we<00:00:20.029> don't<00:00:20.300> spend<00:00:20.599> a<00:00:20.689> lot<00:00:20.720> of<00:00:20.930> time<00:00:21.080> and<00:00:21.320> we

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
we don't spend a lot of time and we

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.170 
we don't spend a lot of time and we
don't<00:00:21.619> spend<00:00:21.919> a<00:00:22.040> lot<00:00:22.189> of<00:00:22.220> money<00:00:22.400> now<00:00:22.939> this

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
don't spend a lot of money now this

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.019 
don't spend a lot of money now this
particular<00:00:23.689> vehicle<00:00:23.930> is<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:24.520> 2008<00:00:25.520> Toyota

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
particular vehicle is a 2008 Toyota

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.749 
particular vehicle is a 2008 Toyota
Yaris<00:00:26.419> and<00:00:26.869> when<00:00:27.439> it<00:00:27.560> comes<00:00:27.860> to<00:00:28.039> accessorizing

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
Yaris and when it comes to accessorizing

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.820 
Yaris and when it comes to accessorizing
the<00:00:29.090> inside<00:00:29.660> I<00:00:29.689> think<00:00:30.019> it's<00:00:30.289> safe<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.619> say<00:00:30.650> that

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
the inside I think it's safe to say that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.340 
the inside I think it's safe to say that
we<00:00:31.070> are<00:00:31.099> limited<00:00:31.609> at<00:00:31.760> best<00:00:31.900> but<00:00:32.900> that's<00:00:33.080> not<00:00:33.260> an

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
we are limited at best but that's not an

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.630 
we are limited at best but that's not an
insult<00:00:33.650> what<00:00:33.830> I'm<00:00:33.920> saying<00:00:34.160> is<00:00:34.309> there's<00:00:34.489> just

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
insult what I'm saying is there's just

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.369 
insult what I'm saying is there's just
not<00:00:34.850> a<00:00:34.910> lot<00:00:35.030> of<00:00:35.239> room<00:00:35.420> in<00:00:35.570> here<00:00:35.629> but<00:00:36.140> this

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
not a lot of room in here but this

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.200 
not a lot of room in here but this
little<00:00:36.559> dash<00:00:36.920> panel<00:00:37.460> right<00:00:37.640> here<00:00:37.910> down<00:00:38.030> the

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
little dash panel right here down the

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.820 
little dash panel right here down the
middle<00:00:38.480> is<00:00:38.600> looking<00:00:39.170> right<00:00:39.290> at<00:00:39.470> me<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:39.650> it's

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
middle is looking right at me and it's

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.200 
middle is looking right at me and it's
kind<00:00:39.980> of<00:00:40.129> playing<00:00:40.370> it<00:00:40.550> fits<00:00:40.790> in<00:00:40.970> but<00:00:41.120> I<00:00:41.150> think

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
kind of playing it fits in but I think

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.380 
kind of playing it fits in but I think
we<00:00:41.480> can<00:00:41.600> spice<00:00:41.930> it<00:00:42.110> up<00:00:42.170> a<00:00:42.290> little<00:00:42.320> bit<00:00:42.650> and

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
we can spice it up a little bit and

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.819 
we can spice it up a little bit and
we're<00:00:44.390> going<00:00:44.570> to<00:00:44.600> do<00:00:44.809> it<00:00:44.989> with<00:00:45.350> this

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
we're going to do it with this

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.340 
we're going to do it with this
it's<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.160> dupli-color<00:00:46.430> carbon<00:00:47.030> fiber<00:00:47.300> kick

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.660 

now<00:00:51.350> that<00:00:51.530> we've<00:00:51.649> got<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:51.920> interior<00:00:52.219> pieces

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
now that we've got the interior pieces

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.860 
now that we've got the interior pieces
out<00:00:52.940> we've<00:00:53.090> got<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.239> couple<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.629> different

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
out we've got a couple of different

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.240 
out we've got a couple of different
things<00:00:53.899> we<00:00:54.199> have<00:00:54.230> to<00:00:54.410> do<00:00:54.500> to<00:00:54.620> get<00:00:54.739> them<00:00:54.980> ready

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
things we have to do to get them ready

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.619 
things we have to do to get them ready
first<00:00:55.579> of<00:00:55.789> all<00:00:55.940> we'll<00:00:56.149> hit<00:00:56.239> them<00:00:56.420> with<00:00:56.539> the

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
first of all we'll hit them with the

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.000 
first of all we'll hit them with the
prep<00:00:56.840> spray<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.260> get<00:00:57.350> them<00:00:57.469> good<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:57.680> clean

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
prep spray and get them good and clean

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.130 
prep spray and get them good and clean
once<00:00:58.520> that<00:00:58.730> dries<00:00:59.000> we<00:00:59.270> can<00:00:59.420> lay<00:00:59.570> on<00:00:59.750> some<00:00:59.989> of

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
once that dries we can lay on some of

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.750 
once that dries we can lay on some of
the<00:01:00.230> adhesion<00:01:00.500> promoter<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.160> that<00:01:01.489> will<00:01:01.640> give

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
the adhesion promoter and that will give

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.320 
the adhesion promoter and that will give
this<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.270> good<00:01:02.480> surface<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:03.050> stick<00:01:03.230> to

applying<00:01:16.480> the<00:01:16.660> carbon<00:01:16.960> fiber<00:01:17.140> kit<00:01:17.410> is<00:01:17.620> a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
applying the carbon fiber kit is a

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.440 
applying the carbon fiber kit is a
two-step<00:01:18.220> process<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.880> first<00:01:19.090> thing<00:01:19.240> we<00:01:19.330> had

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
two-step process the first thing we had

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.970 
two-step process the first thing we had
to<00:01:19.570> do<00:01:19.720> was<00:01:20.020> lay<00:01:20.170> on<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.410> graphite<00:01:20.830> metallic

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
to do was lay on the graphite metallic

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.490 
to do was lay on the graphite metallic
base<00:01:21.490> coat<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:22.030> we<00:01:22.120> did<00:01:22.300> that<00:01:22.510> and<00:01:22.720> we<00:01:22.780> let<00:01:23.380> it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
base coat so we did that and we let it

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.250 
base coat so we did that and we let it
dry<00:01:23.530> next<00:01:24.070> up<00:01:24.280> we<00:01:24.430> laid<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:25.120> the<00:01:25.690> dimensional

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
dry next up we laid in the dimensional

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.600 
dry next up we laid in the dimensional
effects<00:01:26.530> template<00:01:26.920> that's<00:01:27.070> what<00:01:27.220> this<00:01:27.340> white

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
effects template that's what this white

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.670 
effects template that's what this white
piece<00:01:27.850> is<00:01:28.120> right<00:01:28.330> here<00:01:28.479> we<00:01:28.600> cut<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.930> up<00:01:29.020> really

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
piece is right here we cut it up really

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.320 
piece is right here we cut it up really
to<00:01:29.830> size<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.490> match<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:31.030> up<00:01:31.120> with<00:01:31.300> our

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
to size and match it up with our

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.880 
to size and match it up with our
interior<00:01:31.869> piece<00:01:32.080> and<00:01:32.320> there<00:01:32.619> were<00:01:32.710> some

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
interior piece and there were some

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.560 
interior piece and there were some
curves<00:01:33.160> on<00:01:33.430> it<00:01:33.460> so<00:01:33.700> what<00:01:33.850> we<00:01:33.940> did<00:01:34.060> was<00:01:34.210> we<00:01:34.390> laid

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
curves on it so what we did was we laid

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.150 
curves on it so what we did was we laid
it<00:01:34.690> down<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.020> taped<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:35.740> way<00:01:35.860> we<00:01:35.979> can

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
it down and taped it that way we can

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.500 
it down and taped it that way we can
match<00:01:36.369> up<00:01:36.580> with<00:01:36.700> those<00:01:36.820> curves<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.300> we<00:01:37.390> get

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
match up with those curves and we get

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.600 
match up with those curves and we get
maximum<00:01:37.840> contact<00:01:38.440> with<00:01:38.740> our<00:01:39.190> dimensional

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
maximum contact with our dimensional

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.859 
maximum contact with our dimensional
effects<00:01:39.880> template<00:01:40.270> right<00:01:40.420> there<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:40.750> way

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
effects template right there that way

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.330 
effects template right there that way
when<00:01:41.050> we<00:01:41.170> lay<00:01:41.320> on<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.530> black<00:01:41.710> topcoat<00:01:42.160> which

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
when we lay on the black topcoat which

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.070 
when we lay on the black topcoat which
is<00:01:42.550> next<00:01:42.760> we're<00:01:43.240> going<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.420> get<00:01:43.510> that<00:01:43.630> look<00:01:43.900> in

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
is next we're going to get that look in

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:52.859 
is next we're going to get that look in
one

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.600 

so<00:01:53.380> we<00:01:53.500> let<00:01:53.649> it<00:01:53.680> dry<00:01:53.770> for<00:01:54.070> about<00:01:54.159> ten<00:01:54.460> minutes

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
so we let it dry for about ten minutes

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.330
