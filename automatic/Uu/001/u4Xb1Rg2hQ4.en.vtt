definition sorry my phone I'm seeing

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.849 
definition sorry my phone I'm seeing
definition<00:02:35.689> but<00:02:35.840> not<00:02:36.049> volume<00:02:36.290> but<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.709> feel

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
definition but not volume but I feel

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.380 
definition but not volume but I feel
like<00:02:36.890> volume<00:02:37.189> you<00:02:37.519> actually<00:02:37.879> really<00:02:38.120> have<00:02:38.269> to

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
like volume you actually really have to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.449 
like volume you actually really have to
build<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.930> goes<00:02:42.109> really<00:02:42.439> glide<00:02:42.859> on<00:02:43.040> very

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
build so it goes really glide on very

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.119 
build so it goes really glide on very
nicely<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:44.260> think<00:02:45.260> it's<00:02:45.379> a<00:02:45.470> little<00:02:45.620> wet<00:02:45.920> I

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
nicely I think it's a little wet I

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.729 
nicely I think it's a little wet I
probably<00:02:46.400> would<00:02:46.700> like<00:02:46.909> it<00:02:47.180> more<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:48.560> the

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
probably would like it more like the

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.920 
probably would like it more like the
next<00:02:49.040> day<00:02:49.220> sort<00:02:49.579> of<00:02:49.730> our<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.120> next<00:02:50.510> like<00:02:50.750> after

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
next day sort of our the next like after

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.619 
next day sort of our the next like after
it<00:02:51.170> dries<00:02:51.379> out<00:02:51.879> okay<00:02:52.879> so<00:02:52.940> yeah<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:53.299> don't<00:02:53.510> think

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
it dries out okay so yeah I don't think

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.860 
it dries out okay so yeah I don't think
it<00:02:53.840> really<00:02:53.870> does<00:02:54.519> have<00:02:55.519> like<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.730> crusty<00:02:56.689> there

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
it really does have like a crusty there

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.479 
it really does have like a crusty there
I<00:02:57.049> don't<00:02:57.500> think<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.709> really<00:02:57.739> does<00:02:58.129> very<00:02:58.400> much

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
I don't think it really does very much

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.759 
I don't think it really does very much
for<00:02:58.939> me<00:02:59.090> at<00:02:59.209> all<00:02:59.329> it's<00:02:59.569> a<00:02:59.659> very<00:02:59.870> natural<00:03:00.170> look

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.920 
favorite mascara but it is a good
mascara<00:03:43.129> I<00:03:43.370> think<00:03:43.579> it<00:03:43.669> does<00:03:43.819> what<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.629> says<00:03:44.659> for

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
mascara I think it does what it says for

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.599 
mascara I think it does what it says for
the<00:03:45.169> most<00:03:45.319> part<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:45.709> clunk<00:03:46.010> free<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.430> does

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
the most part is clunk free and it does

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.819 
the most part is clunk free and it does
define<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.239> volume<00:03:47.659> part<00:03:47.959> I'm<00:03:48.169> not<00:03:48.500> singing

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
define the volume part I'm not singing

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.949 
define the volume part I'm not singing
it<00:03:49.099> maybe<00:03:49.609> with<00:03:49.790> like<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.030> third<00:03:50.359> coat<00:03:50.690> but

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
it maybe with like a third coat but

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.020 
it maybe with like a third coat but

I think it's a very natural um looking
mascara<00:04:28.780> I'll<00:04:28.930> probably<00:04:29.080> wear<00:04:29.289> this<00:04:29.410> a<00:04:29.470> lot<00:04:29.710> to

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.800 
mascara I'll probably wear this a lot to
work<00:04:30.009> I'm<00:04:30.190> hoping<00:04:30.699> that<00:04:30.759> the<00:04:31.360> argan<00:04:31.690> oil

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
work I'm hoping that the argan oil

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.540 
work I'm hoping that the argan oil
doesn't<00:04:32.139> make<00:04:32.500> it<00:04:32.620> transfer<00:04:32.979> my<00:04:33.130> lower<00:04:33.340> lash

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
doesn't make it transfer my lower lash

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.180 
doesn't make it transfer my lower lash
line<00:04:33.789> though<00:04:34.000> I<00:04:34.180> like<00:04:34.840> my<00:04:35.020> lower<00:04:35.349> things

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
line though I like my lower things

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.740 
line though I like my lower things
because<00:04:36.669> I<00:04:36.789> do<00:04:36.849> have<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.120> problem<00:04:37.360> with<00:04:37.630> the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
because I do have a problem with the

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.969 
because I do have a problem with the
carbon<00:04:38.050> black<00:04:38.259> one<00:04:38.470> that's<00:04:38.650> like<00:04:38.770> super

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
carbon black one that's like super

carbon black one that's like super
creamy<00:04:39.310> I<00:04:39.639> think<00:04:40.300> this<00:04:40.419> would<00:04:40.630> be<00:04:40.660> really<00:04:40.960> nice

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.589 
creamy I think this would be really nice
is<00:04:41.560> like<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.710> first<00:04:42.039> coat<00:04:42.370> underneath<00:04:42.699> the

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
is like a first coat underneath the

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.980 
is like a first coat underneath the
carbon<00:04:43.990> black<00:04:44.169> linear<00:04:44.800> or<00:04:45.130> carbon<00:04:45.580> black

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
carbon black linear or carbon black

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.990 
carbon black linear or carbon black
mascara<00:04:46.990> by<00:04:47.229> L'Oreal<00:04:47.740> but<00:04:48.190> overall<00:04:48.639> I'm<00:04:48.940> happy

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
mascara by L'Oreal but overall I'm happy

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.909 
mascara by L'Oreal but overall I'm happy
that<00:04:49.360> I<00:04:49.479> tried<00:04:49.780> it<00:04:49.900> because<00:04:50.020> I<00:04:50.169> do<00:04:50.229> like<00:04:50.680> the

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
that I tried it because I do like the

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.089 
that I tried it because I do like the
natural<00:04:51.400> look<00:04:51.849> to<00:04:51.910> it<00:04:52.270> it<00:04:53.139> separates<00:04:53.740> it

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
natural look to it it separates it

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.760 
natural look to it it separates it
lengthens<00:04:55.000> but<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.449> does<00:04:55.630> not<00:04:55.810> add<00:04:56.050> volume<00:04:56.349> I

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
lengthens but it does not add volume I

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.980 
lengthens but it does not add volume I
don't<00:04:56.949> see<00:04:57.220> it<00:04:57.250> anyways<00:04:57.639> I<00:04:57.910> do<00:04:58.210> think<00:04:58.720> it<00:04:58.840> was

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
don't see it anyways I do think it was
