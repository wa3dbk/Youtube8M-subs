00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:11.929
 Now it's the floor 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:14.440
 Because it was moving a little thing I asked Rakuten I amazon I think that was so? Mer 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.440
 The 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.630
 I'm sorry, but what is it ? 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.470
 I do not remember but maybe 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.470
 Album available 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.460
 I made a reservation about last month 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.650
 An album of a band called Tokyo Kalan Koron 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.260
 is 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:42.780
 I It is there say that five of the entertainer 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.780
 This true to the base 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.960
 Here 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.100
 attached to the iphone that are taking iphone now 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.480
 Wide-angle lens 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.079
 Megalith lens 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.430
 It is a macro lens 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.210
 Every time this 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:09.049
 I thought it would be better if I could get a little wider 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.330
 I bought it because I could buy it for the point of Rakuten 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:17.860
 Hmm 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:24.300
 It is a guy say three-in-one almost continuous all the time for iphone 5 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.300
 Something is in the bag case and the lens body already 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:33.490
 The lens looks like this 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.790
 I just put in between 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.230
 I wonder if the camera inside is also good 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:46.720
 I would like to put on this 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.950
 This is taken in the usual a camera in the iphone camera 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.570
 It is a size 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:57.260
 I think that it would like to take with the lens of the huge rock 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:01.850
 What is attached with a fisheye lens is here 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:07.190
 I'm shooting at exactly the same position as the location I was ahead of 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.280
 I already had 0 warehouse but now I have a refrigerator 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.340
 Clearly is cytometry today middle way in Hannan 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.390
 It seems like the surroundings are boring 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.390
 Is it dirty inside ? 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.310
 It is such a specification that is not wing starvation 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.770
 I feel say 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.370
 Next time I want to shoot wide with a lens 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.280
 This is how my mileage looks like 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.069
 To do 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:39.340
 I'm to Dokora compared to the normally I do not know so much a little softening in the case 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:42.550
 It seems that fisheye can be taken at wide angle 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.280
 Next time I want to take a macro shot 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.090
 This is taken with a macro lens 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.730
 It is Matsuka bar 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.730
 I'm also very close 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.140
 If I usually use it like this, I can not focus on it 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.569
 Let's become this macro lens 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.350
 You know that it's amazing to lie dust 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.350
 Speaking of this, it is the opposite of the city 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:17.000
 Even if I talk a little , I can not focus on it 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.000
 It feels like you can't get it in focus unless you get too close 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.870
 I think this probably won't be used too much 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.870
 Not say that 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.340
 Iphone 5 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.950
 With wide angle lens 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.430
 Fisheye lens 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.569
 It came by introduction 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.860
 I'm shooting from the same position as before, but now 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.569
 With fisheye megalith lens 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.390
 I am taking 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.530
 Somewhat wider than before 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.530
 What I think we are photographed 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.050
 Just 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.070
 this 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.070
 I'm a lens 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:02.390
 Since the form is in the form of iphone angle 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.920
 I can not attach it with the case of such iphone 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.720
 You 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.830
 In the form 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.890
 In the form of a corner at a fixed Kaiserslautern 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:20.790
 If I put it on or take off now, the protective sheet might be slightly broken 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.790
 Something black stains so it got scratchy 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.730
 A little 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.660
 Do you usually use from now on 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.620
 I m thinking 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.670
 after 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.710
 It's usually and 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.820
 Selfie inside was camera 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.300
 I'd have taken videos 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.990
 this is 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.270
 Now that I can not attach it to this camera 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.750
 I will take it in reverse 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.750
 Hey 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.969
 It is hard to do 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.110
 Recently a clip-on guy has come out and it is more difficult for you 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.110
 I think Naa be that was good 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.550
 For now 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:10.150
 When you want to shoot at a wide angle 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.550
 I think I will use a fisheye lens 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.610
 that's all 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.610
 The annual Homer degree was also a lens 3 item-
