00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
recognition of an illness where we

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.640 
recognition of an illness where we
identify<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.390> fact<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:18.990> illnesses<00:00:19.619> that

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
identify the fact that illnesses that

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.250 
identify the fact that illnesses that
are<00:00:19.800> occurring<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.699> diverse<00:00:21.270> parts<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.990> our

country all seem to be related to the

same kind of bacteria creates almost a

same kind of bacteria creates almost a
CSI<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:30.949> investigation<00:00:31.949> where<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
CSI like investigation where we have to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.290 
CSI like investigation where we have to
first<00:00:33.780> identify<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:35.550> certainty<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
first identify with certainty the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.619 
first identify with certainty the
culprit<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.200> bacteria<00:00:37.860> then<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:39.329> through<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
culprit the bacteria then go through a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.170 
culprit the bacteria then go through a
process<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.290> trying<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.800> detect<00:00:41.190> what<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
process of trying to detect what the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.680 
process of trying to detect what the
common<00:00:42.750> features<00:00:43.290> are<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:44.489> regard<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.120> what

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
common features are with regard to what

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.959 
common features are with regard to what
was<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.530> those<00:00:46.710> patients<00:00:47.370> were<00:00:47.489> exposed

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
was it that those patients were exposed

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.119 
was it that those patients were exposed
to<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:49.020> might<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.379> contained<00:00:49.860> that

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
to that might have contained that

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.119 
to that might have contained that
bacteria<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.270> we're<00:00:51.750> exposed<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.770> host

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
bacteria and we're exposed to just host

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.639 
bacteria and we're exposed to just host
of<00:00:53.370> things<00:00:53.550> every<00:00:53.879> day<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.719> figuring<00:00:55.110> out<00:00:55.410> what

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
of things every day so figuring out what

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.220 
of things every day so figuring out what
might<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.039> been<00:00:56.160> common<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.539> example<00:00:57.989> for

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
might have been common for example for

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.830 
might have been common for example for
everyone<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.739> room<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:59.190> itself<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
everyone in this room in itself is is a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170 
everyone in this room in itself is is a
process<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.710> intense<00:01:02.100> investigation<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
process of intense investigation and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.289 
process of intense investigation and
then<00:01:04.110> once<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> product<00:01:05.309> that

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
then once we have the product that

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.539 
then once we have the product that
contained<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.110> bacteria<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.189> tomato

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
contained that bacteria like the tomato

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.300 
contained that bacteria like the tomato
then<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.570> next<00:01:09.720> question<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.590> where<00:01:10.890> did<00:01:11.130> that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
then the next question is where did that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.179 
then the next question is where did that
come<00:01:11.670> from<00:01:11.869> now<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.350> dealing<00:01:13.650> with<00:01:13.860> an

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
come from now we are dealing with an

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.240 
come from now we are dealing with an
enormously<00:01:14.700> complex<00:01:15.330> supply<00:01:15.600> chain<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.740> which

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
enormously complex supply chain in which

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.660 
enormously complex supply chain in which
things<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.759> being<00:01:18.380> transported<00:01:19.670> mixed

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
things are being transported mixed

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.679 
things are being transported mixed
mingled<00:01:21.350> divided<00:01:22.350> shipped<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.070> sold<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:24.420> whole

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
mingled divided shipped and sold a whole

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.440 
mingled divided shipped and sold a whole
variety<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.259> places<00:01:25.909> once<00:01:26.909> we've<00:01:27.150> gone

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
variety of places once we've gone

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.170 
variety of places once we've gone
through<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> supply<00:01:28.049> chain<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.820> where

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
through the supply chain to the to where

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.780 
through the supply chain to the to where
that<00:01:30.479> supplier<00:01:31.110> obtained<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.829> tomato<00:01:32.220> we

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
that supplier obtained that tomato we

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.510 
that supplier obtained that tomato we
begin<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.240> trace<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.689> back<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.890> source<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
begin to trace it back to the source and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.990 
begin to trace it back to the source and
it<00:01:36.090> may<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.930> farm<00:01:37.320> or<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> field<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it may be a farm or a field and that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.550 
it may be a farm or a field and that
farmer<00:01:39.420> field<00:01:39.689> could<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.110> literally<00:01:40.380> anywhere

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
farmer field could be literally anywhere

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.240 
farmer field could be literally anywhere
depending<00:01:41.189> upon<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.240> growing<00:01:42.659> season<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:44.070> our

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
depending upon the growing season so our

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.950 
depending upon the growing season so our
ability<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.820> deal<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.329> anatomy<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> an

ability to deal with the anatomy of an

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.980 
ability to deal with the anatomy of an
outbreak<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.770> yet<00:01:47.009> from<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.909> recognition<00:01:48.899> of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
outbreak and yet from the recognition of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
an illness to the source of that problem

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.730 
an illness to the source of that problem
and<00:01:51.750> correct<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.829> shut<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.250> down<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.000> we

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
and correct it and shut that down so we

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.230 
and correct it and shut that down so we
it<00:01:55.070> continuously<00:01:56.619> prevent<00:01:57.619> further<00:01:58.009> harm<00:01:58.909> is

it continuously prevent further harm is
