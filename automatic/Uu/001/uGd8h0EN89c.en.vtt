very<00:02:53.360> similar<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.320> TX<00:02:55.010> pedals<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:57.260> I

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
very similar to the TX pedals but I

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.900 
very similar to the TX pedals but I
think<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.680> brake<00:02:57.920> pedal<00:02:58.310> is<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.490> different

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
think the brake pedal is a different

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.090 
think the brake pedal is a different
shape<00:02:59.150> is<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.500> doesn't<00:03:00.560> seem<00:03:00.860> quite<00:03:00.890> as

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
shape is it it doesn't seem quite as

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.290 
shape is it it doesn't seem quite as
wide<00:03:01.340> as<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.610> TX<00:03:02.570> brake<00:03:03.530> pedal<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:05.060> height

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
wide as the TX brake pedal the height

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.180 
wide as the TX brake pedal the height
and<00:03:05.510> spacing<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:05.990> the<00:03:06.170> pedals<00:03:06.530> are<00:03:06.770> fully

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
and spacing of the pedals are fully

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.830 
and spacing of the pedals are fully
adjustable<00:03:07.700> in<00:03:08.120> up<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.420> six<00:03:08.660> different

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
adjustable in up to six different

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.150 
adjustable in up to six different
positions<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:13.690> here<00:03:14.690> we<00:03:14.750> have<00:03:14.960> the<00:03:15.260> base<00:03:15.740> for

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
positions so here we have the base for

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.730 
positions so here we have the base for
some<00:03:16.280> packaging<00:03:16.820> back<00:03:17.000> now<00:03:17.180> as<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:18.470> said<00:03:18.620> before

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
some packaging back now as I said before

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.220 
some packaging back now as I said before

its rubbery texture we've got to love

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.380 
its rubbery texture we've got to love
that<00:04:14.710> satisfying<00:04:15.310> click<00:04:15.670> of<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.910> paddles<00:04:16.299> to

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
that satisfying click of the paddles to

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:25.680 
that satisfying click of the paddles to
show<00:04:17.170> very<00:04:17.500> well-built<00:04:17.860> as<00:04:18.070> well<00:04:18.250> I<00:04:18.280> did<00:04:18.580> metal

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.469 

fifteen<00:04:26.690> rounds<00:04:26.870> with<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.800> buttons<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.699> found

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
fifteen rounds with the buttons I found

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.480 
fifteen rounds with the buttons I found
to<00:04:29.630> be<00:04:29.720> very<00:04:29.960> well<00:04:30.139> positions<00:04:30.680> they're<00:04:31.340> all

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
to be very well positions they're all

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.969 
to be very well positions they're all
easily<00:04:31.759> within<00:04:32.210> reach

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
easily within reach

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.499 
easily within reach
speaking<00:04:33.979> of<00:04:34.069> the<00:04:34.160> paddles<00:04:34.580> it's<00:04:34.940> it's<00:04:35.330> worth

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
speaking of the paddles it's it's worth

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.050 
speaking of the paddles it's it's worth
mentioning<00:04:35.720> that<00:04:36.020> they're<00:04:36.289> not<00:04:36.440> static<00:04:37.060> this

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
mentioning that they're not static this

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.510 
mentioning that they're not static this
was<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.210> common<00:04:38.599> criticism<00:04:38.780> of<00:04:39.259> the<00:04:39.349> T<00:04:39.530> 500<00:04:39.800> but

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
was a common criticism of the T 500 but

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.830 
was a common criticism of the T 500 but
these<00:04:40.669> are<00:04:40.819> attached<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.419> rim

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
these are attached to the rim

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.059 
these are attached to the rim
so<00:04:42.020> they<00:04:42.110> actually<00:04:42.199> move<00:04:42.560> with<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.860> wheel

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
so they actually move with the wheel

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.439 
so they actually move with the wheel
going<00:04:44.710> back<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.009> pedals<00:04:46.340> now<00:04:46.550> just

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
going back to the pedals now just

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.499 
going back to the pedals now just
testing<00:04:47.840> out<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.050> resistance<00:04:49.180> it<00:04:50.180> spun<00:04:50.419> to

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
testing out the resistance it spun to

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.300 
testing out the resistance it spun to
your<00:04:50.660> resistance<00:04:51.139> actually<00:04:51.319> they<00:04:52.039> do<00:04:52.099> require

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
your resistance actually they do require

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.659 
your resistance actually they do require
quite<00:04:52.729> a<00:04:52.789> bit<00:04:53.060> of<00:04:53.150> pressure<00:04:53.389> to<00:04:53.509> press<00:04:53.840> down

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
quite a bit of pressure to press down

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.189 
quite a bit of pressure to press down
the<00:04:55.669> brake<00:04:55.849> is<00:04:56.000> definitely<00:04:56.389> stiffer<00:04:56.720> though

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
the brake is definitely stiffer though

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.520 
the brake is definitely stiffer though
as<00:04:57.650> you'd<00:04:57.860> expect<00:04:58.780> it's<00:04:59.780> not<00:04:59.930> progressive

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
as you'd expect it's not progressive

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.960 
as you'd expect it's not progressive
pressure<00:05:00.860> which<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.460> a<00:05:01.490> bit<00:05:01.789> disappointing

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
pressure which is a bit disappointing

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.810 
pressure which is a bit disappointing
actually<00:05:02.539> and<00:05:02.990> like<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:03.800> TX<00:05:04.099> is<00:05:04.370> no<00:05:04.490> clutch

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
actually and like the TX is no clutch

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.370 
actually and like the TX is no clutch
over<00:05:05.330> I<00:05:05.509> think<00:05:05.720> people<00:05:05.990> might<00:05:06.110> have<00:05:06.259> be

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
over I think people might have be

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.770 
over I think people might have be
expecting<00:05:06.889> one<00:05:06.919> since<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.550> standard<00:05:08.030> T<00:05:08.180> 500

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780

however get the t free PA add-on which

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.800 
however get the t free PA add-on which
