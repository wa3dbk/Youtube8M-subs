00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
okay what we have here today is a 2006

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.200 
okay what we have here today is a 2006
Golf<00:00:06.240> TDI<00:00:06.810> or<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.680> manual<00:00:08.099> transmission<00:00:08.760> the

engine<00:00:09.630> code<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.580> BEW<00:00:11.900> we<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.670> engine

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
engine code is a BEW we have this engine

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.300 
engine code is a BEW we have this engine
apart<00:00:15.000> here<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.480> valve<00:00:15.660> cover<00:00:15.900> off<00:00:16.310> because

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
apart here the valve cover off because

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.769 
apart here the valve cover off because
of<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> defective<00:00:18.660> camshaft<00:00:19.520> this<00:00:20.520> car<00:00:20.850> has<00:00:21.150> two

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
of a defective camshaft this car has two

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.779 
of a defective camshaft this car has two
hundred<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.230> ninety<00:00:22.680> eight<00:00:23.310> thousand

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
hundred and ninety eight thousand

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.250 
hundred and ninety eight thousand
kilometers<00:00:25.400> so<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.730> removed<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.480> EGR

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
kilometers so we have removed the EGR

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.080 
kilometers so we have removed the EGR
here<00:00:28.619> for<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.099> access<00:00:29.490> remove<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.970> valve

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
here for the access remove the valve

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.749 
here for the access remove the valve
cover<00:00:30.330> easier<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.960> also<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> clean<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
cover easier and also to clean it the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.600 
cover easier and also to clean it the
camshaft<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.660> right<00:00:33.870> now<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
camshaft is out right now as if as the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.330 
camshaft is out right now as if as the
lifters<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:37.140> camshaft<00:00:37.590> bearings<00:00:37.770> okay

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
lifters and the camshaft bearings okay

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.420 
lifters and the camshaft bearings okay
so<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.660> problem<00:00:40.050> was<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.530> especially<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.280> this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
so the problem was is especially at this

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.420 
so the problem was is especially at this
number<00:00:42.180> four<00:00:42.450> cylinder<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.860> intake

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
number four cylinder on the intake

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.330 
number four cylinder on the intake
lifter<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.329> lifter<00:00:45.989> was<00:00:46.200> worn<00:00:46.770> right<00:00:47.070> through

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
lifter the lifter was worn right through

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.400 
lifter the lifter was worn right through
so<00:00:48.030> we're<00:00:48.180> gonna<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.629> what<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> looks<00:00:49.800> like

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
so we're gonna see what it looks like

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.900 
so we're gonna see what it looks like
this<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> lifter<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.520> cylinder

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
this is a lifter that was on cylinder

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.450 
this is a lifter that was on cylinder
number<00:00:54.030> four<00:00:54.649> she's<00:00:55.649> busted<00:00:56.160> right<00:00:56.280> through

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
number four she's busted right through

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.979 
number four she's busted right through
there<00:00:56.610> was<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> piece<00:00:57.120> sticking<00:00:57.690> there<00:00:57.960> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
there was a piece sticking there I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.990 
there was a piece sticking there I
removed<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> magnet<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.910> way

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
removed it with a magnet but in a way

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.029 
removed it with a magnet but in a way
that<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.899> missing<00:01:01.500> apart<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
that you know it's missing apart and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.690 
that you know it's missing apart and
it's<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:03.229> worn<00:01:04.229> out<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.650> all<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> lifters

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it's all worn out and all the lifters

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.789 
it's all worn out and all the lifters
look<00:01:05.970> pretty<00:01:06.240> much<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.439> could<00:01:07.560> see

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
look pretty much like this you could see

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.190 
look pretty much like this you could see
that<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> little<00:01:08.159> bit<00:01:08.280> scratch<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.840> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
that a little bit scratch but it's you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.510 
that a little bit scratch but it's you
know<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.530> worn<00:01:10.830> out<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.310> one

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
know it's not worn out like this one

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.450 
know it's not worn out like this one
this<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.150> worse<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:14.100> these<00:01:14.400> are

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
this one is the worse and and these are

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.469 
this one is the worse and and these are
the<00:01:15.290> camshaft<00:01:16.290> shells<00:01:16.880> bearing<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.180> we

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the camshaft shells bearing so we

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.630 
the camshaft shells bearing so we
replace<00:01:18.900> all<00:01:19.140> them<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> same<00:01:19.890> time<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.400> see

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
replace all them at the same time to see

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.480 
replace all them at the same time to see
that<00:01:20.820> these<00:01:21.030> ones<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.450> worn<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:22.340> you<00:01:23.340> can

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that these ones are worn out you can

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
that these ones are worn out you can
tell

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
tell

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.640 
tell
so<00:01:25.920> they're<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.640> pretty<00:01:26.970> much<00:01:27.120> and

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
so they're all like that pretty much and

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.740 
so they're all like that pretty much and
and<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:32.420> problem<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.660> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
and this is the the problem with the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.520 
and this is the the problem with the
camshaft<00:01:34.070> I<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> caliper<00:01:36.120> set<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
camshaft I have a caliper set with the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.250 
camshaft I have a caliper set with the
new<00:01:37.680> lobe<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.160> the<00:01:38.580> new<00:01:38.729> camshaft<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:40.080> can

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
new lobe of the new camshaft as we can

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.770 
new lobe of the new camshaft as we can
see<00:01:40.729> there's<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:42.150> amount<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:44.420> this<00:01:45.420> amount

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
see there's this amount of this amount

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.840 
see there's this amount of this amount
of<00:01:45.900> wear<00:01:47.840> see<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.770> I'm<00:01:49.920> unaware<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.550> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
of wear see this I'm unaware and the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.640 
of wear see this I'm unaware and the
other<00:01:50.970> ones<00:01:51.210> are<00:01:51.390> pretty<00:01:51.420> good<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
other ones are pretty good this is the

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.999 
other ones are pretty good this is the
worst<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.410> brand<00:01:55.920> new

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
worst and so we have a brand new

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.990 
worst and so we have a brand new
camshaft<00:01:56.720> that<00:01:57.720> we're<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.110> install<00:01:58.440> and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
camshaft that we're going to install and

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.180 
camshaft that we're going to install and
brand<00:02:00.000> new<00:02:00.180> eight<00:02:00.390> lifters<00:02:00.930> these<00:02:01.619> are<00:02:01.830> remain

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
brand new eight lifters these are remain

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.430 
brand new eight lifters these are remain
in<00:02:02.340> Germany<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.880> these<00:02:03.539> are<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.840> newer<00:02:04.050> type

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
in Germany and these are the newer type

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.940 
in Germany and these are the newer type
they're<00:02:04.860> all<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.340> black<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.560> they<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.680> like

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
they're all like black so they have like

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.620 
they're all like black so they have like
a<00:02:07.979> special<00:02:08.250> coating<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.270> think<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
a special coating and I think the

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.860 
a special coating and I think the
they're<00:02:10.050> probably<00:02:10.530> harder<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.660> these<00:02:12.660> are

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
they're probably harder so these are

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.120 
they're probably harder so these are
brand<00:02:13.140> new<00:02:13.200> lifters<00:02:13.560> we're<00:02:13.680> going<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> put<00:02:14.010> in

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
brand new lifters we're going to put in

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.390 
brand new lifters we're going to put in
and<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.660> old<00:02:15.810> camshaft<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:17.250> then

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
and this is the old camshaft so then

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.979 
and this is the old camshaft so then
again<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.850> know<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.060> car<00:02:18.239> had<00:02:18.450> two<00:02:18.690> hundred

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
again you know the car had two hundred

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.150 
again you know the car had two hundred
ninety<00:02:19.890> eight<00:02:19.920> thousand<00:02:20.370> kilometers<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:21.000> and

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
ninety eight thousand kilometers on and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.970 
ninety eight thousand kilometers on and
so<00:02:23.160> that's<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.459> two<00:02:23.610> thousand<00:02:23.940> six<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.830> also<00:02:25.830> we

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
so that's a two thousand six and also we

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.070 
so that's a two thousand six and also we
had<00:02:26.130> replaced<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.850> fuel<00:02:27.600> pump<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.050> tank

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.949 
had replaced the fuel pump in the tank
that's<00:02:28.530> one<00:02:28.739> thing<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.100> check<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:30.209> car<00:02:30.510> here

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
that's one thing to check this car here

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.479 
that's one thing to check this car here

had this car had a defective fuel pump
in<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.760> tank<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.299> we<00:02:37.049> checked<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:38.360> with<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
in the tank so we checked it with a I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.640 
in the tank so we checked it with a I
have<00:02:41.120> call<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.480> special<00:02:42.959> tool<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:43.590> a
