00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.440
 hello in this video we're going to demonstrate 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.649
 that the chip that we are discussing 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.449
 It is compatible with all plates 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.639
 and all the psp models 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.639
 it does not matter what fring werth they have 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.470
 in this case 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.239
 it is a psp 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.310
 model 3000 10 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.329
 set up 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.869
 in six points 20 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.069
 that our crazy 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:35.079
 but with this instructive or puelche that handled 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.820
 Well, if you lose models like this 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.820
 the psp 3000 and psp 2000 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.530
 that have damn plate 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.840
 morita to see that it does not exist 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.750
 no fraud 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.750
 and see that the chip really works 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.570
 I will show you 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.720
 to see 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.730
 model is 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.590
 if they realize it has code 9 on 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.270
 its means that it is the new tablets 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.270
 supposedly 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.270
 protected 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.420
 you can not see right here I am 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.230
 putting the bases full 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 to see that the console does not change 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.780
 let's learn 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.720
 transcending 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.950
 we are going I will go to 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.030
 spa system settings 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.460
 left 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.220
 this external information 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.560
 can you check 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.740
 that effectively series 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.880
 version 6 20 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.240
 Now let's activate the chip 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.480
 starz 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.480
 carlos esquivel spark require 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.849
 as if you can load 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.859
 you can load games 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.859
 with that chip 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.769
 highlight gando 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.239
 in the console towards Kim 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.459
 is loading the game 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.459
 we do not hide 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.939
 there we go again 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.579
 or can see 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.959
 the island in the race of the game 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.469
 it's not a demo 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.669
 this is the dad funds 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.669
 we can not see they do not have is with unity 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:36.089
 going directly to the sun 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:39.289
 besides the memory 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:40.509
 sun 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:43.659
 tohÃ¡ is that of a young couple 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.369
 let's load other 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.159
 and it's the same 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.849
 from the same 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.269
 we are loading the other 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.389
 ap 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.419
 lisboa 2 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.779
 marisol floors 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.959
 it is one of the three thousand 10 56 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.400
 so they can see that he is not a Democrat 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.289
 access to the mind 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.289
 if they realize 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.719
 there are no games 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:11.889
 what is to be written
