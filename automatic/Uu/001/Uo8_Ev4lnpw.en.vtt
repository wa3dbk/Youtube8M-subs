00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.170
 carmelo fat in a time when yes 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.139
 closes everything there is something in 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.389
 bucking the trend behind us is the 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.320
 maxi screen of the empire cinema that is 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.760
 off for so many years now since the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.250
 period is what it is because there are the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.650
 multisale and she had the courage to 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.180
 decide to turn on that screen is 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.470
 to revive the theater and for the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.960
 empire cinema 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.570
 yes we have continued anyway 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.250
 a theatrical activity in these years 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.170
 we did some sometime 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.770
 projection for schools in a manner 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.370
 I felt many, however, many 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.770
 spectators who needed to 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.520
 find a cinema space also 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.690
 in the middle of course with a product 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.579
 particular qualified certainly not 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.340
 commercial because we are not able to 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.530
 compete with multi-screen precisely 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.829
 and to andromeda in particular to good 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.129
 but it seemed interesting to me 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.920
 review in May that will begin 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.680
 from every Saturday and Sunday from the next 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.650
 Saturday and Sunday 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.840
 and thus propose a quality product 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.400
 a quality cinema product e 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.470
 this also allows us the new one 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.170
 technology that we have installed here 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.990
 to the empire a digital projector e 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.270
 so we will try to give a service in 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.500
 more to our public audience for 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.960
 precisely this review throughout May 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.540
 then we will see what it knows what the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.759
 public response to toast e 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.740
 in short, we will see what to do in the future 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.329
 a history that of the empire cinema that 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.700
 it starts from afar starting 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.170
 even from piazza cairoli and that of 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.630
 done he has drawn a little what it is 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.100
 was the Italian film history 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.790
 as well as that of this one 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.140
 city 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.000
 certainly my grandfather started in 1919 and us 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.270
 in short, we are close to the century 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.880
 fat family activities then i 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.040
 still like to keep this today 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.710
 tradition and hopefully short of 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.940
 get to the century quietly e 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.039
 in short, we hope that the public 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.900
 Brindisi can follow us 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.420
 at least in this small business in 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.879
 this little adventure and we are 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.430
 glad that this screen finally 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:25.230
 yes we can rekindle yes I hope in short 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.250
 that is something the spectators are happy with 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.250
 to the citizens of Brindisi
