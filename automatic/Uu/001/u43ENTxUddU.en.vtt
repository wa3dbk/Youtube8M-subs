00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.220
 I hope the girls meet 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.560
 super well this tutorial is inspired 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.300
 on the lips of kylie jenner and her 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.340
 general makeup everyone is 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.500
 intrigued that the plane uses it and 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.840
 I will bring you this version that is 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.750
 very similar and the best super economic 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.070
 so let's start to buy time already 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.870
 I had done my eyebrows 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.850
 the next thing was to apply a first this 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.200
 this benedetti professional I'm going to 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.720
 apply in all areas that I know that 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.210
 it means to turn a little bright 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.130
 for heat and humidity then apply 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.590
 my concealer I'm using one of 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.030
 nars radiant with sky the tone is 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.560
 like and what I like this 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.989
 correctors that will not only help me 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.180
 to cover imperfections but also 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.180
 It will serve me to make lighting or 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.620
 highlight then I apply it as 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.600
 always first food title with 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.520
 space with a brush and another thinkable 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.229
 without teachers and I count on this for the 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.579
 so the next thing I'm going to do is something 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.159
 that I was liking lately 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:13.810
 they applied concealer in pencil s 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.280
 is ideal tone is deep and my language 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.109
 what I do is apply it to the areas that 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.899
 I want in this case the outline or 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:21.969
 disguise that if between the bone of my 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.100
 cheekbones and jaw my forehead my nose 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.140
 what helps me outline the following is 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.530
 apply a base using a base in 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.750
 dust studies and in that 42 mack and 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.119
 for this time it is great to apply a 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.819
 powder base especially this one because it's 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.200
 of quite a covering and it makes me like 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.819
 some colors because I do not have to 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.619
 use a cream base and then 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.780
 seal it with a game without leaving everything 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.379
 this not only happens the next one is 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.539
 Apply some of the powder java and havana 

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:51.099
 control palette if you're 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.739
 already beverly hills in the areas where 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:57.159
 I had previously applied the pencil 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:58.719
 glory to the corrector pencil of loria for 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.270
 work with shadows remember that 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.829
 these girls both the kardashian and 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.689
 the trowels are known to have a 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.280
 perfect contour and lighting 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.280
 perfect then that's why you have to 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.200
 do it well detailed and then 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.000
 use the same palette until you know how to see 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.190
 the state is the vanilla tone 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.210
 and seal the concealer to prevent 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.860
 it moves me or it finally quartet me 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.800
 in terms of achievement use that blogs that 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.130
 together roma this cut is from the palette 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.720
 of love bloggers and what is being 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.459
 applying with greater emphasis on 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.590
 back of my billion and in 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.450
 smaller amount in what ever in and toni 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.130
 chairs because by looking at the photos that 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.380
 they always apply in those of that 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.050
 way and then the impellable or the 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.120
 inevitable for me es of angels alternate 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.290
 with illuminator above my 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.270
 air cheeks many edges for 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.850
 start with the canvas uses a base 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.890
 sounders is to designate this environment is 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.690
 perfect and what I'm going to do is 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.100
 apply it on all my eyelid mobile e and 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.140
 lower eyelid because it is that I 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.590
 help highlight the shadows then I 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.300
 to go with the palette is and interned in the 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.820
 first tone that you will use is which 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.739
 illuminate the bone of my complaints and then 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.410
 on the mobile eyelid I'm going to apply the 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.870
 wind tone but only on the boat without 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.260
 reach the basin the only color you 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.579
 I'm going to use it this palette is the 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.379
 Mac software is a color of 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.299
 transition and I'm going to apply it over 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.459
 of the basin with a brush on 40 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.319
 sigma with more emphasis on the part 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.780
 external and bringing the waste to the 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.819
 internal part is good to apply 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.709
 little by little the color again 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.340
 I come with the style palette this time I'm going 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.049
 to use the ry tone which is a brown 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.290
 chocolate as you see and I'm going to apply 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.450
 in the basin but I'm going to apply for less 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.310
 amount of color and little complicating 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.400
 more and in what is the pasta also the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.200
 external trickle and then to give it 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.480
 a little more depth the tone and 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.150
 bonnie that is like black shreds and 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.670
 mixed with the tone but again 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.079
 well, a little bit because I do not want him to do 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.579
 a very strong contrast but that 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.200
 just help me do as more 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.629
 depth the count and in the part 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.159
 external and then it's blur blur 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.409
 Blur the abdominal to combine 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.000
 very much so that the unions remain 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.650
 as in gradient do not stay so 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.629
 marked and we lose part of the color 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.609
 we can apply a little more both the 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.070
 tone as the soft round tone and 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.150
 again blur and that's all in 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.220
 about the shadows 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.540
 now the delineated in the photos I was 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.340
 seeing them in relation to a 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.979
 delineated types every and but and in 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.570
 tiny on the outside many 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.240
 Sometimes it reaches only half of the eye 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.949
 and at other times they do all the 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.479
 full eye on top but 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.490
 half behind reaching the lacrimal will be 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.130
 doing as more thin for that 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.340
 use a brush 11 with a liner 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.830
 in black gel even the following is 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.810
 false eyelashes thats flower online is 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.610
 the model is emily that are more 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.199
 abundant in the external part and with 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.289
 fewer crimes towards the internal part of the 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.380
 eye and then mascara on both 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.330
 upper lashes with many years 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.610
 inferiors and that's all the makeup 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.979
 but now the identity part comes 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.630
 which are the lips to give you better 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.960
 definition to our lips first thing 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.320
 is outlined with a pencil in nude tone 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.400
 I'm using small click 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.530
 depending on the photo that you see of 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.700
 they raise their lips like more rosita 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.080
 knots 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.150
 more beauties than the first 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.010
 combination that I extract is from 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.680
 Back in white they are two - tone intone 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.360
 look for the rosita and sandwiches that is the 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.670
 Brown cited the first one they are going to do 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.850
 is to apply the tone move by tapping 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.590
 all over our lip and then on top of 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.070
 that lipstick will use the brown tone 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.960
 vocal and its equal shape tapping 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.910
 and in this way they will combine and go 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.070
 to do as a nude tone onu 3 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.080
 when pink so there is a goodbye 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.180
 even more perfect we apply a little 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.890
 of corrector and this is already known 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.600
 done in other videos and this is the 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.060
 result in our first combination 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.010
 now lips nude on pink background me 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.290
 love it seems to me that it is super cute and 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.960
 good looking to the lips that already in 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.670
 photos uses boards if they see other 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.350
 pictures of them you also see that uses 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.180
 a combination like more brown so 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.340
 use the same tone very happy if you 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.500
 It costs the same with a little bit of tone 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.390
 Serve and really still are 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.700
 super cheap can not mix 5 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.260
 dollars and gives us this combination what are 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.820
 to use the same way giving 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.100
 taps in our saw that the 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.780
 colors with me and that's all the 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.120
 tutorial is in my crisis valley and 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:30.040
 finish recording 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:30.040
 I liked the next one as always 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.320
 now
