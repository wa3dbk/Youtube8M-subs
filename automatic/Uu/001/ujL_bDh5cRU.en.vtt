smaller hole with the electric auger is

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.380 
smaller hole with the electric auger is
that<00:00:47.440> it<00:00:47.620> will<00:00:47.860> dramatically<00:00:48.760> increase<00:00:49.090> your

40 holes through 24 inches of ice with
an<00:00:54.100> 8<00:00:54.219> inch<00:00:54.430> bit<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.989> an<00:00:56.170> estimate<00:00:56.590> estimate

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
an 8 inch bit just an estimate estimate

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.639 
an 8 inch bit just an estimate estimate
in<00:00:57.430> here<00:00:57.609> if<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:58.269> go<00:00:58.480> down<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.840> say<00:00:59.019> a<00:00:59.050> 6<00:00:59.410> inch

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
in here if you go down to say a 6 inch

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.580 
in here if you go down to say a 6 inch
bit<00:00:59.920> you<00:01:00.519> should<00:01:00.550> get<00:01:01.120> about<00:01:01.239> 70<00:01:02.050> holes<00:01:02.289> give

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
bit you should get about 70 holes give

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.340 
bit you should get about 70 holes give
or<00:01:02.739> take<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:04.059> a<00:01:04.390> lot<00:01:04.750> there's<00:01:04.930> been<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.110> lot<00:01:05.320> of

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
or take so a lot there's been a lot of

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.650 
or take so a lot there's been a lot of
interest<00:01:05.680> in<00:01:05.830> it<00:01:05.980> all<00:01:06.670> you<00:01:06.910> really<00:01:07.120> need<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.480> do

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
interest in it all you really need to do

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.429 
interest in it all you really need to do
is<00:01:07.900> actually<00:01:08.860> use<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:10.060> extension<00:01:10.900> that<00:01:11.170> comes

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
is actually use the extension that comes

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.330 
is actually use the extension that comes
inside<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.400> box<00:01:12.880> with<00:01:13.420> your<00:01:13.600> new<00:01:13.720> ion<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:14.350> put

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
inside the box with your new ion you put

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.070 
inside the box with your new ion you put
this<00:01:15.520> on<00:01:15.759> you<00:01:16.210> actually<00:01:16.299> put<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.659> laser<00:01:16.840> on

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
this on you actually put the laser on

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.390 
this on you actually put the laser on
I'll<00:01:17.200> show<00:01:17.320> you<00:01:17.500> how<00:01:17.650> to<00:01:17.680> do<00:01:17.860> that<00:01:18.040> here<00:01:18.189> in<00:01:18.310> a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
I'll show you how to do that here in a

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.700 
I'll show you how to do that here in a
minute<00:01:18.520> if<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.479> do<00:01:19.869> not<00:01:19.990> want<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.380> use<00:01:20.500> the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
minute if you do not want to use the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.800 
minute if you do not want to use the
extension<00:01:21.280> due<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.210> fact<00:01:22.509> that<00:01:22.600> the

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
extension due to the fact that the

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.380 
extension due to the fact that the
strike<00:01:23.079> master<00:01:23.530> has<00:01:23.740> a<00:01:24.040> oversized<00:01:24.700> wingnut<00:01:25.150> on

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
strike master has a oversized wingnut on

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.600 
strike master has a oversized wingnut on
it<00:01:25.540> like<00:01:25.720> so<00:01:25.960> you'll<00:01:26.560> you're<00:01:27.159> going<00:01:27.189> to<00:01:27.400> need

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
it like so you'll you're going to need

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.340 
it like so you'll you're going to need
to<00:01:27.729> find<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.090> bolt<00:01:28.299> that<00:01:28.479> matches<00:01:28.900> up<00:01:28.930> to<00:01:29.229> the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
to find a bolt that matches up to the

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.260 
to find a bolt that matches up to the
threading<00:01:29.799> that<00:01:30.340> comes<00:01:30.579> with<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:30.850> with<00:01:31.150> the

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
threading that comes with the with the

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.840 
threading that comes with the with the
laser<00:01:31.450> just<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.860> ion<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.490> laser<00:01:33.700> is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
laser just the ion and the laser is

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.600 
laser just the ion and the laser is
threading<00:01:34.270> don't<00:01:34.750> exactly<00:01:35.259> math<00:01:35.619> mitt<00:01:35.979> match

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
threading don't exactly math mitt match

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.190 
threading don't exactly math mitt match
up<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:36.909> you<00:01:37.149> could<00:01:37.329> damage<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.750> thread<00:01:38.020> on

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
up so you could damage a thread on

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.350 
up so you could damage a thread on
another<00:01:39.040> hand<00:01:39.280> auger<00:01:39.460> that<00:01:39.640> will<00:01:39.850> also<00:01:40.180> work

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
another hand auger that will also work

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.710 
another hand auger that will also work
on<00:01:40.540> this<00:01:40.720> is<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:41.049> Eskimo<00:01:41.439> HD<00:01:42.040> so<00:01:42.670> really<00:01:43.509> quick

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
on this is the Eskimo HD so really quick

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.819 
on this is the Eskimo HD so really quick
I'm<00:01:43.899> going<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.110> show<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:44.259> how<00:01:44.470> we're<00:01:44.680> going<00:01:44.710> to

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
I'm going to show you how we're going to

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.710 
I'm going to show you how we're going to
do<00:01:45.220> this<00:01:45.340> conversion<00:01:45.520> just<00:01:46.090> using<00:01:46.509> the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
do this conversion just using the

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.840 
do this conversion just using the
extension<00:01:47.170> if<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.250> don't<00:01:48.520> want<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.700> use<00:01:48.790> the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
extension if you don't want to use the
