today we're going to learn about the

today we're going to learn about the
manifolds<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.100> use<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.699> our<00:00:23.730> boat<00:00:24.210> to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
manifolds that we use on our boat to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.779 
manifolds that we use on our boat to
keep<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.930> engine<00:00:25.260> cool<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:26.279> rid<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
for quite a long time in fact when

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.040 
for quite a long time in fact when
you're<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> salt<00:00:35.100> water<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.870> running<00:00:36.870> the

you're in the salt water and running the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.830 
you're in the salt water and running the
exhaust<00:00:37.500> through<00:00:38.149> sometimes<00:00:39.149> there's

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
exhaust through sometimes there's

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.600 
exhaust through sometimes there's
nothing<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.739> about<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.340> salt

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
nothing you can do about the salt

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.990 
nothing you can do about the salt
crystals<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:43.020> dry<00:00:43.530> when<00:00:44.250> you're<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
crystals that dry when you're out on the

crystals that dry when you're out on the
water<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.360> an<00:00:45.690> overnight<00:00:45.989> cruise<00:00:46.590> or<00:00:46.920> maybe

you've<00:00:47.340> gone<00:00:47.610> three<00:00:47.940> or<00:00:48.030> four<00:00:48.270> days<00:00:48.480> that's

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
you've gone three or four days that's

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.200 
you've gone three or four days that's
all<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.200> takes<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.829> amazing<00:00:50.430> how<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.670> salt

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
all it takes it's amazing how that salt

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.959 
all it takes it's amazing how that salt
will<00:00:51.809> build<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.289> into<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.829> elbow<00:00:53.340> system<00:00:53.789> of

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
will build up into that elbow system of

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.410 
will build up into that elbow system of
your<00:00:54.120> manifold<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:56.070> reason<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:56.940> these

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
your manifold the reason I know these

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.599 
your manifold the reason I know these
things<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.079> because<00:00:58.109> I've<00:00:58.710> chartered<00:00:59.219> for<00:00:59.489> all

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
things is because I've chartered for all

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.700 
things is because I've chartered for all
these<00:00:59.940> years<00:01:00.359> out<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> straits<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.649> Juan

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
these years out in the straits of Juan

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.820 
these years out in the straits of Juan
de<00:01:02.039> Fuca<00:01:02.270> one<00:01:03.270> morning<00:01:03.750> particular<00:01:04.409> we're<00:01:04.650> up

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
de Fuca one morning particular we're up

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.500 
de Fuca one morning particular we're up
off<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> pillar<00:01:05.489> point<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.270> we're<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
off a pillar point you know we're the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.260 
off a pillar point you know we're the
tides<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> incoming<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:08.490> got<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> couple<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
tides on the incoming we got a couple of

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
tides on the incoming we got a couple of
nice<00:01:09.420> fish<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> box<00:01:10.470> already<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
nice fish in the box already and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.149 
nice fish in the box already and
everything<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.930> smooth<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.770> noticed

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
everything is going smooth and I noticed

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.359 
everything is going smooth and I noticed
that<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> tide<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.939> now<00:01:15.150> changed<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.890> I've<00:01:17.070> had

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that the tide is now changed so I've had

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
that the tide is now changed so I've had
to<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:17.880> into<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> engine<00:01:18.600> compartment<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
to get into the engine compartment and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.060 
to get into the engine compartment and
just<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> carburetor<00:01:20.750> throttle<00:01:22.070> adjustment

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
just the carburetor throttle adjustment

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
just the carburetor throttle adjustment
here<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:24.140> as<00:01:25.140> I've<00:01:25.740> changed<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.729> speed<00:01:27.060> I

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
here and as I've changed the speed I

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.300 
here and as I've changed the speed I
watched<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.750> rotation<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.619> flasher<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
watched the rotation of the flasher and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.480 
watched the rotation of the flasher and
this<00:01:29.640> allows<00:01:30.030> me<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.710> make<00:01:31.710> sure<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.280> my

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this allows me to make sure that my

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.789 
this allows me to make sure that my
gears<00:01:32.880> running<00:01:33.570> properly<00:01:34.229> because<00:01:34.439> just

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
gears running properly because just

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.289 
gears running properly because just
because<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.250> think<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.549> running<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.090> way

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
because you think it's running this way

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.440 
because you think it's running this way
at<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> surface<00:01:37.549> it's<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.729> big<00:01:39.030> difference

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
at the surface it's a big difference

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.140 
at the surface it's a big difference
down<00:01:40.140> deep<00:01:40.590> especially<00:01:40.920> where<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.400> crawl<00:01:41.939> in

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
down deep especially where I crawl in

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.940 
down deep especially where I crawl in
that<00:01:42.420> 180<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.649> 225<00:01:44.460> bottom<00:01:45.090> depth<00:01:45.390> level<00:01:46.290> with

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that 180 to 225 bottom depth level with

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.139 
that 180 to 225 bottom depth level with
these<00:01:47.070> 20-pound<00:01:47.880> leads<00:01:48.329> yes<00:01:49.020> sir<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.850> rod

nother<00:01:53.430> story<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:55.619> while<00:01:55.979> I'm<00:01:56.159> down<00:01:56.460> there

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
nother story so while I'm down there

nother story so while I'm down there
though<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.329> bump<00:01:57.810> into<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.290> exhaust<00:01:58.619> manifold

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
though I bump into the exhaust manifold

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.020 
though I bump into the exhaust manifold
and<00:01:59.780> the<00:02:00.780> riser<00:02:01.140> that's<00:02:01.680> above<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.490> it's

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and the riser that's above it and it's

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.679 
and the riser that's above it and it's
hot<00:02:03.329> ah-ha<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.979> reason<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.610> know<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:06.119> hot<00:02:06.390> is

hot ah-ha the reason I know it's hot is

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.869 
hot ah-ha the reason I know it's hot is
