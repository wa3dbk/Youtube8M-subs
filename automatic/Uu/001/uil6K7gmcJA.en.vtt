00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.260
 at the time of the interview the objects 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.230

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.930
 that not being that lionn that means 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.420

 the sheep is the best the best of the year 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.280

 about roberto is this sam and the winds that 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.950
 almost unimportant 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.420
 this was the first hi bye 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.200
 What do you think? 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.840
 good afternoon but the money is little 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.330

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.040

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.040

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.530
 you were replaced once more 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.840
 prestigious by rain 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.810

 threw the shirt on the ground in the area days already 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:26.440
 that the speech is worse because I 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:28.840
 It's necessary to save someone 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.880
 take seriously the seriousness of the people 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.670

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.920

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.810
 way to a future in football 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.970

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:08.599
