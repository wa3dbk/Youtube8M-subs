don't like the paint but we all accept

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.060 
don't like the paint but we all accept
that<00:03:18.540> it's<00:03:18.810> something<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.230> we<00:03:19.590> have<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.920> go

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
that it's something that we have to go

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.009 
that it's something that we have to go
through<00:03:20.280> sort<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.790> as<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:20.940> rites<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.299> passage<00:03:21.810> in

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
so I really don't let the pain get in

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.130

the<00:03:26.880> way<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.299> things<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:29.690> although<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.959> might

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
the way of things and although it might

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.729 
the way of things and although it might
be<00:03:31.200> meaningless<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.920> some<00:03:32.340> people<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.739> there

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
be meaningless to some people and there

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.949 
be meaningless to some people and there
is<00:03:34.859> no<00:03:35.070> real<00:03:35.340> purpose<00:03:35.609> as<00:03:36.000> some<00:03:36.420> people<00:03:36.540> point

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
is no real purpose as some people point

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.240 
is no real purpose as some people point
out<00:03:37.079> like<00:03:37.320> what's<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.590> point<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:37.950> what's

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
out like what's the point of that what's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.580 
out like what's the point of that what's
the<00:03:38.340> point<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.640> this<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.900> world<00:03:40.109> is<00:03:40.290> not<00:03:40.440> gonna

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
the point of this the world is not gonna

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.190 
the point of this the world is not gonna
see<00:03:40.799> it<00:03:40.829> anyway<00:03:41.250> or<00:03:41.280> whatever<00:03:41.760> we<00:03:42.750> do<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.019> for

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
see it anyway or whatever we do it for

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.580 
see it anyway or whatever we do it for
us<00:03:43.350> not<00:03:44.220> for<00:03:44.459> other<00:03:44.579> people<00:03:44.670> we<00:03:45.600> do<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.959> for<00:03:46.109> us

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
us not for other people we do it for us

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.140 
us not for other people we do it for us
and<00:03:46.799> so<00:03:47.190> we<00:03:47.310> understand<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:48.680> there<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.829> pain

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
and so we understand that there is pain

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.979 
and so we understand that there is pain
but<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.269> it's<00:03:51.420> okay

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
but that it's okay

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.880 
but that it's okay
because<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.920> pain<00:03:53.130> will<00:03:53.250> go<00:03:53.280> away<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:55.590> the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
because the pain will go away and the

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.340 
because the pain will go away and the
last<00:03:56.100> question<00:03:56.670> in<00:03:57.299> regards<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:58.049> pain<00:03:58.319> a

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
for going through that kind of pain but

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.460 
for going through that kind of pain but
for<00:05:42.750> us<00:05:42.900> it's<00:05:43.680> worth<00:05:43.950> it<00:05:44.190> and<00:05:44.810> yeah<00:05:45.810> that's

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
for us it's worth it and yeah that's

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.290 
for us it's worth it and yeah that's
pretty<00:05:46.590> much<00:05:46.800> it<00:05:47.330> body<00:05:48.330> my<00:05:48.539> fusion<00:05:48.870> hurts<00:05:50.300> it's

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
pretty much it body my fusion hurts it's

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.510 
pretty much it body my fusion hurts it's
worth<00:05:51.600> the<00:05:51.780> pain<00:05:52.020> and<00:05:52.440> no<00:05:52.800> you<00:05:52.860> can't<00:05:53.160> numb<00:05:53.340> it

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
worth the pain and no you can't numb it

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.150 
worth the pain and no you can't numb it
but<00:05:53.760> it's<00:05:53.910> okay<00:05:54.440> it's<00:05:55.440> okay<00:05:55.680> because<00:05:55.950> it

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
but it's okay it's okay because it

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.050 
but it's okay it's okay because it
doesn't<00:05:56.430> last<00:05:56.520> forever

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
doesn't last forever

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.629 
doesn't last forever
so<00:05:57.510> um<00:05:57.960> I<00:05:58.410> think<00:05:58.830> that<00:05:59.070> pretty<00:05:59.280> much<00:05:59.370> covers

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
so um I think that pretty much covers

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.879 
so um I think that pretty much covers
the<00:06:00.120> subject<00:06:00.360> of<00:06:00.900> pain<00:06:01.289> and<00:06:01.650> body

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
the subject of pain and body

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.500 
the subject of pain and body
modification<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:04.340> wanted<00:06:05.340> to<00:06:05.520> do<00:06:05.880> this<00:06:06.150> kind<00:06:06.450> of

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
modification I wanted to do this kind of

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.360
