00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello everyone today I bring you one of the 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.930
 better applications and being sincere 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.030
 that you can find in all the google 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.400
 play store to improve the duration of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.070
 battery and to manage an aspect that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.430
 so little is taken into account as so 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.020
 accurate and so transcendental is for the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.789
 duration of our batteries as 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.830
 Many of you will know first of all how we handle 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.869
 phones, we use a device that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.519
 try to connect beyond the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.560
 bluetooth beyond wifi and beyond 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.470
 of the nfc and beyond a thousand types of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.989
 connections other than a mobile network and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.090
 the battery life is very very very 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.070
 very very influenced and very very little taken 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.750
 account normally with the connection and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.480
 with the coverage that we usually have in 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.789
 our phone is to say if a phone 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.770
 mobile has good coverage will spend 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.390
 a lot less battery than if you have to 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.610
 be connecting continuously and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.770
 looking for the right networks to be able 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.660
 always be aware of receiving or 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.579
 make a call so with this 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.010
 application that I'm going to show you today that 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.840
 will be in the description of the video as 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.840
 always and it's free that's called intel 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.760
 and 3g are you going to be able to manage an aspect and 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.140
 I already tell you, it is extremely important that 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.720
 taking 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.010
 and little finds normally and that we 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.320
 it's going to be really useful 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.030
 this application as you already know and as 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.860
 you have seen in the title you need to 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.390
 the modules expos the same ones that already 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.159
 teach in the past video and if not 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.659
 you know what video I'm talking about because I'll leave it 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.490
 down here in the description is worth how 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.930
 install the frameworks of the module is 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.880
 post so well this application 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.200
 basically it is divided into a series of 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.150
 sections that we will go seeing little to 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.619
 little and I'll show you how you should 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.940
 configure the application so that 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.860
 really so I can fulfill its function 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.900
 correctly first of all 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.880
 normally it will be disabled so 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.369
 Now let's activate this service that 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.680
 it comes from here we activate it and point well 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.600
 in the whole module first then 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.880
 we have to tell the application that 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.649
 we want it to be configured so that 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.630
 connect to network is as fast as possible 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.580
 or to connect to the network is the most 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.990
 slow possible this usually goes to 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.759
 be depending on the use we are going to 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.590
 give our phone is to say if we go 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.690
 to want to use the phone to the fullest 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.890
 so that I can give my best in a 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.330
 moment when we need it 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.220
 let's put it to connect to 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.710
 fast networks and not only that but 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.429
 let's say what are the networks that 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.250
 we want to establish either in a way 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.930
 Battery saving and in quick mode 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.170
 for example here in the first option 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.600
 asks us what network we want to be the one 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.670
 which is going to connect when we want 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.760
 save battery here you have for example 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.310
 only 3g only 2 g only 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.380
 a network that is similar to 3g so that 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.330
 go changing between 3g and 2g this is a 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.250
 little understand each type of denomination 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.950
 here for example it would be a network that already 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.810
 would include the 4g and here would be changing 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.670
 then by different bands depending on 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.110
 the coverage that we have but I so 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.640
 I usually put it on so that when 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.200
 I want me to save and battery the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.180
 phone that is now I will show you in 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.920
 what determined conditions do you connect 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.060
 either the 3g or 2g so that 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.280
 have to be conditioned only 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.470
 to a network type but go to the one 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.600
 it seems better to you according to the coverage that 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.860
 have in that place and here for the 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.560
 fast connection 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.030
 this is to add the maximum the maximum 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.370
 capacity of networks that can be 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.930
 connect our phone in my case lte 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.660
 that would be 4 g which is the one that you are 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.280
 seeing here right now when when 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.630
 has the best possible coverage and 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.090
 when I so require with the 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.739
 conditions that I want to show so 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.160
 you have already seen in my case it would be for 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.200
 save battery 203 g depending on and for 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.390
 maximum speed because all the possible 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.880
 ascending to the maximum that would be 4 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.650
 here is the service we can tell ya 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.540
 activate it disable it but let's go to 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.550
 the options that is one of the most 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.200
 interesting how are you seeing this 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.490
 icon that appears here continuously 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.530
 it's something that I do not like 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.910
 of everything that today appears an icon that 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.710
 Well maybe we can occupy the space 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.990
 of notifications so if you want 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.400
 eliminate it will give you less priority and 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.260
 less importance in the background the 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.700
 application but it will not appear and 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.260
 simply because you can eliminate the 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.360
 icon here but it will still appear 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.580
 in the notifications this is your 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.530
 taste here you see a couple of options more 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.570
 like for example start it when it 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.280
 turn on the phone this yes clear and 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.990
 here some other options that we do not go 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.790
 to play let's go to the interesting 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.380
 which are the options according to 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.420
 conditions when we want it to be 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.620
 activate one or another type of network what is it 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.530
 that will save us the battery 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.230
 for example we are in the option of 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.840
 battery saving this is how we want 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.150
 about what conditions we want 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.920
 when we turn on we turn off the screen 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.420
 a type of network is changed or not 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.100
 example I like since when the 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.230
 screen what when you have the 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.180
 blocked phone and have passed more than 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.580
 five minutes here I can establish 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.259
 5 minutes is usually because I do not know if 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.639
 we block the screen but at 2 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.259
 minutes we turn it on again because 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.539
 we received an email or a message 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.490
 it has not been passed to another type of 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.199
 connection but it remains at the maximum 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.550
 speed like who says and there's no 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.870
 any problems so I have 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.539
 since whenever the screen is 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.280
 Lock and spend more than 5 minutes pass 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.500
 to the battery saving connection is 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.360
 saying this is generally oriented 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.449
 for all those people that you have 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.340
 4g connection as you know the 4 gigas is 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.990
 an awful lot of battery and is not 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.000
 It is necessary that the phone is always 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.620
 connected to 4g even when we have the 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.630
 blocked screen and we 're not 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.310
 requiring that fast connection 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.199
 then this application what it does is 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.970
 detect that more than 5 minutes have passed 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.280
 with the screen locked and go to a 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.199
 connection that would be 2g or 3g according to more 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.789
 convenient to save the battery and os 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.949
 I can assure you it is very noticeable 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.139
 here you have a couple of options more then 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.910
 for example here amount of coverage 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.770
 I want to be connected to a good network 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.210
 that is if I have for example four 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.220
 coverage stripes that would be the most 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.930
 Well, I do not care if I want to save 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.599
 batteries but you could already connect 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.550
 to a better connection and here you have for 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.540
 example when the wifi is connected 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.030
 so the 3g 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.070
 would activate and a couple more options 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.660
 well this has been for the conditions 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.730
 of battery saving but let's go to 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.130
 the conditions of maximum speed 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.650
 when we want the phone to everything 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.630
 as much as possible and what 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.010
 we need as such for example when 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.240
 the screen lights up just like 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.160
 we had configured that when the 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.780
 screen goes off it goes to a connection 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.890
 Battery saving when the screen 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.810
 it lights up what I want is that the 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.970
 phone is as available as possible 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.830
 and with the best connection you can 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.300
 arrange then when the screen is 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.830
 ignitions is connected to the maximum 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.360
 speed that I have configured and that 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.710
 I have already shown you but you can also 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.720
 do with a couple of bad options for 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.250
 example I can choose that if I open some 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.230
 particular application of all those 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.840
 I have installed that I know internet by 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.430
 example because it connects me to 4g or 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.520
 when the charger is connected that in 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.840
 this case would have connection and it would have 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.250
 directly the battery charging is 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.810
 say I do not have to worry about saving 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.180
 of battery because you can connect me to the 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.830
 more convenient connection so good 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.600
 that has basically been all for this 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.250
 application as you see is a very 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.950
 interesting is a concept that you have 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.960
 little in mind and that influences in a 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.670
 determinant sometimes in the duration 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.139
 of your phone's battery 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.780
 everything I already tell you for all those 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.789
 you have 4g and you want to give much more
