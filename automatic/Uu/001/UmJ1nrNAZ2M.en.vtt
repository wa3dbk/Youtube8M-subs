would<00:02:06.750> never<00:02:06.929> have<00:02:07.140> thought<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.619> that's

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
would never have thought of that that's

would never have thought of that that's
right<00:02:08.550> he's<00:02:08.729> probably<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.179> only<00:02:09.300> person<00:02:09.720> who

right he's probably the only person who
could<00:02:10.590> shoot<00:02:10.950> an<00:02:11.100> arrow<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.730> hit<00:02:12.360> Superman

his ass even being hit with a kryptonite
I<00:02:33.800> know<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.160> chances<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.670> he's<00:02:35.060> gonna<00:02:35.209> have

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
I know the chances that he's gonna have

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.210 
I know the chances that he's gonna have
any<00:02:35.720> kryptonite<00:02:35.930> kryptonite<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:36.770> like<00:02:37.010> you

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
any kryptonite kryptonite is like you

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.670 
any kryptonite kryptonite is like you
know<00:02:37.250> more<00:02:37.880> elusive<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.480> get<00:02:38.690> than<00:02:38.930> Pluto<00:02:39.500> no

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
know more elusive to get than Pluto no

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.500 
know more elusive to get than Pluto no
but<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:39.980> we're<00:02:40.280> just<00:02:40.459> assuming<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.480> were

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
but you we're just assuming you were

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.320 
but you we're just assuming you were
assuming<00:02:42.230> he<00:02:42.410> had<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.709> kryptonite<00:02:43.340> arrow<00:02:43.610> now

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
assuming he had a kryptonite arrow now

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.080 
assuming he had a kryptonite arrow now
you're<00:02:44.690> going<00:02:45.260> against<00:02:45.890> your<00:02:46.100> own<00:02:46.250> opinion<00:02:46.880> no

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
you're going against your own opinion no

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.140 
you're going against your own opinion no
no<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.569> was<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:48.050> was<00:02:48.140> theorized<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.100> if<00:02:49.459> he<00:02:49.790> had

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
no I was I was theorized that if he had

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.390 
no I was I was theorized that if he had
one<00:02:50.420> he'd<00:02:50.750> have<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.959> chance<00:02:51.590> well<00:02:51.980> he<00:02:52.130> could

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
one he'd have a chance well he could

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.280 
one he'd have a chance well he could
have<00:02:52.430> one<00:02:52.880> yeah<00:02:53.540> well<00:02:53.810> but<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.110> thing<00:02:54.260> is

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
have one yeah well but the thing is

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.360 
have one yeah well but the thing is
there's<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.709> lot<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:54.890> people<00:02:55.220> who<00:02:55.340> have

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
there's a lot of people who have

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.860 
there's a lot of people who have
kryptonite<00:02:56.030> they<00:02:56.150> still<00:02:56.360> fail<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.600> beat

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
kryptonite they still fail to beat

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.690 
kryptonite they still fail to beat
Superman<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:58.100> know<00:02:58.160> they<00:02:58.370> don't<00:02:58.580> have

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
Superman you know they don't have

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.060 
Superman you know they don't have
kryptonite<00:02:59.239> arrows<00:02:59.720> like<00:03:00.110> green<00:03:00.440> arrow<00:03:00.680> why

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
kryptonite arrows like green arrow why

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.949 
kryptonite arrows like green arrow why
are<00:03:01.130> you<00:03:01.280> all<00:03:01.519> of<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.760> sudden<00:03:02.180> I'm<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.360> big<00:03:02.690> green

are you all of a sudden I'm a big green
arrow<00:03:03.230> failure<00:03:04.010> extent<00:03:04.640> you're<00:03:04.850> being

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
arrow failure extent you're being

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.809 
arrow failure extent you're being
difficult<00:03:05.269> yes<00:03:06.019> I<00:03:06.350> tend<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:06.950> okay<00:03:07.489> that's

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
difficult yes I tend to okay that's

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.940 
difficult yes I tend to okay that's
weird<00:03:08.090> what<00:03:08.390> we<00:03:08.630> were<00:03:08.810> gonna<00:03:08.900> agree<00:03:09.260> here<00:03:09.650> that

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
weird what we were gonna agree here that

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.530 
weird what we were gonna agree here that
Superman<00:03:10.430> would<00:03:10.640> win<00:03:10.790> that's<00:03:11.090> what<00:03:11.239> we<00:03:11.360> were

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
Superman would win that's what we were

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.410 
Superman would win that's what we were
doing<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.900> was<00:03:12.290> gonna<00:03:12.830> say<00:03:13.090> there's<00:03:14.090> not<00:03:14.390> even

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
doing I was gonna say there's not even

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.259 
doing I was gonna say there's not even
any<00:03:14.900> contest<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.950> course<00:03:16.250> Superman<00:03:16.819> would<00:03:17.030> win

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
any contest of course Superman would win

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.690 
any contest of course Superman would win
but<00:03:17.600> you<00:03:18.970> cleverly<00:03:20.500> brilliantly<00:03:21.500> came<00:03:22.400> up

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
but you cleverly brilliantly came up

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.470 
but you cleverly brilliantly came up
with<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.120> idea<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.989> green<00:03:24.680> arrow<00:03:25.329> having<00:03:26.329> a

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
with the idea of green arrow having a

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.949 
with the idea of green arrow having a
kryptonite<00:03:27.410> arrow<00:03:27.970> that<00:03:28.970> never<00:03:29.329> occurred<00:03:29.480> to

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
kryptonite arrow that never occurred to

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.520 
kryptonite arrow that never occurred to
me<00:03:30.410> then<00:03:31.100> Superman<00:03:31.790> becomes<00:03:32.420> Clark<00:03:32.840> Kent<00:03:33.170> so

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
me then Superman becomes Clark Kent so

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.039 
me then Superman becomes Clark Kent so
to<00:03:33.590> speak<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.220> he<00:03:35.180> can<00:03:35.390> beat<00:03:35.570> him<00:03:35.750> he<00:03:35.900> could

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
to speak and he can beat him he could

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.600 
to speak and he can beat him he could
shoot<00:03:36.260> another<00:03:36.530> arrow<00:03:36.680> at<00:03:37.190> him<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.430> maybe

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
shoot another arrow at him and maybe

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.960 
shoot another arrow at him and maybe
kill<00:03:37.940> him<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.360> go<00:03:38.930> with<00:03:39.110> green<00:03:39.410> arrow<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:40.040> go<00:03:40.820> with

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
kill him I go with green arrow I go with

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.030 
kill him I go with green arrow I go with
Superman<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.690> I<00:03:42.019> go<00:03:42.230> with<00:03:42.380> green<00:03:42.620> arrow<00:03:42.860> a
