the easiest and safest way to do this is

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.609 
the easiest and safest way to do this is
to<00:01:50.880> measure<00:01:51.090> your<00:01:51.240> catheter<00:01:51.810> tip<00:01:52.020> against<00:01:52.500> an

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
to measure your catheter tip against an

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.469 
to measure your catheter tip against an
extra<00:01:53.040> trach<00:01:53.280> tube<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> same<00:01:54.180> size

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
extra trach tube that is the same size

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.749 
extra trach tube that is the same size
as<00:01:54.689> your<00:01:54.810> child's<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.920> tip<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> suction

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
as your child's the tip of the suction

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.219 
as your child's the tip of the suction
catheter<00:01:57.210> should<00:01:57.240> go<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> end<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
catheter should go to the end of the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.920 
catheter should go to the end of the
trach<00:01:58.469> tube<00:01:58.710> or<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.520> slightly<00:01:59.790> past<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.420> so

trach tube or just slightly past it so
if<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.259> get<00:02:01.380> an<00:02:01.500> extra<00:02:01.680> trach<00:02:02.100> tube<00:02:02.340> try

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:12.949 
which can lead to an increased need for

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:15.159 
which can lead to an increased need for
suctioning<00:07:13.610> once<00:07:14.329> you<00:07:14.509> get<00:07:14.719> to<00:07:14.869> know<00:07:15.019> your

child suctioning needs it will be much

child suctioning needs it will be much
easier<00:07:17.360> to<00:07:17.719> determine<00:07:18.199> when<00:07:18.529> an<00:07:18.649> infection

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:19.009 
easier to determine when an infection

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:21.100 
easier to determine when an infection
starts<00:07:19.579> because<00:07:20.209> you<00:07:20.329> will<00:07:20.449> notice<00:07:20.659> that<00:07:20.809> you

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110 
starts because you will notice that you

starts because you will notice that you

cough out secretions and will most
