00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.230
 colom to all that church is safe 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.680
 we are in a new video of gta 5 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.110
 online I teach you in a trick how 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.089
 enter the house of lester is worth it 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.679
 we know we can enter the 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.450
 trevor lab in the house of 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.150
 frank in the class of michael then good 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.750
 now it's the turn of aa 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.180
 lester is worth so good here we have 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.030
 The exact location of your house is worth 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.070
 if we do not remember the campaign mode and 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.770
 good as you know here everything here I have 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.199
 electrically stored all sheltered 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.510
 here in not happening it's worth that I 'm not 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.249
 hacker or anything as good is very 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.659
 simple a bit very simple and you have 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:43.980
 to do it exactly as I do 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:46.170
 just in case it's not going to come out okay and it's good 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.960
 a curiosity trick is not a trick 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.170
 that serves as much just to see 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.039
 how is from inside in the online 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.839
 simply to enter on line in the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.780
 that we went up here for this this 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.639
 success as you said and here very 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.159
 you have to do it like I do 

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:04.829
 I do it at the beginning it gave me a little 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.230
 because it did not work out in the two 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.030
 Sometimes he did not leave me but as well 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.070
 the trick and good we have to be 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.720
 looking at those two palm trees that are 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.630
 opposite our voucher and be 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.610
 exactly in that direction 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.890
 I gave it to the I, I am unintentional and 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.630
 I say ostia I shit on everything but well no 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.350
 it will happen simply you have to stay 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.730
 looking at those palm trees like I'm going 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.080
 to do here here right there there good there 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.430
 it's fine power or what we have to 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.500
 to do is go to the list of activities 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.860
 accept a mission is worth when we are 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.660
 well exactly positioned and we left 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.880
 and when we go out as you are seeing 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.760
 here we are already inside the house of 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.190
 this in the online gta good the truth 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.350
 that is very cool the trick is very 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.480
 curious and good is exactly the same 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.890
 the east is not in the house obviously is 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.320
 that if it is already the letter of the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.850
 history and good as you see everything perfect 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.130
 like in the campaign mode here I shot 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.960
 this because he wanted me to be something of the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.000
 I know gas that was going to float and good as 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.250
 we see here a poster that they put vine wood 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.810
 zombie that we saw in the campaign 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.820
 but I do not know to me I have the thorn in 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.470
 that can that mean something 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.910
 they're going to do something with the zombies 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.750
 how they made red dead redemption of 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.580
 rockstar 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.850
 let's hope so, because it can be 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.470
 very cool in zombie mode in gta 5 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.990
 good as 6 well 2 exactly the same 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.360
 all dolls that had the 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.800
 collecting all computers and 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.390
 good from here because it manages all 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.230
 our missions from online and in the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.830
 campaign mode and good but here you have the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.840
 trick 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.220
 this is to enter to leave 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.080
 simply suicidal and there is no 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.060
 trick to leave simply because 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.380
 committing suicide or taking a pill or 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.330
 hit and a bullet 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.330
 that simple, well, I hope there is 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.760
 liked the video a video so curious the 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.739
 I really liked that I do not know I do not know if 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.820
 you tell me in the comments like this 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.739
 I hope you liked a 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.510
 like favorite and a lot and see you 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:03.999
 the next goodbye 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:03.999
