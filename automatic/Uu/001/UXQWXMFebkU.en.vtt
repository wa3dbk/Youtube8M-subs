00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.440
 Y 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.610
 very well is already ready mariano irrigation 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.530
 rivapalacio how are mariano ahead 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.470
 very good javier thanks very good 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.759
 nights all is not enough 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.770
 contract life or expense insurance 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.680
 older doctors say specialists 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.529
 that now save a baby tooth from 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.580
 children who are adopted in special 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.279
 guarantees future that they do not suffer for 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.609
 burns accidents or diseases and 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.609
 here history 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.780
 this baby tooth is the best insurance 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.750
 of life that a child can have because 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.340
 of this piece comes a quantity 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.920
 considerable amount of stem cells that in a 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.940
 future could serve as treatment 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.250
 doctor 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.350
 even save your life when you 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.050
 you start the first cells in 3 in 3 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.640
 with 400 500 in the mothers that you find 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.760
 a pulp and by day you already have 800 1800 te 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.160
 you go to 1600 gmt it is exponential the 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.170
 teeth contain stem cells that are 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.990
 can preserve for the future as a 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.840
 biological insurance especially for parents 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.570
 who adopt their children because they do not 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.090
 share a genetic line saving 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.310
 the cells of the small means 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.310
 that when they need them by accident 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.950
 burn or disease these will serve 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.880
 for different treatments the dads 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.930
 they are adopting they have a commitment 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.840
 impressive or between 6 and 12 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.479
 2010 years is but if for some milk 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.460
 reason for example the orthodontist or 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.900
 dentist in visit removes premolars by 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.750
 Some reason 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.720
 of the trial are excellent means to 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.910
 to grow cells, this woman wins 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.580
 he considered it for his daughter who was 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.070
 adopted four years ago when one of 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.900
 his milk teeth fell off instead 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.780
 put it on the pillow for the mouse 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.750
 was taken to a stem cell bank 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.990
 in that place they are already reproducing 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.599
 it takes my genes I do not biological daughter 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.270
 I am interested in your health in the future because 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.849
 besides I do not know your history no no 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.270
 I was interested in meeting him and she did not 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.970
 know then I do not know what diseases 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.550
 can you have you are not you made me 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.650
 a great option the children who are 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.510
 adopted have now the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.550
 opportunity to use the cells of 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.250
 your own body for futures 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.340
 treatments especially in the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.200
 attenuation of inflammation by wounds 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.420
 tissue regeneration and to inhibit 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.760
 scar formation in the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.330
 laboratory where we are sending 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.680
 us being us has a quality 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.590
 impressive because it is regulated by 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.590
 the fd and once they have between 2 and 3 - 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.350
 of cells these are separated and these 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.660
 freeze at 196 degrees feel at the low 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.640
 zero liquid hydrogen is made 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.560
 different studies worldwide have 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.319
 proven that stem cells 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.840
 teeth accelerates the healing of 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.370
 Cutaneous wounds in humans was proved 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.900
 that burn injuries have 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.390
 positive results 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.760
 from the fourth day of a transplant 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.090
 you hire a plan for certain years I 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.519
 I contracted a long plan of 11 years you can 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.319
 go renewing follow nothing else tell you if 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.209
 it was possible to extract the cells not 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.720
 they could extract in this case if they 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.609
 they were able to extract currently they are 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.459
 developing medical therapies with 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.530
 mesenchymal stem cells even for 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.950
 regenerate tissues that make up the breast 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.069
 so give them more security and self-esteem 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.670
 to women survivors of the struggle 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.670
 against cancer 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.420
 very interesting javier because the 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.220
 cells that are extracted from a tooth to 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.100
 the six or seven years of age of a child 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.230
 for example, they are preserved for years if 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.090
 the person requires it at 30 or 40 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.160
 years of age the cells that are 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.350
 preserved they stay young like 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.720
 when they were removed when they were 6 or 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.940
 7 years old awesome and here the 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.980
 pulse tonight as always very 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.970
 interesting very useful mariano thanks 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.970
 good night
