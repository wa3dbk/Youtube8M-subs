was staying in motels but soon decided
that<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.420> was<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:06.900> as<00:01:07.290> often<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.740> I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that if I was to do this as often as I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.440 
that if I was to do this as often as I
planned<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.430> would<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.670> very<00:01:08.850> expensive

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
provided at each race I decided that

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.560
