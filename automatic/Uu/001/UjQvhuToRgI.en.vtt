00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
why is a big difference we're workin

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.680 
why is a big difference we're workin
block<00:00:46.860> death<00:00:47.370> can't<00:00:47.640> block<00:00:47.850> he<00:00:48.030> dodges<00:00:48.480> stuff

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
block death can't block he dodges stuff

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.150 
block death can't block he dodges stuff
he's<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> lot<00:00:49.110> more<00:00:49.140> nimble<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.800> has<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> lot

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
he's a lot more nimble and has a lot

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.000 
he's a lot more nimble and has a lot
more<00:00:50.340> fast<00:00:50.879> moves<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.600> warded<00:00:51.930> yeah<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> think

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
more fast moves and warded yeah I think

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.540 
more fast moves and warded yeah I think
