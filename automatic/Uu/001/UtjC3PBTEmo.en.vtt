could do it on free mode you can do it

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.290 
could do it on free mode you can do it
on<00:00:09.510> online<00:00:09.750> hacking<00:00:10.349> one<00:00:10.679> on<00:00:10.860> one<00:00:11.099> but<00:00:11.910> uh<00:00:11.969> yeah

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
on online hacking one on one but uh yeah

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.959 
on online hacking one on one but uh yeah
let's<00:00:12.570> get<00:00:12.809> into<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.170> what<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.099> want<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.519> is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
to do is look out for these hexagon

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.229 
to do is look out for these hexagon
windows<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.860> see<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> hexagon<00:00:38.640> window<00:00:38.969> like

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
windows if you see a hexagon window like

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.750 
windows if you see a hexagon window like
that<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.719> should<00:00:39.930> probably<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:41.340> probably

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that you should probably you probably

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.930 
that you should probably you probably
could<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.390> into<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:44.190> they<00:00:44.399> all<00:00:44.550> around

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
could get into it and they all around

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.200 
could get into it and they all around
them<00:00:45.090> out<00:00:46.190> so<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.430> want<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.940> jump

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
them out so what you want to do is jump

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.439 
them out so what you want to do is jump
up<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.570> there<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.739> then<00:00:50.280> hold<00:00:51.000> your<00:00:51.180> sprint

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
up on there and then hold your sprint

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.360 
up on there and then hold your sprint
button<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.930> keep<00:00:52.110> spamming<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.649> climb

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
button and keep spamming the climb

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.240 
button and keep spamming the climb
button<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.989> should<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.440> able<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.739> jump<00:00:56.100> in

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
button and you should be able to jump in

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.080 
button and you should be able to jump in
there<00:00:57.140> pretty<00:00:58.140> simple<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.399> yeah<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.850> said

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
there pretty simple and yeah like I said

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.130 
there pretty simple and yeah like I said
there's<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.420> whole<00:01:00.539> bunch<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.930> these<00:01:01.079> around

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
there's a whole bunch of these around

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.439 
there's a whole bunch of these around
Parker<00:01:02.010> Square<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:02.730> yeah<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.270> this

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
Parker Square but yeah you can do this

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.490 
Parker Square but yeah you can do this
in<00:01:03.629> online<00:01:04.320> hacking<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.290> if<00:01:07.290> you

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
in online hacking one on one and if you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.750 
in online hacking one on one and if you
see<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> car<00:01:08.040> about<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.310> building<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:11.729> see

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
see a car about a building and you see

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.250 
see a car about a building and you see
they<00:01:12.060> messed<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> fence<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.020> grass

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
they messed up the fence the grass

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.620 
they messed up the fence the grass
whatever<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.640> know<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:14.909> asked<00:01:15.210> probably<00:01:15.390> in

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
whatever you know they asked probably in

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.230 
whatever you know they asked probably in
the<00:01:15.750> window<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.320> glitch<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.070> make<00:01:18.030> sure<00:01:18.060> you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the window to glitch so make sure you

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.020 
the window to glitch so make sure you
look<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.409> windows<00:01:19.890> you're<00:01:20.759> getting

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
look out to the windows you're getting

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.749 
look out to the windows you're getting
hacked<00:01:21.240> around<00:01:21.659> here<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.159> gotta<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.729> it

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
hacked around here and you gotta do it

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.020 
hacked around here and you gotta do it
to<00:01:24.240> somebody<00:01:24.479> while<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.200> here

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
to somebody while you in here

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.270 
to somebody while you in here
so<00:01:27.030> yeah<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:28.140> only<00:01:28.350> bad<00:01:28.560> thing<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:28.829> this

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
so yeah the only bad thing about this

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.749 
so yeah the only bad thing about this
thing<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:30.659> can't<00:01:31.009> well<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.189> can't<00:01:32.460> shoot

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
thing is you can't well you can't shoot

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.780 
thing is you can't well you can't shoot
out<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:33.930> shot<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
out but you can get shot in here and the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.429 
out but you can get shot in here and the
police<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.299> shoot<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.200> shot

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
police can shoot you you can get shot
