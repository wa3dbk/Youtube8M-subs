grooming<00:01:42.479> implement<00:01:43.110> controls<00:01:44.060> still

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
grooming implement controls still

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.880 
grooming implement controls still
functional<00:01:45.830> everything<00:01:46.830> works<00:01:47.069> here<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
functional everything works here and

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:57.850 
functional everything works here and
believe<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.100> radio<00:01:50.459> still<00:01:51.209> works<00:01:53.299> yep

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.400 

then<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> converter<00:01:59.369> is<00:02:00.149> there<00:02:00.709> there<00:02:01.709> is<00:02:01.860> a

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
then the converter is there there is a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.729 
then the converter is there there is a
computer<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.860> we<00:02:05.129> do<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.580> programming

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:06.739 
computer and we do have the programming

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.759 
computer and we do have the programming
component<00:02:07.739> that<00:02:07.950> goes<00:02:08.190> with<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.090> if<00:02:09.769> anybody

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
component that goes with this if anybody

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.890 
component that goes with this if anybody
ever<00:02:10.920> had<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.250> program<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.559 

Ricardo<00:02:16.900> seats<00:02:17.260> still<00:02:17.769> in<00:02:17.950> good<00:02:18.099> shape<00:02:18.569> we'll

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
Ricardo seats still in good shape we'll

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:30.240 
Ricardo seats still in good shape we'll
take<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.810> look<00:02:20.439> outside

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250
