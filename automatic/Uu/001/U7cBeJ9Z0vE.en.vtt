say before just I want to just make this
point<00:00:02.010> just<00:00:02.250> out<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.520> kind<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.990> point<00:00:03.990> of

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
point just out of kind of a point of

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.099 
point just out of kind of a point of
edification<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.920> guess<00:00:05.660> this<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.810> different

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
edification I guess this is a different

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.080 
edification I guess this is a different
game<00:00:07.200> than<00:00:07.290> normal<00:00:07.560> normally<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.670> Protoss

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
game than normal normally the Protoss

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.299 
game than normal normally the Protoss
you<00:00:09.510> know<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:09.719> say<00:00:10.139> oh<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.620> Protoss<00:00:10.980> wants<00:00:11.250> to

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
you know you say oh the Protoss wants to

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.100 
you know you say oh the Protoss wants to
be<00:00:11.370> one<00:00:11.490> expansion<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.120> or<00:00:12.330> at<00:00:12.540> least<00:00:12.750> over<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
be one expansion of or at least over the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.839 
be one expansion of or at least over the
Terran<00:00:13.410> but<00:00:13.920> see<00:00:14.070> that's<00:00:14.400> usually<00:00:14.820> because

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
Terran but see that's usually because

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.750 
Terran but see that's usually because
the<00:00:15.299> situation<00:00:15.480> where<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.590> Terran<00:00:17.130> there's

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the situation where the Terran there's

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.490 
the situation where the Terran there's
those<00:00:18.090> probes<00:00:18.420> they<00:00:18.600> actually<00:00:18.900> did<00:00:19.140> run<00:00:19.350> into

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
those probes they actually did run into

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.179 
those probes they actually did run into
their<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.100> some<00:00:20.789> vulture<00:00:21.600> death<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.920> they're

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
their to some vulture death and they're

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.380 
their to some vulture death and they're
going<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.369> get<00:00:23.490> almost<00:00:23.880> completely

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
going to get almost completely

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.640 
going to get almost completely
slaughtered<00:00:24.810> before<00:00:24.900> making<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
slaughtered before making it to the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.200 
slaughtered before making it to the
natural<00:00:25.980> expansion<00:00:26.250> look<00:00:26.580> at<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.760> yeah<00:00:26.939> he

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
natural expansion look at that yeah he

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.019 
natural expansion look at that yeah he
even<00:00:28.019> takes<00:00:28.590> some<00:00:28.800> hits<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.550> his<00:00:29.670> vulture

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
even takes some hits to his vulture

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.490 
even takes some hits to his vulture
assist<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.390> go<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.750> finish<00:00:30.990> off<00:00:31.260> those

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
assist to go in and finish off those

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.280 
assist to go in and finish off those
probes<00:00:31.920> finish<00:00:32.610> off<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.759> probe<00:00:33.120> line<00:00:33.329> so

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
probes finish off that probe line so

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.630 
probes finish off that probe line so
that's<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.620> little<00:00:34.680> bit<00:00:34.860> unlucky<00:00:35.040> but<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.340> think

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that's a little bit unlucky but I think

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.520 
that's a little bit unlucky but I think
Cal<00:00:35.910> has<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> Nexus<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.809> de<00:00:36.960> sperrit<00:00:37.380> right

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
Cal has the Nexus is de sperrit right

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.440 
Cal has the Nexus is de sperrit right
now<00:00:37.680> he's<00:00:37.890> got<00:00:38.070> 1<00:00:38.280> 2<00:00:38.309> 3<00:00:38.910> 4<00:00:39.570> 5<00:00:40.230> 6<00:00:40.670> nexuses<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.239> he

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
now he's got 1 2 3 4 5 6 nexuses so he

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.529 
now he's got 1 2 3 4 5 6 nexuses so he
can<00:00:42.600> replace<00:00:42.840> those<00:00:43.110> probes<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.649> about<00:00:44.539> 45

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
can replace those probes in about 45

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.500 
can replace those probes in about 45
seconds<00:00:46.730> so<00:00:47.730> he's<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.360> too<00:00:48.480> bad

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
seconds so he's not going to be too bad

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.630 
seconds so he's not going to be too bad
off<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.020> look<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.289> fantasy<00:00:49.710> forced<00:00:50.219> to

float his command center up to that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.350 
float his command center up to that

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.700 
but he has a lot of your goons no
actually<00:01:33.689> dragoons<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.350> gonna<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.530> able<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
actually dragoons are gonna be able to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.530 
actually dragoons are gonna be able to
push<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.220> get<00:01:35.850> close<00:01:36.060> enough<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.329> those

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
push in and get close enough to those

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.999 
push in and get close enough to those
tanks<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.960> don't<00:01:37.259> think<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> be

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
tanks I don't think this is going to be

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.770 
tanks I don't think this is going to be
the<00:01:38.130> killing<00:01:38.520> blow<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.909> again<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.750> said

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the killing blow but again like I said

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.560 
the killing blow but again like I said
Cal<00:01:40.200> he<00:01:40.470> likes<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.979> trade<00:01:41.250> armies<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.909> keep

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
Cal he likes to trade armies and keep

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.780 
Cal he likes to trade armies and keep
the<00:01:42.720> turn<00:01:42.979> bottle<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.100> their<00:01:44.250> base<00:01:44.369> keep<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the turn bottle in their base keep the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.190 
the turn bottle in their base keep the
pressure<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:45.540> exactly<00:01:45.750> what's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
pressure on and that's exactly what's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.350 
pressure on and that's exactly what's
doing<00:01:46.439> right<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:46.680> he<00:01:47.100> lost<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.820> lot<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.030> horses

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
doing right now he lost a lot of horses

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.270 
doing right now he lost a lot of horses
be<00:01:48.570> has<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.960> much<00:01:49.110> macro<00:01:49.649> going<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.100> right<00:01:50.250> now

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
be has so much macro going on right now

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.399 
be has so much macro going on right now
that<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.670> does<00:01:50.850> not<00:01:51.000> matter<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.450> him<00:01:51.509> he<00:01:52.259> can

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
that it does not matter to him he can

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.280 
that it does not matter to him he can
rimac<00:01:52.799> rope<00:01:53.009> his<00:01:53.189> forces<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:53.880> easily

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
rimac rope his forces really easily

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.109 
rimac rope his forces really easily
fantasy<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.320> only<00:01:55.890> mining<00:01:56.340> from<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.700> think<00:01:56.969> his

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
fantasy is only mining from I think his

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.330 
fantasy is only mining from I think his
gas<00:01:57.360> expansion<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.649> now<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.040> new

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
gas expansion and is and now this new

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.639 
gas expansion and is and now this new
expansion<00:02:00.210> at<00:02:00.659> nine<00:02:00.840> o'clock<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.320> he's<00:02:01.439> going

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
expansion at nine o'clock and he's going

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.899 
expansion at nine o'clock and he's going
to<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.799> able<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.009> defend<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.430> for<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> minute

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
to be able to defend that for a minute

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.550 
to be able to defend that for a minute
here<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.270> looks<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:04.110> got<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.350> decent

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
here it looks like it's got a decent

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.780 
here it looks like it's got a decent
defense<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:05.100> out<00:02:05.189> he's<00:02:05.340> got<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.549> decent

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
defense going out he's got a decent

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.180 
defense going out he's got a decent
amount<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.149> Tanks<00:02:06.509> arbors<00:02:07.500> are<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.799> play<00:02:07.979> now<00:02:08.009> I

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
amount of Tanks arbors are in play now I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.650 
amount of Tanks arbors are in play now I
did<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:08.610> spot<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.970> arbiters<00:02:09.300> coming<00:02:09.569> out

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
did not spot the arbiters coming out

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.720 
did not spot the arbiters coming out
before<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.200> there<00:02:10.860> are<00:02:10.950> Goliath<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.459> play<00:02:11.670> as

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
well glass

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.240 
well glass
decent<00:02:13.780> counter<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.200> go<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.590> arbors<00:02:15.010> because

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
decent counter to go to arbors because

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.640 
decent counter to go to arbors because
you<00:02:15.340> can<00:02:15.430> pick<00:02:15.610> them<00:02:15.760> off<00:02:15.940> but<00:02:16.690> not<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:17.409> good<00:02:17.500> an

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
you can pick them off but not as good an

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.380 
you can pick them off but not as good an
encounter<00:02:17.920> as<00:02:18.280> like<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.879> know<00:02:18.909> science

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
encounter as like you know science

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.030 
encounter as like you know science
vessels<00:02:19.659> that<00:02:19.720> can<00:02:19.900> run<00:02:20.019> up<00:02:20.140> an<00:02:20.260> EMP<00:02:20.620> them<00:02:20.799> that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
vessels that can run up an EMP them that

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.059 
vessels that can run up an EMP them that
smell<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.430> sort<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.700> thing<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.950> really

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
smell that sort of thing it's really

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.080 
smell that sort of thing it's really
what<00:02:24.280> he<00:02:24.340> needs<00:02:24.549> right<00:02:24.640> now<00:02:24.760> I'm<00:02:24.970> actually

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
what he needs right now I'm actually

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.309 
what he needs right now I'm actually
surprised<00:02:25.569> we<00:02:25.720> haven't<00:02:25.870> seen<00:02:26.049> science

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
surprised we haven't seen science

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.960 
surprised we haven't seen science
whistles<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.709> guess<00:02:26.860> he<00:02:26.950> hasn't<00:02:27.099> had<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.459> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
whistles I guess he hasn't had that the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.479 
whistles I guess he hasn't had that the
money<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.450> spare<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.590> build<00:02:29.799> science<00:02:30.160> vessels

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
money to spare to build science vessels

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.920 
money to spare to build science vessels
all<00:02:30.940> right<00:02:31.060> let<00:02:31.209> me<00:02:31.239> try<00:02:31.299> and<00:02:31.450> make<00:02:31.629> this<00:02:31.750> point

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
all right let me try and make this point

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.930 
all right let me try and make this point
again<00:02:32.140> real<00:02:32.319> quick<00:02:32.349> basically<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.580> Terran

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
again real quick basically the Terran

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.789 
again real quick basically the Terran
usually<00:02:34.239> turtles<00:02:34.599> in<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:34.989> that's<00:02:35.590> why<00:02:35.739> the

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
usually turtles in and that's why the

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.680 
usually turtles in and that's why the
Protoss<00:02:36.190> gets<00:02:36.670> ahead<00:02:36.970> an<00:02:37.090> expansion<00:02:37.510> ahead

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
Protoss gets ahead an expansion ahead

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.350 
Protoss gets ahead an expansion ahead
because<00:02:37.870> they<00:02:38.230> want<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.650> have<00:02:39.400> superior<00:02:40.000> macro

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
because they want to have superior macro

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.940 
because they want to have superior macro
if<00:02:40.540> someone's<00:02:40.870> playing<00:02:41.170> defensively<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.799> got

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
if someone's playing defensively you got

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.559 
if someone's playing defensively you got
to<00:02:42.069> expand<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:42.700> out<00:02:42.760> macro<00:02:43.060> them<00:02:43.209> in<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.390> long

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
to expand and out macro them in the long

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.509 
to expand and out macro them in the long
run<00:02:43.599> it's<00:02:44.200> usually<00:02:44.440> why<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.739> Protoss<00:02:45.159> has<00:02:45.370> so

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
run it's usually why the Protoss has so

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.119 
run it's usually why the Protoss has so
many<00:02:45.579> forces<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.840> many<00:02:46.989> base<00:02:47.170> has<00:02:47.440> more<00:02:47.769> bases

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
many forces so many base has more bases

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.890 
many forces so many base has more bases
in<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.310> term<00:02:48.489> but<00:02:48.700> because<00:02:49.120> they<00:02:49.840> do

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
in the term but because they do

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.809 
in the term but because they do
basically<00:02:50.349> like<00:02:50.620> trading<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.069> lot<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.340> forces

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
basically like trading a lot of forces

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.140 
basically like trading a lot of forces
that's<00:02:52.510> why<00:02:52.859> it<00:02:53.859> was<00:02:53.920> okay<00:02:54.340> for<00:02:54.370> Cal<00:02:54.849> that<00:02:54.879> he

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
that's why it was okay for Cal that he

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.270 
that's why it was okay for Cal that he
had<00:02:55.299> basically<00:02:55.750> an<00:02:55.900> even<00:02:56.140> expansion<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:56.739> even

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
had basically an even expansion is even

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.520 
had basically an even expansion is even
a<00:02:57.340> mountain<00:02:57.609> of<00:02:57.700> basis<00:02:58.120> because<00:02:58.379> they'd<00:02:59.379> been

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
a mountain of basis because they'd been

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.750 
a mountain of basis because they'd been

like<00:04:25.680> three<00:04:25.860> or<00:04:25.980> four<00:04:26.010> bases<00:04:26.490> mining<00:04:26.820> he's<00:04:27.480> got

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
like three or four bases mining he's got

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.960 
like three or four bases mining he's got
its<00:04:27.810> got<00:04:27.930> two<00:04:28.230> or<00:04:28.470> three<00:04:28.740> is<00:04:29.220> fourth<00:04:29.550> going<00:04:29.850> up

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
its got two or three is fourth going up

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.240 
its got two or three is fourth going up
it<00:04:30.120> looks<00:04:30.270> like<00:04:30.800> actually<00:04:31.800> not<00:04:31.950> going<00:04:32.070> up

anymore those vultures are going to shut

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.920 
anymore those vultures are going to shut

it down to a moment but um ya fantasy

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.870 
it down to a moment but um ya fantasy
only<00:04:37.260> has<00:04:37.380> that<00:04:37.560> one<00:04:37.800> base<00:04:38.040> money<00:04:38.310> is<00:04:38.580> trying

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
only has that one base money is trying

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.409 
only has that one base money is trying
to<00:04:38.940> get<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.090> second<00:04:39.450> one<00:04:39.540> up<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:41.310> is<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.910> gas

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
to get a second one up I it is a gas

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.510 
to get a second one up I it is a gas
expansion<00:04:42.840> I'm<00:04:43.020> gonna<00:04:43.139> call<00:04:43.350> kind<00:04:43.919> of<00:04:43.980> half<00:04:44.190> a

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
expansion I'm gonna call kind of half a

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.409 
expansion I'm gonna call kind of half a
nice<00:04:45.260> little<00:04:46.260> drop<00:04:47.130> there<00:04:47.430> when<00:04:47.790> I<00:04:47.820> say<00:04:48.030> nice<00:04:48.240> i

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
nice little drop there when I say nice i

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.940 
nice little drop there when I say nice i
mean<00:04:48.570> like<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.840> drop<00:04:49.080> was<00:04:49.290> a<00:04:49.350> nice<00:04:49.530> idea<00:04:49.710> but

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
mean like the drop was a nice idea but

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.200 
mean like the drop was a nice idea but
obviously<00:04:50.520> he<00:04:50.639> didn't<00:04:50.790> really<00:04:50.910> accomplish

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
obviously he didn't really accomplish

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.330 
obviously he didn't really accomplish
push<00:04:51.600> with<00:04:51.750> that<00:04:51.900> again<00:04:52.260> he's<00:04:53.010> really<00:04:53.160> not

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
push with that again he's really not

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.470 
push with that again he's really not
doing<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.639> lot<00:04:53.760> with<00:04:53.820> these<00:04:54.030> little<00:04:54.180> storm

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
doing a lot with these little storm

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.420 
doing a lot with these little storm
drops<00:04:54.750> but<00:04:55.230> what<00:04:55.590> he<00:04:55.680> also<00:04:55.830> is<00:04:56.100> doing<00:04:56.310> though

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
drops but what he also is doing though

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.409 
drops but what he also is doing though
is<00:04:56.460> he's<00:04:56.669> stopping<00:04:57.120> fantasy<00:04:57.540> from<00:04:57.720> mining

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
is he's stopping fantasy from mining

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.730 
is he's stopping fantasy from mining
which<00:05:00.419> is<00:05:00.690> critical<00:05:00.990> because<00:05:01.290> that's<00:05:01.590> like

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
which is critical because that's like

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.580 
which is critical because that's like
his<00:05:01.919> only<00:05:02.190> mining<00:05:02.520> base<00:05:02.669> right<00:05:02.940> now<00:05:03.230> so<00:05:04.230> yeah

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
his only mining base right now so yeah

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.590 
his only mining base right now so yeah
tanks<00:05:05.220> coming<00:05:05.400> in<00:05:05.550> here<00:05:05.730> and<00:05:05.850> finish<00:05:06.270> off<00:05:06.480> the

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
tanks coming in here and finish off the

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.940 
tanks coming in here and finish off the
Templar<00:05:06.930> with<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.260> Templars<00:05:07.590> no<00:05:07.740> longer

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
Templar with the Templars no longer

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.380 
Templar with the Templars no longer
there<00:05:08.070> here<00:05:08.250> comes<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.640> arbiter<00:05:09.000> coming<00:05:09.270> in

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
there here comes the arbiter coming in

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.930 
there here comes the arbiter coming in
oh<00:05:09.540> he<00:05:09.990> is<00:05:10.169> mining<00:05:10.530> it<00:05:10.620> as<00:05:10.710> gas<00:05:11.400> only<00:05:11.610> but<00:05:11.820> it's

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
oh he is mining it as gas only but it's

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.280 
oh he is mining it as gas only but it's
almost<00:05:12.120> dead<00:05:12.419> as<00:05:12.570> what<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:12.750> was<00:05:12.840> going<00:05:12.930> to<00:05:13.020> say

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
almost dead as what I was going to say

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.440 
almost dead as what I was going to say
what<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:13.890> thought<00:05:14.190> and<00:05:14.460> here<00:05:14.880> it<00:05:14.970> comes<00:05:15.150> in<00:05:15.300> with

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
what I thought and here it comes in with

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.150 
what I thought and here it comes in with
a<00:05:15.480> recall<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:16.230> don't<00:05:16.710> know<00:05:16.770> if<00:05:16.830> he's<00:05:16.919> going<00:05:17.070> to

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
a recall I don't know if he's going to

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.260 
a recall I don't know if he's going to
go<00:05:17.220> for<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.370> expansion<00:05:17.640> he<00:05:17.880> make<00:05:18.030> over<00:05:18.240> the

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
go for the expansion he make over the

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.030 
go for the expansion he make over the
factories<00:05:18.840> he<00:05:19.320> make<00:05:19.470> over<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.680> factories

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
factories he make over the factories

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.290 
factories he make over the factories
turret<00:05:20.340> is<00:05:20.430> there<00:05:20.610> he's<00:05:20.790> going<00:05:20.940> to<00:05:21.000> recall

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
turret is there he's going to recall

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.840 
turret is there he's going to recall
right<00:05:21.600> on<00:05:21.750> top<00:05:21.990> of<00:05:22.140> that<00:05:22.460> not<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.700> best

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
right on top of that not the best

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.360 
right on top of that not the best
location<00:05:24.510> to<00:05:24.540> do<00:05:25.200> a<00:05:25.229> recall<00:05:25.620> actually<00:05:26.070> I<00:05:26.130> think

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
location to do a recall actually I think

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.680 
location to do a recall actually I think
it<00:05:26.490> is<00:05:26.520> way<00:05:26.820> in<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.000> back<00:05:27.150> so<00:05:27.360> it's<00:05:27.510> gonna<00:05:27.600> be

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
it is way in the back so it's gonna be

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.930 
it is way in the back so it's gonna be
really<00:05:28.020> difficult<00:05:28.320> for<00:05:29.040> fantasy<00:05:29.729> to<00:05:29.790> his

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
really difficult for fantasy to his

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.250 
really difficult for fantasy to his
forces<00:05:30.300> back<00:05:30.479> there<00:05:30.660> but<00:05:30.750> he's<00:05:30.840> not<00:05:30.960> going<00:05:31.169> to

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
forces back there but he's not going to

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.810 
forces back there but he's not going to
do<00:05:31.470> a<00:05:31.500> lot<00:05:31.650> of<00:05:31.710> damage<00:05:31.979> there's<00:05:32.340> no<00:05:32.430> critical

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
do a lot of damage there's no critical

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.260 
do a lot of damage there's no critical
buildings<00:05:33.210> there<00:05:33.419> from<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.440> takeout<00:05:34.800> and

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
buildings there from the takeout and

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.250 
buildings there from the takeout and
fantasies<00:05:36.270> can<00:05:36.419> be<00:05:36.479> able<00:05:36.600> to<00:05:36.690> get<00:05:36.780> his<00:05:36.870> forces

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
fantasies can be able to get his forces

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.540 
fantasies can be able to get his forces
back<00:05:37.440> there<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:37.770> defend<00:05:37.890> this<00:05:38.220> pretty<00:05:38.490> easily

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
back there and defend this pretty easily

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.520 
back there and defend this pretty easily
I'm<00:05:39.300> not<00:05:39.479> sure<00:05:39.540> exactly<00:05:39.960> what<00:05:40.110> is<00:05:40.200> hoping<00:05:40.410> to

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
take out that armory that is a nice idea

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.830

of the armor armory armed robbery ARM

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:02.800 
of the armor armory armed robbery ARM
arm<00:06:58.280> arm<00:06:58.400> our<00:06:58.699> armory<00:07:00.340> anyway<00:07:01.660> what<00:07:02.660> was<00:07:02.720> I

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
arm arm our armory anyway what was I

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.350 
arm arm our armory anyway what was I
saying<00:07:02.840> yeah<00:07:03.620> so<00:07:03.919> he<00:07:04.190> killed<00:07:04.789> off<00:07:04.910> some<00:07:05.090> decent

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 
saying yeah so he killed off some decent

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.640 
saying yeah so he killed off some decent
buildings<00:07:05.630> in<00:07:05.690> the<00:07:05.780> back<00:07:05.930> there<00:07:06.110> but<00:07:06.229> but

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650 
buildings in the back there but but

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.749 
buildings in the back there but but
mostly<00:07:07.039> I<00:07:07.130> think<00:07:07.310> that<00:07:07.400> was<00:07:07.490> just<00:07:07.669> a

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 
mostly I think that was just a

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.460 
mostly I think that was just a
distraction<00:07:07.940> to<00:07:08.330> kill<00:07:08.539> off<00:07:08.660> that<00:07:08.810> line

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
distraction to kill off that line

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.200 
distraction to kill off that line
o'clock<00:07:09.740> expansion<00:07:10.250> it<00:07:10.340> looks<00:07:10.520> like<00:07:10.669> fantasy

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:25.570 
the Terran can just build up a ball of
tanks<00:07:24.500> and<00:07:24.590> they<00:07:24.710> could<00:07:24.860> just<00:07:25.009> move<00:07:25.160> out<00:07:25.370> and

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580 
tanks and they could just move out and

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.580 
tanks and they could just move out and
just<00:07:25.820> Bowl<00:07:26.120> everything<00:07:26.539> over<00:07:26.750> I<00:07:26.900> think<00:07:27.380> Cal

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590 
just Bowl everything over I think Cal

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.320 
just Bowl everything over I think Cal
has<00:07:27.770> too<00:07:28.009> much<00:07:28.130> macro<00:07:28.550> now<00:07:28.729> though<00:07:28.880> it's<00:07:29.120> just

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 
has too much macro now though it's just

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.420 
has too much macro now though it's just
a<00:07:29.449> matter<00:07:29.900> of<00:07:29.990> time<00:07:30.259> before<00:07:30.440> he<00:07:30.680> he<00:07:31.039> takes<00:07:31.310> out

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:31.430 
a matter of time before he he takes out

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.980 
a matter of time before he he takes out
this<00:07:31.580> force<00:07:31.759> it's<00:07:31.970> going<00:07:32.120> to<00:07:32.180> be<00:07:32.270> difficult<00:07:32.599> to

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:32.990 
this force it's going to be difficult to

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.659 
this force it's going to be difficult to
kill<00:07:33.169> this<00:07:33.289> Terran<00:07:33.560> force<00:07:33.800> but<00:07:34.310> again<00:07:34.520> I<00:07:34.550> think

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:34.669 
kill this Terran force but again I think

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:36.129 
kill this Terran force but again I think
it<00:07:34.910> is<00:07:34.940> just<00:07:35.240> a<00:07:35.330> matter<00:07:35.509> of<00:07:35.570> time<00:07:35.660> just<00:07:36.050> a

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:36.139 
it is just a matter of time just a

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:38.110 
it is just a matter of time just a
matter<00:07:36.289> of<00:07:36.349> throwing<00:07:36.650> macro<00:07:37.160> Adam<00:07:37.520> looks<00:07:37.970> like

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 
matter of throwing macro Adam looks like

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.029 
matter of throwing macro Adam looks like
he's<00:07:38.330> actually<00:07:38.570> got<00:07:38.870> a<00:07:38.900> little<00:07:39.139> drop<00:07:39.380> may<00:07:39.949> have

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 
he's actually got a little drop may have

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:41.710 
he's actually got a little drop may have
been<00:07:40.130> a<00:07:40.160> recall<00:07:40.400> it<00:07:40.669> may<00:07:40.820> have<00:07:40.910> been<00:07:41.030> just<00:07:41.599> a

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 
been a recall it may have been just a

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.089 
been a recall it may have been just a
shuttle<00:07:42.110> drop<00:07:42.260> or<00:07:42.380> something<00:07:42.590> like<00:07:42.680> that<00:07:42.770> puts

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:43.099 
shuttle drop or something like that puts

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:44.680 
shuttle drop or something like that puts
themselves<00:07:43.250> in<00:07:43.580> the<00:07:43.639> back<00:07:43.789> and<00:07:44.030> kill<00:07:44.539> off

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:44.690 
themselves in the back and kill off

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.960 
themselves in the back and kill off
another<00:07:44.930> couple<00:07:45.260> of<00:07:45.289> depots<00:07:45.710> and<00:07:46.460> that's

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:46.970 
another couple of depots and that's

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.339 
another couple of depots and that's
going<00:07:47.180> to<00:07:47.240> hurt<00:07:47.330> fantasy<00:07:47.780> even<00:07:47.960> more<00:07:48.169> I<00:07:48.199> wish

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:48.349 
going to hurt fantasy even more I wish

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:49.779 
going to hurt fantasy even more I wish
you<00:07:48.440> can<00:07:48.530> see<00:07:48.680> what<00:07:48.800> a<00:07:48.830> supply<00:07:49.190> was<00:07:49.430> right<00:07:49.639> now

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:49.789 
you can see what a supply was right now

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:52.330 
you can see what a supply was right now
but<00:07:50.330> um<00:07:50.620> yeah<00:07:51.620> this<00:07:51.770> is<00:07:51.919> only<00:07:52.070> a<00:07:52.159> matter<00:07:52.250> of

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:52.340 
but um yeah this is only a matter of

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.950 
but um yeah this is only a matter of
time<00:07:52.430> now<00:07:52.520> that<00:07:52.909> we<00:07:53.210> have<00:07:53.240> actually<00:07:53.690> seen<00:07:53.900> it

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 
time now that we have actually seen it

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.200 
time now that we have actually seen it
work<00:07:54.229> sometimes<00:07:54.710> where<00:07:54.949> the<00:07:55.400> Terran<00:07:55.760> it

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.210 
work sometimes where the Terran it

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.089 
work sometimes where the Terran it
basically<00:07:56.720> is<00:07:56.900> this<00:07:57.050> fantasy<00:07:57.260> is<00:07:57.500> last-ditch

00:07:58.089 --> 00:07:58.099 
basically is this fantasy is last-ditch

00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:01.960 
basically is this fantasy is last-ditch
effort<00:07:58.490> and<00:07:58.610> last<00:07:58.880> dish<00:07:59.150> push<00:07:59.449> he
