00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
one but since then I've definitely

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.940 
one but since then I've definitely
noticed<00:02:54.730> for<00:02:55.150> 12<00:02:55.450> 12<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.900> quality<00:02:56.470> formation

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
noticed for 12 12 is a quality formation

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.770 
noticed for 12 12 is a quality formation
and<00:02:57.100> it's<00:02:57.549> just<00:02:57.760> really<00:02:57.819> um<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:58.569> know<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.690> just

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
and it's just really um you know I just

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.300 
and it's just really um you know I just
haven't<00:02:59.140> been<00:02:59.170> updating<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.860> squad<00:03:00.069> enough

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
haven't been updating the squad enough

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.920 
haven't been updating the squad enough
so<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:00.670> definitely<00:03:01.060> think<00:03:01.420> you're<00:03:01.599> right<00:03:01.780> in

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
so I definitely think you're right in

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.509 
so I definitely think you're right in
that<00:03:01.989> sense<00:03:02.319> I<00:03:02.500> mean<00:03:02.530> there's<00:03:02.830> no<00:03:03.010> real<00:03:03.250> cam

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
that sense I mean there's no real cam

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.670 
that sense I mean there's no real cam
void<00:03:03.849> I<00:03:04.000> definitely<00:03:04.239> feel<00:03:04.480> as<00:03:04.630> though<00:03:04.780> Gaston

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
void I definitely feel as though Gaston

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.949 
void I definitely feel as though Gaston
Ramirez<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.310> from<00:03:06.549> me<00:03:06.670> definitely<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.450> natural

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
Ramirez is from me definitely a natural

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.289 
Ramirez is from me definitely a natural
center<00:03:08.230> attacking<00:03:08.620> midfielder<00:03:09.069> so<00:03:09.310> he<00:03:09.970> fits

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
center attacking midfielder so he fits

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.660 
center attacking midfielder so he fits
perfectly<00:03:10.720> in<00:03:10.870> there<00:03:11.049> my<00:03:11.920> only<00:03:12.130> real<00:03:12.400> concern

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
perfectly in there my only real concern

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.789 
perfectly in there my only real concern
like<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.330> said<00:03:13.599> towards<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.049> end<00:03:14.200> there<00:03:14.260> was

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
like you said towards the end there was

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.470 
like you said towards the end there was
aware<00:03:15.250> do<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.459> where<00:03:15.640> will<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.880> potential

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
aware do the where will the potential

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.000 
aware do the where will the potential
players<00:03:16.720> play<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.080> know<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.319> got<00:03:17.530> Meyer<00:03:17.739> who

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
players play you know you got Meyer who

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.039 
players play you know you got Meyer who
can<00:03:18.160> come<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:18.430> as<00:03:18.549> a<00:03:18.579> substitute<00:03:19.049> Schneiderlin

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
can come on as a substitute Schneiderlin

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.509 
can come on as a substitute Schneiderlin
who<00:03:20.140> can<00:03:20.320> play<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.680> defensive<00:03:21.160> midfield

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
who can play that defensive midfield

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.190 
who can play that defensive midfield
role<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:22.030> it's<00:03:22.239> going<00:03:22.329> to<00:03:22.390> be<00:03:22.510> interesting<00:03:22.840> to

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
role and it's going to be interesting to

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.259 
role and it's going to be interesting to
see<00:03:23.380> how<00:03:23.590> one<00:03:23.829> Yama<00:03:24.070> plays<00:03:24.430> in<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.760> defensive

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
see how one Yama plays in a defensive

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.000 
see how one Yama plays in a defensive
midfielder<00:03:25.420> role<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:25.989> said<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.709> know<00:03:26.799> he's

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
midfielder role you said you know he's

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.190 
midfielder role you said you know he's
got<00:03:27.220> some<00:03:27.430> quality<00:03:28.239> long<00:03:28.510> shots<00:03:28.810> on<00:03:28.989> them<00:03:29.109> and

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
got some quality long shots on them and

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.809 
got some quality long shots on them and
things<00:03:29.380> like<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:29.890> I<00:03:30.069> definitely<00:03:30.609> think

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
things like that so I definitely think

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.520 
things like that so I definitely think
is<00:03:30.970> gonna<00:03:31.090> be<00:03:31.239> worth<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.569> try<00:03:31.810> but<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.230> could

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
is gonna be worth a try but it could

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.259 
is gonna be worth a try but it could
quickly<00:03:32.890> turn<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.700> point<00:03:34.060> where

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
quickly turn to the point where

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.940 
quickly turn to the point where
Schneiderlin<00:03:34.840> gets<00:03:35.079> that<00:03:35.260> starting<00:03:35.709> spot

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
Schneiderlin gets that starting spot

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.069 
Schneiderlin gets that starting spot
ahead<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.640> one<00:03:36.790> Yama<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:37.269> be<00:03:37.450> interesting<00:03:37.959> to

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
ahead of one Yama so be interesting to

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.009 
ahead of one Yama so be interesting to
see<00:03:38.260> what<00:03:38.290> goes<00:03:38.709> down<00:03:39.180> let's<00:03:40.180> look<00:03:40.480> at<00:03:40.690> what

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
is a combination of the players overall

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.349 
is a combination of the players overall
and<00:03:53.739> their<00:03:53.920> form<00:03:54.220> hence<00:03:54.430> why<00:03:54.609> Rickie<00:03:54.850> Lambert

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
and their form hence why Rickie Lambert

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.420 
and their form hence why Rickie Lambert
was<00:03:55.690> above<00:03:56.109> Gaston<00:03:56.590> Ramirez<00:03:56.889> who<00:03:57.190> has<00:03:57.400> a

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
was above Gaston Ramirez who has a

was above Gaston Ramirez who has a
higher<00:03:57.700> overall<00:03:58.120> so<00:03:58.420> um<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:59.230> that<00:03:59.530> does<00:03:59.709> make

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
higher overall so um that that does make

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.979 
higher overall so um that that does make
sense<00:03:59.950> I'm<00:04:00.790> not<00:04:00.970> into<00:04:01.209> I<00:04:01.239> you<00:04:01.359> know<00:04:01.569> I<00:04:01.600> can't

we can do i'm sure the southampton board
will<00:04:49.419> be<00:04:49.509> pretty<00:04:49.720> tough<00:04:49.990> that<00:04:50.169> i<00:04:50.199> made<00:04:50.380> it<00:04:50.530> to

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
will be pretty tough that i made it to

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.469 
will be pretty tough that i made it to
the<00:04:50.800> semi-finals<00:04:51.100> but<00:04:51.850> it'd<00:04:51.910> be<00:04:52.060> great<00:04:52.449> to

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
the semi-finals but it'd be great to

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.180 
the semi-finals but it'd be great to
come<00:04:52.840> home<00:04:52.870> with<00:04:53.050> some<00:04:53.350> silverware<00:04:53.770> although

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
come home with some silverware although

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.010 
come home with some silverware although
it<00:04:54.310> might<00:04:54.460> be<00:04:54.639> tough<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:55.090> definitely<00:04:55.660> think<00:04:55.930> we

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
it might be tough I definitely think we

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.560 
it might be tough I definitely think we
