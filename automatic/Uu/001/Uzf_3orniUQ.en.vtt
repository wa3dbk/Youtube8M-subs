00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:54.420
 here we have started 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:58.550
 the stage there if we want after 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.550
 usually in fact a serious 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.340
 we can really do what we want 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.320
 in the effects we can see three 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.869
 differences and does as if we want 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:30.240

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.409
 we like these are spatulas we 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:48.479
 can take a toothpick to prick 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:51.580

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.500
 okay see the effects of marble 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.500

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.119
 we can do with many colors 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.180
 so now are on our disks 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:11.590
 presentation blacks so we'll go 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.450

 we will create a thermal shock in fact we 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.290
 go the spaces and like this so we 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.600
 instead we put some chocolate 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.330
 like those we are going to come is cramped 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:45.730
