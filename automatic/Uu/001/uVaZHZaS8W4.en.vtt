00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
about that because as the barbecue cooks

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.520 
about that because as the barbecue cooks
that<00:00:43.469> we're<00:00:43.649> at<00:00:43.739> 250<00:00:44.520> degrees<00:00:44.899> cooking<00:00:45.899> as<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
that we're at 250 degrees cooking as the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.350 
that we're at 250 degrees cooking as the
meat<00:00:46.739> rises<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.640> get<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> temperature

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
meat rises up to get to the temperature

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.540 
meat rises up to get to the temperature
that<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.600> want<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.739> finishing<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.340> at

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that we want it to to be finishing up at

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.279 
that we want it to to be finishing up at
which<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.910> probably<00:00:51.210> close<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.570> 200<00:00:51.989> degrees

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
which is probably close to 200 degrees

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.729 
which is probably close to 200 degrees
internal<00:00:52.860> once<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> hits<00:00:54.059> about<00:00:54.230> 160<00:00:55.230> 60

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
internal once it hits about 160 60

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.160 
internal once it hits about 160 60
degrees<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.850> fat<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> pork<00:00:58.050> is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
degrees the fat in the in the pork is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.170 
degrees the fat in the in the pork is
going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> start<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.800> render<00:00:59.010> which<00:00:59.940> means

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
going to start to render which means

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.610 
going to start to render which means
it's<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.600> start<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.840> melt<00:01:01.109> away<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
it's going to start to melt away and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.219 
it's going to start to melt away and
rain<00:01:01.770> away<00:01:01.949> that's<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> leave<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
rain away that's going to leave the the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.780 
rain away that's going to leave the the
texture<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> meat<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.220> those<00:01:05.460> there's

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
texture of the meat and those there's

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.670 
texture of the meat and those there's
fibers<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.510> loose<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> falling<00:01:07.200> apart

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
fibers just loose and falling apart

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.100 
fibers just loose and falling apart
thus<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> pulled<00:01:08.729> pork<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.750> are<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> lot<00:01:09.990> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
thus the pulled pork there are a lot of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.719 
thus the pulled pork there are a lot of
ways<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.439> get<00:01:10.560> our<00:01:10.710> rub<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.130> make<00:01:11.310> got<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> rub

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
ways to get our rub we make got a rub

doing<00:02:04.070> I'm<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.490> school<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.270> don't

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
doing I'm of the school that I don't

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.600 
doing I'm of the school that I don't
like<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.990> do<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> whole<00:02:07.530> lot<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.829> rubbing<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.489> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
like to do a whole lot of rubbing on the

like to do a whole lot of rubbing on the
meat<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> believe<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.200> kind<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.470> clogs<00:02:10.739> up

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
meat I believe that it kind of clogs up

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.729 
meat I believe that it kind of clogs up
the<00:02:11.009> pores<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.550> doesn't<00:02:12.000> allow<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:13.500> fat

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
the pores and doesn't allow the the fat

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.360 
the pores and doesn't allow the the fat
to<00:02:13.950> come<00:02:14.129> out

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
to come out

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.940 
to come out
into<00:02:14.940> good<00:02:15.090> flavors<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:16.110> smokin<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.620> go<00:02:16.769> in

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
into good flavors and a smokin to go in

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.820
