00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.579
 beautiful sometimes also does things in the 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.949
 life and good because sometimes it may not 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.350
 comply so in a month that has gone up 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.569

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:01.179
 and of immense with its field as you see here 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.090
 of to play football that by the way 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.090
 did you do 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:11.310
 for what I teach in the last video 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.350
 there is no tennis paddle is that if we have 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.060
 the tennis in this part of here look 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.940
 How cool and beautiful and with his entourage 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.410
 hello pig 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.320
 after the milestone of a source that takes us 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.180
 by a path made towards the forest this 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.220
 I find that you are missing little things 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.900
 some or like me for example make me 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.550
 trips that I am very fussy jr 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.080
 I find little things for example look at you 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.369
 this is crossing the fences at last 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.119
 you should face this you take you could 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.330
 so that you know or are the fences 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.050
 they should go a little bit higher 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.850
 already if I think about it 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.649
 hey maybe the creator has decided not to 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.759
 do it like this we must accept it 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.130
 but what would this have done 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.450
 upload it a little bit more is look at what 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.310
 nice has been this is silly 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.340
 be left behind but it remains 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.229
 beautiful look at these details carvings 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.789
 they matter and make the difference 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.520
 to the house an immense house you do not see is 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.720
 made of quartz turn wood 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.760
 dark oak 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.260
 and in turn black wool and as you see 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.440
 let's go in and let's observe how 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.040
 we have here a beautiful place with a 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.530
 round table that 60 the gentlemen to 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.940
 discuss beautiful things like records 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.890
 different if we say the kitchen is 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.120
 a very large house you see that we have 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.800
 when you know the map you will see that 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.960
 he has as many I do not know why he is 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.730
 passed a map with bots but good 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.340
 us the opening and you will see it normal 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.290
 everything and good so that it is empty what 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.270
 has done with creative all this we are going to 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.920
 enter and well then here we see how 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.680
 is everything you see that is very broad this is 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.660
 a spacious house is a house with great 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.160
 dimension a tiny house but good 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.990
 here that we have nothing less than a 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.020
 sink here we have it here we have a 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.300
 shower to bathe we have a washbasin 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.910
 here is a toilet sorry and here then 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.800
 you live for the hands I really like this 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.300
 idea the kitchen that we just saw me 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.370
 this seems very cool plate 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.200
 pressure and that there will be both traps 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.420
 how this here seems super cool 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.040
 I think it's a very good idea to say 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.989
 true today the house is very spacious but 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.489
 The time seems like very empty 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.019
 I do not know about that depends on each one is how you 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.610
 like houses logically good and 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.410
 you see different pictures some that 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.489
 they go so you know let's see floor 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.099
 top where we have the rooms 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.170
 to sleep that we have here then nothing 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.569
 less than a real life scale bed 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.099
 global therefore this bed works for us 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.840
 as it is here we have different cars 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.709
 to leave little things for graffiti or for 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.500
 here very cool this to do in doors with 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.450
 fences this way of separating and at the same time 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.400
 not doing it that's pretty cool 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.470
 here we have another layer and we have more 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.239
 cuts so that those of pimp we 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.860
 it seems to me I like it a lot and here 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.630
 we have the last station that are 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.849
 three rooms that we have like that 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.440
 It's cool but at the same time I do not know you do not have 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.900
 a lot of intimacy is perfectly what 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.810
 Does your neighbor finally from a house 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.970
 It's not easy either to have their 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.110
 things I like but that mola more 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.090
 has left you the coordinates and why 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.620
 no gentlemen to because I prefer that you know 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.970
 you on your own to also 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.609
 save surprises from time to time but 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.980
 If not, this is your turn, it's up to 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.510
 guys I say goodbye but first of all 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.940
 what is so striking that you 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.930
 incorporates this map as it is a ship a 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.730
 yacht flips how beautiful everything and when entering 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.120
 Well, we have, as you can see here, our area 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.609
 with a beautiful table with its kitchen where 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.070
 more spend or places to sit for sale 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.430
 output of the zone is in operation 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.020
 of conserves this those steam and these 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.060
 starboard like val rolls does not 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.040
 agreement but good if we wanted to go to 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.540
 water but here we have a little increase 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.430
 would take us to a pool look at what 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.120
 a yacht with a pool touches the 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.490
 feet 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.620
 touch your feet here we have this very 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.389
 Cocky I really like and that battle 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.800
 you see we have areas to relax 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.669
 We stretch an upper floor even for 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:51.320
 come up to see if I can do it where 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.320
 we would have the dressing rooms 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.630
 the area of ​​playing pool and the area of ​​the 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.729
 captain where he is and the captain who 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.570
 pilot where he stays I do not know but it's cool 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.830
 pretty wow 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.830
 look which perspective more hello from here 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.190
 so to make the miniature from 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.960
 this place if I put another say that I do not 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.030
 like this miniature or it does not look like 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.710
 I would like but I'm going to put it there 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.270
 see how perfect you can see what he did 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.530
 several pictures around here I liked 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.880
 you can leave me like I think 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.100
 it would be very good that new one does not arrive 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.419
 house or joyce and it is because you are a happy 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.680
