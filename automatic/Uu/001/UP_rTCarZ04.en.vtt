00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.000 
who picks them up the renegade wears the
Jeep<00:03:44.180> costume<00:03:44.750> well<00:03:44.959> but<00:03:45.530> when<00:03:45.680> you're<00:03:45.830> out<00:03:45.980> on

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010

Jeep costume well but when you're out on
the<00:03:46.160> trail<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:46.730> need<00:03:46.940> substance<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.750> back

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
the trail you need substance to back

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.410 
the trail you need substance to back
that<00:03:48.110> Wrangler<00:03:48.560> inspired<00:03:49.010> styling<00:03:49.549> I<00:03:49.730> don't

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420

think<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.959> regular<00:03:51.769> 1.4<00:03:53.440> renegade<00:03:54.440> would

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
think the regular 1.4 renegade would

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.650 
think the regular 1.4 renegade would
make<00:03:55.549> it<00:03:55.670> through<00:03:55.850> here<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.330> front-wheel

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
make it through here and the front-wheel

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.660 
make it through here and the front-wheel

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
drive would certainly not have a chance

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.080 
drive would certainly not have a chance
but

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090
