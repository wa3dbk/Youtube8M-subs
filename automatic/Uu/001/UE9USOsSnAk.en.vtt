00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.860
 I will climb today we will consider the first 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.599
 bullpup carbine in the game which is 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.969
 not the best representative of the class 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.320
 carbines automatic grant mint 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.280
 complex 91 developed in here mkb 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.470
 instrument making sample 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.860
 originally intended for armament 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.610
 special operations forces MIA Army 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.130
 Russia 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.380
 as well as for exporting weapons created in 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.270
 Bullpup configurations with integrated 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.850
 design forty millimeter 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.970
 grenade launcher using this machine 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.060
 ammunition of two calibers 556 nato and our 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.950
 762 in the game version is presented under 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.750
 NATO cartridge for opening this 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.370
 carbine you need to dial with 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.110
 using carbines 28 thousand points 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.540
 a91 is a good carbine which has a lot 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.790
 small complex problems they make this 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.010
 the trunk is almost not usable but in 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.020
 overall good damage characteristics 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.559
 standard for carbines 25 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.009
 maximum and minimum 15.4 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.749
 rate of fire 800 shots per minute 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.579
 recharge the problem of all hitting the floor 

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:12.659
 full will take three point three 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.850
 seconds 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.729
 tactical 2 point seven 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.579
 seconds in many days is somehow strange 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.859
 arrived with 91 battlefield 3 at this 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:26.159
 the barrel was below vertical recoil and 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.209
 recharging why they changed these 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.549
 specifications 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.799
 not clear because in battlefield3 given 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.899
 the carbine was not very embolus but very 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.719
 even balanced and perfect for 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.639
 melee and medium range combat 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.319
 battlefield 4 situation a bit 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:43.079
 changed now he is good only for 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.479
 melee due to the fact that he was on the street 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.849
 priests have one negative trait this 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.119
 accuracy when aiming shooting on 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:53.099
 much lower plus add high 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.289
 vertical recoil but this is not the most 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:56.939
 the worst is the worst 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.490
 horizontal return which you do not 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.679
 be able to control for a distance 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.480
 hitting someone is impossible because 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.040
 the barrel goes shaking 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.830
 also add a long recharge 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.530
 which you will often substitute in the near 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.110
 combat to the positive features can be attributed 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.720
 low scatter when shooting from the hip and in 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.590
 Coupe with Alsu you can forget about the sight 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.010
 in melee 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.560
 and those many problems that have a 91 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.270
 can solve modules sights only 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.700
 collimator multiple not 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.930
 recommended to solve problems with 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.540
 horizontal recoil 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.820
 I recommend to put a compensator he 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.950
 reduce horizontal return by 25 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.990
 percent it somehow helps you 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.600
 work at medium distances although even 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.760
 after installing this module it will 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.060
 bad bullpup and yet oblique on 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.830
 distance required module and soul 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.260
 he reduce scatter when shooting from 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.630
 thighs at 25 percent such a module is not 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.150
 once will save your life in the unexpected 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.740
 appearance of the enemy from the corner and yes 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.170
 wield against a crowd of opponents 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.060
 melee is more comfortable from the hip than in 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.160
 targeted mode is also quite good 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.080
 looks ergonomic handle 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.140
 especially if you take action 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.540
 rank tactics on this module will make 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.340
 significantly lower scatter when shooting 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.430
 movement 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.290
 whole a91 very controversial trunk 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.700
 if he had a rate of fire to 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.230
 kumtor or essay gave yar then he would 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.020
 Great for melee 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.030
 even despite its cons but that 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.100
 the form in which he is now represented in 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.070
 the game, he plov compared to the same 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.260
 SRs which opens before them 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.180
 taram which opens in addition 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.700
 China Rising but I think that's all 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.110
 thanks for watching subscribe 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.110
 comment see you on the battlefield bye
