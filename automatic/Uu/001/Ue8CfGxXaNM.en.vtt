Tim<00:00:10.740> Duncan<00:00:11.630> he<00:00:12.630> did<00:00:12.870> win<00:00:13.110> an<00:00:13.259> NBA

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
Tim Duncan he did win an NBA

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.499 
Tim Duncan he did win an NBA
championship<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.490> year<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.059> think<00:00:15.179> that

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
championship this year so I think that

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.870 
championship this year so I think that
might<00:00:15.990> play<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.650> small<00:00:17.070> part<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
might play a small part in to the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.540 
might play a small part in to the
overall<00:00:18.439> rating<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.680> might<00:00:19.830> not<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.310> don't

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
overall rating and might not I don't

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.599 
overall rating and might not I don't
know<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.670> think<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.060> would<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.270> think<00:00:21.949> I<00:00:22.949> mean<00:00:23.400> I

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
know I think it would I think I mean I

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.720 
know I think it would I think I mean I
think<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.180> would<00:00:24.269> deserve<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:25.170> anyways

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
think you would deserve it but anyways

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.060 
think you would deserve it but anyways
Tim<00:00:26.730> Duncan<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.449> an<00:00:28.380> 87<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.400> NBA<00:00:29.970> 2k14<00:00:31.070> after

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
Tim Duncan is an 87 in NBA 2k14 after

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.370 
Tim Duncan is an 87 in NBA 2k14 after
looking<00:00:32.279> at<00:00:32.369> his<00:00:32.520> stats<00:00:32.969> his<00:00:33.390> points<00:00:34.079> went

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
looking at his stats his points went

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.770 
looking at his stats his points went
down<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:35.489> his<00:00:35.640> assists<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:36.329> up<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
down but his assists one up and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.299 
down but his assists one up and
everything<00:00:37.320> else<00:00:37.500> pretty<00:00:37.710> much<00:00:37.829> stayed<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
everything else pretty much stayed the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.319 
everything else pretty much stayed the
same<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.590> mean<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.460> fact<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.940> assists

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
same so I mean the fact that it assists

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
same so I mean the fact that it assists
one<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.780> his<00:00:42.840> points<00:00:43.290> went<00:00:43.440> down<00:00:43.649> we

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
one up in his points went down we

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.590 
one up in his points went down we
probably<00:00:44.399> mean<00:00:44.670> he's<00:00:44.789> passing<00:00:45.090> more<00:00:45.420> than

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
probably mean he's passing more than

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.240 
probably mean he's passing more than
shooting<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.770> don't<00:00:46.920> think<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.100> would

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
shooting so I don't think that would

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.569 
shooting so I don't think that would
affect<00:00:47.640> his<00:00:47.789> overall<00:00:48.120> rating<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.629> much<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
affect his overall rating that much and

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.939 
affect his overall rating that much and
his<00:00:50.579> field-goal<00:00:50.879> percentage<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.570> still<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.170> was

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
his field-goal percentage is still I was

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.119 
his field-goal percentage is still I was
still<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.969> around<00:00:54.329> other<00:00:54.780> point<00:00:55.289> five<00:00:55.530> so

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
still right around other point five so

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.650 
still right around other point five so
that's<00:00:56.309> also<00:00:56.520> very<00:00:56.699> good<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:59.520> my<00:00:59.910> opinion<00:01:00.090> I

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
that's also very good so in my opinion I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.429 
that's also very good so in my opinion I
think<00:01:00.809> Tim<00:01:01.530> Duncan<00:01:02.010> would<00:01:02.280> probably<00:01:03.439> get

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
think Tim Duncan would probably get

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
think Tim Duncan would probably get
boosted<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.460> point<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.299> an<00:01:06.390> 88<00:01:06.900> /<00:01:08.180> unto<00:01:09.180> his

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
boosted up one point to an 88 / unto his

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.780 
boosted up one point to an 88 / unto his
15<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.439> my<00:01:10.619> opinion<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.640> do

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
15 that's just my opinion I really do

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.690 
15 that's just my opinion I really do
think<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> fact<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.689> he<00:01:13.670> won<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
think of the fact that he won a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.630 
think of the fact that he won a
championship<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.659> he's<00:01:16.290> had<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> little<00:01:17.460> bit

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
championship and he's had a little bit

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.899 
championship and he's had a little bit
more<00:01:17.820> assists<00:01:18.210> my<00:01:19.170> booth<00:01:19.500> creeper<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.490> overall

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
more assists my booth creeper is overall

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.330 
more assists my booth creeper is overall
reading<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.570> bit<00:01:21.659> more<00:01:22.130> but<00:01:23.130> again

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
reading a little bit more but again

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.190 
reading a little bit more but again
that's<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.820> my<00:01:23.970> opinion<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.540> really<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:24.990> want

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that's just my opinion I really do want
