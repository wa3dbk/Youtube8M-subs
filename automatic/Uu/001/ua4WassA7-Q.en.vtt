there and we are looking and we kind of

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.549 
there and we are looking and we kind of

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
we chose this one I hear it's the sepia

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.850 
we chose this one I hear it's the sepia
3236<00:01:08.250> two<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.390> same<00:01:09.600> flips<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
3236 two on the same flips it's on the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.560 
3236 two on the same flips it's on the
same<00:01:12.110> like<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.260> know<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:14.299> strips<00:01:15.299> on

same like you know like up strips on
color<00:01:15.990> strip<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.220> figured<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.610> match<00:01:17.850> it's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
color strip so we figured in match it's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.789 
color strip so we figured in match it's
only<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.720> bit<00:01:19.020> darker<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.530> about<00:01:19.680> like

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
did squatching on our wall and I kind of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.690 
did squatching on our wall and I kind of
filling<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.530> looks<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> same<00:01:41.040> color<00:01:41.340> as<00:01:41.549> our

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
filling it looks the same color as our

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.010 
filling it looks the same color as our
hallway<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.180> definitely<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> little<00:01:42.750> bit

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
hallway it's definitely a little bit

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.039 
hallway it's definitely a little bit
darker<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> look<00:01:43.770> at<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.689> our

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
darker if you look at it but that is our

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.679 
darker if you look at it but that is our
hallway<00:01:46.470> color<00:01:46.710> out<00:01:46.920> there<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.700> then<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
hallway color out there and then that is

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.780 
hallway color out there and then that is
that<00:01:48.840> color<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.680> we'll<00:01:50.220> see<00:01:50.399> i'm<00:01:50.549> probably

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
