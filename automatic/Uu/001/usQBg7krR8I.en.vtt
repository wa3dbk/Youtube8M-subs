00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.900
 carbohydrate digestion 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.010
 the question we want to solve is 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.070
 how the body digests a piece of bread 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.250
 a first step to clear up this doubt is 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.190
 wonder what the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.610
 bread that must be digested 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.910
 if we think about it, bread is a food that 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.330
 It is derived mainly from wheat flour 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.980
 which is a grain and the grains are 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:43.260
 consisting mostly of carbohydrates 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.500
 carbohydrates are molecules 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.440
 similar to sugars but in the case 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.170
 of the grains and therefore in the case 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.329
 of bread are much larger molecules 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.329
 size since they form long chains 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.210
 carbohydrates in general have a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.790
 pretty similar structure are 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.010
 formed by chains of cycles like this 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.010
 that are called monkeys to streets 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.100
 the union of hands has fallen will form in 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.490
 first place and take me out if they are 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.829
 a union of two units and then a 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.550
 polysaccharide if you have a higher 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.180
 quantity 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.490
 however for the sugars or 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.160
 carbohydrates are used and 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.710
 absorbed by the body should be in 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.780
 form of monkeys to street ie 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.970
 isolated units 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.119
 that's why the digestion of 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.119
 carbohydrates will aim at 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.170
 separate these chains breaking the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.619
 links that connect these units 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.900
 in this way we will form a lot of 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.259
 monosaccharides that may be absorbed 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.190
 in the thin wine and then used 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.190
 for the rest of the body 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.270
 the digestion of carbohydrates is the most 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.750
 early as it starts in the mouth 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.320
 this because the saliva besides having 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.140
 as a public function and moisten the 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.660
 The food we eat contains a 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.530
 single digestive enzymes called amylase 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.020
 salivary 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.910
 This has the function of starting 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.490
 break the links between 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.720
 monosaccharides beginning thus the 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.720
 digestion of carbohydrates 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.159
 Unlike other nutrients the 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:54.459
 carbohydrates are not digested in the 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:57.459
 stomach since the salivary amylase that 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.310
 contains the food bolus is inactivated 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:05.239
 for the very acid ph that exists in this 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.709
 the next step of digestion is 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:12.620
 will already have list and purpose this by 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.310
 two enzymes secreted in the juice 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.310
 pancreatic 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.550
 this tenth will have the function of 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.110
 finish degrading carbohydrates 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.489
 in a bunch of units 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.680
 monosaccharides so that at the end of the 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.140
 first portion of the intestine is to say 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.750
 of the duodenum will no longer exist 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.390
 complex carbohydrates but only good 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.150
 remove them isolated that may be 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:46.459
 absorbed by the rest of the tract come 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.459
 it is estimated slim and taken to the flow
