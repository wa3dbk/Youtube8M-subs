they're<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.720> has<00:01:46.049> well<00:01:46.350> inside

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
they're going to have has well inside

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.789 
they're going to have has well inside
let's<00:01:48.149> take<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> look<00:01:48.479> at<00:01:48.750> what<00:01:48.960> you're<00:01:49.649> going
