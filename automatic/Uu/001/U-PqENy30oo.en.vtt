00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.660
 in this episode of hart liver tv the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.660
 asus transformer book trio 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.180
 welcome to hearts info tv 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.520
 special product of asus today one 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.869
 two in one device or actually three 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.920
 in a what they call a transformer 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.860
 book trio 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.050
 so it is without a doubt a laptop and a 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.820
 tablet wrinkled together but then too 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.160
 really a loose laptop and tablet 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.350
 yes we already have many hybrids here 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.019
 in the studio and had all kinds of shapes and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.870
 novo and yoga for example a lot 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.489
 transformer book like products from 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.489
 of asus, for example, through various 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.559
 models of van hp for example yes this 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.880
 is really something completely different 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.050
 and normally to 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.030
 normally sketch if you have one 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.989
 have a laptop whose screen you take off 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.489
 can pull 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.010
 you can then sit with Doris tablet 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.020
 normally the PC itself 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.930
 so the processor and things like that 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.430
 behind the screen and is the keyboard 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.039
 we speak and dove and with a little 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.270
 luck is there and an extra battery in japan 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.680
 wim maybe hard drive 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.479
 this thing is really completely different from pol 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.420
 yes i will show it 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.380
 and right now it's just one 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.720
 windows laptop 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.970
 you can with the push of a button you can 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.439
 switch to android yes he 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.180
 sees that is really green 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.220
 instantaneous to be yes that such a beautiful one 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.150
 Here you really click and it is to see you 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.130
 are switched 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.600
 and you can switch back again immediately 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.909
 then you go to windows so you can 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.350
 at that moment directly between the two 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.790
 switch worlds well I would n't be like that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.780
 very crazy because actually donate 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.600
 again just turn the screen around 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.909
 because this is a full-fledged android 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.650
 tablet me 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.979
 and takes android 4 point 2 are 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.710
 just a set of 2560 processor in 2 gigabytes 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.659
 memory and 16 gigabytes of storage is included in 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.310
 yes you can on this mister this 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.110
 just use it separately but then 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.030
 very funny because here is in this 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.590
 device and core i5 processor 4200 4 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.189
 gigabyte of memory and a 500 gb 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.930
 Hard Drive 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.700
 and here we are just the monitor 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.560
 be able to connect and continue working 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.110
 yes and that is why they trio him 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.470
 mention what actually says so this is one 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.530
 laptop tablet and even a desktop want 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.560
 put together that way goes the tablet 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.120
 actually serve as a monitor of the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.530
 laptop so to speak 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.790
 of the research thing and you have one 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.980
 laptop loose 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.409
 so you have an android tablet where you 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.629
 can get started, but can also handle it 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.069
 women prefer to give children and 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.900
 that separate keyboard can then be placed on one 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.159
 loose monitor and the keyboard mouse 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.299
 to connect 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.569
 and then you can actually do it that way 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.950
 As a desktop you think that's the way 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.599
 asus sees the world yes i must be honest 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.030
 say that I don't quite see it that way 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.870
 find it quite technical here 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.760
 funny to it 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.090
 funny thing but i see it 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.739
 use model I are not quite 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.390
 two could be completely separate devices 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.280
 there is a synchronization tool 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.930
 that they had been to admit that 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.250
 include but are late in both 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.859
 is storage in both is storage yes i do 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.120
 do n't quite see that model for me 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.799
 then you give a tablet to your children 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.510
 give yes if you would like that 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.180
 maybe one with a little more storage 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.609
 and on the other hand if you are going to buy this 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.989
 you can from human good and loose 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.090
 to purchase a tablet 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.609
 yes because in fact you mean buy green 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.840
 two full-fledged system week or two 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.280
 once a process you want comes twice 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.510
 save your head twice memory 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.430
 actually I have you cell school 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.060
 literally literally two things 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.410
 a 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.829
 but I have to go for that too 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.690
 pay while yes for that matter there 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.730
 there might be an office 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.290
 solutions even stronger than is not itself 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.849
 again during ces 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.040
 maybe an elegant solution 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.440
 sucina namely that the transformer book 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.169
 duet where just both android as 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.560
 use the same processes 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.780
 and indeed everything is 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.239
 denotes all the all the logic behind the screen 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.650
 so that for green also the loose 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.419
 systems so watch the language is also 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.419
 of course on disney it will be pretty 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.739
 heavy systems that work that tick 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.450
 not all that great benefit 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.519
 look another side also if you like 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.169
 you are working with windows and 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.700
 then you tap the screen believe yes why 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:13.359
 would you do that also look like if like 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.700
 like this thing too if you look at it 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.289
 both the base and as the tablet 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.239
 yes both are not necessarily whole 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.519
 good products 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.010
 yes okay sit hairy screen on full hd 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.169
 but here is just a set 2560 in well 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.180
 yes tell the concept is that not all 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.729
 fastest processor here is again 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.860
 for generation you lead him this is we 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.330
 not VAT yes and if you look at this 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.200
 the to the processor that is in it 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.270
 a core i5 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.130
 4200 wind to that could get me 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.740
 many different devices 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.710
 that against but that's the drawback is that 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.570
 she there a 500 gigabyte traditional 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.890
 hard disk from 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.930
 if you are going to look at the according to the 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.100
 no SSD support or not at all 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.570
 no ssd actually 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.330
 you can also do it you can't do it either 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.670
 in places so yes in terms of performance 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.720
 This is also not necessarily the best laptop that 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.130
 you can buy with with 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.600
 especially when you look at the price tag 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.620
 combination of those two costs around the 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.660
 1000 euros 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.970
 yes and then yes then I want something like that 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.650
 would actually be a bit faster 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.300
 want to have the ultrabook for that money 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.290
 that of course we already have the positive of it 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.810
 it from it from it 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.240
 the concept is perhaps normal 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.430
 that combination of windows and android 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.290
 because of course have already had it often 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.910
 windows 8 is ideal for trick 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.920
 just the productivity behind your things 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.380
 the number of apps is very disappointing 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.570
 that is the me very good at android 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.060
 for each other it is the fact that you 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.940
 can I switch can be nice 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.380
 manon was already in existence in the 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.670
 hunter and solutions for and go there 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.440
 also can get a lot in from it too 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.400
 less item as well a pink tablet 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.570
 to buy 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.920
 yes that is also for the for this for 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.090
 of course buy this money and laptop 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.280
 tablet green as 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.620
 yes i this is there time with something i see 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.090
 see the see the same way and synergy 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.040
 get a nice fashion and that 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.390
 I would not between those two products 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.220
 look if you really just have one 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.200
 fantastic combination between the two 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.880
 but these are really two separate ones 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.800
 look at things and it 's nice that you put that in 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.180
 can click each other but yes I have then 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.950
 something like me if you go to that model 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.330
 then I prefer myself 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.880
 to loose tablet from then you can 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.260
 for example , watch TV and all the 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.240
 other things at the same time if you do it 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.400
 are little and productive 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.330
 you can only be productive 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.100
 on this thing 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.630
 so if you have it in your windows mill 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.950
 or in android mode you can do this at the 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.960
 things not really at the same time 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.130
 often use under that through my 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.720
 mother words to stay if we have the 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.590
 machine here we often talk about 1 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.720
 plus 1 is 2 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.330
 but here if you actually feel in this 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.500
 more like a plus one is one and a half yes me 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.000
 I don't even know if I'm going to 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.680
 one and a half they want to go I think it's me 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.960
 find it personally yes it is technical 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.160
 here is great fun but yes i think 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.110
 it just a shame 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.550
 for example here one 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.860
 a traditional hard drive 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.510
 allowing you to do with me not 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.110
 totally the modern computer experience 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.270
 have 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.430
 and yes look if you want as a tablet 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.930
 have yes in my opinion there are too 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.310
 better to get the tablets there 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.050
 maybe you add that together 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:56.220
 it might be just a little cheaper then 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.910
 a full hd notebook and a tablet
