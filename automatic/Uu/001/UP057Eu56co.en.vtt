and I'll let us unfortunately this gift

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.940 
and I'll let us unfortunately this gift
card<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.570> not<00:01:48.720> rigid<00:01:49.259> enough<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.829> actually

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
card is not rigid enough it's actually

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.539 
card is not rigid enough it's actually
bending<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:51.689> gift<00:01:52.140> card<00:01:52.470> trying<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.369> get

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
bending the gift card trying to get

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.999 
bending the gift card trying to get
underneath<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.799> basically<00:01:55.799> you're<00:01:55.920> going

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
underneath here basically you're going

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.819 
underneath here basically you're going
to<00:01:56.070> want<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:57.060> start<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.840> go<00:01:58.590> all<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
to want to go you start here go all the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.219 
to want to go you start here go all the
way<00:01:58.860> around<00:01:59.040> take<00:01:59.790> it's<00:01:59.969> about<00:02:00.030> here<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.110> then

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
way around take it's about here and then

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.670 
way around take it's about here and then
kind<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.740> pry<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.219> open<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.350> trick<00:02:04.649> is

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
kind of pry it open and the trick is

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.880 
kind of pry it open and the trick is
getting<00:02:04.979> around<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.880> fun

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
getting around this is fun

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.530 
getting around this is fun
let's<00:02:08.580> see<00:02:08.729> if<00:02:08.790> we<00:02:08.880> can<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.119> with<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.360> gift

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
let's see if we can do with the gift

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.080 
let's see if we can do with the gift
card<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.020> math<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:11.660> grab<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.810> metal<00:02:13.050> piece

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
card in math to grab the metal piece

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.130 
card in math to grab the metal piece
does<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.210> look<00:02:15.360> like<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.690> going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.960> happen

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
does it look like it's going to happen

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.010 
does it look like it's going to happen
so<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:17.550> can<00:02:17.700> try<00:02:17.970> lightly<00:02:18.540> with<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
so you can try lightly with the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.330 
so you can try lightly with the
screwdriver<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.380> know<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.650> even<00:02:23.280> with

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
screwdriver and you know it's even with

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.800 
screwdriver and you know it's even with
that<00:02:23.460> screwdriver<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:24.120> not<00:02:24.240> coming<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.750> I'm

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
that screwdriver it's not coming so I'm

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.120 
that screwdriver it's not coming so I'm
using<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.170> flat<00:02:25.680> blade<00:02:27.140> insert<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.410> little

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
using a flat blade insert it a little

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.300 
using a flat blade insert it a little
bit<00:02:29.340> weighs<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:33.500> as<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.830> can<00:02:34.950> see<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.220> we

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
bit weighs in and as you can see that we

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.470 
bit weighs in and as you can see that we
just<00:02:35.340> took<00:02:35.580> off<00:02:35.730> some<00:02:35.940> paint

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
just took off some paint

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.390 
just took off some paint
