00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
musician that I've been thinking about

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.409 
musician that I've been thinking about
recently<00:00:18.939> is<00:00:19.390> is<00:00:19.919> how<00:00:20.919> you<00:00:20.980> deal<00:00:21.429> with<00:00:21.699> both

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:22.419 
recently is is how you deal with both

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.569 
recently is is how you deal with both
your<00:00:22.869> expectations<00:00:23.589> of<00:00:23.710> yourself<00:00:23.829> how<00:00:24.519> you

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:24.579 
your expectations of yourself how you

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.009 
your expectations of yourself how you
should<00:00:24.939> be<00:00:25.029> playing<00:00:25.239> and<00:00:25.449> also<00:00:25.630> other

should be playing and also other

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.169 
should be playing and also other
people's<00:00:26.529> expectations<00:00:27.130> of<00:00:27.609> yourself<00:00:27.730> not

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
people's expectations of yourself not

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.659 
people's expectations of yourself not
necessarily<00:00:28.749> not<00:00:29.619> necessarily<00:00:29.679> musically

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
necessarily not necessarily musically

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.060 
necessarily not necessarily musically
but<00:00:30.999> I<00:00:31.179> mean<00:00:31.329> so<00:00:32.079> it's<00:00:32.439> great<00:00:32.619> since<00:00:32.800> you<00:00:32.890> got<00:00:33.010> a

but I mean so it's great since you got a

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.430 
but I mean so it's great since you got a
review<00:00:33.489> that's<00:00:34.390> good<00:00:34.690> then<00:00:35.019> the<00:00:35.109> next<00:00:35.320> time

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
review that's good then the next time

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.290 
review that's good then the next time

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
you go back to the place you know you

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.660 
you go back to the place you know you
want<00:00:37.660> to<00:00:37.780> play<00:00:37.960> well<00:00:38.199> or<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:39.370> I'm<00:00:39.460> just

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
curious how the three of you you know

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.779 
curious how the three of you you know
three<00:00:42.940> people<00:00:43.239> who<00:00:43.570> have<00:00:44.410> or<00:00:44.800> have<00:00:45.070> had<00:00:45.100> you

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
three people who have or have had you

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.110 
three people who have or have had you
know<00:00:46.199> incredible<00:00:47.199> careers<00:00:47.620> how<00:00:48.609> you<00:00:48.670> deal

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
know incredible careers how you deal

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.049 
know incredible careers how you deal
with<00:00:49.149> that<00:00:49.600> sort<00:00:49.929> of<00:00:50.019> pressure<00:00:50.530> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
with that sort of pressure of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.160 
with that sort of pressure of
expectation<00:00:52.059> both<00:00:52.269> from<00:00:52.510> other<00:00:52.629> people<00:00:52.929> and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
expectation both from other people and

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.529 
expectation both from other people and
from<00:00:53.289> from<00:00:53.890> yourself<00:00:54.280> I<00:00:54.730> will<00:00:55.269> probably

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
from from yourself I will probably

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.770 
from from yourself I will probably
answer<00:00:56.160> takes<00:00:57.160> of<00:00:57.730> something<00:00:58.120> that<00:00:58.239> I<00:00:58.300> first

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
answer takes of something that I first

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.380 
answer takes of something that I first
heard<00:01:00.210> Leon<00:01:01.210> talk<00:01:01.449> about<00:01:01.780> maybe<00:01:02.679> when<00:01:02.949> I<00:01:02.980> was

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
heard Leon talk about maybe when I was

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.120 
heard Leon talk about maybe when I was
in<00:01:04.390> my<00:01:04.600> early<00:01:04.720> twenties<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:06.120> and<00:01:07.120> this<00:01:07.420> is<00:01:07.600> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
in my early twenties and and this is a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.800 
in my early twenties and and this is a
it's<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.280> sh<00:01:09.310> anabolism<00:01:09.820> also<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.810> this

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
it's a sh anabolism also and and this

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.230 
it's a sh anabolism also and and this
and<00:01:14.050> it's<00:01:14.200> also<00:01:14.380> part<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:15.240> contradiction

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
and it's also part of the contradiction

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.350 
and it's also part of the contradiction
that<00:01:16.270> we<00:01:16.540> have<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:16.900> hold<00:01:17.140> within<00:01:17.500> ourselves

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
that we have to hold within ourselves

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.660 
that we have to hold within ourselves
but<00:01:19.360> since<00:01:19.630> we<00:01:19.810> are<00:01:19.840> complex<00:01:20.590> beings<00:01:21.250> and

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
but since we are complex beings and

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.060 
but since we are complex beings and
we're<00:01:21.790> multi-layered<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:22.900> and<00:01:23.170> I<00:01:23.770> think<00:01:23.830> we

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
we're multi-layered and and I think we

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.890 
we're multi-layered and and I think we
can<00:01:24.520> certainly<00:01:24.880> do<00:01:25.120> that<00:01:25.150> but<00:01:25.600> we<00:01:25.720> have<00:01:25.870> to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
can certainly do that but we have to

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.000 
can certainly do that but we have to
actually<00:01:26.410> exercise<00:01:26.800> that<00:01:27.220> so<00:01:27.790> what<00:01:28.480> what<00:01:29.260> and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
actually exercise that so what what and

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.990 
actually exercise that so what what and
that<00:01:30.520> is<00:01:31.980> the<00:01:32.980> idea<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.340> you're<00:01:33.640> three

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
that is the idea that you're three

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.260 
that is the idea that you're three
people<00:01:34.360> at<00:01:34.510> once

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.899 

you<00:01:38.270> know<00:01:38.420> person<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:40.450> content<00:01:41.450> provider

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
you know person a is content provider

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.539 
you know person a is content provider
person<00:01:43.909> B<00:01:44.119> is<00:01:44.619> you<00:01:45.619> know<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:46.280> the

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
person B is you know is the

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.460 
person B is you know is the
communications<00:01:47.360> guy<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:48.020> know<00:01:48.140> that<00:01:48.320> does

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
communications guy you know that does

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.639 
communications guy you know that does
the<00:01:48.649> that<00:01:49.220> does<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:50.299> executing<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.380> the

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
the that does the executing of the

the that does the executing of the
content<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:53.360> hardest<00:01:54.020> thing<00:01:55.000> for<00:01:56.000> any

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
content and the hardest thing for any

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.210 
content and the hardest thing for any
one<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.320> us<00:01:57.500> is<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:59.210> get<00:01:59.450> to<00:02:00.140> person<00:02:00.590> C<00:02:00.890> who<00:02:01.100> is

one of us is to get to person C who is

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.429 
one of us is to get to person C who is
the<00:02:01.340> receptor<00:02:01.960> of<00:02:02.960> what<00:02:03.170> is<00:02:03.259> being

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
the receptor of what is being

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.830 
the receptor of what is being
communicated<00:02:03.970> who<00:02:04.970> actually<00:02:05.210> needs<00:02:05.659> to

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
care about and how much we can actually

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.130 
care about and how much we can actually
stretch<00:02:19.040> our<00:02:19.280> ear<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.910> another<00:02:20.630> part<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.019> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.280 
stretch our ear to another part of the
hall<00:02:21.319> because<00:02:22.250> we<00:02:22.700> usually<00:02:23.170> encompass<00:02:24.170> our

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
hall because we usually encompass our

hall because we usually encompass our
own<00:02:24.530> reality<00:02:25.010> oh<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.340> screwed<00:02:25.819> up<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.180> was
