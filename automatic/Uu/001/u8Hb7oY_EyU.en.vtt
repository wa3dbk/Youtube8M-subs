00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
and this is basically the one way that I

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.180 
and this is basically the one way that I
use<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.719> make<00:00:39.719> money<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.260> between<00:00:40.590> times<00:00:40.890> when

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the bank deposit goes in you can make up

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.119 
the bank deposit goes in you can make up
to<00:00:45.390> ten<00:00:45.420> thousand<00:00:46.020> dollars<00:00:46.260> at<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> time<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
to ten thousand dollars at a time a

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.330 
to ten thousand dollars at a time a
little<00:00:47.820> bit<00:00:48.030> more<00:00:48.239> maybe<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.860> can<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:50.190> it

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
little bit more maybe and you can do it

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.119 
little bit more maybe and you can do it
over<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.730> over<00:00:50.910> again<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> usually<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
over and over again so I usually do it a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.100 
over and over again so I usually do it a
few<00:00:53.309> times<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.760> then<00:00:53.910> go<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> rest

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
few times and then go on with the rest

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.439 
few times and then go on with the rest
of<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.350> storyline<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.489> we're<00:00:57.000> making<00:00:57.149> our

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
of the storyline but we're making our

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.700 
of the storyline but we're making our
way<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.840> down<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> runway

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
way here down the runway

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.130 
way here down the runway
they'll<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.579> basically<00:01:00.210> two<00:01:00.510> turns<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.989> got

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
they'll be basically two turns you got

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.560 
they'll be basically two turns you got
to<00:01:01.260> make<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.680> go<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.910> end<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> runway

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
to make and go to the end of the runway

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.590 
to make and go to the end of the runway
and<00:01:04.280> there<00:01:05.280> will<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.939> airplane<00:01:06.270> hangar

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and there will be the airplane hangar

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.410 
and there will be the airplane hangar
now<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.610> own<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.030> airplane

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
now you do not have to own this airplane

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.050 
now you do not have to own this airplane
hangar<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:09.960> you're<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> point<00:01:11.909> in

the game where you own any airplanes
there<00:01:15.540> will<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:16.080> outside<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.530> little

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
there will be one outside that little

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.890 
there will be one outside that little
airplane<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:18.000> saw<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.360> that's<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.870 
airplane you just saw there that's the
woodpecker<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.619> we're<00:01:20.250> gonna<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.670> again

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
woodpecker and we're gonna see it again

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.340 
woodpecker and we're gonna see it again
here<00:01:21.090> there<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:23.600> any<00:01:24.600> airplane<00:01:25.049> will<00:01:25.200> do

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
here there it is so any airplane will do

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.350 
here there it is so any airplane will do
you<00:01:25.950> jump<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> airplane<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.530> tag<00:01:28.530> off

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you jump in the airplane and tag off

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.410 
you jump in the airplane and tag off
and<00:01:31.340> basically<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.790> you're<00:01:32.910> gonna<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.210> is

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and basically what you're gonna do is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
and basically what you're gonna do is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you're just gonna fly a short period of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.000 
you're just gonna fly a short period of
time<00:01:35.310> you're<00:01:36.120> really<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.600> gonna<00:01:36.810> leave<00:01:37.140> the

time you're really not gonna leave the
airport<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.820> don't<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> go<00:01:39.300> very<00:01:39.450> far

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
actually a few other light poles here

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.650 
actually a few other light poles here
that<00:02:04.890> we<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.220> this<00:02:05.370> with<00:02:05.550> right<00:02:06.390> there

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
that we can do this with right there

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.949 
that we can do this with right there
coming<00:02:07.620> up<00:02:07.760> down<00:02:08.760> below<00:02:08.940> there's<00:02:09.479> those<00:02:09.720> like

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
coming up down below there's those like

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.199 
coming up down below there's those like
hold<00:02:10.229> right<00:02:10.470> there<00:02:10.679> you're<00:02:11.670> gonna<00:02:11.790> go<00:02:12.000> in

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
hold right there you're gonna go in

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.490 
hold right there you're gonna go in
between<00:02:12.540> them<00:02:12.630> that's<00:02:12.810> called<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.050> knife<00:02:13.260> edge

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
between them that's called a knife edge

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
between them that's called a knife edge
when<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> turn<00:02:14.520> sideways<00:02:14.760> like<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.600> your

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
when you turn sideways like that so your

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.470 
when you turn sideways like that so your
barnstorming<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.920> basically<00:02:17.760> at<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.300> end

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
barnstorming and basically at the end

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.090 
barnstorming and basically at the end
you<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.720> keep<00:02:19.020> flying<00:02:19.260> straight<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.830> at<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
you just keep flying straight and at the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.620 
you just keep flying straight and at the
end<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.490> this<00:02:20.610> runway<00:02:20.940> there's<00:02:21.300> gonna<00:02:21.420> be<00:02:21.600> a

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
end of this runway there's gonna be a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.660 
end of this runway there's gonna be a
couple<00:02:21.990> more<00:02:22.140> light<00:02:22.350> poles<00:02:22.620> basically<00:02:23.610> I

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
couple more light poles basically I

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.100 
couple more light poles basically I
think<00:02:23.730> there's<00:02:24.030> six<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.450> them<00:02:24.600> right<00:02:24.630> here<00:02:24.810> do

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
think there's six of them right here do

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.260 
think there's six of them right here do
the<00:02:25.260> knife<00:02:25.440> edge<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.550> knife<00:02:26.730> edge<00:02:27.000> all

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
the knife edge and if you knife edge all

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.780 
the knife edge and if you knife edge all
the<00:02:27.330> way<00:02:27.540> through<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.230> between<00:02:28.740> all<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.550> poles

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
the way through in between all the poles

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.810 
the way through in between all the poles
for<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.480> full<00:02:30.690> distance<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:32.310> will<00:02:32.459> come<00:02:32.640> up

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820
