00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
as well and overall all the greater fuel

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.189 
as well and overall all the greater fuel
efficiency<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.820> more<00:00:57.329> aerodynamics<00:00:58.050> which

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
efficiency from more aerodynamics which

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.049 
efficiency from more aerodynamics which
is<00:00:58.350> certainly<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.070> good<00:00:59.250> but<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
is certainly going to be good but the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.369

biggest<00:01:00.239> change<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.719> fuel<00:01:00.899> efficiency<00:01:00.989> will

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
biggest change in fuel efficiency will

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.979 
biggest change in fuel efficiency will
come<00:01:01.680> from<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> 1.0<00:01:02.670> litre<00:01:02.699> EcoBoost<00:01:03.239> engine

cautious some bigger changes on the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.910 
cautious some bigger changes on the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
inside so let's take a look in there

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.310 
inside so let's take a look in there
inside<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> revised<00:01:18.420> layout<00:01:19.020> that's<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
inside we have a revised layout that's a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
inside we have a revised layout that's a
little<00:01:19.530> bit<00:01:19.619> clean<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> little<00:01:20.070> bit<00:01:20.250> nicer<00:01:20.670> than

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
little bit clean a little bit nicer than

little bit clean a little bit nicer than
before<00:01:21.240> not<00:01:21.450> radically<00:01:21.960> different<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.530> is

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
before not radically different but it is

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.440
