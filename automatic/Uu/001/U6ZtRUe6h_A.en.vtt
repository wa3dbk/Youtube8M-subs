think that one of the greatest gifts of
human<00:01:34.490> interaction<00:01:35.149> is<00:01:35.330> finding<00:01:35.690> out<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:35.960> we

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
human interaction is finding out that we

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
all share the same issues then it's just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.910 
all share the same issues then it's just
a<00:01:38.750> matter<00:01:38.929> of<00:01:39.050> people<00:01:39.410> living<00:01:39.770> together

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
a matter of people living together

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.800 
a matter of people living together
having<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.580> share<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.789> land<00:01:41.149> just<00:01:41.240> leaving<00:01:41.690> to

having to share the land just leaving to
politicians<00:01:42.170> which<00:01:42.470> we've<00:01:42.679> tried<00:01:42.950> for<00:01:43.009> so

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
politicians which we've tried for so

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.880 
politicians which we've tried for so
long<00:01:43.399> is<00:01:43.940> clearly<00:01:44.240> not<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.810> answer

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.100 

finally<00:01:48.890> we<00:01:49.399> begin<00:01:49.819> to<00:01:50.149> perceive<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.929> future

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
finally we begin to perceive the future

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.749 
finally we begin to perceive the future
as<00:01:51.500> something<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:52.300> we<00:01:53.300> can<00:01:53.509> influence<00:01:54.170> I

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
as something that we can influence I

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.399 
as something that we can influence I
just<00:01:55.759> keep<00:01:55.940> going<00:01:56.149> after<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:57.020> what<00:01:57.170> I'm<00:01:57.259> trying

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
just keep going after to what I'm trying

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.590 
just keep going after to what I'm trying
to<00:01:57.590> do<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.069> no<00:01:58.460> matter<00:01:58.640> what<00:01:58.940> I<00:02:01.300> simply<00:02:02.300> and

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
to do and no matter what I simply and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.660 
to do and no matter what I simply and
perhaps<00:02:03.050> in<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.319> silly<00:02:03.560> way<00:02:03.649> I<00:02:03.770> believe<00:02:04.159> that

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
perhaps in a silly way I believe that

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.120 
perhaps in a silly way I believe that
anything<00:02:05.270> can<00:02:05.569> be<00:02:05.720> changed<00:02:05.750> oh<00:02:06.259> I<00:02:06.350> would

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
anything can be changed oh I would

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.080 
anything can be changed oh I would
imagine<00:02:07.369> something<00:02:08.060> without<00:02:08.179> any<00:02:08.600> borders

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
imagine something without any borders

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.759 
imagine something without any borders
you<00:02:11.090> know<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.329> more<00:02:11.600> women<00:02:12.200> are<00:02:12.350> viewed<00:02:12.650> as

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
you know the more women are viewed as

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.949 
you know the more women are viewed as
equals<00:02:13.280> truly<00:02:13.850> equal<00:02:13.970> partners<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.810> more

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
equals truly equal partners the more

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.810 
equals truly equal partners the more
difference<00:02:15.320> we<00:02:15.500> will<00:02:15.709> have<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.489> is<00:02:16.640> the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
difference we will have this is the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.270 
difference we will have this is the
dream<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.090> every<00:02:17.510> one<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.110> our<00:02:18.380> shared<00:02:18.890> spaces

dream of every one of our shared spaces
shared<00:02:19.790> narrative<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.480> think<00:02:20.750> what<00:02:20.930> we<00:02:21.049> need<00:02:21.079> to

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
shared narrative I think what we need to

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:41.600 
shared narrative I think what we need to
get<00:02:21.560> there<00:02:21.799> is<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.489> bit<00:02:22.730> more<00:02:22.880> imagination
