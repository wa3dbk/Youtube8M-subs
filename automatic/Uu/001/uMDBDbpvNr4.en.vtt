00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
stop and I have to cipher spells to get

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.550 
stop and I have to cipher spells to get
things<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.520> right<00:02:08.670> away<00:02:08.819> okay<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.560> trait

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
things going right away okay and trait

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.740 
things going right away okay and trait
doctoring<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> weakest<00:02:11.700> one<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.599> has

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
doctoring is the weakest one but it has

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.350 
doctoring is the weakest one but it has
uses<00:02:13.200> hidden<00:02:13.920> strings<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.459> super<00:02:14.819> powerful<00:02:15.030> if

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
uses hidden strings is super powerful if

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.480 
uses hidden strings is super powerful if
I<00:02:15.450> draw<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.870> it's<00:02:16.200> real<00:02:16.620> hard<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:17.099> me

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
I draw that it's real hard to be me

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.690 
I draw that it's real hard to be me
cuz<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.910> untap<00:02:19.360> lands<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:20.020> just<00:02:20.290> go<00:02:21.190> yeah<00:02:21.490> so

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
cuz I untap lands and just go yeah so

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.220 
cuz I untap lands and just go yeah so
I've<00:02:21.970> kind<00:02:22.210> of<00:02:22.240> lets<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.510> cast<00:02:22.840> multiple

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
I've kind of lets you cast multiple

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.930 
I've kind of lets you cast multiple
spells<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.650> turn<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.460> of<00:02:24.550> course<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
spells in a turn and of course the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.670 
spells in a turn and of course the
cypher<00:02:25.390> mechanic<00:02:25.810> particularly<00:02:26.560> powerful

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
cypher mechanic particularly powerful

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.180 
cypher mechanic particularly powerful
here<00:02:27.130> because<00:02:27.810> whenever<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.960> cipher<00:02:29.410> triggers

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
here because whenever a cipher triggers

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.730 
here because whenever a cipher triggers
it<00:02:30.430> actually<00:02:30.760> counts<00:02:31.600> as<00:02:31.750> targeting<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.440> heroic

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
it actually counts as targeting a heroic

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.040 
it actually counts as targeting a heroic
creature<00:02:33.100> again<00:02:33.520> yep<00:02:33.820> so<00:02:34.270> we<00:02:34.420> get<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.690> heroic

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
creature again yep so we get the heroic

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.630 
creature again yep so we get the heroic
trigger<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.590> then<00:02:35.800> with<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.130> NIV<00:02:36.280> Magus

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
trigger and then with the NIV Magus

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.540 
trigger and then with the NIV Magus
elemental<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.210> can<00:02:37.360> exile<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.430> after<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
elemental you can exile the after the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.760 
elemental you can exile the after the
trigger<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.910> can<00:02:40.030> exile<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:41.170> copy<00:02:41.410> over

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
trigger you can exile the the copy over

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.190 
trigger you can exile the the copy over
the<00:02:41.800> spell<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:43.150> know<00:02:43.240> really<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:44.020> get

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
the spell so you know really you get

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.530 
the spell so you know really you get
bull<00:02:44.410> uses<00:02:44.770> out<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:45.070> each<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.490> those<00:02:45.610> wells<00:02:45.940> I

don't you mentioned a particular
interaction<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.340> thought<00:02:48.520> was<00:02:48.580> really<00:02:48.730> cool

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
interaction that thought was really cool

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.750 
interaction that thought was really cool
with<00:02:49.090> trait<00:02:49.300> doctoring<00:02:49.720> yeah<00:02:50.590> with<00:02:51.340> chain<00:02:51.580> to

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
with trait doctoring yeah with chain to

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.550 
with trait doctoring yeah with chain to
the<00:02:51.790> rocks<00:02:52.060> if<00:02:52.660> they<00:02:52.870> have<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.080> chain<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.470> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
the rocks if they have a chain to the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.710 
the rocks if they have a chain to the
rocks<00:02:53.740> on<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.130> guy<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.310> can<00:02:54.670> then<00:02:55.030> take<00:02:55.570> your

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
rocks on you guy you can then take your

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.780 
rocks on you guy you can then take your
turn<00:02:55.990> trait<00:02:56.440> doctoring<00:02:56.950> change<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.490> a<00:02:57.520> fire

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
turn trait doctoring change it to a fire

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.180 
turn trait doctoring change it to a fire
swamp<00:02:58.210> whatever<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:58.960> then<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.590> falls<00:02:59.890> off<00:03:00.130> the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
swamp whatever and then it falls off the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.730 
swamp whatever and then it falls off the
land<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.750> get<00:03:01.900> your<00:03:02.020> creature<00:03:02.230> back<00:03:02.470> and

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
land and you get your creature back and

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.960 
land and you get your creature back and
then<00:03:02.920> if<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.160> don't<00:03:03.250> have<00:03:03.460> another<00:03:03.640> creature

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
then if you don't have another creature

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.850 
then if you don't have another creature
in<00:03:04.060> play<00:03:04.240> you<00:03:04.750> can<00:03:04.960> cipher<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.650> trade

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
in play you can cipher the trade

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.530 
in play you can cipher the trade
doctoring<00:03:06.340> on<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:07.000> same<00:03:07.270> creature

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
doctoring on to that same creature

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.720 
doctoring on to that same creature
because<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.470> spell<00:03:08.860> resolves<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.490> then<00:03:09.610> the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
because the spell resolves and then the

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.120 
because the spell resolves and then the
cipher<00:03:10.030> happens<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:10.620> treetop<00:03:11.620> stirring<00:03:11.890> and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
cipher happens so treetop stirring and

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.100 
cipher happens so treetop stirring and
it<00:03:12.400> has<00:03:12.550> another<00:03:12.820> thing<00:03:13.120> with<00:03:13.330> master<00:03:14.020> of

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
it has another thing with master of

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.010 
it has another thing with master of
waves<00:03:14.320> oh<00:03:14.560> if<00:03:15.070> Magus<00:03:15.490> is<00:03:15.670> red<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.150> if<00:03:16.720> they<00:03:16.900> have

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
waves oh if Magus is red so if they have

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.110 
waves oh if Magus is red so if they have
master<00:03:17.410> waves<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:18.220> can't<00:03:18.460> just<00:03:18.640> run<00:03:18.850> into

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
master waves you can't just run into

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.550 
master waves you can't just run into
them<00:03:19.240> over<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.540> over<00:03:19.660> again<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.080> you<00:03:20.140> treat

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
them over and over again so you treat

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.130 
them over and over again so you treat
doctoring<00:03:21.070> turn<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.580> green<00:03:22.300> or<00:03:22.690> black

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
doctoring turn it to green or black

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.170 
doctoring turn it to green or black
whatever<00:03:23.470> run<00:03:24.250> right<00:03:24.430> into<00:03:24.460> them<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:24.940> kind<00:03:25.060> of

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
whatever run right into them so kind of

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.000 
whatever run right into them so kind of
some<00:03:25.630> subtle<00:03:25.960> or<00:03:26.050> interactions<00:03:26.590> there<00:03:26.800> yes

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
some subtle or interactions there yes

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.700 
some subtle or interactions there yes
and<00:03:27.580> even<00:03:27.790> blood<00:03:28.180> baron<00:03:28.390> yeah<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.410> change

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
and even blood baron yeah you change

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.430 
and even blood baron yeah you change
