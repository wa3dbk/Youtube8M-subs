 just especially do nothing else well yes 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.880
 sit next to me a lot of ax 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.440
 principle, it is logical and not to notice well 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.790
 no, they somehow stand together 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.870
 probably conspire how to find only 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.480
 me with 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.459
 although I remember you and I were sorting that 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.739
 for the sound of sand 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.459
 Well, yes I remember a friend of mine said that 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.600
 it's like your blows I don't understand me 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.760
 it seems to sense a blow 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.920
 Now a lot of art disassemble such sounds 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.660
 now try wait but I get it yes 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.180
 many blocks right now interrupt 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.130
 yes yes yes here are a lot of blocks I want to kill and 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.410
 In short, these sounds hiv 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.060
 I wondered thought so from said that bad 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.510
 hide in the light becky can find 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:11.460
 but no, I sleep badly first and now I 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:14.580
 found a more suitable place like this 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.380
 so so so much my sweaters and Christmas trees 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.440
 kidneys why do you know when you get along 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:25.250
 relates back but this is because of the internet 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:31.190
 most likely yes yes super fast 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:40.070
 6 hiding one of them and the remaining 90 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:42.620
 90 seconds before the end but it is Acne 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.100

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.080
 esophagus but doubted well let me 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.680

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.380
