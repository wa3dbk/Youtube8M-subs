00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
is as you can see we have this gaping

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.430 
is as you can see we have this gaping
hole<00:04:07.209> here<00:04:07.540> we<00:04:07.750> need<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:07.930> close<00:04:08.799> that<00:04:10.440> select

the upper vertex here move it a bit to
the<00:04:14.709> right<00:04:15.209> okay<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.709> as<00:04:17.709> you<00:04:18.039> can<00:04:18.160> see<00:04:18.370> we

the right okay and as you can see we

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.260 
the right okay and as you can see we
have<00:04:18.700> made<00:04:19.660> this<00:04:19.930> upper<00:04:20.919> vertex<00:04:21.579> a<00:04:21.760> Bezier

green vertex here to the precise middle

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.580 
green vertex here to the precise middle
here<00:04:28.050> that's<00:04:29.050> one<00:04:29.380> step<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:29.950> then<00:04:30.190> go<00:04:30.340> back<00:04:30.550> go

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
here that's one step and then go back go

one vertex lower and as you can see we

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.020 
one vertex lower and as you can see we

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
have this green vertusair sticking out

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.700 
have this green vertusair sticking out
all<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.690> right<00:04:37.840> we<00:04:37.960> don't<00:04:38.080> need<00:04:38.289> that<00:04:38.500> we

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
all to the right we don't need that we

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.100 
all to the right we don't need that we
want<00:04:38.919> to

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
drag this to the middle so we can also

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.030 
drag this to the middle so we can also
