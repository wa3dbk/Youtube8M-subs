00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.090
 hello friends how are you I hope that well 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.800
 I am super droid and well then today 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.420
 we are with a mod for what would be 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.300
 minecraft and 0.11 points 0 14 and this mode 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.880
 for it is the way of too many dense 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.100
 but if this mode is not the mode that 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.289
 has previously brought and is not the 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.859
 complement that we had at 0.10 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.409
 point 5 you could say that it is therefore a 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.149
 merge between those two mods and how can 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:39.320
 see this would be the way that is pretty 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.930
 great as you can see 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.360
 well here we would have what would be all 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.850
 the blocks and we are then created it 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.890
 a developer of mods for in the city 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.390
 which is called word trade in the 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.100
 description of the video as it will be 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.840
 channel if you want to spend as 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.879
 Well, it has several mods that are very 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.860
 great and good then here as they can 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.590
 see if we press this little button that 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.449
 We have here , what is displayed 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.610
 it would be here and all the objects of the 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.380
 minecraft and to add us then just 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.600
 just touch what would be the object 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.640
 that we want to add and for this part 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.590
 As you can see we have four sections 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.110
 a serious to be day or night 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.090
 but at this moment, they are not made to me 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.610
 it does not change me day or night 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.979
 because then this world I always have 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.080
 from day to day this heart would be for 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.899
 add us life and this here is for 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.000
 change creative urbiÃ³n now well 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.950
 this part that we have here like this 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.530
 armor and we press it then it comes out 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.770
 this box and here is to add us 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.200
 what would be an an item with his and of 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.630
 customized for now so to speak 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.969
 let's add what is he 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.789
 the glass and here we will choose in the 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.039
 amount of about 40 and well then here 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.710
 it would be what the damage would be but this 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.479
 item because we do not care in this and it's 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.340
 in what would be the damage here we are going to 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.399
 add and as you can see I already added 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.780
 what would be glass or glass and 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.030
 Well, this is pretty 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.250
 great since then what goes 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.530
 it would be the complement of too many events 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.479
 we can have this mod that is 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.489
