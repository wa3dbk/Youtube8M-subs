00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.680 
today I'm going to show you how to tell
if<00:00:21.650> your<00:00:21.800> shocks<00:00:22.250> or<00:00:22.520> struts<00:00:22.550> are<00:00:23.060> worn<00:00:23.300> out<00:00:23.480> on

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
if your shocks or struts are worn out on

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.440 
if your shocks or struts are worn out on
your<00:00:23.870> car<00:00:24.490> now<00:00:25.490> in<00:00:25.610> the<00:00:25.670> case<00:00:25.850> of<00:00:25.880> this<00:00:26.210> Dodge

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
your car now in the case of this Dodge

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.240 
your car now in the case of this Dodge
it's<00:00:26.750> pretty<00:00:26.960> easy<00:00:27.140> to<00:00:27.320> tell<00:00:27.590> it<00:00:27.800> to<00:00:27.830> run<00:00:28.100> out

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
it's pretty easy to tell it to run out

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.910 
it's pretty easy to tell it to run out
cuz<00:00:28.820> when<00:00:29.000> you<00:00:29.120> go<00:00:29.270> over<00:00:29.540> bumps<00:00:29.750> like<00:00:30.020> this<00:00:30.290> hey

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
cuz when you go over bumps like this hey

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.150 
cuz when you go over bumps like this hey
the<00:00:31.910> whole<00:00:32.029> car<00:00:32.330> just<00:00:32.570> bounces<00:00:33.380> up<00:00:33.680> and<00:00:34.010> down

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
the whole car just bounces up and down

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.540 
the whole car just bounces up and down
and<00:00:34.760> up<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:35.239> down<00:00:35.680> but<00:00:36.680> many<00:00:36.890> times<00:00:37.130> it's<00:00:37.400> not

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
and up and down but many times it's not

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.880 
and up and down but many times it's not
that<00:00:37.820> easy<00:00:38.030> to<00:00:38.210> tell<00:00:38.510> so<00:00:39.080> if<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:39.380> drive<00:00:39.620> and

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
that easy to tell so if you drive and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.010 
that easy to tell so if you drive and
say<00:00:40.070> forty<00:00:40.640> or<00:00:40.760> fifty<00:00:40.940> miles<00:00:41.300> an<00:00:41.570> hour<00:00:41.720> and

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
say forty or fifty miles an hour and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.320 
say forty or fifty miles an hour and
your<00:00:42.440> car<00:00:42.680> runs<00:00:42.950> straight<00:00:43.309> but<00:00:43.910> then<00:00:44.030> when<00:00:44.239> you

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
your car runs straight but then when you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.270 
your car runs straight but then when you
hit<00:00:44.480> bumps<00:00:44.750> then<00:00:45.470> you<00:00:45.620> find<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.040> steering

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
hit bumps then you find the steering

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.490 
hit bumps then you find the steering
wheel<00:00:46.610> starts<00:00:47.120> to<00:00:47.270> shake<00:00:47.540> until<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:48.080> gets<00:00:48.260> not

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
wheel starts to shake until it gets not

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.730 
wheel starts to shake until it gets not
bumpy<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.580> struts<00:00:49.910> are<00:00:50.059> one<00:00:50.270> then<00:00:50.510> two<00:00:50.840> or<00:00:51.620> if

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
bumpy the struts are one then two or if

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.110 
bumpy the struts are one then two or if
you're<00:00:51.860> backing<00:00:52.280> up<00:00:52.400> and<00:00:52.579> you<00:00:52.640> hear<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.820> clunk

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
you're backing up and you hear a clunk

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.490 
you're backing up and you hear a clunk
like<00:00:53.420> this<00:00:54.670> coming<00:00:55.670> from<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:55.910> back<00:00:56.470> then<00:00:57.470> you

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
like this coming from the back then you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.440 
like this coming from the back then you
know<00:00:57.770> that<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.130> back<00:00:58.340> struts<00:00:58.790> are<00:00:58.970> worn<00:00:59.239> and

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
know that the back struts are worn and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.930 
know that the back struts are worn and
clunking<00:00:59.960> now<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:00.950> last<00:01:01.370> way<00:01:01.610> to<00:01:01.640> check

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
clunking now the last way to check

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.120 
clunking now the last way to check
struts<00:01:02.300> a<00:01:02.450> simple<00:01:02.870> just<00:01:03.440> go<00:01:03.560> under<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:03.950> wheel

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.130 
struts a simple just go under the wheel

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.880 
struts a simple just go under the wheel
well<00:01:04.399> pick<00:01:05.360> up<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.660> top<00:01:05.869> tuned<00:01:06.170> on<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.590> strut

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
well pick up the top tuned on the strut

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.600 
well pick up the top tuned on the strut
and<00:01:07.160> feel<00:01:07.610> inside<00:01:08.060> on<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.450> rod<00:01:08.660> and<00:01:09.460> if<00:01:10.460> your

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
and feel inside on the rod and if your

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.270 
and feel inside on the rod and if your
fingers<00:01:11.000> come<00:01:11.180> out<00:01:11.330> oily<00:01:12.020> like<00:01:12.200> this<00:01:12.470> it<00:01:12.979> means

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
fingers come out oily like this it means

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.950 
fingers come out oily like this it means
the<00:01:13.399> seal<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:13.910> wearing<00:01:14.240> out<00:01:14.360> on<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.660> Strada

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
the seal is wearing out on the Strada

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.670 
the seal is wearing out on the Strada
it's<00:01:15.229> time<00:01:15.440> for<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.710> new<00:01:15.890> one<00:01:17.200> now<00:01:18.200> when<00:01:18.380> I<00:01:18.410> was

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
it's time for a new one now when I was

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.490 
it's time for a new one now when I was
young<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.130> dinosaurs<00:01:19.700> roamed<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.240> earth

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
young and dinosaurs roamed the earth

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.660 
young and dinosaurs roamed the earth
suspension<00:01:21.500> systems<00:01:21.890> were<00:01:22.040> easier<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.460> check

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
suspension systems were easier to check

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.280 
suspension systems were easier to check
as<00:01:22.850> most<00:01:23.060> cars<00:01:23.299> had<00:01:23.479> just<00:01:23.690> simple<00:01:24.020> shock

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
as most cars had just simple shock

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.350 
as most cars had just simple shock
absorbers<00:01:24.890> they<00:01:25.310> did<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.520> bolt<00:01:25.729> on<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.000> top<00:01:26.030> and

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
absorbers they did a bolt on the top and

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.570 
absorbers they did a bolt on the top and
the<00:01:26.420> bottom<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:26.810> held<00:01:27.110> them<00:01:27.200> in<00:01:27.320> place<00:01:27.590> and

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
the bottom that held them in place and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.950 
the bottom that held them in place and
to<00:01:28.700> check<00:01:28.940> them<00:01:29.090> on<00:01:29.210> all<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.510> had<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.659> do<00:01:29.810> is

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
to check them on all you had to do is

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.050 
to check them on all you had to do is
push<00:01:30.170> on<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.530> car<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.100> if<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.549> bounced<00:01:31.760> too

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
push on the car and if it bounced too

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.149 
push on the car and if it bounced too
much<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:32.600> was<00:01:32.930> worn<00:01:33.200> out<00:01:33.350> but<00:01:33.770> with<00:01:33.920> modern

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
much it was worn out but with modern

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.510 
much it was worn out but with modern
McPherson<00:01:34.970> struts<00:01:35.330> that<00:01:35.510> most<00:01:35.900> cars<00:01:36.260> use<00:01:36.619> it's

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
McPherson struts that most cars use it's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.000 
McPherson struts that most cars use it's
often<00:01:37.880> more<00:01:38.030> complicated<00:01:38.810> because<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.770> shock

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
often more complicated because the shock

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.550 
often more complicated because the shock
assembly<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:40.640> built<00:01:40.880> inside<00:01:41.180> it<00:01:41.479> but<00:01:42.290> it<00:01:42.380> has<00:01:42.530> a

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
assembly is built inside it but it has a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.859 
assembly is built inside it but it has a
spring<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.340> even<00:01:43.610> when<00:01:43.880> it's<00:01:44.000> worn<00:01:44.240> out<00:01:44.390> it

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
spring and even when it's worn out it

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.260 
spring and even when it's worn out it
can<00:01:45.080> still<00:01:45.380> not<00:01:45.590> bounce<00:01:45.890> all<00:01:46.280> that<00:01:46.549> bad<00:01:46.820> and

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
can still not bounce all that bad and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.880 
can still not bounce all that bad and
that's<00:01:47.570> why<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:47.900> need<00:01:48.080> to<00:01:48.200> test<00:01:48.439> them<00:01:48.590> fully

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
that's why you need to test them fully

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.500 
that's why you need to test them fully
like<00:01:49.189> I'm<00:01:49.369> showing<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:49.760> in<00:01:50.000> this<00:01:50.090> video

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
like I'm showing you in this video

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.710 
like I'm showing you in this video
because<00:01:51.470> worn<00:01:51.950> struts<00:01:52.369> can<00:01:53.180> make<00:01:53.330> your<00:01:53.479> tires

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
because worn struts can make your tires

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.710 
because worn struts can make your tires
wear<00:01:54.049> out<00:01:54.080> faster<00:01:54.799> they<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:55.700> affect<00:01:56.150> braking

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
wear out faster they can affect braking

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.810 
wear out faster they can affect braking
and<00:01:56.869> make<00:01:57.080> it<00:01:57.229> less<00:01:57.439> safe<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.040> they<00:01:58.640> can

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
and make it less safe and they can

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.359 
and make it less safe and they can
certainly<00:01:59.119> affect<00:01:59.659> handling<00:02:00.369> especially

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
certainly affect handling especially

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.260 
certainly affect handling especially
when<00:02:01.580> your<00:02:01.729> cornering<00:02:02.240> whoa<00:02:03.970> now<00:02:04.970> I've<00:02:05.090> been

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
when your cornering whoa now I've been
