00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
innovation isn't necessarily a common

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.370 
innovation isn't necessarily a common
word<00:00:27.119> but<00:00:27.570> that's<00:00:27.840> what<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.050> pride<00:00:28.259> ourselves

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
word but that's what we pride ourselves

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.589 
word but that's what we pride ourselves
on<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.009> when<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.730> decided<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.150> do<00:00:30.270> higher<00:00:30.449> but

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
on so when we decided to do higher but

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.429 
on so when we decided to do higher but
we<00:00:30.689> wanted<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.930> do<00:00:31.020> something<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.320> was

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
we wanted to do something that was

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.020 
we wanted to do something that was
actually<00:00:31.560> completely<00:00:32.009> different<00:00:32.430> from<00:00:32.879> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
actually completely different from the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.759 
actually completely different from the
norm<00:00:33.269> of<00:00:33.449> what<00:00:33.600> you're<00:00:33.750> you're<00:00:34.230> used<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.620> but

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:34.769 
norm of what you're you're used to but

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.340 
norm of what you're you're used to but
still<00:00:34.980> kind<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.220> feel<00:00:35.370> similar<00:00:36.080> it's<00:00:37.080> probably

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
still kind of feel similar it's probably

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.380 
still kind of feel similar it's probably
the<00:00:37.470> biggest<00:00:37.680> thing<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.010> separates<00:00:38.550> hybrid

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the biggest thing that separates hybrid

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.210 
the biggest thing that separates hybrid
is<00:00:39.540> its<00:00:39.900> combat<00:00:40.230> focus<00:00:40.379> movement<00:00:40.949> and<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.100> with

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
is its combat focus movement and so with

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.500 
is its combat focus movement and so with
combat<00:00:41.460> focus<00:00:41.610> movement<00:00:42.150> instead<00:00:42.330> of

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
combat focus movement instead of

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.750 
combat focus movement instead of
controlling<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.769> movement<00:00:43.890> specifically

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
controlling the movement specifically

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.819 
controlling the movement specifically
you<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.449> look<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:45.839> a<00:00:45.870> cover<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.410> press<00:00:46.650> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
you just look at a cover and press a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.259 
you just look at a cover and press a
your<00:00:47.190> character<00:00:47.460> will<00:00:47.489> automatically<00:00:48.150> go

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
your character will automatically go

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.450 
your character will automatically go
there<00:00:48.510> if<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.470> press<00:00:49.619> B<00:00:49.830> they'll<00:00:50.339> actually

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
there if you press B they'll actually

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.700 
there if you press B they'll actually
retreat<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.269> you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
retreat and you can actually with the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.250 
retreat and you can actually with the
left<00:00:52.920> stick<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.309> control<00:00:53.869> on<00:00:54.869> the<00:00:55.080> path

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
left stick you can control on the path

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.899 
left stick you can control on the path
where<00:00:55.530> they're<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.339> as<00:00:56.489> they're<00:00:56.699> flying

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
where they're going so as they're flying

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.700 
where they're going so as they're flying
to<00:00:57.150> cover<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.930> move<00:00:58.049> kind<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.379> strife

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
to cover they can move kind of strife

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.780 
to cover they can move kind of strife
and<00:00:58.979> and<00:00:59.129> dodge<00:01:00.500> within<00:01:01.500> their<00:01:01.710> flight<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
and and dodge within their flight the

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.280 
and and dodge within their flight the
game<00:01:02.939> actually<00:01:03.089> doesn't<00:01:03.479> have<00:01:03.659> any<00:01:03.989> ground

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
game actually doesn't have any ground

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.200 
game actually doesn't have any ground
movement<00:01:04.680> except<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.430> strafing<00:01:05.760> within

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
movement except for strafing within

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.789 
movement except for strafing within
cover<00:01:11.750> while<00:01:12.750> you're<00:01:12.990> moving<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.619> can

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
cover while you're moving you can

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.410 
cover while you're moving you can
actually<00:01:14.100> change<00:01:14.310> directions<00:01:14.700> mid-flight<00:01:15.240> so

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
actually change directions mid-flight so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.910 
actually change directions mid-flight so
you're<00:01:15.540> not<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.689> locked<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.409> one<00:01:16.619> cover

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
you're not just locked to that one cover

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.010 
you're not just locked to that one cover
so<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.700> very<00:01:17.729> fluid<00:01:18.119> very<00:01:18.299> very<00:01:18.479> intuitive

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
so very very fluid very very intuitive

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.830 
so very very fluid very very intuitive
very<00:01:19.650> very<00:01:19.710> simple<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.730> it<00:01:21.000> makes<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.330> strategy

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
very very simple but it makes a strategy

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.860 
very very simple but it makes a strategy
very<00:01:22.080> very<00:01:22.320> deep<00:01:22.530> because<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.940> fact<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.270> you

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
very very deep because the fact that you

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.480 
very very deep because the fact that you
can't<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.350> go<00:01:25.530> anywhere<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.340> be

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
can't just go anywhere you have to be

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.750 
can't just go anywhere you have to be
very<00:01:26.520> purposeful<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.360> your<00:01:27.480> movement

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.450 

statist<00:01:35.770> what's<00:01:36.770> really<00:01:37.010> cool<00:01:37.160> about<00:01:37.220> this

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
statist what's really cool about this

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.680 
statist what's really cool about this
game<00:01:37.700> is<00:01:37.730> that<00:01:37.910> because<00:01:38.210> we<00:01:38.720> have<00:01:38.990> kind<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:40.010> a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
game is that because we have kind of a

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.750 
game is that because we have kind of a
focused<00:01:41.690> kind<00:01:41.870> of<00:01:41.960> movement<00:01:42.190> we<00:01:43.190> can<00:01:43.370> allow

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
focused kind of movement we can allow

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.180 
focused kind of movement we can allow
people<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.210> go<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.020> upside<00:01:45.470> down<00:01:45.590> cover<00:01:45.800> or<00:01:46.040> to

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
people to go to upside down cover or to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.400 
people to go to upside down cover or to
wall<00:01:46.400> cover<00:01:47.020> seamlessly<00:01:48.020> without<00:01:48.140> any

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
wall cover seamlessly without any

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.540 
wall cover seamlessly without any
problems<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:48.830> they<00:01:48.860> just<00:01:48.950> select<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.430> and

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
problems so they just select it and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.060 
problems so they just select it and
they'll<00:01:49.670> go<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.940> they'll<00:01:50.030> go<00:01:50.150> upside<00:01:50.390> down<00:01:51.070> we

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
they'll go and they'll go upside down we

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.400 
they'll go and they'll go upside down we
also<00:01:52.280> have<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.670> killstreak<00:01:53.510> system<00:01:53.960> called

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
also have a killstreak system called

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.260 
also have a killstreak system called
drone<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:55.670> you've<00:01:55.760> seen<00:01:55.910> a<00:01:55.940> few<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.180> them

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
drone and so you've seen a few of them

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.700 
drone and so you've seen a few of them
before<00:01:56.420> this<00:01:56.720> is<00:01:56.930> kind<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:57.230> like<00:01:57.290> robot

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
before this is kind of like robot

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.800 
before this is kind of like robot
looking<00:01:57.950> characters<00:01:58.460> that<00:01:58.610> fly<00:01:58.790> around<00:01:58.820> when

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
looking characters that fly around when

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.300

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
actually using the source engine so this

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.040 
actually using the source engine so this
is<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:10.850> this<00:04:10.940> isn't<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.270> home<00:04:11.390> run<00:04:11.630> engine<00:04:11.870> but

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
is it this isn't a home run engine but

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.600 
is it this isn't a home run engine but
it's<00:04:12.140> heavily<00:04:12.350> modified<00:04:12.650> is<00:04:13.040> actually

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
it's heavily modified is actually

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.040 
it's heavily modified is actually
running<00:04:13.700> 60<00:04:14.090> frames<00:04:14.270> a<00:04:14.390> second<00:04:14.720> we<00:04:14.780> actually

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
running 60 frames a second we actually

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.930 
running 60 frames a second we actually
thought<00:04:15.170> that<00:04:15.410> with<00:04:16.040> a<00:04:16.070> multiplayer<00:04:16.640> shooter

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
thought that with a multiplayer shooter

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.630 
thought that with a multiplayer shooter
that's<00:04:17.209> really<00:04:17.660> important<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.950> get<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.519> kind

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
that's really important to get the kind

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.110 
that's really important to get the kind
of<00:04:19.760> smooth<00:04:20.120> gameplay<00:04:20.989> going<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.790> so<00:04:22.790> we<00:04:22.880> spend

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
of smooth gameplay going and so we spend

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.810 
of smooth gameplay going and so we spend
a<00:04:23.150> lot<00:04:23.180> of<00:04:23.360> time<00:04:23.480> you<00:04:24.080> know<00:04:24.430> optimizing<00:04:25.430> and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
a lot of time you know optimizing and

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.130 
a lot of time you know optimizing and
