00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
little more mall at the end it's kind of

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.520

bitter

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
bitter

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.109

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.240 
it doesn't finish very clean no it's
good<00:01:43.329> I<00:01:43.479> mean<00:01:43.659> it's<00:01:44.079> tasty<00:01:44.500> counters<00:01:45.100> the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
good I mean it's tasty counters the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.899 
good I mean it's tasty counters the
maltiness<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.789> little<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.329> think<00:01:47.110> I<00:01:47.319> would

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
maltiness a little I think I would

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.389 
maltiness a little I think I would
probably<00:01:48.909> prefer<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.899> tiger<00:01:50.350> beer<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:54.159> it's

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
probably prefer the tiger beer but it's

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.949 
probably prefer the tiger beer but it's
this<00:01:54.729> is<00:01:54.789> definitely<00:01:55.119> multi<00:01:55.509> of<00:01:55.569> the<00:01:55.659> tiger

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
this is definitely multi of the tiger

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.059 
this is definitely multi of the tiger
but<00:01:56.049> it's<00:01:56.229> got<00:01:56.350> its<00:01:56.500> got<00:01:56.709> a<00:01:56.770> little<00:01:56.950> more

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
but it's got its got a little more

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.730 
but it's got its got a little more
flavor<00:01:57.280> seems<00:01:57.640> more<00:01:57.850> complex<00:01:58.600> right<00:01:59.289> but<00:01:59.590> I'm

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
flavor seems more complex right but I'm

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.570
