tutorial here at rifle productions we

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.380 
tutorial here at rifle productions we
are<00:00:19.050> working<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.590> cycles<00:00:20.420> 2.66<00:00:21.420> blender<00:00:23.390> what

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
are working on cycles 2.66 blender what

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.320 
are working on cycles 2.66 blender what
we're<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.869> be<00:00:24.990> doing<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:26.029> modeling<00:00:27.029> and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
we're going to be doing is modeling and

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.790 
we're going to be doing is modeling and
arch<00:00:28.260> that's<00:00:28.770> correct<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:30.350> if<00:00:31.350> you<00:00:31.470> saw<00:00:31.619> my

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
arch that's correct and if you saw my

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.030 
arch that's correct and if you saw my
tutorial<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.579> how<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:32.999> make<00:00:33.449> a<00:00:33.780> disc

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
tutorial on how to make a disc

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.250 
tutorial on how to make a disc
such<00:00:36.760> as<00:00:37.030> this<00:00:37.300> one<00:00:38.280> then<00:00:39.280> you'll<00:00:39.940> know<00:00:40.230> how<00:00:41.230> to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
such as this one then you'll know how to

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:51.520 
such as this one then you'll know how to
do<00:00:41.590> it

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.980 

okay<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:53.220> dusk<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.180> will<00:00:54.480> find<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.960> quite

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 
okay so this dusk you will find is quite

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.050 
okay so this dusk you will find is quite
useful<00:00:55.380> I<00:00:55.620> mentioned<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.130> be<00:00:56.430> use<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.550> LPS

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
useful I mentioned it can be use for LPS

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.930 
useful I mentioned it can be use for LPS
and<00:00:57.180> CDs<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:57.810> obviously<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.860> thing<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.640> can

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
and CDs but obviously one thing that can

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.740 
and CDs but obviously one thing that can
be<00:01:00.120> used<00:01:00.150> for<00:01:00.540> as<00:01:00.660> well<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.080> creating<00:01:02.040> an<00:01:02.130> arch

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
be used for as well is creating an arch

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.930 
be used for as well is creating an arch
alright<00:01:03.750> um<00:01:04.050> very<00:01:05.040> quickly<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.640> we're<00:01:05.790> going

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
alright um very quickly what we're going

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.580 
alright um very quickly what we're going
to<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.840> select<00:01:07.320> these<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.940> lower

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
to do is just select these the lower

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.700 
to do is just select these the lower
vertices<00:01:11.870> alright<00:01:12.870> and<00:01:13.260> we're<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
vertices alright and we're going to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.960 
vertices alright and we're going to
extend<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.640> bottom<00:01:15.390> okay<00:01:16.050> now<00:01:16.730> using<00:01:17.730> box

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
extend the bottom okay now using box

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.850 
extend the bottom okay now using box
select<00:01:18.300> again<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.990> could<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.380> grab<00:01:19.560> this

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
select again we could just grab this

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.540 
select again we could just grab this
along<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.400> z-axis<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:22.040> extend<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.160> out<00:01:23.280> there

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
along the z-axis and extend it out there

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.250 
along the z-axis and extend it out there
but<00:01:23.700> you'll<00:01:23.850> notice<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.300> this<00:01:24.630> edge<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:24.930> is

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
but you'll notice that this edge here is

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.109 
but you'll notice that this edge here is
shot<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.950> may<00:01:26.130> want<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.550> in<00:01:26.700> certain<00:01:26.910> cases

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
shot you may want that in certain cases

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.160 
shot you may want that in certain cases
but<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.710> preferably<00:01:29.310> needs<00:01:29.850> rather<00:01:30.840> make<00:01:31.140> it

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
but it preferably needs rather make it

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.730 
but it preferably needs rather make it
in<00:01:31.380> Mersin<00:01:32.090> around<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.270> day<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.560> we'll

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
in Mersin around the day and so we'll

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.660 
in Mersin around the day and so we'll
just<00:01:34.770> extrude<00:01:35.550> it<00:01:35.640> along<00:01:35.940> Z<00:01:36.210> much<00:01:37.080> better

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
just extrude it along Z much better

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.990 
just extrude it along Z much better
great<00:01:38.670> now<00:01:39.590> I'm<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:41.160> to<00:01:41.340> select<00:01:41.580> all<00:01:41.940> of

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
great now I'm going to select all of

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.310 
great now I'm going to select all of
those<00:01:42.800> day<00:01:43.800> I'm<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> go<00:01:44.580> into<00:01:44.940> side<00:01:45.330> view

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
those day I'm going to go into side view

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.150 
those day I'm going to go into side view
and<00:01:46.910> extrude<00:01:47.910> this<00:01:48.119> along<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.750> y-axis<00:01:51.050> great

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
and extrude this along the y-axis great

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.620 
and extrude this along the y-axis great
we<00:01:54.260> can<00:01:55.260> go<00:01:55.440> into<00:01:55.590> smooth<00:01:56.040> shading<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.820> you'll

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
we can go into smooth shading and you'll

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.750 
we can go into smooth shading and you'll
notice<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.230> we<00:01:58.440> have<00:01:58.470> this<00:01:58.760> strange

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
notice that we have this strange

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.940 
notice that we have this strange
appearance<00:02:00.570> don't<00:02:01.140> worry<00:02:01.290> about<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.740> too

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
appearance don't worry about that too

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.600 
appearance don't worry about that too
much<00:02:01.980> yet<00:02:02.840> I'm<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.320> select<00:02:04.980> all<00:02:05.220> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
much yet I'm going to select all the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.880 
much yet I'm going to select all the
vertices<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.110> make<00:02:07.290> sure<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.710> we

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
vertices and just to make sure that we

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.759 
vertices and just to make sure that we
have<00:02:08.040> no<00:02:08.220> doubles<00:02:08.640> let's<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.149> that

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
have no doubles let's do that

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.949 
have no doubles let's do that
okay<00:02:10.769> nothing<00:02:11.190> there<00:02:12.239> alright<00:02:13.140> now<00:02:14.630> let's<00:02:15.630> add

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
okay nothing there alright now let's add

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.449 
okay nothing there alright now let's add
a<00:02:16.380> subdivision<00:02:16.820> surface<00:02:17.820> modifier<00:02:19.250> we<00:02:20.250> need

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
a subdivision surface modifier we need

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.789 
a subdivision surface modifier we need
to<00:02:20.580> do<00:02:20.760> now<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.239> just<00:02:22.700> sort<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.120> base<00:02:24.590> sort<00:02:25.590> out

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
to do now is just sort the base sort out

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.060 
to do now is just sort the base sort out
the<00:02:26.130> bottom<00:02:26.670> there<00:02:28.459> selecting<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.580> faces<00:02:30.150> and

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
the bottom there selecting the faces and

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.840 
the bottom there selecting the faces and
basically<00:02:33.440> correct<00:02:34.519> now<00:02:35.660> we're<00:02:36.660> going<00:02:36.840> to

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
basically correct now we're going to

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.840 
basically correct now we're going to
back<00:02:38.850> into<00:02:39.090> Bertha's<00:02:39.660> vertex<00:02:40.410> mode<00:02:41.070> we're

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
back into Bertha's vertex mode we're

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.820 
back into Bertha's vertex mode we're
just<00:02:42.030> going<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.360> select<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:45.290> horizontal<00:02:46.290> loop

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
just going to select a horizontal loop

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.430 
just going to select a horizontal loop
cuts<00:02:47.190> may<00:02:47.700> create<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.150> loop<00:02:48.390> cut<00:02:48.600> they<00:02:48.870> bring

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
cuts may create a loop cut they bring

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.949 
cuts may create a loop cut they bring
that<00:02:49.620> down<00:02:49.890> we'll<00:02:50.340> bring<00:02:50.519> this<00:02:50.700> yeah<00:02:51.180> down

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.370 

they<00:02:54.959> go<00:02:55.860> into<00:02:56.010> side<00:02:56.370> view<00:02:56.790> again<00:02:57.780> will<00:02:57.989> create

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
they go into side view again will create

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.660 
they go into side view again will create
a<00:02:58.440> loop<00:02:58.709> cut

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
a loop cut

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.230 
a loop cut
and<00:02:59.760> bring<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:00.959> day<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.730> bring<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.760> new<00:03:02.970> cut

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
and bring that day and bring a new cut

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:11.660 
and bring that day and bring a new cut
they<00:03:05.270> write<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:09.170> grammar<00:03:10.170> smiles<00:03:10.560> edx's<00:03:11.459> I

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
they write and grammar smiles edx's I

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.960 
they write and grammar smiles edx's I
