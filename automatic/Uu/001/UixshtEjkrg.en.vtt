screenshot on-screen now then you

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.510 
screenshot on-screen now then you
obviously<00:00:20.960> have<00:00:21.380> no<00:00:21.560> idea<00:00:21.890> what<00:00:22.040> I'm<00:00:22.130> talking

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
obviously have no idea what I'm talking

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.900 
obviously have no idea what I'm talking
about

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
about

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.429 
about
however<00:00:23.450> those<00:00:23.599> of<00:00:23.630> you<00:00:23.750> who<00:00:23.930> have<00:00:24.169> you<00:00:24.410> know

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
however those of you who have you know

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.470 
however those of you who have you know
that<00:00:24.860> this<00:00:25.009> is<00:00:25.220> actually<00:00:25.669> a<00:00:25.700> screenshot<00:00:26.239> from

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
that this is actually a screenshot from

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.290 
that this is actually a screenshot from
minecraft<00:00:26.960> ps3<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:28.160> you<00:00:28.610> can<00:00:28.790> clearly<00:00:29.149> see

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
minecraft ps3 and you can clearly see

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.330 
minecraft ps3 and you can clearly see
that<00:00:29.540> there<00:00:29.809> is<00:00:29.869> a<00:00:29.989> texture<00:00:30.590> pack<00:00:30.770> on<00:00:31.009> this

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
that there is a texture pack on this

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.910 
that there is a texture pack on this
world<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.599> this<00:00:32.780> is<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:33.020> equivalent<00:00:33.590> of<00:00:33.710> the

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
world so this is the equivalent of the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.400 
world so this is the equivalent of the
plastic<00:00:34.550> texture<00:00:34.940> pack<00:00:35.149> on<00:00:35.390> minecraft<00:00:35.960> Xbox

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
plastic texture pack on minecraft Xbox

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.770 
plastic texture pack on minecraft Xbox
360<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:37.579> what<00:00:37.730> I've<00:00:37.850> gone<00:00:38.000> ahead<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:38.360> done<00:00:38.570> is

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
360 so what I've gone ahead and done is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.479 
360 so what I've gone ahead and done is
gone<00:00:39.020> on<00:00:39.260> minecraft<00:00:39.829> and<00:00:40.040> I've<00:00:40.130> got<00:00:40.309> this

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
gone on minecraft and I've got this

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.579 
gone on minecraft and I've got this
world<00:00:40.790> here<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:41.570> I<00:00:41.660> will<00:00:41.780> have<00:00:41.960> a<00:00:41.989> link<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.440> the

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
world here and I will have a link to the

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:43.930 
world here and I will have a link to the
download<00:00:42.980> in<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:43.160> description<00:00:43.250> if<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:43.760> want

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
download in the description if you want

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.459 
download in the description if you want
to<00:00:44.030> get<00:00:44.120> this<00:00:44.239> map<00:00:44.420> for<00:00:44.570> yourself<00:00:44.929> but

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
to get this map for yourself but

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:46.990 
to get this map for yourself but
essentially<00:00:45.949> this<00:00:46.039> map<00:00:46.250> just<00:00:46.429> allows<00:00:46.730> me<00:00:46.760> to

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
essentially this map just allows me to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.579 
essentially this map just allows me to
show<00:00:47.149> you<00:00:47.210> what<00:00:47.629> all<00:00:47.809> of<00:00:47.839> the<00:00:48.050> blocks<00:00:48.320> look

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
show you what all of the blocks look

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.560 
show you what all of the blocks look
like<00:00:48.800> on<00:00:48.980> this<00:00:49.280> texture<00:00:49.609> pack<00:00:49.699> so<00:00:50.269> for<00:00:50.480> those

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
like on this texture pack so for those

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.450 
like on this texture pack so for those
of<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:50.749> on<00:00:50.899> ps3<00:00:51.289> obviously<00:00:51.949> you<00:00:52.039> can<00:00:52.160> see<00:00:52.309> in

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
of you on ps3 obviously you can see in

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.950 
of you on ps3 obviously you can see in
the<00:00:52.550> background<00:00:52.969> what<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.210> texture<00:00:53.539> pack<00:00:53.749> is

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
the background what the texture pack is

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.139 
the background what the texture pack is
going<00:00:54.199> to<00:00:54.320> look<00:00:54.499> like<00:00:54.530> on<00:00:54.859> your<00:00:55.039> world<00:00:55.309> as<00:00:55.579> well

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149

as what all of the blocks will look like

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.130 
as what all of the blocks will look like
when<00:00:58.219> you<00:00:58.309> apply<00:00:58.609> the<00:00:58.670> texture<00:00:59.059> pack<00:00:59.329> now<00:00:59.839> this

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
when you apply the texture pack now this

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.599 
when you apply the texture pack now this
is<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:00.440> first<00:01:00.649> texture<00:01:01.039> pack<00:01:01.280> for<00:01:01.489> minecraft

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
is the first texture pack for minecraft

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.759 
is the first texture pack for minecraft
PlayStation<00:01:02.420> 3<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:02.749> we<00:01:02.870> don't<00:01:03.109> entirely<00:01:03.559> know

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
PlayStation 3 so we don't entirely know

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.980 
PlayStation 3 so we don't entirely know
how<00:01:04.100> much<00:01:04.280> it's<00:01:04.460> going<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.730> cost<00:01:04.840> however<00:01:05.840> if<00:01:05.930> I

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
how much it's going to cost however if I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.780 
how much it's going to cost however if I
had<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.500> guess<00:01:06.770> I<00:01:07.040> would<00:01:07.190> say<00:01:07.370> that<00:01:07.400> it<00:01:07.580> will<00:01:07.700> be

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
had to guess I would say that it will be

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.670 
had to guess I would say that it will be
the<00:01:07.909> exact<00:01:08.240> same<00:01:08.420> price<00:01:08.659> it<00:01:08.840> is<00:01:08.900> on<00:01:09.050> Xbox<00:01:09.470> and

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
the exact same price it is on Xbox and

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.370 
the exact same price it is on Xbox and
if<00:01:10.070> I'm<00:01:10.159> not<00:01:10.310> mistaken<00:01:10.700> that<00:01:10.850> price<00:01:11.150> is<00:01:11.390> $1<00:01:11.870> I'm

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
if I'm not mistaken that price is $1 I'm

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.780 
if I'm not mistaken that price is $1 I'm
sure<00:01:12.680> you're<00:01:12.800> probably<00:01:13.040> wondering<00:01:13.490> when<00:01:13.670> is

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
sure you're probably wondering when is

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.250 
sure you're probably wondering when is
this<00:01:13.910> going<00:01:14.120> to<00:01:14.240> be<00:01:14.330> coming<00:01:14.630> out<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:14.990> when<00:01:15.170> am

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
this going to be coming out and when am

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.420 
this going to be coming out and when am
I<00:01:15.350> going<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.710> be<00:01:15.800> able<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:15.980> change<00:01:16.220> the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
I going to be able to change the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.580 
I going to be able to change the
textures<00:01:16.850> on<00:01:17.030> my<00:01:17.210> world<00:01:17.480> well<00:01:18.140> I<00:01:18.170> don't

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
textures on my world well I don't

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.590 
textures on my world well I don't
entirely<00:01:19.010> know<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.640> release<00:01:19.910> date<00:01:20.240> I<00:01:20.420> would

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
entirely know the release date I would

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.540 
entirely know the release date I would
assume<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:21.200> it<00:01:21.290> will<00:01:21.380> either<00:01:21.590> be<00:01:21.710> on<00:01:22.100> or

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
assume that it will either be on or

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.070 
assume that it will either be on or
before<00:01:22.790> to<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:23.390> 14

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
before to you 14

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.660 
before to you 14
I<00:01:24.110> would<00:01:24.500> guess<00:01:24.650> it'll<00:01:24.860> come<00:01:24.920> out<00:01:25.070> before<00:01:25.310> to

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
I would guess it'll come out before to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.610 
I would guess it'll come out before to
you<00:01:25.760> 14<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:26.480> probably<00:01:26.900> middle<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.290> this<00:01:27.380> month

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
you 14 so probably middle of this month

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.710 
you 14 so probably middle of this month
we<00:01:28.190> will<00:01:28.400> be<00:01:28.580> seeing<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.000> release<00:01:29.270> of<00:01:29.480> the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
we will be seeing the release of the

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.510 
we will be seeing the release of the
plastic<00:01:30.140> texture<00:01:30.500> pack<00:01:30.680> on<00:01:30.920> minecraft

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
plastic texture pack on minecraft

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.150 
plastic texture pack on minecraft
PlayStation<00:01:32.060> 3<00:01:32.300> so<00:01:33.080> I<00:01:33.110> think<00:01:33.320> with<00:01:33.710> that<00:01:33.740> said

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
PlayStation 3 so I think with that said
