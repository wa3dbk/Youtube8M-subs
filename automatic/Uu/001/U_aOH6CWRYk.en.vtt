00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
is a mouthful but it helps you figure

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.999 
is a mouthful but it helps you figure
out<00:00:11.519> which<00:00:11.730> part<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.179> Dells<00:00:12.840> laptop<00:00:13.469> line<00:00:13.769> this

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
out which part of Dells laptop line this

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.460 
out which part of Dells laptop line this
is<00:00:14.070> first<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:14.849> an<00:00:14.969> Inspiron<00:00:15.540> as<00:00:15.750> opposed<00:00:16.350> to

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
is first it's an Inspiron as opposed to

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.460 
is first it's an Inspiron as opposed to
the<00:00:16.590> more<00:00:16.740> high-end<00:00:16.980> XPS<00:00:17.789> line<00:00:18.289> secondly<00:00:19.289> it's

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
the more high-end XPS line secondly it's

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.830 
the more high-end XPS line secondly it's
an<00:00:19.590> Inspiron<00:00:19.949> 17<00:00:20.520> which<00:00:20.640> means<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.119> big<00:00:21.300> 17

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
an Inspiron 17 which means it's a big 17

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.870 
an Inspiron 17 which means it's a big 17
inch<00:00:22.050> desktop<00:00:22.380> replacement<00:00:23.189> that's<00:00:23.640> not<00:00:23.850> a

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
inch desktop replacement that's not a

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.370 
inch desktop replacement that's not a
size<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.269> really<00:00:24.510> even<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.140> often

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
size we really even see that often

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.700 
size we really even see that often
anymore<00:00:25.939> then<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.150> an<00:00:27.330> Inspiron<00:00:27.810> are<00:00:28.080> which

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
anymore then it's an Inspiron are which

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.769 
anymore then it's an Inspiron are which
is<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.310> regular<00:00:29.460> old<00:00:29.699> Inspiron<00:00:30.300> line<00:00:30.330> as

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
is just a regular old Inspiron line as

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.200 
is just a regular old Inspiron line as
opposed<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.349> Inspiron<00:00:31.859> z<00:00:32.189> line<00:00:32.460> which<00:00:33.090> is

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
opposed to the Inspiron z line which is

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.299 
opposed to the Inspiron z line which is
a<00:00:33.239> little<00:00:33.510> bit<00:00:33.630> thinner<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.260> haves<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> z-axis

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
a little bit thinner I haves the z-axis

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.020 
a little bit thinner I haves the z-axis
and<00:00:36.000> finally<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.930> an<00:00:37.140> Inspiron<00:00:37.680> are<00:00:37.920> se<00:00:38.790> which

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and finally is an Inspiron are se which

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.060 
and finally is an Inspiron are se which
stands<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.570> assume<00:00:40.140> special<00:00:40.620> edition

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
stands for I assume special edition

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.680 
stands for I assume special edition
which<00:00:41.550> means<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.969> they've<00:00:42.090> actually<00:00:42.450> packed

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
which means that they've actually packed

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.900 
which means that they've actually packed
some<00:00:42.870> higher-end<00:00:43.230> components<00:00:44.100> into<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:44.820> is

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
some higher-end components into what is

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
some higher-end components into what is
basically<00:00:45.270> their<00:00:45.480> more<00:00:45.660> budget<00:00:46.079> priced<00:00:46.410> body

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
basically their more budget priced body

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.310 
basically their more budget priced body
and<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.940> first<00:00:48.180> reaction<00:00:48.690> I've<00:00:48.870> gotten<00:00:49.170> from
