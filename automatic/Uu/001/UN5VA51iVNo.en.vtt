00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
doing this with a flash drive you can

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.289 
doing this with a flash drive you can
get<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.100> off<00:01:08.280> your<00:01:08.460> hard<00:01:08.670> drive<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.119> have

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
your save editor and go ahead just load

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.200 
your save editor and go ahead just load

now as you can see the same editors

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.560 
now as you can see the same editors
pretty<00:01:43.920> basic<00:01:44.160> it's<00:01:44.550> even<00:01:44.760> easier<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.120> use<00:01:45.210> in

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
pretty basic it's even easier to use in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.390
