00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.980
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.980
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.980
 Hmm 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:20.330
 I am a guitar instructor at Ride Guitar Music School. 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:25.820
 I hope to explain the pentatonic scale in this video 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:28.040
 This pentatonic scale is often used especially in rock genres 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.150
 Is a scale 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.230
 US Well then scale minor who introduce even that scale say when Well previous videos 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.970
 Scale 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.320
 Well this is also Kedomo I have a variety because basically the scale is the configuration of seven sound 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.150
 I'm sorry but in fact Pentatonix 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.680
 The mail is composed of individual sounds 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:52.730
 So Well Kedomo I have a sense that well five So you Tteyuu that penta its 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.980
 It is named pentatonic scale with what say are made in one of the musical scale 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.500
 You have 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.750
 In other words, what consists of five sounds in one octave is the Enteronic scale 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.020
 Please understand that 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:11.050
 So if you divide this pentatonic scale roughly 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:15.999
 It is divided into a mediator pentatonic scale and a binder pentatonic scale 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:20.469
 The fender tonic scale actually has major and minor 

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:23.300
 In fact, in the genre of the rock system and say either by Naa pentatonic scale 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:27.630
 I think you often use 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:32.219
 English rock system = minor pentatonic scale 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.450
 Even though it is not too much exaggeration by well by Naa Pentatonic scale is better 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.750
 I think it will be used 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.060
 This minor pentatonic scale is 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.020
 by Naa scale Masu Tei made to the original 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.850
 The second brother of the minor scale and say what it 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.409
 Those composed of the sixth sound five sound disconnect the two sounds 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.340
 Filer pentatonic it's scale 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.690
 If you try to pull 1 young 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.000
 I would like to draw a minor scale 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.010
 ano ang N 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.630
 I This is a minor scale 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:15.320
 Well then the minor pentatonic scale was beaten ahead 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:19.600
 And say what will happen because removing the minor scale of the two-th brother sixth sound a 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.600
 The second of minor scale is 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:33.959
 This is of minor scale minute and since the sixth sound Well I really become a 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:40.590
 The third door at the same of the sixth Well 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.159
 The five sounds from which two objects are removed become a minor pentatonic scale 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.819
 I will 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.819
 Well I want to play a minor pentatonic once 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:59.500
 This is a scale like this, so a minor pentatonic scale is 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:07.769
 it will be in the configuration with No. 2 eyes and sixth of the sound of a minor scale 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:07.769
 Speaking of how the arrangement of the sound is made first of all 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.200
 Yes 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:21.349
 Say prima facie version 1 o 1 o 1 o version of one sound in such a way that 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.710
 That are made It is the distance between the interval 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:28.750
 It will be a minor pentatonic scale 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:32.920
 [musics] 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.990
 If you can remember the minor pentatonic scale inevitably 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:41.040
 It is the same as learning the Meder Pentatonic Scale 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:46.620
 This way of thinking was also that previous movie 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:52.770
 I talked to say that it is a major scale and a minor scale This is the same component notes 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:56.980
 If you do not understand the meaning with a child for a moment, you should have a look at the previous video 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:00.519
 But yes, major and minor scales go through the beginning 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.239
 I told you that it was just different and made up of the same composition. 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:08.980
 In fact is we say the same thing of this pentatonic scale 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.319
 Under the name penta tonic scale and the minor pentatonic scale is exactly the same component notes 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.329
 It is possible 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:17.430
 The minor pentatonic scale, as it will have the same configuration with different beginning sounds. 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:21.389
 It is inevitable if you learn 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.470
 I One example is that the main Dja pentatonic scale comes to play 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.310
 given that 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.820
 a minor pentatonic scale and c major pentatonic scale 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.430
 I did not know 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.430
 First of all, if I try to subtract a minor pentatonic scale 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.510
 a minor pentatonic scale now c major pentatonic 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.810
 The scale is 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.810
 Be 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:49.960
 It means that in fact it has the same configuration again 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:54.660
 Yes, so the US major pentatonic scale minor pentatonic put this 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:58.880
 Please also remember this time to say that it is the same configuration proposed by the sound of the beginning is different only 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:02.390
 [musics] 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:06.770
 So that's three things in this video 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:12.440
 I think that I want you to remember as point first one, but say something when Peddotonikku 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:13.040
 The scale is composed of five sounds and the second one is 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.870
 Speaking of 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:23.850
 The component sounds of the pentatonic scale are temporarily 1 o 1 o 1 o 1 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:28.170
 Is that is made of this It is the distance between the interval of sound 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.010
 And the third one is the minor pentatonic scale and the vague penta 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:34.320
 Help tonic 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:36.289
 This is exactly the same scale and only the sound is different. 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.559
 Because it is also a configuration 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:44.059
 If you can remember the full pentatonic scale, inevitably 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:48.229
 Please keep in mind that also play as anyone that the main Dja pentatonic scale 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:53.020
 In this video, I hope you will remember these three things 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:55.860
 Beneath Thank you very much this time even if I received your watch by that 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.860
