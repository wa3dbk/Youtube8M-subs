start<00:01:03.960> out<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:05.549> know<00:01:05.670> basic<00:01:06.090> kind

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
start out with the you know basic kind

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.350 
start out with the you know basic kind
of<00:01:06.509> sketchy<00:01:07.500> form<00:01:08.100> actually<00:01:08.759> in<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.149> one<00:01:09.329> I

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
of sketchy form actually in this one I

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.499 
of sketchy form actually in this one I
didn't<00:01:09.719> go<00:01:09.869> too<00:01:09.930> much<00:01:10.350> into<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:11.240> you<00:01:12.240> know<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
didn't go too much into a you know the

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.440 
didn't go too much into a you know the
basic<00:01:12.869> sketch<00:01:13.140> form<00:01:13.649> I<00:01:14.149> just<00:01:15.149> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.329> went

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
basic sketch form I just kind of went

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.760 
basic sketch form I just kind of went
right<00:01:15.630> into<00:01:15.780> sort<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.200> jewel<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> body

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
right into sort of jewel in the body

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.249 
right into sort of jewel in the body
because<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> pretty<00:01:17.340> easy<00:01:17.430> pose<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.390> didn't

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
because it's a pretty easy pose I didn't

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.010 
because it's a pretty easy pose I didn't
feel<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.590> needed<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:20.479> really<00:01:21.479> sketch<00:01:21.840> in

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
feel like I needed to really sketch in

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.260 
feel like I needed to really sketch in
much<00:01:22.200> skeletal<00:01:22.860> structure<00:01:23.159> stuff<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:24.149> I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
much skeletal structure stuff like I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.330 
much skeletal structure stuff like I
usually<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.409> know<00:01:25.500> usually<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
usually do you know usually do more of a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.859 
usually do you know usually do more of a
rough<00:01:26.549> thing<00:01:26.789> when<00:01:26.969> I<00:01:27.000> first<00:01:27.240> start<00:01:27.539> out<00:01:27.630> just

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
rough thing when I first start out just

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.539 
rough thing when I first start out just
to<00:01:28.020> kind<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> feel<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:28.979> them<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
to kind of get a feel for them for the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.819 
to kind of get a feel for them for the
pose<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.789> everything<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.780> one<00:01:30.960> had<00:01:31.799> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
pose and everything but this one had a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.529 
pose and everything but this one had a
good<00:01:32.100> idea<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.520> how<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.759> want<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.420> my

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
good idea of how I want it to be in my

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.779 
good idea of how I want it to be in my
head<00:01:34.219> unfortunately<00:01:35.219> i<00:01:35.250> don't<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.700> like

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
head unfortunately i don't really like

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.240 
head unfortunately i don't really like
the<00:01:36.270> end<00:01:36.450> result<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.229> much<00:01:37.469> it<00:01:37.950> came<00:01:38.159> out

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the end result all that much it came out

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.609 
the end result all that much it came out
okay<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:39.479> i<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:40.320> could<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.530> been

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
okay but i think it could have been

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.370 
okay but i think it could have been
better<00:01:40.680> i<00:01:41.159> may<00:01:41.609> be<00:01:41.670> more<00:01:42.450> powerful<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.079> i<00:01:43.170> would

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
better i may be more powerful if i would

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.370 
better i may be more powerful if i would
have<00:01:43.409> pulled<00:01:44.280> her<00:01:44.640> hip<00:01:45.030> back<00:01:45.420> away<00:01:45.990> from<00:01:46.049> us

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
have pulled her hip back away from us

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.100 
have pulled her hip back away from us
like<00:01:46.619> twisted<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.250> away<00:01:47.399> from<00:01:47.460> us<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.659> is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
like twisted it away from us that is

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.780 
as to this kind of casual pose
nonetheless<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:05.860> came<00:02:06.070> out<00:02:06.190> kind<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.400> cool<00:02:06.580> I

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
nonetheless I came out kind of cool I

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.630 
nonetheless I came out kind of cool I
did<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.660> forced<00:02:07.990> perspective<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.770> forest

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
did a forced perspective a forest

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.010 
did a forced perspective a forest
perspective<00:02:10.149> is<00:02:10.270> when<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.509> make<00:02:10.630> something<00:02:10.660> a

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
perspective is when you make something a

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.510 
perspective is when you make something a
lot<00:02:11.170> larger<00:02:11.350> than<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.800> would<00:02:11.920> be<00:02:12.070> even<00:02:12.250> if<00:02:12.400> you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
lot larger than it would be even if you

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.490 
lot larger than it would be even if you
had<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.910> close<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.300> your<00:02:13.420> face<00:02:13.600> leaving

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
had it that close to your face leaving

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.930 
had it that close to your face leaving
with<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.680> gun<00:02:14.860> was<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.160> close<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.580> my<00:02:15.700> face

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
with that gun was that close to my face

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.020 
with that gun was that close to my face
and<00:02:16.470> her<00:02:17.470> body<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:18.070> everything<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.520> when<00:02:18.940> it

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
and her body and everything this when it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.320 
and her body and everything this when it
quite<00:02:19.209> look<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.940> went<00:02:21.940> ahead<00:02:22.060> and

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
quite look like this so I went ahead and

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.480 
quite look like this so I went ahead and
full<00:02:23.080> force<00:02:23.380> of<00:02:23.530> perspective<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.280> think

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
full force of perspective and I think

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.640 
full force of perspective and I think
it's<00:02:24.670> good<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.970> do<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.270> sometimes<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:26.470> in

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
it's good to do that sometimes it in

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.460 
it's good to do that sometimes it in
itself<00:02:27.040> adds<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.970> dramatic<00:02:28.510> pneus<00:02:28.989> to<00:02:29.290> the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
itself adds a dramatic pneus to the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.770 
itself adds a dramatic pneus to the
picture<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.520> adds<00:02:30.760> force<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.420> picture

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
picture it adds force to the picture

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.600 
picture it adds force to the picture
that<00:02:31.930> when<00:02:32.110> otherwise<00:02:32.380> be<00:02:32.709> there<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.370> try

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
that when otherwise be there so you try

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.520 
that when otherwise be there so you try
it<00:02:33.670> sometimes<00:02:34.120> comic<00:02:35.020> books<00:02:35.170> do<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.350> all<00:02:35.440> the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
it sometimes comic books do it all the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.670 
it sometimes comic books do it all the
time<00:02:35.560> like<00:02:35.950> when<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.190> character<00:02:36.940> is<00:02:37.680> facing

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
time like when a character is facing

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.110 
time like when a character is facing
their<00:02:38.830> hand<00:02:39.100> at<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.459> their<00:02:39.730> hand<00:02:39.910> will<00:02:40.000> get

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
their hand at you their hand will get

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.640 
their hand at you their hand will get
really<00:02:40.360> big<00:02:40.540> no<00:02:40.720> force<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.110> perspective

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
really big no force the perspective

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.630 
really big no force the perspective
cartoons<00:02:42.550> do<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.910> as<00:02:43.090> well<00:02:43.120> or<00:02:43.540> anime<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.640> so

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
lips what's cool the advantage of

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.300 
lips what's cool the advantage of
sketching<00:03:19.090> digitally<00:03:19.540> is<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:21.040> could

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
sketching digitally is that you could

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.360 
sketching digitally is that you could
easily<00:03:21.900> erase<00:03:22.900> much<00:03:23.230> easier<00:03:23.650> but<00:03:23.860> also<00:03:24.130> you

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
easily erase much easier but also you

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.160 
easily erase much easier but also you
can<00:03:24.610> resize<00:03:25.000> things<00:03:25.390> so<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.600> can<00:03:25.660> like<00:03:25.870> grab

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
can resize things so you can like grab

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.410 
can resize things so you can like grab
the<00:03:26.320> lips<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.739> just<00:03:26.950> laughs<00:03:27.640> around<00:03:28.030> them<00:03:28.299> and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
the lips and just laughs around them and

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.420 
the lips and just laughs around them and
resize<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:29.650> that<00:03:29.799> comes<00:03:30.040> in<00:03:30.160> handy<00:03:30.250> I

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
resize it and so that comes in handy I

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.560 
resize it and so that comes in handy I
did<00:03:30.580> that<00:03:30.700> with<00:03:30.790> our<00:03:30.850> hand<00:03:31.209> because<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.450> was

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
did that with our hand because I was

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.690 
did that with our hand because I was
having<00:03:31.660> trouble<00:03:32.110> getting<00:03:32.799> how<00:03:33.070> I<00:03:33.100> want<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.519> and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
having trouble getting how I want it and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.300 
having trouble getting how I want it and
so<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.209> just<00:03:34.540> decided<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:35.110> draw<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.440> big<00:03:35.860> first

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
so I just decided to draw it big first

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.500 
so I just decided to draw it big first
and<00:03:36.549> then<00:03:36.640> just<00:03:36.820> shrink<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.150> down<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.330> little

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
and then just shrink it down a little

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.830 
and then just shrink it down a little
bit<00:03:37.830> after<00:03:38.830> I<00:03:39.130> have<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.760> rough<00:03:40.209> sketch<00:03:40.570> in

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
bit after I have the rough sketch in

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.020 
bit after I have the rough sketch in
there<00:03:41.350> then<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.680> go<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.130> go<00:03:42.700> at<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.850> more

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
there then I go and go at a more

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.630 
there then I go and go at a more
finalized<00:03:43.540> sketch<00:03:43.810> now<00:03:44.620> what<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.400> could<00:03:45.610> have

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
finalized sketch now what I could have

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.670 
finalized sketch now what I could have
done<00:03:45.730> here<00:03:46.239> is<00:03:46.269> actually<00:03:46.570> I<00:03:46.780> could<00:03:47.230> have<00:03:47.380> taken

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
done here is actually I could have taken

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.620 
done here is actually I could have taken
that<00:03:47.950> rough<00:03:48.340> sketch<00:03:48.640> before<00:03:49.090> even<00:03:49.299> doing<00:03:49.540> this

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
that rough sketch before even doing this

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.660 
that rough sketch before even doing this
part<00:03:50.049> here<00:03:50.350> I've<00:03:50.500> could<00:03:51.280> have<00:03:51.370> taken<00:03:51.519> that

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
part here I've could have taken that

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.370 
part here I've could have taken that
rough<00:03:51.970> sketch<00:03:52.269> right<00:03:52.510> into<00:03:52.750> illustrator<00:03:52.989> or

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
rough sketch right into illustrator or

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.380 
rough sketch right into illustrator or
whatever<00:03:53.860> I<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.370> do<00:03:54.519> line<00:03:54.730> art<00:03:54.940> with<00:03:55.150> I

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
whatever I like to do line art with I

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.200 
whatever I like to do line art with I
like<00:03:56.049> illustrator<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.739> I<00:03:56.890> could

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
like illustrator and I could

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.180 
like illustrator and I could
then<00:03:57.390> just<00:03:57.840> do<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.200> lineart<00:03:58.410> directly<00:03:59.040> with

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
then just do the lineart directly with

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.750 
then just do the lineart directly with
that<00:03:59.430> so<00:04:00.380> but<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.410> was<00:04:01.830> doing<00:04:02.070> a<00:04:02.130> drawing<00:04:02.310> sketch

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
that so but I was doing a drawing sketch

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.090 
that so but I was doing a drawing sketch
thing<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:03.210> I<00:04:03.240> decided<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:03.750> go<00:04:03.870> ahead<00:04:03.960> and<00:04:04.320> using

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
thing so I decided to go ahead and using

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.890 
thing so I decided to go ahead and using
a<00:04:05.190> three<00:04:06.710> sighs<00:04:07.710> three<00:04:08.160> brush<00:04:08.460> it's<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.540> hard

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
a three sighs three brush it's a hard

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.870 
a three sighs three brush it's a hard
brush<00:04:10.200> size<00:04:10.560> three<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.280> have<00:04:11.490> noise

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
brush size three and I have noise

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.020 
brush size three and I have noise
checked<00:04:12.360> on<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.720> in<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.170> brush<00:04:13.740> brush<00:04:14.370> options

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
checked on it in the brush brush options

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.360 
checked on it in the brush brush options
and<00:04:15.420> this<00:04:16.290> is<00:04:16.410> actually<00:04:16.470> really<00:04:16.680> cool<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.280> get

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and this is actually really cool to get

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.850 
and this is actually really cool to get
a<00:04:17.430> kind<00:04:17.700> of<00:04:17.820> pencil<00:04:18.210> sketch<00:04:18.480> look<00:04:18.810> we<00:04:19.350> just<00:04:19.500> use

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
a kind of pencil sketch look we just use

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.640 
a kind of pencil sketch look we just use
this<00:04:20.070> size<00:04:20.340> for<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.730> whole<00:04:20.910> thing<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:22.530> can

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
this size for the whole thing you can

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.800 
this size for the whole thing you can
get<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:22.890> kind<00:04:23.070> of<00:04:23.100> a<00:04:23.160> neat<00:04:23.300> sketch<00:04:24.300> look<00:04:24.630> with

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
get it kind of a neat sketch look with

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.170 
get it kind of a neat sketch look with
it<00:04:24.960> I<00:04:25.200> made<00:04:25.860> our<00:04:25.980> eyes<00:04:26.130> too<00:04:26.460> far<00:04:26.670> apart<00:04:26.790> at

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
it I made our eyes too far apart at

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.300 
it I made our eyes too far apart at
first<00:04:27.450> but<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:28.020> going<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:28.410> fix<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:28.890> by<00:04:29.250> just

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
first but I going and fix that by just

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.550 
first but I going and fix that by just
grabbing<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.450> eye<00:04:30.570> with<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.960> lasso<00:04:31.260> tool<00:04:31.290> and

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
grabbing the eye with the lasso tool and

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.770 
grabbing the eye with the lasso tool and
moving<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:31.920> again<00:04:32.760> that's<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.150> advantage<00:04:33.390> of

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
moving it again that's the advantage of

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.260 
moving it again that's the advantage of
sketching<00:04:34.320> digitally<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:35.700> really<00:04:35.880> does<00:04:36.060> save

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
sketching digitally it really does save

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.700 
sketching digitally it really does save
a<00:04:36.330> lot<00:04:36.480> of<00:04:36.540> time<00:04:36.660> sketching<00:04:37.170> digitally<00:04:37.680> I

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
a lot of time sketching digitally I

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.320 
a lot of time sketching digitally I
think<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:40.430> mean<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.490> can<00:04:41.640> sketch<00:04:41.850> pretty<00:04:42.090> fast

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
think I mean I can sketch pretty fast

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.060 
think I mean I can sketch pretty fast
with<00:04:42.510> pencil<00:04:42.990> too<00:04:43.230> but<00:04:43.500> sometimes<00:04:43.680> if<00:04:44.010> you

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
with pencil too but sometimes if you

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.700 
with pencil too but sometimes if you
make<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.250> huge<00:04:44.640> error<00:04:44.970> it's<00:04:45.810> like<00:04:45.990> on<00:04:46.140> man<00:04:46.470> it's

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
make a huge error it's like on man it's

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.920 
make a huge error it's like on man it's
like<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:47.430> know<00:04:47.520> but<00:04:48.300> it's<00:04:48.480> all<00:04:48.660> right<00:04:48.690> as<00:04:48.810> long

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
like you know but it's all right as long

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.040 
like you know but it's all right as long
as<00:04:49.200> you<00:04:49.350> lay<00:04:49.980> down<00:04:50.010> your<00:04:50.340> first<00:04:50.900> thing<00:04:51.900> with

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
as you lay down your first thing with

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.110 
as you lay down your first thing with
light<00:04:52.290> color<00:04:52.590> pencil<00:04:53.040> like<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.190> blue<00:04:53.430> pencil<00:04:53.670> or

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
light color pencil like a blue pencil or

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.450 
light color pencil like a blue pencil or
if<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:54.990> lay<00:04:55.170> down<00:04:55.200> your<00:04:55.560> lines<00:04:55.800> just<00:04:56.160> lightly

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
if you lay down your lines just lightly

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.740 
if you lay down your lines just lightly
with<00:04:56.760> a<00:04:56.790> harder<00:04:57.180> edge<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.660> harder<00:04:58.290> lead<00:04:59.750> then

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
with a harder edge a harder lead then

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.900 
with a harder edge a harder lead then
you<00:05:00.960> could<00:05:01.110> easily<00:05:01.290> erase<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.520> know<00:05:02.610> fix

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
you could easily erase and you know fix

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.940 
you could easily erase and you know fix
it<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.150> stuff<00:05:03.420> and<00:05:03.600> then<00:05:03.720> go<00:05:03.960> in<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:04.200> add<00:05:04.410> your

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
it and stuff and then go in and add your

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.550 
it and stuff and then go in and add your
final<00:05:05.880> sketch<00:05:06.090> on<00:05:06.270> top<00:05:06.450> of<00:05:06.630> that<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.380> then

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
final sketch on top of that and then

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.670 
final sketch on top of that and then
scan<00:05:08.070> it<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:08.250> do<00:05:08.670> your<00:05:08.850> inking<00:05:09.180> if<00:05:09.270> you<00:05:09.390> want

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
scan it and do your inking if you want

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.990 
scan it and do your inking if you want
but<00:05:10.680> i<00:05:10.710> think<00:05:11.100> it<00:05:11.190> just<00:05:11.220> saved<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.550> lot<00:05:11.670> of<00:05:11.730> time

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
but i think it just saved a lot of time

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.960 
but i think it just saved a lot of time
if<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:12.440> just<00:05:13.440> do<00:05:13.560> it<00:05:13.680> all<00:05:13.800> digitally<00:05:14.280> but<00:05:14.310> it

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
if you just do it all digitally but it

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.540 
if you just do it all digitally but it
really<00:05:15.210> just<00:05:15.450> depends<00:05:15.780> on<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:15.990> person<00:05:16.490> I'll<00:05:17.490> i

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
really just depends on the person I'll i

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.420 
really just depends on the person I'll i
doing<00:05:17.850> both<00:05:18.030> so<00:05:18.390> i'll<00:05:18.900> still<00:05:19.260> be<00:05:19.380> doing<00:05:19.530> I've

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
doing both so i'll still be doing I've

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.790 
doing both so i'll still be doing I've
you<00:05:20.700> know<00:05:20.730> sketching<00:05:21.330> with<00:05:21.360> live<00:05:21.800> or

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
you know sketching with live or

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.830 
you know sketching with live or
sketching<00:05:23.160> of<00:05:23.250> life<00:05:23.490> it's<00:05:24.090> both<00:05:24.300> live<00:05:24.540> but

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
sketching of life it's both live but

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.030 
sketching of life it's both live but
sketching<00:05:25.200> with<00:05:25.230> pins<00:05:25.500> all<00:05:25.650> still<00:05:25.860> be<00:05:25.950> doing

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
sketching with pins all still be doing

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.040 
sketching with pins all still be doing
that<00:05:26.310> so<00:05:27.300> as<00:05:27.360> you<00:05:27.480> can<00:05:27.540> see<00:05:27.660> I'm<00:05:27.750> just<00:05:27.780> doing<00:05:28.200> a

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
that so as you can see I'm just doing a

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.180 
that so as you can see I'm just doing a
you<00:05:29.979> know<00:05:30.099> hatching<00:05:30.639> shading<00:05:31.440> it<00:05:32.440> just<00:05:32.800> it's

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
you know hatching shading it just it's

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.159 
you know hatching shading it just it's
easier<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:33.520> do<00:05:33.610> with<00:05:34.060> using<00:05:34.479> that<00:05:34.569> small<00:05:34.870> brush

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
easier to do with using that small brush

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.499 
easier to do with using that small brush
on<00:05:35.500> a<00:05:35.560> digital<00:05:36.400> when<00:05:37.300> you're<00:05:37.449> working

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
on a digital when you're working

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.089 
on a digital when you're working
digitally<00:05:37.840> at<00:05:38.110> this<00:05:38.259> it's<00:05:38.470> easier<00:05:38.740> to<00:05:38.830> just<00:05:38.949> do

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
digitally at this it's easier to just do

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.520 
digitally at this it's easier to just do
the<00:05:39.250> hatching<00:05:39.610> type<00:05:39.819> shading<00:05:40.240> than<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:41.199> is<00:05:41.349> to

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
the hatching type shading than it is to

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.920 
the hatching type shading than it is to
try<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:41.770> actually<00:05:41.979> shade<00:05:42.520> fuzz<00:05:43.419> actually

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
try to actually shade fuzz actually

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.820 
try to actually shade fuzz actually
shade<00:05:44.229> then<00:05:44.800> I<00:05:44.919> would<00:05:45.129> just<00:05:45.340> use<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:46.830> bigger

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
shade then I would just use the bigger

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.879 
shade then I would just use the bigger
brush<00:05:48.159> in<00:05:48.550> and<00:05:48.960> make<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.110> more<00:05:50.259> shaded<00:05:50.680> either

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
brush in and make it more shaded either

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.309 
brush in and make it more shaded either
like<00:05:51.039> kinda<00:05:51.310> like<00:05:51.370> a<00:05:51.490> pen<00:05:51.699> shading<00:05:52.210> or<00:05:52.389> just<00:05:52.960> do

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 
like kinda like a pen shading or just do

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.089 
like kinda like a pen shading or just do
a<00:05:53.349> quick<00:05:54.030> speed<00:05:55.030> painting<00:05:55.590> you<00:05:56.590> really<00:05:56.830> can't

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
a quick speed painting you really can't

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.330 
a quick speed painting you really can't
get<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:58.120> know<00:05:58.240> pencil<00:05:58.810> shading<00:05:59.560> shading<00:05:59.949> look

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
get you know pencil shading shading look

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.680 
get you know pencil shading shading look
with<00:06:00.610> digital

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.030 

you<00:06:04.690> kind<00:06:04.900> of<00:06:04.960> can<00:06:05.169> with<00:06:05.350> the<00:06:05.440> blur<00:06:05.590> tool<00:06:05.830> if

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
you kind of can with the blur tool if

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.860 
you kind of can with the blur tool if
you<00:06:06.100> do<00:06:06.250> cross<00:06:06.820> hatching<00:06:07.270> and<00:06:07.360> then<00:06:07.449> blur<00:06:07.660> it

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
you do cross hatching and then blur it

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.140 
you do cross hatching and then blur it
you<00:06:08.590> can<00:06:08.740> kind<00:06:08.949> of<00:06:09.040> get<00:06:09.190> a<00:06:09.220> pencil<00:06:09.460> look<00:06:09.970> like

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
you can kind of get a pencil look like

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.850 
you can kind of get a pencil look like
that<00:06:10.300> and<00:06:10.510> mix<00:06:10.630> between<00:06:10.900> cross<00:06:11.290> hatching<00:06:11.710> and

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
that and mix between cross hatching and

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.890 
that and mix between cross hatching and
blurring<00:06:12.070> but<00:06:13.000> it's<00:06:13.419> really<00:06:13.510> hard<00:06:13.750> to

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
blurring but it's really hard to

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.610 
blurring but it's really hard to
duplicate<00:06:14.050> pencil<00:06:14.770> completely<00:06:15.310> but<00:06:15.610> anyway

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
duplicate pencil completely but anyway

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.140 
duplicate pencil completely but anyway
no<00:06:17.620> reason<00:06:17.830> really<00:06:17.979> to<00:06:18.160> do<00:06:18.370> that<00:06:18.580> anyway<00:06:18.850> if

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
no reason really to do that anyway if

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.460 
no reason really to do that anyway if
you<00:06:19.270> really<00:06:19.510> want<00:06:19.660> the<00:06:19.750> pencil<00:06:20.080> just<00:06:20.260> draw

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
you really want the pencil just draw

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.260 
you really want the pencil just draw
with<00:06:20.680> pencil<00:06:21.040> if<00:06:21.729> you<00:06:21.820> really<00:06:21.940> want<00:06:22.180> that

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
with pencil if you really want that

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.000 
with pencil if you really want that
pencil<00:06:22.870> look<00:06:23.070> so<00:06:24.070> I'm<00:06:24.160> just<00:06:24.310> about<00:06:24.580> done<00:06:24.639> here

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
pencil look so I'm just about done here

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.430 
pencil look so I'm just about done here
adding<00:06:27.010> in<00:06:27.160> some<00:06:27.310> final<00:06:28.270> shading<00:06:28.690> and<00:06:28.870> they've

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
adding in some final shading and they've

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.020 
adding in some final shading and they've
got<00:06:29.470> to<00:06:29.680> fix<00:06:29.919> her<00:06:30.100> eyeball<00:06:30.460> so<00:06:30.760> it<00:06:30.820> was<00:06:30.910> all

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
got to fix her eyeball so it was all

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.020 
got to fix her eyeball so it was all
retarder<00:06:31.449> looking<00:06:32.550> her<00:06:33.550> eyes<00:06:33.729> could<00:06:34.000> have

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
retarder looking her eyes could have

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.930 
retarder looking her eyes could have
been<00:06:34.210> just<00:06:34.240> better<00:06:34.690> in<00:06:34.960> general<00:06:35.250> I<00:06:36.250> could<00:06:36.850> have

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
been just better in general I could have

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.029 
been just better in general I could have
made<00:06:37.120> the<00:06:37.270> mask<00:06:37.510> to<00:06:37.870> wear<00:06:37.900> it<00:06:38.560> didn't<00:06:38.860> cover

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
made the mask to wear it didn't cover

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:40.680 
made the mask to wear it didn't cover
her<00:06:39.220> eyes<00:06:39.250> so<00:06:39.610> much<00:06:39.789> anyway<00:06:40.210> so<00:06:40.270> that's<00:06:40.419> it

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
her eyes so much anyway so that's it

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.960 
her eyes so much anyway so that's it
thank<00:06:40.900> you
