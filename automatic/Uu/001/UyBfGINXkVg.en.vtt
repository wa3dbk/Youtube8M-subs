 thousands of views on youtube 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.540
 hundreds of tastings and comments on 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.849
 facebook and national recognition of 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.060
 caroline carolina overnight 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.090
 kriguer of 38 years saw the social networks 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.660
 overflowing with praise and 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.340
 questionings 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.080
 The reason is first and last name lucas luco 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.060
 carol was the singer's romantic couple in 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.060
 music video of when god wants 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.260
 Braskem graduated in law 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.899
 he had never acted and was a fan of 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.640
 singer before recording the clip she 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.100
 just to know lucas's work 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.649
 after her helper appeared 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.840
 eusébio aida showed the video clip of 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.930
 Mozart music one of the first hits 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.239
 of the singer's career 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.320
 invitation to participate in the recording of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.210
 when God wants 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.609
 emerged from a colleague of the time of the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.850
 college that is friends with the director of the clip 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.409
 at his request carol and saw photos and videos 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.570
 and was selected days later the command 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.220
 but it was so scary as it did not even give 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.939
 time to think that I think if I 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.060
 I had time to think I did not 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.930
 I would have gone to that business since 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.479
 this theme because that's when he called me 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.909
 Friday afternoon and had to speak at the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.750
 Sunday to record the second 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.770
 so I had time to pack things up 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.290
 and send me 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:44.630
 but when I got there on Sunday 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:47.360
 so I stopped to think about it 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.270
 the brusquense uses a wheelchair since 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.100
 23 years old when he suffered a 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.890
 car accident on highway 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.990
 silveira and became tetraplegic 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.450
 carol says that no singer nor 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.759
 say 'if they chose it 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.289
 Because she is a wheelchair, she is not. 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.020
 Do you know if other women 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.039
 The paper also had some 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.670
 physical disability I woke up 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.190
 quadriplegic 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.530
 in fact I have the movement of the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.980
 arms is not but still the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.209
 tetraplegia because it is so is limited and 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.610
 With the hands 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.980
 I have enough limitation is that 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.530
 learn a lot typing with 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.959
 computer to write some more 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.459
 adaptation to write to eat too 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.319
 I have a say in the implementation and I 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.940
 most things but it's enough 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.660
 difficulty 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.970
 Carol spent the 6th and 8th of July 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.910
 recording with the singer in Sorocaba 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.329
 São Paulo, recordings began in 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.340
 morning and stretched until the evening in 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:59.180
 saw there in the condominium closed them 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.000
 I rented a mansion so beautiful I'm very 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.040
 beautiful the house was rented but the owners 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.340
 they were inside right? 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.450
 and then we used the house of inter- 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:16.269
 night to the hotel on the days I was there 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:19.720
 I was there I did not hardly sleep 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.549
 arrived at dawn at the hotel and there 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.880
 I thought it took me two days to 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.590
 realize it right 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.690
 You know when you think it seems like a dream. 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:35.840
 so that's when I would wake up and then 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.900
 days are not really happening too 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.170
 surreal is suddenly a person who 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.200
 never did anything of the kind do a job 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.350
 I consider this a great job. 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.810
 of card 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.130
 with the release of the clip to Carol 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.110
 began to receive a lot of messages 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.690
 Lucas's fans 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.590
 both by facebook and by 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.330
 Instagram 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.610
 now she is struggling to try 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.500
 everyone responds to most 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.910
 questions are about the singer and 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.380
 also has a lot of praise for the 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.880
 her participation 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.550
 the fans it all adding me and the people 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.810
 talk in the face, right? 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:19.050
 and there they are there that envy that anger 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.239
 but not like that but with caring snow 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.270
 Funny, I think they liked it. 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.090
 The less I think I talked to them. 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:31.800
 they played a little bit like this is henrique 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.930
 anger and jealousy but in the background is it not with 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.980
 affection that they came into contact with 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.030
 with me 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.460
 It was really cool in just five days on 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.530
 youtube the video clip has reached more than 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.140
 one million views 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.760
 many of them from the 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.010
 watches every day 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.050
 still trying to believe that he has changed 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.060
 caresses and kisses with the dream of consumption 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.690
 of thousands of fans 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.400
 it is very difficult if they look at the river who 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.520
 not used to it 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.730
 at first i saw it the first time 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.880
 I'm kind of god, right? 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.960
 Shame on me today I'm watching. 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.960
 have all
