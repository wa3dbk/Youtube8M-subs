most<00:02:31.220> scientists<00:02:31.639> agree<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.970> Earth<00:02:32.299> is<00:02:32.540> in

most scientists agree that Earth is in
fact<00:02:32.900> getting<00:02:33.230> warmer<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.769> many<00:02:34.220> suggest

fact getting warmer and many suggest

fact getting warmer and many suggest
that<00:02:34.819> is<00:02:34.970> being<00:02:35.180> caused<00:02:35.420> by<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.690> activities

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290

that is being caused by the activities
on<00:02:36.440> earth<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.200> can<00:02:39.410> play<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.620> big<00:02:39.709> role

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
on earth you and I can play a big role

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.680 
on earth you and I can play a big role
in<00:02:40.190> reducing<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.880> amount<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.180> gas<00:02:41.329> levels

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
in reducing the amount of gas levels

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.240 
in reducing the amount of gas levels
being<00:02:41.870> put<00:02:42.079> in<00:02:42.139> the<00:02:42.200> atmosphere<00:02:42.650> by<00:02:42.859> doing

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
being put in the atmosphere by doing

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.190 
being put in the atmosphere by doing
very<00:02:43.519> simple<00:02:44.000> activity<00:02:44.480> like<00:02:44.810> riding<00:02:45.109> your

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
very simple activity like riding your

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.830 
very simple activity like riding your
bike<00:02:45.440> instead<00:02:45.799> of<00:02:45.920> asking<00:02:46.220> for<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.459> ride

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
bike instead of asking for a ride

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.420 
bike instead of asking for a ride
recycling<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:47.989> turning<00:02:48.590> off<00:02:48.709> unused<00:02:48.980> lights

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
recycling and turning off unused lights

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.400 
recycling and turning off unused lights
so<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.000> guess<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:50.389> could<00:02:50.510> say<00:02:50.690> series<00:02:51.230> is

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
so I guess you could say series is

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.800 
so I guess you could say series is
looking<00:02:51.650> out<00:02:51.769> for<00:02:51.950> us<00:02:52.099> from<00:02:52.370> way<00:02:52.609> up<00:02:52.790> there<00:02:52.819> but

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
looking out for us from way up there but

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.330 
looking out for us from way up there but
we<00:02:53.900> can<00:02:54.049> all<00:02:54.169> do<00:02:54.319> our<00:02:54.349> part<00:02:54.500> right<00:02:55.040> here<00:02:55.069> on

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
we can all do our part right here on

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.159 
we can all do our part right here on
earth<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.519> make<00:02:55.849> sure<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.150> our<00:02:56.359> world<00:02:56.599> stays

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
earth to make sure that our world stays

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.859
