now because your phone have a limited

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.290 
now because your phone have a limited
memory<00:00:07.049> size<00:00:07.350> so<00:00:08.130> you<00:00:08.189> might<00:00:08.460> think<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.030> a

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
memory size so you might think it is a

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.910 
memory size so you might think it is a
good<00:00:09.450> idea<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.960> move<00:00:10.110> some<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.530> apps<00:00:10.679> data

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
have up to 128 gigabytes of memories so

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.420 
have up to 128 gigabytes of memories so
it<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.730> good<00:00:21.539> idea<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.080> move<00:00:22.260> softer<00:00:23.130> apps

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
it is a good idea to move softer apps

it is a good idea to move softer apps
data<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.390> SD<00:00:25.080> card<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.560> some

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
data to the SD card so you have some

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.939 
data to the SD card so you have some
more<00:00:26.010> memory<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.310> your<00:00:26.550> phone<00:00:26.900> now<00:00:27.900> with<00:00:28.199> not

more memory on your phone now with not
to<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.400> first<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:30.539> go<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.960> settings<00:00:31.769> and

to do so first just go to settings and
in<00:00:33.450> settings<00:00:33.480> slow<00:00:34.170> down<00:00:35.660> then<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.780> want<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
in settings slow down then you want to

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.160 
in settings slow down then you want to
go<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.980> applications<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.149> slow<00:00:39.870> down<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
go to the applications so slow down a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.920 
go to the applications so slow down a
bit<00:00:40.469> more<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> application<00:00:42.540> section

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
bit more and in the application section

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.490 
bit more and in the application section
tap<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.379> application<00:00:44.040> manager<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.809> now<00:00:46.440> you

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
tap on application manager and now you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.020 
tap on application manager and now you
can<00:00:46.710> see<00:00:46.890> there<00:00:47.160> are<00:00:47.219> two<00:00:47.370> sections<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:47.910> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
can see there are two sections one is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.700 
can see there are two sections one is
the<00:00:48.149> download<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> SD<00:00:49.289> card<00:00:49.530> as

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the download and one is the SD card as

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.619 
the download and one is the SD card as
they<00:00:50.280> cut<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> app<00:00:50.969> studies<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
they cut out all the app studies on the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.560 
they cut out all the app studies on the
SD<00:00:51.930> card<00:00:51.960> at<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> moment<00:00:52.680> if<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.910> back<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
SD card at the moment if you go back to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.020 
SD card at the moment if you go back to
downloaded<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.410> slow<00:00:56.160> down<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.699> let's<00:00:56.940> say

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
downloaded and slow down so let's say

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.729 
downloaded and slow down so let's say
you<00:00:57.120> want<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.360> move<00:00:57.629> our<00:00:57.899> sample<00:00:58.260> data<00:00:58.289> from

you want to move our sample data from

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.979 
you want to move our sample data from
this<00:00:58.890> particular<00:00:59.100> analytics<00:00:59.910> apps<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.960> can

tap<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.270> then<00:01:03.270> tap<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.570> move<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.350> SD

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
tap on that and then tap on move to SD

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.670 
tap on that and then tap on move to SD
card<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:06.180> then<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.350> some<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.619> the
