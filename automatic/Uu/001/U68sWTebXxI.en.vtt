 crème brûlée descheemaeker geek coconut 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.100
 abers descheemaeker geek and tweaks from 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.570
 at mac 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.100
 these two there look almost similar 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.080
 then created calf a darker hair 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.020
 but mostly crème brûlée and dull and 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.100
 arena is a little iridescent and creme brulee 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.629
 is a little more orange 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.070
 I showed you when I make the make 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.910
 up creme brulee is a bit more orange 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.820
 it looks like 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.350
 I start by putting creme brulee in 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.140
 the hollow so I look a little bit in 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.530
 back and with the brush 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.410
 I just accented the shadow that is 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.330
 already there and you can actually see it 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.830
 he does not look in the pot but he has 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.369
 a little secret orange were burning 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.140
 always but the lighthouse next door but we 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.290
 will not say who gives this result I 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.210
 personally finds and is actually so 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.410
 and so I was a confess I was a 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.060
 little disappointed when I ovaries me 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.320
 Saying no, it's not at all 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.960
 color that I wanted and actually if 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.540
 it's alright It works 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.430
 so that's to make the outside of 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.500
 the eye and even just that I find that 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.540
 super pretty does that with mascaras 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.140
 bim i'm ready not quite 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.740
 but almost 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.970
 then I took a brush that is 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.880
 that I learned I took that one 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.280
 a schema trick with a little bit 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.520
 coconut abers bout and I made the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.200
 lower part of the hollow to give still 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.600
 a little more depth you see I 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.400
 always come back and I'm doing 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.920
 the whole hollow of the inside the outside 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.530
 and again just that I find it 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.580
 very nice game say it at every step 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.019
 then I took aubert cock on a 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.650
 beveled brush to make the line 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.959
 by the way all the time mates along 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.200
 the lash line I did not tell you 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.549
 I put a base as before as I 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.550
 do it every time I have not you 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.460
 shown 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.040
 hop once I did that I took 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.140
 a big brush to put the lighthouse 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.670
 arena and there you go see he's a 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.230
 little more series and finally he is 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.210
 iridescent unlike creme brulee it 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.370
 is irritated but so discreet I 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.760
 find it awesome doing that it's really 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.860
 very very very very very natural and that 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.610
 makes a very smooth eyelid I like 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.550
 a lot 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.020
 if you need to retouch the eye 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.790
 liner you do it and then for the 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.960
 outer corner I took again what good 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.450
 you understood that it was the theme 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.970
 of the day to make this little kid 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.430
 little shadow this little square so we get 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.080
 put on the outside we support well and we 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.310
 come back and then what I like is that 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.510
 you see when we take it with a 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.000
 brush a bit wide 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.830
 it makes a very blurred effect but if we 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.990
 want more pigmented we can have it 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.800
 just taking fairer denser 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.650
 and I know a little bit about 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:24.690
 inside I pick up the brush up the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.070
 first to fade and makes you 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.709
 back and forth colors stamping 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.120
 colors stamping colors stamping 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:36.270
 with the beveled I also made the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.680
 under hard at it then I think that 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.190
 this color on the blue eyes that must 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.190
 to be a slaughter 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.959
 and finally twins the world and if he wants 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.260
 really where it's the darkest and 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.260
 that's all 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.060
 so that with black eyeliner I 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.800
 think it gives dingo and but there I 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.480
 really wanted to put green cocoa in 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.480
 value so I stop there 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.620
 mascara and basta 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.890
 I will start with the pen pote 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.140
 constructivist of mc that here is that 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.800
 I'm going to apply to the finger all over the 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.330
 mobile eyelid 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.950
 I apply it up and down and the 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.870
 peeled management board so that it's a 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.270
 little more clean with a true brush than 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.250
 technics and ben j think my polish it's 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.800
 the 232 at clicquot which was on sale 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.170
 last week a very red red 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.540
 as we like them 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.710
 then the famous cocoa berrer ben yes 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.110
 I do all the eyelid 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.610
 I just thought at first I 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.470
 thought I was 1-1 make it clearer to 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.570
 inside and then and then no I 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:46.270
 find it well alone I'm well beyond 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.620
 voluntarily above the hollow and I 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.920
 also come to put a little bit in 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.920
 under the eye 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.660
 I take the brush that fades and I 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.710
 follow all the outlines 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.390
 after that I had a bit of a dream 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.040
 bricks from mac who on the other hand 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.050
 still very very lively I take it to 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.880
 worth it is to say that I just put the 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.320
 tip of the brush like that it's a 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.700
 brush is afraid of the mark 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.780
 first seven and I made the hollow I 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.750
 just going to make a small transition 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.740
 something a little brighter and I 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.440
 finds that they complement each other well 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.230
 two so the club of clowns the hollow to 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.810
 inside and out in 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.680
 lengthening a little too 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.330
 if you do not have orange it's not 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.030
 very serious it does not play it's not 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.860
 flagrant that it was used either 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.740
 let's move on to my aqua eyeliner 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.710
 blacks i'm going to do line 2 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:42.030
 or tell them they too no movie 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.050
 super and more compact and I'm going 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.550
 try to make a comma that 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.430
 looks pretty much like the one I did 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:51.870
 here and so compared to malines die 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.729
 die to watch I'm not up I'm 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.870
 I kept going down before 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.349
 back up so I'm going to try to do 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.910
 this too 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:02.250
 so I'm a point there and I 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.610
 go down in fact I'm joining the 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:09.300
 bottom eyelash line and after only 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:12.139
 I go back and I think on me it's 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.139
 like that it's prettier 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.710
 and so I'm doing the lining of the bottom and I 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.100
 exceed a little bit by putting my 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.260
 brush vertically on the line in 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:31.510
 below 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:33.400
 I forgot my upper case so that 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.919
 carve liner stays well the whole 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.770
 day they are even more opaque 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.900
 I took the black of the fal is at 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.669
 natural slick make up with a little 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.940
 Beveled brush that has no mark 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:48.220
 and I went all the way back 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.639
 I usually do very often 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.639
 must know 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.470
 I understand a little coco abers and get 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:01.780
 iron over it for mascara 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:05.530
 is going to be the process of cosmetics 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.540
 design paris and hop both pick up 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.979

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:11.950

 eyelids which one does so much 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.460
