00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:14.450
 my name is franky resident real comedy 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.000
 today i will tell you how to behave in 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:22.490
 falling elevator a year and a half ago with 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.910
 I just happened such a story 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.460
 I called the elevator started not to enter and then neither 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.830
 from that one started to fall i was lucky 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.270
 because I was driving in a modern elevator 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.010
 modern elevator has a property 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.629
 stop by yourself 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.760
 connects such self stop and 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.760
 but after this incident it became interesting 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.010
 what to do if the hatch is really 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.340
 falls I became interested read 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.040
 several facts and learned ridiculous things 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.640
 then how to escape and at that moment when 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.309
 falls elevator interesting facts according to version 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.430
 Moi drop coals of birds is 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.559
 literally two seconds is if you fly 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.210
 6 from the fifth floor if you fly from 17 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.030
 floor elevator accelerates and fall 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.860
 is only 3 seconds and participants 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.530
 advise in these three seconds constantly 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.350
 jump big ridiculousness is to rest 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.720
 kicking both walls and expect 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.380
 that when the elevator falls you sleep peacefully 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.210
 eat up that recommend you 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.890
 I recommend these facts that I managed 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.080
 to dig 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.680
 recommend you fall to the floor 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.380
 to lay flat 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.950
 two seconds not much nonsense 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.880
 Of course, but just suffer 2 seconds you 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.310
 lie on the floor 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.910
 impact area becomes accordingly 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.620
 more and you don't break anything you just 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.180
 and landed 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.860
 this is one of the options is real 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.860
 option which people say works 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 if you suddenly had your hand 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.070
 such a big jacket 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.930
 fast just 2 seconds and remind 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:06.229
 throw it on the floor and as comfortable as possible 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.450
 come up on this floor take some 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.480
 comfortable posture 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.970
 that falling out was fun on 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.630
 in fact the more time you put 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.340
 spawn sex 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.959
 say the less will be hit on 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.790
 some particular part of the body that is 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.080
 it will hurt everywhere 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.310
 no little bit option number two if u 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.350
 you had a bag at hand 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.140
 be sure to put it under your head 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.769
 way depreciation hit them was 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.769
 will not hurt so much 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.680
 There are options that I personally think 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.970
 completely absurd for example rest 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.250
 arms and legs of the elevator wall as for me 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.230
 it just is not possible 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.000
 Great king in the second it is necessary 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.220
 orient what you need to lay out 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.349
 that the elevator is already falling and the third time to 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.660
 do this there is another option like 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.260
 just what participants are talking about 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:03.230
 jump if you bounce you have 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.360
 one chance in a million to jump 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.630
 exactly at that moment when it was 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:14.000
 necessary in Europe took care of people 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.980
 and now in the elevators have made such myself 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.120
 the perch looks like this 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.730
 how is the lamp here now 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.160
 so that a person in a falling elevator could 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.560
 catch your hands raise your legs and so 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.420
 I donâ€™t feel a blow to the ground 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.310
 tips that I managed to find you 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.310
