00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
in there to see what there is I'm not

in there to see what there is I'm not
really<00:00:41.290> sure<00:00:41.410> in<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:42.250> back<00:00:42.400> all<00:00:42.640> we<00:00:42.850> have<00:00:43.030> is

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
really sure in the back all we have is

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.570 
really sure in the back all we have is
preload<00:00:43.690> as<00:00:43.870> adjustability<00:00:44.320> so<00:00:44.590> obviously<00:00:45.460> at

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
preload as adjustability so obviously at

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.299 
preload as adjustability so obviously at
some<00:00:45.640> point<00:00:46.170> provided<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.380> forks<00:00:47.770> are<00:00:47.950> the

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
some point provided the forks are the

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.850 
some point provided the forks are the
same<00:00:48.610> you<00:00:49.540> could<00:00:49.750> put<00:00:49.930> surrogate<00:00:50.380> Forks<00:00:50.680> into

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
same you could put surrogate Forks into

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.820 
same you could put surrogate Forks into
this<00:00:51.070> from<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.370> 675<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.330> also<00:00:52.809> a<00:00:52.839> 675<00:00:53.350> shock

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
this from the 675 and also a 675 shock

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.009 
this from the 675 and also a 675 shock
if<00:00:54.430> that<00:00:54.790> bolts<00:00:55.089> in<00:00:55.269> then<00:00:55.480> you've<00:00:55.600> got<00:00:55.780> pretty

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
if that bolts in then you've got pretty

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.420 
if that bolts in then you've got pretty
cheap<00:00:56.290> upgrades<00:00:56.739> on<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.010> bikes<00:00:57.190> fully

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
cheap upgrades on the bikes fully

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.030 
cheap upgrades on the bikes fully
adjustable<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.089> that<00:00:58.870> will<00:00:59.050> make<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.350> a<00:00:59.470> lot

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
adjustable and that will make it a lot

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.680 
adjustable and that will make it a lot
better<00:01:00.100> of<00:01:00.519> a<00:01:00.610> ride<00:01:00.850> so<00:01:01.150> let's<00:01:01.420> get<00:01:01.540> some

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
better of a ride so let's get some

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.079 
better of a ride so let's get some
measure<00:01:01.870> in<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.170> see<00:01:02.290> what<00:01:02.440> we<00:01:02.530> got<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.940> right

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
measure in and see what we got all right

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.010 
measure in and see what we got all right
with<00:01:04.239> Dave<00:01:04.390> on<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.629> bike<00:01:04.780> at<00:01:04.960> 180<00:01:05.650> pounds

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
with Dave on the bike at 180 pounds

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.399 
with Dave on the bike at 180 pounds
we're<00:01:08.020> using<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:10.090> end<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.510> axle<00:01:10.930> here<00:01:11.230> and

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
we're using the end of the axle here and

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:18.480 
we're using the end of the axle here and
go<00:01:11.560> into<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.950> top<00:01:12.220> of<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:13.120> heel<00:01:13.360> guard<00:01:17.490> so

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
go into the top of the heel guard so

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.640 
go into the top of the heel guard so
we're<00:01:19.090> at<00:01:19.240> 50<00:01:19.600> millimetres<00:01:20.140> of<00:01:20.170> sag<00:01:20.440> in<00:01:20.560> the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
we're at 50 millimetres of sag in the

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.090 
we're at 50 millimetres of sag in the
back<00:01:20.770> at<00:01:20.920> 180<00:01:21.670> pounds<00:01:22.300> so<00:01:23.080> that's<00:01:23.800> a<00:01:23.979> little

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
back at 180 pounds so that's a little

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.070 
back at 180 pounds so that's a little
bit<00:01:24.310> much<00:01:24.520> you<00:01:24.970> may<00:01:25.180> be<00:01:25.240> able<00:01:25.480> to<00:01:25.720> change<00:01:25.930> the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
bit much you may be able to change the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.600 
bit much you may be able to change the
spring<00:01:26.320> tension<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:26.830> bring<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.130> back<00:01:27.280> into

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
spring tension to bring it back into

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.420 
spring tension to bring it back into
line<00:01:27.820> at<00:01:28.000> 40<00:01:28.450> but<00:01:28.960> at<00:01:29.050> this<00:01:29.170> point<00:01:29.410> that<00:01:30.160> seems

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
line at 40 but at this point that seems

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.100 
line at 40 but at this point that seems
awfully<00:01:30.580> soft<00:01:31.120> on<00:01:31.300> the<00:01:31.420> spring<00:01:31.720> so<00:01:31.900> you<00:01:31.990> may

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
awfully soft on the spring so you may

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.890 
awfully soft on the spring so you may
want<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.350> change<00:01:32.620> the<00:01:33.250> spring<00:01:33.580> and<00:01:34.180> as<00:01:34.720> we

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
want to change the spring and as we

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.420 
want to change the spring and as we
discussed<00:01:35.290> earlier<00:01:35.470> you<00:01:35.800> may<00:01:35.920> want<00:01:36.160> to<00:01:36.190> even

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
discussed earlier you may want to even

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.670 
discussed earlier you may want to even
see<00:01:36.610> if<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:36.850> stock<00:01:37.120> shock<00:01:37.420> from<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.720> 675<00:01:38.260> bolts

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
see if the stock shock from a 675 bolts

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.400 
see if the stock shock from a 675 bolts
in<00:01:38.830> on<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.910> forks<00:01:40.330> well<00:01:41.260> they're

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
in on to the forks well they're

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.000 
in on to the forks well they're
extremely<00:01:41.920> soft<00:01:42.490> as<00:01:42.730> well<00:01:42.910> so<00:01:43.590> at<00:01:44.590> this<00:01:44.770> point

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
extremely soft as well so at this point

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.340 
extremely soft as well so at this point
almost<00:01:45.310> half<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.700> travels<00:01:46.030> going<00:01:46.090> 180<00:01:46.870> pounds

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
almost half the travels going 180 pounds

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.660 
almost half the travels going 180 pounds
so<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:49.270> if<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.570> 675<00:01:50.080> Forks<00:01:50.710> bolt<00:01:50.980> in<00:01:51.220> the

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
so see if the 675 Forks bolt in the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.850 
so see if the 675 Forks bolt in the
wheels<00:01:51.880> no<00:01:52.180> doubt<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.570> same<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.110> then<00:01:53.710> you've

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
wheels no doubt the same and then you've

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.560 
wheels no doubt the same and then you've
got<00:01:54.010> a<00:01:54.040> completely<00:01:54.550> adjustable<00:01:54.970> bike<00:01:55.240> again

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
got a completely adjustable bike again

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.720 
got a completely adjustable bike again
such<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.440> shame<00:01:56.710> for<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:57.010> street<00:01:57.370> bike<00:01:57.460> like<00:01:57.700> this

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
such a shame for a street bike like this

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.760 
such a shame for a street bike like this
you<00:01:58.120> think<00:01:58.330> they<00:01:58.450> keep<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.900> same<00:01:59.110> componentry

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
you think they keep the same componentry

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.440 
you think they keep the same componentry
but<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.340> get<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.520> price<00:02:00.730> point<00:02:00.910> where<00:02:01.150> it<00:02:01.270> is

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
but to get the price point where it is

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.390 
but to get the price point where it is
we<00:02:02.200> end<00:02:02.290> up<00:02:02.470> with<00:02:02.500> these<00:02:02.800> suspension

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
we end up with these suspension

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.070 
we end up with these suspension
components<00:02:04.140> now<00:02:05.140> with<00:02:05.320> Chris<00:02:05.530> on<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.800> bike<00:02:05.950> at

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.440 

we're<00:02:16.500> at<00:02:16.620> 60<00:02:17.069> millimeters<00:02:17.580> our<00:02:17.700> sex<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.180> if

we're at 60 millimeters our sex so if
