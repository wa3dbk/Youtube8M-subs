for<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.569> long<00:03:22.810> time<00:03:23.250> because<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:25.209> would<00:03:25.450> not<00:03:25.660> be

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
for a long time because you would not be

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.369 
for a long time because you would not be
able<00:03:25.989> just<00:03:26.200> to<00:03:26.470> glimpse<00:03:27.430> or<00:03:27.670> glance<00:03:28.540> at<00:03:28.959> things

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
able just to glimpse or glance at things

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.339 
able just to glimpse or glance at things
oh<00:03:31.079> yeah<00:03:32.079> don't<00:03:32.440> forget<00:03:32.620> about<00:03:32.890> movie<00:03:33.489> stars

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
oh yeah don't forget about movie stars

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.500 
oh yeah don't forget about movie stars
movie<00:03:35.349> stars<00:03:35.380> would<00:03:36.280> look<00:03:36.549> dull<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.470> boring

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
movie stars would look dull and boring

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.140 
movie stars would look dull and boring
because<00:03:40.510> they<00:03:40.989> would<00:03:41.200> have<00:03:41.440> no<00:03:41.950> glamour<00:03:42.519> at

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
because they would have no glamour at

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.059 
because they would have no glamour at
all<00:03:45.000> there<00:03:46.000> wouldn't<00:03:46.329> be<00:03:46.390> any<00:03:46.629> glitter<00:03:47.069> to

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
all there wouldn't be any glitter to

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.990 
all there wouldn't be any glitter to
decorate<00:03:48.519> your<00:03:48.640> artwork<00:03:49.150> with<00:03:50.640> but<00:03:51.640> with<00:03:51.819> no

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
decorate your artwork with but with no

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.729 
decorate your artwork with but with no
glue<00:03:52.920> there<00:03:53.920> wouldn't<00:03:54.310> stink<00:03:54.640> anyway

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
glue there wouldn't stink anyway

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.119 
glue there wouldn't stink anyway
that's<00:03:56.739> right<00:03:57.569> so<00:03:58.569> I<00:03:58.900> think<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.829> is<00:03:59.950> obvious

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
that's right so I think it is obvious

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:07.039 
that's right so I think it is obvious
that<00:04:01.349> without<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:02.950> sound<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:04.060> girl<00:04:04.510> makes

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
that without the sound that girl makes

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:16.550 
that without the sound that girl makes
it<00:04:08.049> things<00:04:08.859> would<00:04:09.069> be<00:04:09.220> very<00:04:09.510> gloomy<00:04:13.980> yeah
