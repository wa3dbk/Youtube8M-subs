let's<00:01:34.920> get<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.579> show<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.820> what

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
let's get going so I can show you what

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.149 
let's get going so I can show you what
we<00:01:36.600> are<00:01:36.689> basically<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.650> we're

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
we are basically going to do is we're

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.460 
we are basically going to do is we're
gonna<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.549> focus<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> eccentric<00:01:40.020> part<00:01:40.229> of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
gonna do focus on the eccentric part of

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.590 
gonna do focus on the eccentric part of
each<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.340> these<00:01:41.460> exercises<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.270> means

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
each one of these exercises that means

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.810 
each one of these exercises that means
the<00:01:43.110> lowering<00:01:43.590> down<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> extension<00:01:44.610> of

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the lowering down or the extension of

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.639 
the lowering down or the extension of
your<00:01:44.939> muscle<00:01:45.270> part<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.170> was<00:01:46.320> doing<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
your muscle part so if I was doing a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.620 
your muscle part so if I was doing a
dumbbell<00:01:46.920> curl<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.000> example<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
dumbbell curl then for example this is

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.660 
dumbbell curl then for example this is
concentric<00:01:49.350> you're<00:01:49.770> contracting<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
concentric you're contracting it and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.639 
concentric you're contracting it and
then<00:01:50.880> he<00:01:51.360> centric<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.899> when<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.170> let<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> down

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
then he centric is when you let it down

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.889 
then he centric is when you let it down
so<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.820> I'm<00:01:53.880> gonna<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.270> get<00:01:54.390> my<00:01:54.450> feet<00:01:54.750> on

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
so what I'm gonna do is get my feet on

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.120 
so what I'm gonna do is get my feet on
you<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.259> gonna<00:01:55.380> show<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.649> exactly<00:01:55.950> how

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
you and I'm gonna show you exactly how

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.740 
you and I'm gonna show you exactly how
to<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.549> each<00:01:56.759> one<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.000> these<00:01:57.060> exercises<00:01:57.719> but

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
to do each one of these exercises but

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.480 
to do each one of these exercises but
let's<00:01:58.200> get<00:01:58.350> going<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.740> first<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.189> so

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
let's get going with the first one so

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.789 
let's get going with the first one so
you<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.790> my<00:02:00.180> backpack<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.719> makes<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.649> nice

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
you can see my backpack on makes it nice

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.240 
you can see my backpack on makes it nice
hard<00:02:02.040> I've<00:02:02.189> got<00:02:02.369> about<00:02:02.490> half<00:02:03.450> ink<00:02:03.689> these<00:02:03.810> are<00:02:04.250> 7

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
hard I've got about half ink these are 7

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.169 
hard I've got about half ink these are 7
1/2<00:02:05.549> kg<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.329> extra<00:02:07.259> 15<00:02:07.860> 16<00:02:08.280> pounds<00:02:08.700> if<00:02:09.060> it's

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
1/2 kg so extra 15 16 pounds if it's

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.270 
1/2 kg so extra 15 16 pounds if it's
still<00:02:09.360> too<00:02:09.390> easy<00:02:09.660> for<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.250> continue<00:02:11.250> to

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
still too easy for you just continue to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.320 
still too easy for you just continue to
II<00:02:11.400> need<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
II need to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.450 
II need to
load<00:02:12.630> more<00:02:12.990> dumbbells<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.800> your<00:02:13.890> backpack<00:02:14.280> to

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
load more dumbbells in your backpack to

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.970 
load more dumbbells in your backpack to
make<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.790> lot<00:02:14.940> harder<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.480> extra<00:02:15.900> 15<00:02:16.620> 20

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
make it a lot harder that extra 15 20

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.790 
make it a lot harder that extra 15 20
pounds<00:02:17.490> can<00:02:17.820> make<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.150> lot<00:02:18.240> harder<00:02:18.480> so

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
pounds can make it a lot harder so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
pounds can make it a lot harder so
simply<00:02:19.800> get<00:02:19.950> into<00:02:20.130> your<00:02:20.250> incline<00:02:20.490> it's<00:02:20.730> gonna

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
simply get into your incline it's gonna

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.820 
simply get into your incline it's gonna
focus<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:22.080> full<00:02:22.290> chest<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:22.710> also

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
focus on you your full chest but also

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.070 
focus on you your full chest but also
your<00:02:23.040> upper<00:02:23.280> chest<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.730> little<00:02:24.060> bit<00:02:24.210> more<00:02:24.420> okay

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
your upper chest a little bit more okay

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.990 
your upper chest a little bit more okay
so<00:02:25.140> what<00:02:25.350> we're<00:02:25.470> gonna<00:02:25.560> do<00:02:25.770> then<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.000> you're

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
so what we're gonna do then is you're

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.920 
so what we're gonna do then is you're
gonna<00:02:27.090> go<00:02:27.300> down<00:02:27.570> five<00:02:28.290> seconds<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.100> one<00:02:29.930> two

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
gonna go down five seconds so one two

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.330 
gonna go down five seconds so one two
three<00:02:31.310> four<00:02:32.810> five<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.050> then<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.650> explode<00:02:35.100> up

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
three four five and then you explode up

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.650 
three four five and then you explode up
bang<00:02:36.080> one<00:02:37.080> two<00:02:38.040> three<00:02:39.030> four<00:02:39.960> five<00:02:40.890> bang<00:02:41.760> one

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
bang one two three four five bang one

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.410 
bang one two three four five bang one
two<00:02:43.530> three<00:02:44.520> four<00:02:45.330> five<00:02:46.110> bang<00:02:46.710> okay<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.850> that

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
two three four five bang okay and that

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.510 
two three four five bang okay and that
makes<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.900> lot<00:02:49.320> harder<00:02:49.560> if<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.340> can

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
makes it a lot harder if you can

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.750 
makes it a lot harder if you can
normally<00:02:50.820> do<00:02:50.970> like<00:02:51.180> 10<00:02:52.110> 15<00:02:52.680> push-ups<00:02:53.670> like

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
normally do like 10 15 push-ups like

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.430 
normally do like 10 15 push-ups like
that<00:02:53.970> you're<00:02:54.510> gonna<00:02:54.600> struggle<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.080> do<00:02:55.200> about

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
that you're gonna struggle to do about

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.770 
that you're gonna struggle to do about
eight<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.890> nine<00:02:56.040> sometimes<00:02:57.000> even<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.390> lot<00:02:57.570> less

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
eight to nine sometimes even a lot less

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.230 
eight to nine sometimes even a lot less
so<00:02:58.350> do<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.830> way<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.730> extra<00:03:00.060> weight

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
so do it that way at the extra weight

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.449 
so do it that way at the extra weight
and<00:03:00.420> that's<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.990> first<00:03:01.200> exercise<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.250> good

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
and that's the first exercise and a good

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.490 
and that's the first exercise and a good
way<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.640> start<00:03:02.940> because<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.420> focuses<00:03:03.930> on<00:03:04.050> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
way to start because it focuses on the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.160 
way to start because it focuses on the
upper<00:03:04.800> but<00:03:04.950> also<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.370> full<00:03:05.610> chest<00:03:06.209> area<00:03:06.570> the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
upper but also the full chest area the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.050 
upper but also the full chest area the
second<00:03:07.500> exercise<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:08.130> basically<00:03:08.490> a<00:03:08.610> dip<00:03:08.880> and

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
second exercise is basically a dip and

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.970 
second exercise is basically a dip and
here<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:09.600> need<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.810> focus<00:03:09.990> on<00:03:10.260> two<00:03:10.470> things<00:03:10.500> we

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
here we need to focus on two things we

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.199 
here we need to focus on two things we
once<00:03:11.220> again<00:03:11.430> are<00:03:11.520> going<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.670> focus<00:03:11.850> on<00:03:12.090> the

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
once again are going to focus on the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.210 
once again are going to focus on the
eccentric<00:03:12.570> part<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.080> exercise<00:03:13.560> but<00:03:14.070> you

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
eccentric part of the exercise but you

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.460 
eccentric part of the exercise but you
also<00:03:14.430> need<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.760> make<00:03:15.060> sure<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.420> lean<00:03:15.660> as<00:03:15.930> far

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
also need to make sure you lean as far

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.900 
also need to make sure you lean as far
forward<00:03:16.890> as<00:03:16.950> possible<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.519> I'll<00:03:17.610> show<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.820> in

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
forward as possible and I'll show you in
