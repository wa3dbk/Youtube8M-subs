00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.950 

father<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.149> probably<00:01:27.630> gonna<00:01:27.749> get

father this is probably gonna get
interesting<00:01:32.119> when<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.149> first<00:01:33.509> heard<00:01:33.990> about

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
interesting when I first heard about

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.410 
interesting when I first heard about
lucky<00:01:34.649> the<00:01:34.770> penguin<00:01:35.219> in<00:01:35.429> that<00:01:35.670> situation<00:01:36.270> I

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
lucky the penguin in that situation I

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.169 
lucky the penguin in that situation I
thought<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:37.319> a<00:01:37.350> connection<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.069> have<00:01:38.310> just

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
thought what a connection we have just

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.139 
thought what a connection we have just
given<00:01:39.299> were<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.319> tether<00:01:40.560> brand<00:01:40.890> comes<00:01:41.819> from

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
given were the tether brand comes from

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:49.050 
given were the tether brand comes from
you<00:01:42.750> know<00:01:42.869> from<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.289> water

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.980 

it<00:01:49.990> hit<00:01:50.530> me<00:01:50.710> hit<00:01:51.040> all<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.250> us<00:01:51.720> we've<00:01:52.720> probably

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
it hit me hit all of us we've probably

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.200 
it hit me hit all of us we've probably
gone<00:01:53.470> through<00:01:53.770> six<00:01:54.070> interations<00:01:54.700> of<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.030> boot

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
gone through six interations of the boot

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.529 
gone through six interations of the boot
we<00:01:55.750> put<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.100> hard<00:01:57.100> boot<00:01:57.490> on<00:01:57.729> him<00:01:58.030> that<00:01:58.240> was

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
we put a hard boot on him that was

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.050 
we put a hard boot on him that was
locked<00:01:58.840> at<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.229> 90-degree<00:02:00.100> angle<00:02:00.130> he<00:02:00.759> didn't

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
locked at a 90-degree angle he didn't

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.480 
locked at a 90-degree angle he didn't
like<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.439> he<00:02:02.619> let<00:02:02.829> us<00:02:02.979> know<00:02:03.189> immediately

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
like that and he let us know immediately

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.410 
like that and he let us know immediately
a<00:02:03.759> feedback<00:02:04.299> was<00:02:04.679> instantaneous<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:10.090> brand

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
a feedback was instantaneous this brand

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.790 
a feedback was instantaneous this brand
has<00:02:11.140> been<00:02:11.470> helping<00:02:12.370> athletes<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:14.080> 25<00:02:14.530> plus

has been helping athletes for 25 plus
years<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:16.080> penguins<00:02:17.080> are<00:02:17.230> athletes<00:02:17.590> too

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
years and penguins are athletes too

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.460 
years and penguins are athletes too
and<00:02:20.070> then<00:02:20.550> when<00:02:20.730> he<00:02:20.850> got<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> soft<00:02:21.510> boot<00:02:21.810> took

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
and then when he got a soft boot took

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.450 
and then when he got a soft boot took
off<00:02:22.650> walking<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:25.530> was<00:02:25.650> clear<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.130> was

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
off walking it was clear that that was

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:33.180 
off walking it was clear that that was
the<00:02:26.490> answer

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.890 

when<00:02:34.190> we<00:02:34.340> did<00:02:34.520> get<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:34.850> right

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
when we did get it right

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.200 
when we did get it right
it<00:02:36.890> was<00:02:37.100> obvious<00:02:39.400> my<00:02:40.400> only<00:02:40.700> issue<00:02:40.790> with<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
it was obvious my only issue with the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.480 
it was obvious my only issue with the
boot<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.900> it's<00:02:42.020> a<00:02:42.140> little<00:02:42.410> informal<00:02:43.010> for

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
boot is that it's a little informal for

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.530 
boot is that it's a little informal for
a<00:02:43.520> guy<00:02:43.730> wearing<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.150> tux

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.750 

we<00:02:48.989> treated<00:02:49.379> lucky<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.400> we<00:02:50.580> would

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
we treated lucky just like we would

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.350

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
fulfilling moment for me with lucky was

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.270 
fulfilling moment for me with lucky was
watching<00:02:57.810> him<00:02:57.989> go<00:02:58.170> back<00:02:58.319> to<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.650> exhibit<00:02:59.099> for

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
watching him go back to the exhibit for

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.369
