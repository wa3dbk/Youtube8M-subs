00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.180
 remember old tutorial times 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.460
 and programs and in this case I'm going to 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.000
 bring a new video I'm seeing it 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.890
 you have seen the description good 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.960
 Well, this is an application for 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.269
 see football the ultimate application 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.140
 Well, I've been the truth since I met her 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:39.879
 a year or more ago is the one that when 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.800
 boring and such is the one that most in the 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.420
 that he usually uses and the truth that works 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.380
 very well they have stopped having support 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.820
 for her 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.000
 and in this case it is the application 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.700
 the tdt mono channel is Spanish the truth 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.980
 I do not know if it's good for mexico and 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.590
 other this will work or not other countries 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.140
 I avalanche of the voice of my experience 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.700
 about the applications these two are in 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.940
 this case 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.160
 the channel of spain and gallant of Spain and 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.730
 although right now he does not have much 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.470
 service is here they are the same 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.050
 developer although they are made with 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.160
 a page with an application that 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.680
 does it through a page I do not 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.420
 I agree well the pnc leo I do not remember 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.580
 now how was the page going to the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.200
 beginning or leaving now I do not know if so 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.390
 updated plus and the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.470
 propaganda of the page because it carries 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.330
 I was looking to do 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.120
 applications and I know the page so 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.009
 Well, the one that you saw from the channel is the 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.310
 canal tdt españa with this application 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.470

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.080
 normal channels and some autonomic and 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.800

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.729
 I know if I closed it 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.679
 good with the application of those tabs 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.600
 and they have already removed the page 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.179
 whenever it lacks windows always 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.530
 an advertisement comes out here very cool 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.420

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.519
 this program is used to link strina 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.650
 to those channels that use that 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.360
 application on average beach good so 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.950

 that with advertising is how it feeds 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.459
 this is the developer of the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.500

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.680
 carry for a functional amount that I am 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.300
 a bit messy and good, well, what 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.539
 you have to do is have events 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.370

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.380
 here we go multichannel multichannel 2 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.600
 all these are all multiple and you 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.389
 warns that through the multichannel one 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.770

 perfectly to perfection very good 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.200
 you do not need the other application that is 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.720
 the most piratilla of her that to see 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.600
 all in a large part of the channels of 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.330
 digital but good with that is to say 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.780
 sporting events when the program 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.520
 will warn you 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.380
 a notification that you will see a 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.310

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:45.370
 multi-channel all sporting events 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.020
 they will continue and well then they have 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.580
 first the second antenna 3 so 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.280
 well I will try for example in the 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.280
 first a very cool thing that I like 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.570
 is that you can see the programming 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.310
 we give here we would see the programming of 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.810
 the chain is that said chain and here I go 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.070
 to see how the 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:09.310
 programming very cool informative so to 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.639
 4 such that now 7 to 7 is not 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.740
 they will finish 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.999
 'españa directo' good now if I start 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.979
 the application I will see 'Spain direct' 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.520
 so good we are going to try to 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.430
 give him there 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.169
 to the number 1 and start Spain and 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.360
 this I'm going to lower the volume and I'm going to 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.940
 cover part of the screen to pay a 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.020
 extra and I hope to avoid it like this so 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.020
 come i give 1 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.260
 Well, let's see why I've 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.540
 put right now and there was evidently 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.250
 a mint singing there I do not know what song 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.800
 and to not visit the country it opens the 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.110
 copyright and all that good for 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.630
 I put and I'm going to give you now to see how 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:49.630
 Let's see if he does not give me a sack now 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.190
 now it will load the media player of a 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.880
 moment to another there is media player 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:57.300
 embedded budget and will load the channel 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.300
 itv1 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.110
 there you see how nothing is like so 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.090
 well I hope you liked this 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.500
 video and the super super app 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.169
 recommended I'll leave it in the description 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.880
 surely so you can download it 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.880
