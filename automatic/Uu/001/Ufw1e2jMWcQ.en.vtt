00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:11.949

 My name is and tells me franÃ§ois beck 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.380
 kotch professional tennis coach I am passionate about this 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.820
 wonderful sport 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.080
 it's with 25 years of experience in the field 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.609
 that I come to introduce you through this video 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.179
 we approach sports and tennis in particular 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.530
 very quickly I became interested in the players 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.470
 rather than laval 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.460
 I dedicated more boats in 2008 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.460
 to put to the test the optimize an approach 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.370
 this step but the sport 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.670
 in the center of a project I was small and so all the time 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.990
 in this quest for personal development flourishing at the service of the 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.490
 pleasure to be of each 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.490
 each of the big and small 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.610
 during these years I was able to develop my experience in the field 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.180
 I learned the methods of great players and tennis coaches 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.530
 like everyone by tsa cap d'agde in france 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.620
 aidan several tennis courts in the usa 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.080
 more exciting 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.130
 I was able to follow if it was not necessary to say that during the winter on pain 4 5 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.730
 the national conference of tps teachers 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.450
 organized by the stylish duo the united states tennis association 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.300
 to dry paris to the painter in florida 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.700
 I advise you another approach to tennis has taken birth 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.420
 I was sitting in the bleachers 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.700
 and February on neighboring land the five chairs sabbatini trade 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.350
 practice 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.590
 I was traveling to see a study group on a court in front of me 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.220
 run behind balls that send them a coach next to 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.220
 health of the grand prix de basle 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:11.519
 a woman in her forties 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.739
 and become very quickly all red out of breath 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.099
 she could not take it anymore 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.099
 for the coach said that this sum exhausted 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.619
 recovery time 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.579
 for me it was obvious she was hs out of service crever 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:33.029
 she tied herself on a seat without taking care of her guru he had to 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.469
 learn how 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.389
 which is obvious to me 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.389
 is that the training the high level athlete 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.009
 what not to apply in the same way 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.009
 to all tennis players 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.099
 as if by chance a few weeks later 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.319
 I had the pleasure of working in the whitby seller's tennis court 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.779
 at the same date in north carolina 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.759
 our efforts on his method used 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.449
 take some time 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.349
 take pictures 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.639
 I found it very interesting 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.259
 I spent eight weeks listening 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.259
 supervising these courses with this great team of instructors 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:18.869
 it allowed me to deepen his approach 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.609
 I understood from him 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.609
 than last year bring the little more differently 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.290
 back in France in 1986 following a battle my approach 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:35.559
 I breathe 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:36.549
 a source 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.019
 leaving the summit 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.889
 she and other fruits little all these approaches 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.889
 I think I have so many beautiful personal journeys 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.729
 a rich experience of reading meetings 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.229
 of samba on various as for example echoes sophrology the building of 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.229
 tickets every passage of water I took courses in paris 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.029
 the practice of tai chi yoga 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:04.689
 smoke releases to the department 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.039
 crossing Tibetans in exile in India 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:10.249
 we can bring another vision of human relations 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.189
 beyond the racket 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.139
 of the ball 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.449
 and tennis game 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.759
 for me the essential is at the level of the person 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.469
 he pleaded m accompanied by the human being 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:29.210
 he shows up in front of me 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.660
 I will not develop boconcept in an upcoming video
