00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 a god facebook.com and we are in the 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.090
 boiling 380 and we just sat well 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.309
 we have cleared but I wanted to show you a 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.780
 little what is seen and what looks like 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.849
 you have still I say no for being 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.230
 ripped leg space and a little bit 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.010
 more scope 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.599
 these are my legs these and here is 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.910
 the manga book that will pick up 2 and psp and 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.699
 As you can see there is space at least there is 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.160
 four of 25 fingers are from magazines and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.930
 all this is what what comes in the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 singapore airlines flight there is a 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.180
 gadget to put the drinks there is a 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.760
 remote control phone and one thing 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.790
 curious that there is a connection for 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.519
 internet there is a usb connection and a 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:52.200
 connection that looks like video there's a 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:54.240
 screen here with more where of things 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.430
 now it will not work from I am 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.270
 recording with the camera because if not a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.270
 little the plane 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.150
 here you see how we are all packaged 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.590
 I already say this is the vision of the class 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.590
 obviously economic 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:17.630
 and you can see that it's fine but it 's better 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.390
 and above all that we flew with singapore 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.750
 airlines which is the best airline in the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.280
 world without a doubt 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.380
 Well, here I am seeing how we enter 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.960
 I wanted to show us a little bit to see if it's 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.170
 possible more 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.180
 It is enough that I have ernest but 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.350
 it seems that we are a little bit more and 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.540
 they are all far away that you can not 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.210
 teach anything good to see how we 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.979
 visit game some text comments 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.310
 but I already say very happy to try the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.040
 a380 at least in economic class 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.360
 the space is worthy 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.110
 if not excessive forms is worthy of 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.430
 singapore airlines because the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.290
 airplane configurations allow 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.660
 various seat configurations and 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.420
 imagine from scratch lines will abuse like 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.420
 they always abuse at least 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:26.950
 we are talking with the passenger 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.890
 in the a380 800 of singapore
