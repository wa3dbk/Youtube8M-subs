three times and I still don't understand
what<00:06:36.180> that<00:06:36.240> story<00:06:36.540> is<00:06:36.690> about<00:06:36.840> for<00:06:37.680> all<00:06:37.740> its

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
what that story is about for all its

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.470 
what that story is about for all its
time<00:06:38.070> travel<00:06:38.400> complexities<00:06:38.970> the<00:06:39.090> first<00:06:39.300> game

time travel complexities the first game

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.290 
time travel complexities the first game
is<00:06:39.600> much<00:06:39.780> easier<00:06:39.960> to<00:06:40.320> wrap<00:06:40.470> my<00:06:40.590> head<00:06:40.740> around<00:06:41.300> so

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
is much easier to wrap my head around so

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.760 
is much easier to wrap my head around so
it<00:06:42.630> goes<00:06:42.810> without<00:06:43.080> saying<00:06:43.140> that<00:06:43.470> chrono

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
it goes without saying that chrono

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.250 
it goes without saying that chrono
trigger<00:06:44.130> is<00:06:44.310> an<00:06:44.610> excellent<00:06:45.330> and<00:06:45.600> it

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
trigger is an excellent and it

trigger is an excellent and it
definitely<00:06:46.620> stands<00:06:47.250> the<00:06:47.370> test<00:06:47.520> of<00:06:47.700> time<00:06:47.760> I

definitely stands the test of time I

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.360
