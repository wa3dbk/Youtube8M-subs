adjusters<00:02:43.230> out<00:02:44.420> close<00:02:45.420> enough<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.050> here<00:02:46.940> there

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
adjusters out close enough in here there

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.650 
adjusters out close enough in here there
is<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> layer<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.410> here<00:02:50.720> right<00:02:51.720> there<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:53.660> thin

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
is a layer in here right there a thin

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.479 
is a layer in here right there a thin
piece<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.900> wood<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.230> top<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:55.920> saddle<00:02:56.370> and

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
piece of wood on top of that saddle and

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.020 
piece of wood on top of that saddle and
that<00:02:56.670> raises<00:02:57.180> or<00:02:57.300> lowers<00:02:57.330> this<00:02:57.840> whole<00:02:58.080> thing

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
that raises or lowers this whole thing

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.940 
that raises or lowers this whole thing
to<00:03:00.030> raise<00:03:00.180> or<00:03:00.420> lower<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.959> but<00:03:01.230> pretty<00:03:01.709> much

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
to raise or lower it but pretty much

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.199 
to raise or lower it but pretty much
this<00:03:02.160> thing<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.890> would<00:03:05.040> be<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.190> little<00:03:05.430> extra

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
this thing is it would be a little extra

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.120 
this thing is it would be a little extra
high<00:03:06.390> if<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.840> put<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.500> there<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.860> pulled

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
high if I put that in there so I pulled

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.009 
high if I put that in there so I pulled
it<00:03:08.250> out<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:08.670> about<00:03:08.820> an<00:03:09.209> eighth<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.690> an<00:03:09.840> inch

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
it out it's about an eighth of an inch

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.960 
it out it's about an eighth of an inch
high<00:03:10.380> at<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:11.280> 12th<00:03:12.030> fret<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:12.600> all<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.110> strings

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
high at the 12th fret on all the strings

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:22.320 
high at the 12th fret on all the strings
they're<00:03:14.970> small<00:03:15.300> frets

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.380 

somewhere<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.600> frets<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:27.010> mean<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:28.100> works

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
somewhere to the frets I mean it works

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.120 
somewhere to the frets I mean it works
in<00:03:29.390> some<00:03:30.050> areas<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:30.470> got<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.770> push<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:30.950> little

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
in some areas you got to push a little

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.890 
in some areas you got to push a little
harder<00:03:31.280> than<00:03:31.550> others<00:03:31.790> I<00:03:37.210> think<00:03:38.210> I<00:03:38.360> lost<00:03:38.600> a

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
harder than others I think I lost a

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.450 
harder than others I think I lost a
screw<00:03:39.020> I'm<00:03:39.260> not<00:03:39.440> sure<00:03:39.620> if<00:03:39.710> it<00:03:39.800> had<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.040> screw

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
screw I'm not sure if it had a screw

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.340 
screw I'm not sure if it had a screw
there<00:03:40.730> for<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.450> pickguard<00:03:41.690> there's<00:03:42.170> one

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
there for the pickguard there's one

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.370 
there for the pickguard there's one
there<00:03:42.620> one<00:03:42.650> there<00:03:43.030> these<00:03:44.030> five<00:03:44.420> screws<00:03:44.990> don't

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
there one there these five screws don't

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.010 
there one there these five screws don't
match<00:03:45.770> I<00:03:46.400> think<00:03:46.760> it<00:03:46.910> could<00:03:47.180> stand<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.990> have

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
match I think it could stand to have

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.140 
match I think it could stand to have
some<00:03:48.470> little<00:03:48.680> thicker<00:03:49.010> screws<00:03:49.490> put<00:03:49.820> in<00:03:49.970> and

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
some little thicker screws put in and

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.520 
some little thicker screws put in and
hold<00:03:50.270> it<00:03:50.390> in<00:03:50.510> place<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.810> little<00:03:51.110> better<00:03:53.530> but

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
hold it in place a little better but

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.399 
hold it in place a little better but
everything<00:03:54.890> works<00:03:55.100> it's<00:03:56.090> playable
