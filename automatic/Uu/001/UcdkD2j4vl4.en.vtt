right<00:00:14.570> off<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.809> bat<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:15.990> can<00:00:16.289> do<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
right off the bat we can do that the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.939 
right off the bat we can do that the
stickers<00:00:17.160> are<00:00:17.279> slightly<00:00:17.699> smaller<00:00:18.330> than<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
stickers are slightly smaller than the

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.250 
stickers are slightly smaller than the
normal<00:00:19.949> wind<00:00:20.310> stickers<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.779> might<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
normal wind stickers it might be a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.380 
normal wind stickers it might be a
little<00:00:22.410> bit<00:00:22.560> hard<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.800> tell<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.210> reason

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
little bit hard to tell and the reason

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.790 
little bit hard to tell and the reason
for<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.840> they<00:00:25.140> did<00:00:25.289> not<00:00:25.439> want<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.650> make

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
for this is they did not want to make

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.970 
for this is they did not want to make
rounded<00:00:26.400> um<00:00:26.640> rounds<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.599> stickers<00:00:28.140> to

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
rounded um rounds on the stickers to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.170 
rounded um rounds on the stickers to
compensate<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.219> holes<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:33.030> made

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
compensate for the holes so they made

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.709 
compensate for the holes so they made
the<00:00:33.270> sticker<00:00:33.510> slightly<00:00:34.079> smaller<00:00:35.390> it's<00:00:36.390> kind

notice that too much and it doesn't
really<00:00:45.570> affect<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.789> solving<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> puzzle

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
really affect the solving of the puzzle

slight bumpiness to it it's hard to
explain<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.479> okay<00:01:06.920> yet<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.760> hear

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
explain like okay yet if you can hear

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.120 
explain like okay yet if you can hear
closely<00:01:11.869> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:12.930> hear<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.380> bump<00:01:13.619> bump<00:01:13.710> bump

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
closely you can hear that bump bump bump

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.630 
closely you can hear that bump bump bump
you<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.119> don't<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:16.340> where<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.430> can

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
you really don't see that where you can

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.280 
you really don't see that where you can
kind<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.030> hear<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> different<00:01:18.810> sound<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
kind of hear a different sound on the

kind of hear a different sound on the
wind<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:21.600> wind<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.560> doesn't<00:01:22.799> feel<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
wind the wind just it doesn't feel the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.789 
wind the wind just it doesn't feel the
same<00:01:23.630> I'm<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.840> sure<00:01:24.900> exactly<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:25.740> did

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
same I'm not sure exactly what they did

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.600 
same I'm not sure exactly what they did
but<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:27.990> does<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.350> feel<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.740> same<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.579> I

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
but it just does not feel the same so I

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.390 
but it just does not feel the same so I
was<00:01:29.850> kind<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> hoping<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.900> feel<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.500> no

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
was kind of hoping that this feel but no

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.969 
was kind of hoping that this feel but no
it<00:01:32.820> has<00:01:33.119> its<00:01:33.420> own<00:01:33.600> feel<00:01:34.049> which<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.590> actually

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
it has its own feel which is actually

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.940 
it has its own feel which is actually
pretty<00:01:35.670> decent<00:01:36.590> corner-cutting<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.829> this

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
pretty decent corner-cutting on this

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.109 
pretty decent corner-cutting on this
puzzle<00:01:38.210> it<00:01:39.210> could<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.570> line-to-line

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
puzzle it could do line-to-line

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
puzzle it could do line-to-line
effortlessly<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.540> anymore<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.439> kind<00:01:43.890> of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
effortlessly but anymore and it kind of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.210 
effortlessly but anymore and it kind of
takes<00:01:44.250> too<00:01:44.670> much<00:01:44.820> force<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.380> reverse<00:01:46.890> cut

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
takes too much force it can reverse cut

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.109 
takes too much force it can reverse cut
half<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.640> QB<00:01:48.060> which<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.979> very<00:01:49.979> good<00:01:50.369> considering

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
half a QB which is very good considering

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.620 
half a QB which is very good considering
that<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.310> normal<00:01:53.310> wind<00:01:53.610> was<00:01:54.000> not<00:01:54.450> able<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.020> do

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
that the normal wind was not able to do

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.039 
that the normal wind was not able to do
something<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.950> that<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:58.390> would<00:01:58.570> get<00:01:58.750> locked

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
something like that it would get locked

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.330 
something like that it would get locked
up<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:02.619> is<00:02:02.770> definitely<00:02:02.799> a<00:02:03.219> big

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
up so that is definitely a big

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.160 
up so that is definitely a big
improvement<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.270> was<00:02:04.420> due<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.869> holes

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
improvement and I was due to the holes

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.260 
improvement and I was due to the holes
you<00:02:05.829> see<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.130> holes<00:02:06.369> kind<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.789> allow<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.240> to

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
you see the holes kind of allow it to

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:15.600 
you see the holes kind of allow it to
slide<00:02:11.910> out<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.120> mechanism<00:02:14.040> mechanism<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
slide out of the mechanism mechanism the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.089 
slide out of the mechanism mechanism the
puzzle<00:02:16.000> compared<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.959> normal<00:02:17.170> egg<00:02:17.890> shell

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
puzzle compared to a normal egg shell

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.880 
puzzle compared to a normal egg shell
wind<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:19.420> edges<00:02:19.840> are<00:02:20.080> exactly<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.860> same

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
actually a very good speed cube and now

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.410 
actually a very good speed cube and now
does<00:04:08.830> it<00:04:08.920> hold<00:04:09.129> up<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.550> say<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:11.340> new<00:04:12.420> Laurieann

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
does it hold up to say the new Laurieann

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.789 
does it hold up to say the new Laurieann
or<00:04:13.840> something<00:04:14.560> or<00:04:14.799> more<00:04:15.280> you<00:04:15.549> sorry<00:04:15.910> i<00:04:16.799> don't

that's as good as this but i mean i

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.760 
that's as good as this but i mean i
think<00:04:28.330> it's<00:04:28.600> it's<00:04:28.840> own<00:04:29.020> again<00:04:29.320> it's<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.590> really

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
think it's it's own again it's a really

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.860 
think it's it's own again it's a really
good<00:04:29.830> intermediate<00:04:30.310> cube<00:04:31.150> just<00:04:31.510> like<00:04:31.660> the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
good intermediate cube just like the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.969 
good intermediate cube just like the
wind<00:04:32.169> is<00:04:32.790> except<00:04:33.790> it's<00:04:34.260> it's<00:04:35.260> more<00:04:35.650> enjoyable

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
wind is except it's it's more enjoyable

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.650 
wind is except it's it's more enjoyable
to<00:04:36.250> turn<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:37.389> it's<00:04:38.110> just<00:04:38.320> great<00:04:39.190> cube<00:04:39.669> Shh<00:04:40.479> I

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
to turn and it's just great cube Shh I

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.659 
to turn and it's just great cube Shh I
really<00:04:41.200> outdid<00:04:41.530> themselves<00:04:41.710> this<00:04:42.130> time<00:04:42.340> like

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
really outdid themselves this time like

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.900 
really outdid themselves this time like
they<00:04:42.820> went<00:04:43.000> from<00:04:44.070> I'm<00:04:45.070> not<00:04:45.220> sure<00:04:45.460> if<00:04:45.580> this<00:04:45.700> was

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
they went from I'm not sure if this was

they went from I'm not sure if this was
the<00:04:46.090> first<00:04:46.660> version<00:04:47.139> but<00:04:47.770> as<00:04:48.160> you<00:04:48.340> can<00:04:48.430> see

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
the first version but as you can see

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:56.310 
the first version but as you can see
here<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.300> puzzle<00:04:50.169> which<00:04:52.020> really<00:04:55.320> really

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
here this puzzle which really really

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.129 
here this puzzle which really really
bumpy<00:04:56.860> feel<00:04:58.560> now<00:04:59.560> just<00:05:00.520> not<00:05:01.150> a<00:05:01.180> great<00:05:01.419> cube<00:05:01.870> but

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
bumpy feel now just not a great cube but

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.110 
bumpy feel now just not a great cube but
at<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.410> time<00:05:02.500> i<00:05:02.680> guess<00:05:03.070> it<00:05:03.160> was<00:05:03.220> an<00:05:03.370> ok<00:05:03.700> cube

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
at the time i guess it was an ok cube

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.640 
at the time i guess it was an ok cube
and<00:05:04.389> then<00:05:04.510> they<00:05:04.630> said<00:05:04.990> you<00:05:05.110> know<00:05:05.229> what<00:05:05.410> we're

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
gonna you know make it be cube / diane

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.760 
gonna you know make it be cube / diane
style<00:05:09.700> with<00:05:10.389> the<00:05:10.450> ridges<00:05:11.050> their<00:05:11.289> classic
