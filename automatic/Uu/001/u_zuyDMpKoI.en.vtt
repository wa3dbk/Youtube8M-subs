with<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.110> earthquake<00:02:28.500> right<00:02:28.710> now<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.870> oh

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
with that earthquake right now so oh

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.620 
with that earthquake right now so oh
wait<00:02:31.650> nevermind<00:02:32.190> lickilicky<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.360> going

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
wait nevermind lickilicky just going

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.160 
wait nevermind lickilicky just going
all-out<00:02:33.870> for<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.500> explosion<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:36.900> wants

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
all-out for the explosion it just wants

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.460 
all-out for the explosion it just wants
to<00:02:37.200> 1-shot<00:02:37.800> end<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:39.150> Vaporeon<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.200> then<00:02:40.380> I

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
to 1-shot end that Vaporeon and then I

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.630 
to 1-shot end that Vaporeon and then I
guess<00:02:40.620> bring<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.070> something<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.490> handle

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
guess bring in something to handle

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.390 
guess bring in something to handle
dusclops<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.270> little<00:02:42.480> better<00:02:42.740> so<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:44.040> think

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
dusclops a little better so I think

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.010 
dusclops a little better so I think
earthquake<00:02:44.910> could<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.180> worked<00:02:45.360> instead<00:02:45.900> of

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
clear out that substitute right now just

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.290 
clear out that substitute right now just
kind<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.250> waiting<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.670> burn<00:02:51.030> down<00:02:51.240> the

kind of waiting to burn down the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.320 
kind of waiting to burn down the
dusclops<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.710> go<00:02:53.520> see<00:02:53.730> how<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.970> one<00:02:54.090> ends<00:02:54.270> up

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
dusclops and go see how that one ends up

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.410 
dusclops and go see how that one ends up
going<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:56.190> breaking<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.610> sub<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.120> getting
