00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 chances are goodbye to PSV 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.509
 taking Kevin strobeman 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.770
 claimant has grandma according to various media 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.450
 made an offer for the midfielder of 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.280
 no less than 17 million euros 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.690
 reporter Ronald Sträter who stands 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.120
 the training complex at 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.350
 psv and ronald washes man there too 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.840
 actually he is behind you there 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.490
 busy or not 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.740
 yes he is still a Kevin Strootman 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.269
 is that every actor to train with the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.800
 PC selection but the question is 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.480
 of course how long 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.310
 because we eyes grandma has his arrows 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.449
 aimed at recognizing strobe man and that 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.989
 interest is for is technical 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.460
 manager marcel brands from psv and seriously 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.030
 they have reported it interested 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.649
 We have indicated that we are not 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
 so interested in being a straw man 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.680
 prevent but also old no can me 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.120
 imagine why he so who strong 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.500
 love the team 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.289
 yes they are the most important 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.180
 player so that yes you can actually 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.280
 man you sell me things then you must 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.550
 way too high a price to be paid and where 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.020
 You should think about it when you say grand prize 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.629
 I will be really interested 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.829
 are then roma is report but can also 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.260
 imagine jack where we want 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.939
 straw man did not cook at all 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.310
 no but you can call everything very tough 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.990
 look like really extremely large amounts the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.180
 applies to every player at every level then 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.830
 then you should think about it but on 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.950
 this is currently not the case 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.119
 Fortunately that Marcel Brands is not real 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.799
 very enthousiastic 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.180
 previously, jermain lens erik 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.890
 pieters and dries mertens of course 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.659
 solders respond to it 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.960
 loss of weather is therefore a major possibility 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.960
 stones 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.000
 it looks a bit like an empty run 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.799
 PSV and there are many again 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.270
 supporters designation of days at the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.500
 training chic vacation or in the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.280
 south so yes they can go nicely 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.439
 go watch 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.150
 yes and you actually respond a bit 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.490
 divided on a possible departure of the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.899
 from Kevin Strootman 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.149
 well you think he will not get away with it 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.070
 and marriage the flow always good 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.869
 so I always hear a lot about it 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.159
 agus good players leave and I see in 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.840
 a lot of club only cruise on 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.759
 awaited considerable loss 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.979
 things give psv or strostman departure 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.600
 yes pretty well that come the idea yes 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.100
 while they keep the team in tow 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.750
 to take 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.189
 then he will deliver a lot 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.780
 probably 17 mini 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.210
 getting that is true but on him and the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.100
 base white sheet not really needed 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.679
 then maybe they get his slave we 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.739
 so I didn't mind so much 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.390
 there is not so much nemaco quality 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.680
 remains 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.100
 yes those were the supporters he ronald 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.989
 He plays even more at PSV there 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.730
 yes is correct ' info and roofs novices 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.020

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.050

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.000
 it also trains indeed the young 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.200
 defender center trainer jürgen 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.970

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.470
