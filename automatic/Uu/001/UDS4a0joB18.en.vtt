set<00:05:13.280> another<00:05:14.280> tip<00:05:15.180> that<00:05:15.210> I<00:05:15.510> want<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:15.960> hand<00:05:16.380> you

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
set another tip that I want to hand you

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.400 
set another tip that I want to hand you
is<00:05:17.010> I<00:05:17.280> drilled<00:05:18.210> these<00:05:18.419> holes<00:05:18.479> a<00:05:18.960> little<00:05:19.229> bit

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
is I drilled these holes a little bit

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.529 
is I drilled these holes a little bit
off-center<00:05:20.099> drilled<00:05:20.759> them<00:05:20.880> actually<00:05:21.300> two

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
off-center drilled them actually two

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.439 
off-center drilled them actually two
inches<00:05:21.960> off-center<00:05:22.889> I<00:05:23.070> put<00:05:23.639> the<00:05:23.759> longer<00:05:24.180> piece

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
inches off-center I put the longer piece

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.510 
inches off-center I put the longer piece
at<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:24.750> bottom<00:05:25.050> that's<00:05:25.800> going<00:05:25.979> to<00:05:26.130> give<00:05:26.340> me<00:05:26.490> a

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
at the bottom that's going to give me a

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.180 
at the bottom that's going to give me a
slider<00:05:27.000> slightly<00:05:27.750> wider<00:05:28.050> base<00:05:28.470> on<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.919> ground

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
slider slightly wider base on the ground

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.670 
slider slightly wider base on the ground
and<00:05:29.580> it's<00:05:30.510> going<00:05:30.690> to<00:05:30.750> make<00:05:30.900> for<00:05:31.169> a<00:05:31.199> little<00:05:31.500> bit

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
and it's going to make for a little bit

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.580 
and it's going to make for a little bit
more<00:05:31.919> stable<00:05:32.220> platform<00:05:33.169> so<00:05:34.169> if<00:05:34.260> you're<00:05:34.440> good

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
more stable platform so if you're good

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.680 
more stable platform so if you're good
with<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:34.889> dimensions<00:05:35.490> it's<00:05:35.880> time<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.360> do<00:05:36.539> it

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
with the dimensions it's time to do it

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:59.420 
with the dimensions it's time to do it
yet

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.670

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
now we just have to give the PVC glue a

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.130 
now we just have to give the PVC glue a
couple<00:06:05.320> hours<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.860> finish<00:06:06.040> curing<00:06:06.870> it's<00:06:07.870> nice

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
couple hours to finish curing it's nice

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.210 
couple hours to finish curing it's nice
and<00:06:08.410> stable<00:06:08.650> its<00:06:09.280> dimensions<00:06:09.970> we<00:06:10.180> wanted<00:06:11.220> Stan

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220
