these electronic sets were way ahead of

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.279 
these electronic sets were way ahead of
their<00:00:52.559> time<00:00:53.660> because<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.930> special

their time because of a special

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.939 
their time because of a special
transformer<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.520> diode<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.210> each<00:00:57.360> car

this setup allowed you to race cars in

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.240 
this setup allowed you to race cars in
either<00:01:03.000> Lane<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.439> opponent's<00:01:04.890> lane<00:01:05.070> or

either Lane in your opponent's lane or
your<00:01:05.400> lane<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.820> allowed<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.330> switch<00:01:06.659> lanes

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
your lane it allowed you to switch lanes

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.710 
your lane it allowed you to switch lanes
and<00:01:07.400> control<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> cars<00:01:08.729> independently<00:01:09.479> which

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
and control the cars independently which

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.990 
and control the cars independently which
was<00:01:09.990> something<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.799> slot<00:01:11.430> cars<00:01:11.670> were<00:01:11.820> just

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
was something that slot cars were just

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.289 
was something that slot cars were just
not<00:01:12.119> able<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.540> before<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:12.990> time<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:14.299> it

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
not able to do before this time and it

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.700 
not able to do before this time and it
really<00:01:15.600> made<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> lot<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.320> interesting

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
really made for a lot of interesting

really made for a lot of interesting
racing<00:01:17.150> right<00:01:18.150> now<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.360> don't<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.840> it

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
racing right now I don't have it

racing right now I don't have it
configured<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> lane<00:01:19.890> changing<00:01:20.520> option

I've<00:01:22.350> got<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> rather<00:01:22.740> simple<00:01:23.159> setup<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.670> but

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
I've got a rather simple setup here but

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.249 
I've got a rather simple setup here but
these<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.000> select<00:01:24.450> Roenick<00:01:24.720> cars<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.170> they

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
these are select Roenick cars and they

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.530 
these are select Roenick cars and they
allow<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.070> which<00:01:26.970> again<00:01:27.210> was<00:01:27.360> way

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
allow you to do that which again was way

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.359 
allow you to do that which again was way
ahead<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.810> its<00:01:27.930> time<00:01:33.950> believe<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.040> or<00:01:35.130> not<00:01:35.189> it

ahead of its time believe it or not it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.609 
ahead of its time believe it or not it
takes<00:01:35.579> quite<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.630> bit<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.869> time<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.200> restore<00:01:37.350> the
