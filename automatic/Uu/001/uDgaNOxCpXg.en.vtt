00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
know slating a lot I had a little

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.470 
know slating a lot I had a little
friction<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.550> they<00:02:34.640> fought<00:02:34.940> each<00:02:34.970> other<00:02:35.330> I

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
friction and they fought each other I

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.450 
friction and they fought each other I

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
division well it's kind of lackluster a

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.730 
division well it's kind of lackluster a
little<00:02:58.220> bit<00:02:58.400> uh<00:02:58.960> Klitschko<00:02:59.960> he's<00:03:00.290> handling

little bit uh Klitschko he's handling

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.190 
little bit uh Klitschko he's handling
things<00:03:01.040> but<00:03:01.370> he's<00:03:01.970> at<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.360> age<00:03:02.510> now<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.900> way

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
things but he's at that age now the way

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.630 
things but he's at that age now the way
he's<00:03:03.410> picking<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.100> choosing<00:03:04.130> different

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
he's picking and choosing different

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.610 
he's picking and choosing different
fighters<00:03:05.180> or<00:03:05.300> whatnot<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:06.230> her<00:03:06.320> heavyweight

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
fighters or whatnot so her heavyweight

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.890 
fighters or whatnot so her heavyweight

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
really tested you know and stubborn you

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.740 
really tested you know and stubborn you
know<00:03:14.840> he<00:03:15.110> just<00:03:15.380> proved<00:03:15.860> himself<00:03:16.750> about

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
know he just proved himself about

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.990 
know he just proved himself about
winning<00:03:18.110> his<00:03:18.290> last<00:03:18.500> fight<00:03:18.830> whatnot<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:19.520> it's

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
winning his last fight whatnot so it's

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.270 
winning his last fight whatnot so it's
kind<00:03:20.300> of<00:03:20.420> open<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:21.710> don't<00:03:21.920> see<00:03:22.100> what's

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
kind of open so we don't see what's

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.070 
kind of open so we don't see what's
gonna<00:03:22.460> be<00:03:22.580> happening<00:03:22.700> next<00:03:23.180> year<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:23.780> think

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
gonna be happening next year so I think

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.870 
gonna be happening next year so I think
he's<00:03:24.320> gonna<00:03:24.470> have<00:03:24.620> some<00:03:24.680> very<00:03:25.130> different

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
he's gonna have some very different

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.180 
he's gonna have some very different
faces<00:03:26.390> in<00:03:26.510> boxing<00:03:27.020> coming<00:03:27.560> up<00:03:27.680> shortly

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
faces in boxing coming up shortly

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.860 
faces in boxing coming up shortly
you<00:03:28.640> think<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:28.970> winder<00:03:29.390> is<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.690> better

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
you think the winder is the better

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.890 
you think the winder is the better
fighter<00:03:30.200> than<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.709> stiver<00:03:31.070> not<00:03:32.000> really<00:03:32.570> I

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
fighter than the stiver not really I

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.140 
fighter than the stiver not really I
think<00:03:33.020> he's<00:03:33.320> a<00:03:33.350> better<00:03:33.739> boxer<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.790> certain

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
think he's a better boxer to a certain

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.930 
think he's a better boxer to a certain
extent<00:03:35.540> but<00:03:36.140> stubborn<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.070> better<00:03:37.400> puncher

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
extent but stubborn is a better puncher

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.580 
extent but stubborn is a better puncher
and<00:03:37.970> I<00:03:38.150> think<00:03:38.390> right<00:03:38.660> now<00:03:38.840> I'm<00:03:39.110> going<00:03:39.380> with

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
and I think right now I'm going with

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.680 
and I think right now I'm going with
that<00:03:39.709> puncher<00:03:40.280> he's<00:03:40.790> more<00:03:41.120> point<00:03:41.480> he's<00:03:41.660> a

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
that puncher he's more point he's a

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.690 
that puncher he's more point he's a
better<00:03:41.989> puncher<00:03:42.440> he's<00:03:42.590> more<00:03:42.860> experienced<00:03:43.520> as

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
better puncher he's more experienced as

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.360 
better puncher he's more experienced as
far<00:03:43.940> as<00:03:44.230> caliber<00:03:45.230> of<00:03:45.380> fighters<00:03:45.770> you<00:03:45.950> know<00:03:46.100> and

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
far as caliber of fighters you know and

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.940 
far as caliber of fighters you know and
so<00:03:46.820> it's<00:03:47.300> a<00:03:47.450> toss-up<00:03:48.110> type<00:03:48.350> of<00:03:48.500> fight<00:03:48.709> but

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
so it's a toss-up type of fight but

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.190 
so it's a toss-up type of fight but
right<00:03:49.220> now<00:03:49.459> I'm<00:03:49.880> leaning<00:03:50.300> towards<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:51.020> burn

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
right now I'm leaning towards to burn

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.270 
right now I'm leaning towards to burn
off<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.620> power

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
off the power

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.820 
off the power
once<00:03:52.489> he<00:03:52.670> hit<00:03:52.910> once<00:03:53.720> he<00:03:53.870> hit<00:03:54.050> louder<00:03:54.320> with<00:03:54.709> the

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
once he hit once he hit louder with the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.070 
once he hit once he hit louder with the
little<00:03:55.130> gloves<00:03:55.370> who<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.420> fight<00:03:56.630> changes

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
little gloves who the fight changes

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.960 
little gloves who the fight changes
dramatically<00:03:57.620> what<00:03:58.160> do<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.370> think<00:03:58.580> of<00:03:58.730> the

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
dramatically what do you think of the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:59.740 
dramatically what do you think of the
Shannon<00:03:59.330> Briggs

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
Shannon Briggs

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.770 
Shannon Briggs
there<00:04:00.320> are<00:04:00.440> many<00:04:00.769> many<00:04:01.370> things<00:04:01.780> with

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
there are many many things with

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.520

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.920 
Klitschko he want the fighter for the

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
title but you think he can get that's a

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.190 
title but you think he can get that's a
chance<00:04:09.230> or<00:04:09.440> not<00:04:09.590> Wow<00:04:09.920> well<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:10.640> like<00:04:11.450> Shannon
