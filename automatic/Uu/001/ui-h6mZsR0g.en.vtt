 you are driving everyone from a 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.329
 murder 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:37.879

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.170
 tests who the fuck they think they are 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.269
 to accuse me behave like this there's no 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.430
 evidence has to say that it also 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.640
 I was tired of his murderous look every 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.640
 sheep 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.540

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.060

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.630
 let me stop fucking life if I 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.460
 confirmed the suspicion blocked the 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.510
 Envy worth I was jealous and many times 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.510
 I'm the one who kills her 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.460
 and it shows 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.610
 I loved her 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.780

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:25.119

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.810
 medicine 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.369
 but 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.020
 but about how many grams of poison 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.799
 you need so that the person dies 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.799
 at the right moment 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.050
 I guess force chose miranda 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.330
 because I am a top designer no one 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.580
 is talking about that 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.230

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.790
