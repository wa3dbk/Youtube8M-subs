so<00:00:05.310> this<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.640> M<00:00:05.820> Elias<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.630> we're<00:00:06.930> doing<00:00:07.020> a

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
so this is M Elias and we're doing a

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.070 
so this is M Elias and we're doing a
math<00:00:07.410> lesson<00:00:07.649> it's<00:00:08.430> a<00:00:08.580> lesson<00:00:08.790> based<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.389> under

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
math lesson it's a lesson based on under

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.930 
math lesson it's a lesson based on under
the<00:00:10.200> sea<00:00:10.380> which<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.710> our<00:00:10.830> topic<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.790> we're

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
the sea which is our topic and we're

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.490 
the sea which is our topic and we're
going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.180> be<00:00:12.330> revisiting<00:00:12.870> all<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.230> skills

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
going to be revisiting all the skills

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.470 
going to be revisiting all the skills
that<00:00:13.620> they've<00:00:13.830> learnt<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.309> far<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.389> that

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
that they've learnt so far and so that

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.910 
that they've learnt so far and so that
we<00:00:15.599> can<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:16.049> where<00:00:16.230> they<00:00:16.320> are<00:00:16.349> in<00:00:16.470> terms<00:00:16.590> of

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
we can see where they are in terms of

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.410 
we can see where they are in terms of
assessment<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.520> then<00:00:17.730> move<00:00:17.910> their<00:00:18.090> learning

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
assessment and then move their learning

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.140 
assessment and then move their learning
on<00:00:18.540> to<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.650> where<00:00:19.770> they<00:00:19.830> need<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.009> go<00:00:20.189> next<00:00:20.340> our

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
on to see where they need to go next our

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.359 
on to see where they need to go next our
ability<00:00:21.869> group<00:00:22.050> will<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.320> working<00:00:22.770> and<00:00:23.009> in<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
they've got a range of mathematical

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.160 
they've got a range of mathematical
activities<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.999> they<00:00:54.210> need<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> report<00:00:54.749> on

concentrating on them and recording with
marks<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.839> give<00:01:00.960> meaning<00:01:01.379> for

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
marks and to give meaning for

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.320 
marks and to give meaning for
mathematics<00:01:03.620> okay<00:01:04.620> well<00:01:05.040> since<00:01:05.460> we've<00:01:05.909> shown

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
mathematics okay well since we've shown

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.840 
mathematics okay well since we've shown
me<00:01:08.570> how<00:01:09.570> many<00:01:09.630> times<00:01:10.170> did<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.409> found<00:01:10.649> the<00:01:10.920> drum
