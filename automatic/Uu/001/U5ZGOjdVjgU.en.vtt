 but how much to that LED lighting 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.299
 because it is said to be meant 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.549
 for safety and better visibility 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.159
 you notice that something say better view 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.180
 sure everything is much clearer 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.840
 sharper 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.470
 it looks like you lost during the day 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.990
 greater 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.030

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.030

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.600

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.960

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.410
 once I did it great light 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.200
 and then drove towards another car and 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.030
 did not go out then want to see you 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.860

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.310
