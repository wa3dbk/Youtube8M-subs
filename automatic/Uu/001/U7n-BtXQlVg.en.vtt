00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
app you're going to need to set a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.880 
app you're going to need to set a
passcode<00:00:29.720> this<00:00:30.720> passcode<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.320> either<00:00:31.470> be<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
passcode this passcode can either be the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.430 
passcode this passcode can either be the
normal<00:00:32.250> passcode<00:00:32.880> or<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.120> pattern<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.630> I'm<00:00:34.380> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
normal passcode or the pattern I I'm a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.229 
normal passcode or the pattern I I'm a
fan<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> pattern<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> always<00:00:36.059> choose

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
fan of the pattern so I always choose

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.369
