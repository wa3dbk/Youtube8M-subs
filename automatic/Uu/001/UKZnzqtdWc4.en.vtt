there<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.040> go<00:02:14.450> against<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.719> goes<00:02:15.900> your<00:02:15.930> saddle

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:16.499 
there you go against in goes your saddle

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.289

when you go and over a summit you can't
avoid<00:02:20.700> rather<00:02:21.060> than<00:02:21.209> let<00:02:21.389> the<00:02:21.480> saddle<00:02:21.900> take

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
avoid rather than let the saddle take

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.339 
avoid rather than let the saddle take
all<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.069> brunt<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.359> impact<00:02:24.749> you<00:02:25.260> can

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
all the brunt of the the impact you can

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.020 
all the brunt of the the impact you can
save<00:02:25.650> yourself<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.099> snap<00:02:26.310> side<00:02:26.579> I've<00:02:26.760> only<00:02:26.939> ever

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.289 
save yourself a snap side I've only ever
snap<00:02:27.450> one<00:02:27.659> saddle<00:02:27.989> in<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.290> past<00:02:28.909> it<00:02:29.909> want<00:02:30.120> like

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
snap one saddle in the past it want like

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.559 
snap one saddle in the past it want like
titanium<00:02:30.810> rails<00:02:31.230> like<00:02:31.469> this<00:02:31.650> one<00:02:31.889> it<00:02:32.670> was<00:02:33.000> just

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
titanium rails like this one it was just

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.300 
titanium rails like this one it was just
some<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.079> basically<00:02:34.439> some<00:02:34.620> cheaper<00:02:34.950> saddle

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
some like basically some cheaper saddle

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.910 
some like basically some cheaper saddle
but<00:02:35.489> again<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:35.939> still<00:02:36.000> my<00:02:36.239> own<00:02:36.389> fault<00:02:36.659> for

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
but again it's still my own fault for

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.800 
but again it's still my own fault for
letting<00:02:37.920> all<00:02:38.189> the<00:02:38.400> saddle<00:02:39.120> take<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.419> impact

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
letting all the saddle take the impact

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.899 
letting all the saddle take the impact
so<00:02:40.409> yeah<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.859> it<00:02:41.010> far<00:02:41.219> as<00:02:41.370> what<00:02:41.579> can<00:02:41.639> I<00:02:41.730> say<00:02:41.879> I

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
so yeah is it far as what can I say I

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:42.920 
so yeah is it far as what can I say I
don't<00:02:42.060> know<00:02:42.239> if<00:02:42.299> they<00:02:42.359> may<00:02:42.510> actually<00:02:42.629> make

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
don't know if they may actually make
