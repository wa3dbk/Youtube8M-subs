00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.430

 we continue with the tablet 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.860
 we connect the tablet 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.860
 to the computer 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.600
 turned on 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.790
 we press the skype button we take a 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.140
 clip and on the reset button 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.140

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:53.060
 repeatedly the power button 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.600
 until we see an image in the 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.550
 philips 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.290
 here basically it is no longer 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.990
 establishing that we can perform the 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.990
 formatting we click on 216 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.019
 and immediately it is being done 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:12.310
 the formatting process which has a 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.310
 Approximate time of 5 minutes 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.660
 at this time 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.180
 already as we can see it has already been 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.310

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.880
 minutes with 35 seconds 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.470

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.489
 to the information on the tablet 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.440
