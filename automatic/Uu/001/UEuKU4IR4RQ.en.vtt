of racks of new assess or what have you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.109 
of racks of new assess or what have you
and<00:01:36.350> that<00:01:37.350> general<00:01:37.710> i<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:38.009> select<00:01:38.579> whatever

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and that general i just select whatever

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.990 
and that general i just select whatever
is<00:01:40.009> right<00:01:41.009> there<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.280> front<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.670> me<00:01:41.729> however

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
is right there in front of me however

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.060 
is right there in front of me however
because<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.720> how<00:01:43.110> many<00:01:43.170> hollows<00:01:43.500> i<00:01:43.799> tend<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
because of how many hollows i tend to

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.530 
because of how many hollows i tend to
pull<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.490> decided<00:01:44.850> I'd<00:01:44.970> mix<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.329> up<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.509> little

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
pull I decided I'd mix it up a little

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.630 
pull I decided I'd mix it up a little
bit<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.369> shuffled<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> rack<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
bit so I kind of shuffled the rack a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.210 
bit so I kind of shuffled the rack a
little<00:01:48.000> bit<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.259> my<00:01:49.409> pull

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
little bit just just to see if my pull

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.560 
little bit just just to see if my pull
rate<00:01:50.430> would<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.610> any<00:01:50.820> different<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.360> guess

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
rate would be any different so I guess

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.749 
rate would be any different so I guess
we'll<00:01:51.720> test<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.079> theory<00:01:52.350> today<00:01:52.579> all<00:01:53.579> right

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
we'll test that theory today all right

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.499 
we'll test that theory today all right
we'll<00:01:53.909> start<00:01:54.149> off<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.479> traffic<00:01:55.310> little

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
we'll start off with traffic little

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:04.100 
we'll start off with traffic little
