00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.410 
there is a 24-7 rechargeable gaming
battery<00:02:43.200> pack<00:02:43.710> now<00:02:44.280> what<00:02:44.550> does<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.850> mean

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
battery pack now what does that mean

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.340 
battery pack now what does that mean
there<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.470> two<00:02:47.270> battery<00:02:48.270> packs<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.960> come

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
there is two battery packs that come

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.700 
there is two battery packs that come
with<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.980> warhead<00:02:50.520> one<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.600> them<00:02:51.780> goes<00:02:52.200> into

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
with the warhead one of them goes into

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.820 
with the warhead one of them goes into
the<00:02:52.830> base<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.520> constantly<00:02:54.320> recharging<00:02:55.320> so

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
the base and is constantly recharging so

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.310 
the base and is constantly recharging so
when<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.220> one<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.670> your<00:02:56.730> headset<00:02:57.480> runs<00:02:58.080> out<00:02:58.290> of

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
when the one in your headset runs out of

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.800 
when the one in your headset runs out of
battery<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:59.250> simply<00:02:59.580> switch<00:03:00.000> them<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:00.750> you

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
battery you simply switch them so you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.420 
battery you simply switch them so you
don't<00:03:01.110> have<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.410> deal<00:03:01.560> with<00:03:01.680> double-a<00:03:02.190> or

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
don't have to deal with double-a or

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.150 
don't have to deal with double-a or
