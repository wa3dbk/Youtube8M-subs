you<00:00:26.189> know<00:00:26.310> shoes<00:00:26.609> exploding<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.840> second<00:00:28.529> time

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
you know shoes exploding a a second time

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.060 
you know shoes exploding a a second time
if<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.609> were<00:00:29.730> all<00:00:29.789> having<00:00:30.090> our<00:00:30.330> shoes<00:00:30.570> checked

if we were all having our shoes checked
my<00:00:32.070> point<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.850> don't<00:00:33.090> really<00:00:33.270> believe

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
my point is I don't really believe

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.310 
my point is I don't really believe
there's<00:00:34.200> any<00:00:34.440> danger<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.340> absolutely<00:00:36.320> don't

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
there's any danger I I absolutely don't

there's any danger I I absolutely don't
there<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.710> there<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.399> no<00:00:38.790> rational<00:00:39.629> way<00:00:40.379> that

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
there is there is no rational way that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
what I think I just I don't see it but I

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.140 
what I think I just I don't see it but I

if<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.360> complete<00:01:18.930> nonsense<00:01:21.350> there<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.500> have

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
if it's complete nonsense there you have

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.570 
if it's complete nonsense there you have
it<00:01:24.049> you<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.560> disagree<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.009> little<00:01:26.159> bit<00:01:26.430> not

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
it you and I disagree a little bit not

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.300 
it you and I disagree a little bit not
completely<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.780> terms<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.140> degree<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.710> I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
completely but in terms of degree I I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.969 
completely but in terms of degree I I
think<00:01:29.880> we'll<00:01:30.060> find<00:01:30.270> out<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> moment<00:01:31.049> yes<00:01:31.799> I'm

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
think we'll find out a moment yes I'm

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.620 
think we'll find out a moment yes I'm
just<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.310> from<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> technology<00:01:33.119> there<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
just going from the technology there you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.749 
just going from the technology there you
know<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> OS<00:01:35.400> mean

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
know this that it's not like the OS mean

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.929 
know this that it's not like the OS mean
it<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.119> incredibly<00:01:37.049> mature<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.860> mean<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.640> it's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
it is incredibly mature I mean it's it's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.260 
it is incredibly mature I mean it's it's
it's<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.390> rock-solid<00:01:40.290> OS<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.090> only

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
it's a rock-solid OS and it's the only

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.950 
it's a rock-solid OS and it's the only
the<00:01:42.689> exposure<00:01:43.579> to<00:01:44.579> wait<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> min<00:01:45.119> ste<00:01:45.329> knew<00:01:45.689> it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the exposure to wait a min ste knew it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.630 
the exposure to wait a min ste knew it
is<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> rock-solid<00:01:47.070> OS<00:01:47.780> that's<00:01:48.780> absurd

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
is not a rock-solid OS that's absurd

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.139 
is not a rock-solid OS that's absurd
sure<00:01:50.640> well<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.960> rock-solid<00:01:52.560> Wes<00:01:53.100> at<00:01:53.640> well

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
sure well it's a rock-solid Wes at well

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.170 
sure well it's a rock-solid Wes at well
then<00:01:54.780> there<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.110> none<00:01:55.350> well<00:01:56.130> maybe<00:01:56.369> not<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
then there is none well maybe not but it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.539 
then there is none well maybe not but it
yes<00:01:57.570> that's<00:01:57.840> probably<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.320> case<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:59.280> may<00:01:59.490> be

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
yes that's probably the case it may be

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.780 
yes that's probably the case it may be
more<00:02:00.149> rock<00:02:00.420> solid<00:02:00.719> than<00:02:01.140> some<00:02:01.490> but<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.610> not

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
more rock solid than some but it's not

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.870 
more rock solid than some but it's not

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
rock solid vista windows evident there's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.429 
rock solid vista windows evident there's

exploits every single month they're

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.309 
exploits every single month they're
critical<00:02:07.799> exploits<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.690> all<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.899> them<00:02:10.080> for
