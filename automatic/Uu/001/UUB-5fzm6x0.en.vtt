and it's a lot quicker just to have the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.309 
and it's a lot quicker just to have the
number<00:02:38.329> one<00:02:38.480> then<00:02:38.719> go<00:02:38.750> into<00:02:38.989> all<00:02:39.200> the

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
number one then go into all the

different bunch of numbers or letters it

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.250 
different bunch of numbers or letters it
doesn't<00:02:44.540> matter<00:02:44.659> because<00:02:44.780> each<00:02:44.989> one<00:02:45.230> is

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
doesn't matter because each one is

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.470 
doesn't matter because each one is
different<00:02:45.829> so<00:02:46.219> we<00:02:46.250> open<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:46.609> up<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.180> then

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
different so we open this up and then

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.479 
different so we open this up and then
you<00:02:47.569> go<00:02:47.659> see<00:02:47.840> backup<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.439> user<00:02:48.590> now<00:02:49.370> we're

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
you go see backup and user now we're

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.729 
you go see backup and user now we're
going<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:49.669> open<00:02:49.730> up<00:02:50.060> our<00:02:50.299> user<00:02:50.750> first<00:02:51.109> the

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
going to open up our user first the

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.550 
going to open up our user first the

original one save as and then we're

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.580 
original one save as and then we're
going<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.739> create<00:02:54.919> backup<00:02:55.519> that's<00:02:56.239> CFG<00:02:56.810> so

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
going to create backup that's CFG so

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.409 
going to create backup that's CFG so
this<00:02:57.709> way<00:02:57.889> that<00:02:58.099> we<00:02:58.430> have<00:02:58.579> our<00:02:58.819> original<00:02:58.849> files

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
backed up in case we mess up alright so

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.599 
backed up in case we mess up alright so
then<00:03:02.150> we<00:03:02.269> open<00:03:02.540> up<00:03:02.599> our<00:03:02.780> user<00:03:02.930> again<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:04.280> we're

actually see what you're looking at but

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.160 
actually see what you're looking at but
this<00:05:06.670> one<00:05:06.850> I<00:05:06.880> mean<00:05:07.060> by<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.210> realistic<00:05:07.750> effects

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
this one I mean by the realistic effects

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.840 
this one I mean by the realistic effects
that<00:05:08.350> see<00:05:08.710> how<00:05:08.830> dark<00:05:09.100> it<00:05:09.220> is<00:05:09.340> you<00:05:09.490> obviously

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
that see how dark it is you obviously

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.880 
that see how dark it is you obviously
need<00:05:09.970> a<00:05:10.000> flashlight<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.600> turn<00:05:10.750> it<00:05:10.870> on<00:05:10.960> and

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
need a flashlight to turn it on and

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.610 
need a flashlight to turn it on and
since<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.610> change<00:05:12.850> the<00:05:12.970> fov<00:05:13.200> that<00:05:14.200> sound<00:05:14.410> only

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
since I change the fov that sound only

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.260 
since I change the fov that sound only
would<00:05:15.010> look<00:05:15.160> like<00:05:15.310> if<00:05:15.550> you<00:05:15.580> were<00:05:15.730> standing<00:05:16.150> in

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
would look like if you were standing in

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.270 
would look like if you were standing in
that<00:05:16.390> position<00:05:16.690> rather<00:05:17.290> than<00:05:17.440> having<00:05:17.950> your

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
that position rather than having your
