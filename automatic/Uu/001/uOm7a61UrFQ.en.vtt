00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.580
 ours is a comprehensive institution that 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.460
 he works on two santoro communes and I'll be there 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.570
 we have eight classes of schools 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.980
 of childhood 14 of primary school and the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.980
 9 of lower secondary school 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.110
 feb at least so only things diverted into 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.579
 way of contrast also because it is 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.290
 going over the static ones is a way 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.850
 for them meanwhile if it must be then 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.329
 also went to relate to 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.600
 others 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:48.210
 beautiful so that one brings to it 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.309
 more important is just to enter as 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.530
 school within families e 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.339
 therefore improve communication between 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.409
 school and family because a new way 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:07.850
 to remember how children are doing a 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:07.850
 school give us all the children and yo yo 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.869
 the photo album replaces but in 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.759
 manner in a more innovative 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.460
 captivating what is classic 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.210
 class photo that is done at the end of the year 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.440
 beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:37.909
 it's not just my class but it's mine 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.909
 school my territory and my angel 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.390
 I'm already thrilled to see these 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.100
 such figurines of these cartoons I imagine 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.950
 see her in a figurine in an album 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.869
 I think it will be a very nice thing 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.090
 dead 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.090
 now churning out fail me liked it 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.980
 so many also apply the pd that 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.590
 in the beginning she was not so much in agreement with the 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.349
 situation why 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.640
 I knew they were going out too 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.800
 same korine 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.120
 in other countries but then they have me 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.950
 explained that it was something inside 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.620
 of the school a project and therefore I have 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.010
 decided to join the initiative the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.950
 the validity of the initiative is such that at 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.670
 end exceeded what was it 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.670
 initial skepticism 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.959
 structure all the various phases e 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.420
 through summing up an organization 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.970
 capillary as well as in the practice of 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.550
 schools especially with regard to i 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.820
 training courses can be done very well 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:55.660
 it's not tiring project has no 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.660
 cost for school administration 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:05.500
 the company leaves on the sale of the 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.610
 10 percent of the entire material 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.440
 of the entire expenditure that we will reinvest 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.720
 definitely a nice school 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.720
 initiative different from the others
