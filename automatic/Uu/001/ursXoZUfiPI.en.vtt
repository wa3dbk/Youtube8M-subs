it nowadays and rocky is connected to

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.210 
it nowadays and rocky is connected to
the<00:00:20.220> power<00:00:20.430> right<00:00:21.359> there<00:00:21.590> so<00:00:22.590> when<00:00:23.130> you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the power right there so when you

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
connect rocky to power it actually

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.589 
connect rocky to power it actually
already<00:00:25.230> boots<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.640> disconnect

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
already boots up so if I just disconnect

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.630 
already boots up so if I just disconnect
and<00:00:27.900> connect<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.769> turned<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.160> off<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
and connect this I turned it off for the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.930 
and connect this I turned it off for the
demo<00:00:30.260> it<00:00:31.260> will<00:00:31.800> automatically<00:00:32.399> power<00:00:32.759> up<00:00:34.940> C

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
demo it will automatically power up C

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.520 
demo it will automatically power up C
and<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:37.620> will<00:00:37.739> boot<00:00:37.950> up<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.370> you'll<00:00:39.239> hear<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
and it will boot up and you'll hear the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.470 
and it will boot up and you'll hear the
mode<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.450> over<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> speaker<00:00:44.480> hotspot

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
mode it's in over the speaker hotspot

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.440 
mode it's in over the speaker hotspot
mode<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.680> hotspot<00:00:47.100> mode<00:00:47.309> rocky<00:00:47.820> connects

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
mode so in hotspot mode rocky connects

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.619 
mode so in hotspot mode rocky connects
or<00:00:48.660> creates<00:00:49.079> its<00:00:49.260> own<00:00:49.410> high<00:00:49.680> Wi-Fi<00:00:50.340> network<00:00:51.239> so

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
or creates its own high Wi-Fi network so

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.200 
or creates its own high Wi-Fi network so
you<00:00:51.690> connect<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.230> directly<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.059> stream<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
you connect to it directly and stream to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.510 
you connect to it directly and stream to
it<00:00:54.329> when<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.660> connect<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.190> course<00:00:56.219> you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
it when you connect it but of course you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.299 
it when you connect it but of course you
want<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.789> hook<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.270> into<00:00:57.420> your<00:00:57.660> home<00:00:58.020> Wi-Fi<00:00:58.309> so
