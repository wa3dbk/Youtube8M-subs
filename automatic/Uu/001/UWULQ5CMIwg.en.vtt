00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
first set could have came up a lot

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.680

faster<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.650> I'm<00:01:31.979> gonna<00:01:32.100> work<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.550> that<00:01:32.910> with

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
faster and I'm gonna work on that with

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.469 
faster and I'm gonna work on that with
my<00:01:34.020> second<00:01:34.650> set<00:01:34.800> here<00:01:35.070> maybe<00:01:35.369> my<00:01:35.670> muscles<00:01:36.330> will

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
my second set here maybe my muscles will

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.030 
my second set here maybe my muscles will
have<00:01:36.630> warmed<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:37.080> and<00:01:37.320> I'll<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.710> able<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:37.920> do

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
have warmed up and I'll be able to do

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.040 
have warmed up and I'll be able to do
them<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.160> lot<00:01:38.190> smoother<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.420> I'm<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> do

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
them a lot smoother but I'm going to do

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.480 
them a lot smoother but I'm going to do
eighty-five<00:01:40.500> percent<00:01:40.649> of<00:01:40.890> my<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.280> max

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
eighty-five percent of my one right max

00:01:41.490 --> 00:02:05.260 
eighty-five percent of my one right max
or<00:01:41.670> three<00:01:41.910> reps

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.640 

okay<00:02:06.270> so

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
okay so

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.969 
okay so
that<00:02:08.280> first<00:02:08.700> set<00:02:09.570> was<00:02:09.780> pretty<00:02:10.140> good<00:02:10.350> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that first set was pretty good the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.560 
that first set was pretty good the
second<00:02:11.460> set<00:02:11.670> was<00:02:12.680> okay<00:02:14.090> though<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.120> better<00:02:15.510> than

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
second set was okay though I better than

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.120 
second set was okay though I better than
my<00:02:15.780> first<00:02:15.990> set<00:02:16.260> let<00:02:16.380> me<00:02:16.440> tell<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.830> Monty

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
my first set let me tell you that Monty

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.990 
my first set let me tell you that Monty
came<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.460> a<00:02:17.550> lot<00:02:17.670> smoother<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.980> think<00:02:20.880> maybe

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
came up a lot smoother and I think maybe

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.960 
came up a lot smoother and I think maybe
just<00:02:21.300> my<00:02:21.630> legs<00:02:22.470> or<00:02:22.710> my<00:02:22.740> body<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.430> getting<00:02:23.700> these

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
just my legs or my body is getting these

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.330 
just my legs or my body is getting these
two<00:02:24.330> heavyweight<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.350> little<00:02:25.620> bit<00:02:25.710> right<00:02:26.070> now

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
two heavyweight a little bit right now

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.670 
two heavyweight a little bit right now
the<00:02:26.400> biggest<00:02:27.150> thing<00:02:27.660> i<00:02:27.810> could<00:02:27.870> see<00:02:28.260> that's<00:02:28.500> a

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
the biggest thing i could see that's a

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.890 
the biggest thing i could see that's a
difficult<00:02:29.640> for<00:02:29.850> me<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.060> my<00:02:30.180> grip<00:02:30.450> strength<00:02:30.750> I

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
difficult for me it's my grip strength I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.230 
difficult for me it's my grip strength I
need<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.680> work<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:32.490> my<00:02:32.550> grip<00:02:32.850> strength<00:02:33.060> little

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
need to work on my grip strength little

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.730 
need to work on my grip strength little
bit<00:02:33.330> better<00:02:33.480> because<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.870> bar<00:02:34.080> was<00:02:34.200> slipping

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
bit better because that bar was slipping

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.740 
bit better because that bar was slipping
out<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.950> my<00:02:35.040> left<00:02:35.280> hand<00:02:35.430> maybe<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.420> need<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.630> go

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
out of my left hand maybe I need to go

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.590 
out of my left hand maybe I need to go
to<00:02:36.780> straps<00:02:37.250> but<00:02:38.250> my<00:02:38.550> grip<00:02:39.150> strength<00:02:39.420> is

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
to straps but my grip strength is

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.900 
to straps but my grip strength is
slacking<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.470> let's<00:02:40.680> try<00:02:41.070> this<00:02:41.130> third<00:02:41.580> set

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
slacking so let's try this third set

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.880 
slacking so let's try this third set
it's<00:02:42.360> going<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.870> ninety<00:02:43.320> percent<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.770> my

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
it's going to be ninety percent of my

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.040 
it's going to be ninety percent of my
one<00:02:44.040> rep<00:02:44.250> max<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.880> I'm<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:45.660> gonna<00:02:45.810> try<00:02:46.020> to

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
one rep max and I'm just gonna try to

00:02:46.050 --> 00:03:05.620 
one rep max and I'm just gonna try to
get<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.350> once<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:47.100> let's<00:02:47.430> go

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.220
