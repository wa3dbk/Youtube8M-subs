 Welcome to the program. 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.950
 warning to the final 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.070
 more than a third of the earth's inhabitants 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.290
 believes in the bible in the past many 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.230
 gave their life to have the privilege 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.610
 read your pages and obey the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.210
 your instructions 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.690
 on the other hand for hundreds of years 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.330
 others have relegated the bible there is contempt 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.530
 and the chains of darkness intended 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.210
 that she should stay forever 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.899
 object of so much controversy 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.210
 this book has taken many still cattle 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:27.270
 would indeed be the bible the word of god 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.320
 to their stories some seeming 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.160
 advantageous 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.560
 it would be true moment 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.979
 on today's show you'll see together 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.170
 with me some archaeological evidence 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:45.650
 that actually lead us to think with 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.650
 seriousness about the book on foot
