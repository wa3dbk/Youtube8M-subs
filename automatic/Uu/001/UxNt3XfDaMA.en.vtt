an idea for making a 3d curly picture by

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.800 
an idea for making a 3d curly picture by
curling<00:00:56.130> lots<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.580> strips<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.180> paper<00:00:57.390> in

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
curling lots of strips of paper in

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.320 
curling lots of strips of paper in
different<00:00:58.290> ways<00:00:58.410> try<00:00:59.130> this<00:00:59.190> take<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.090> piece<00:01:00.120> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
colored paper or thin card and cut a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.340 
colored paper or thin card and cut a
long<00:01:02.790> strip<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.720> one<00:01:04.050> centimeter

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
long strip that's about one centimeter

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.580 
long strip that's about one centimeter
wide<00:01:04.890> then<00:01:05.550> take<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.060> paintbrush<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.110> just

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
wide then take a paintbrush and just

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.730 
wide then take a paintbrush and just
roll<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.400> strip<00:01:08.760> from<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.300> end<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.810> tightly

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
roll the strip from one end just tightly

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.800 
roll the strip from one end just tightly
around<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.640> paintbrush<00:01:12.060> handle<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.630> that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
around the paintbrush handle like that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.710 
around the paintbrush handle like that
just<00:01:13.020> curling<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.009> round<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.180> all

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
just curling it round as you go in all

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.260 
just curling it round as you go in all
the<00:01:15.780> way<00:01:16.229> nice<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:16.890> tight<00:01:17.340> when<00:01:18.150> you've

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the way nice and tight when you've

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.510 
the way nice and tight when you've
rolled<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.440> strip<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.130> that

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
rolled all the strip up like that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.440 
rolled all the strip up like that
just<00:01:21.860> remove<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.890> paintbrush<00:01:23.820> watch<00:01:24.180> this

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
just remove the paintbrush watch this

and<00:01:24.990> let<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.259> curled<00:01:25.560> paper<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.729> spring<00:01:27.210> out

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and let the curled paper just spring out

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.670 
and let the curled paper just spring out
a<00:01:27.450> bit<00:01:27.660> you've<00:01:27.840> got<00:01:27.869> us<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.110> little<00:01:28.229> spring<00:01:28.560> you

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
a bit you've got us a little spring you

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.320 
a bit you've got us a little spring you
just<00:01:28.860> pull<00:01:29.009> ours<00:01:29.190> a<00:01:29.280> little<00:01:29.490> bit<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.880> you've

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
just pull ours a little bit and you've

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.260 
just pull ours a little bit and you've
got<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> tightly<00:01:31.200> curled<00:01:31.410> spiral<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.220> paper<00:01:32.550> now

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
got a tightly curled spiral of paper now

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.780 
got a tightly curled spiral of paper now
if<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.570> use<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.050> shorter<00:01:34.950> strip<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.369> paper<00:01:35.550> and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
if you use a shorter strip of paper and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.310 
if you use a shorter strip of paper and
curl<00:01:36.330> it<00:01:36.450> around<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.750> paintbrush<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.259> in

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
curl it around a paintbrush it in

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.410 
curl it around a paintbrush it in
exactly<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> same<00:01:37.979> way<00:01:38.399> look<00:01:38.580> at<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.820> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
exactly the same way look at that you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.500 
exactly the same way look at that you
get<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.720> very<00:01:40.320> tiny<00:01:40.800> spiral<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:42.030> if<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.300> use

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
get this very tiny spiral and if you use

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.510 
get this very tiny spiral and if you use
a<00:01:42.659> longer<00:01:42.990> strip<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.830> exactly<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.490> same

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
a longer strip and do exactly the same

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.230 
a longer strip and do exactly the same
thing<00:01:44.940> then<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.540> get<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.460> larger<00:01:47.460> spiral

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
thing then you get this larger spiral

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.200 
thing then you get this larger spiral
and<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:49.110> technique<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.770> called<00:01:50.210> quilling

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and this technique is called quilling

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
and this technique is called quilling
and<00:01:51.540> there's<00:01:52.050> lots<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.470> different<00:01:52.890> ways<00:01:52.979> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
and there's lots of different ways of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.550 
and there's lots of different ways of
killing<00:01:53.610> your<00:01:53.909> strips<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.390> paper<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:55.409> can

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
killing your strips of paper you can

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.500 
killing your strips of paper you can
just<00:01:55.590> roll<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.400> strip<00:01:56.700> around<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
just roll the strip around the

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.560 
just roll the strip around the
paintbrush<00:01:58.020> again<00:01:58.700> same<00:01:59.700> way<00:01:59.909> as<00:01:59.970> before

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
paintbrush again same way as before

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.230 
paintbrush again same way as before
nice<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.440> tight<00:02:01.650> as<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.010> goes<00:02:02.190> there<00:02:02.520> but

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
nice and tight as it goes there but

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.270 
nice and tight as it goes there but
instead<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.860> rolling<00:02:04.860> up<00:02:04.979> all<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.700> strip

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
instead of rolling up all of the strip

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.820 
instead of rolling up all of the strip
you<00:02:08.280> leave<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:09.030> bit<00:02:09.570> at<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.840> bottom<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.380> over

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
you leave a bit at the bottom just over

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.090 
you leave a bit at the bottom just over
halfway<00:02:11.209> when<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.330> take<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> brush<00:02:12.840> out

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
halfway when you take the brush out

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.920 
halfway when you take the brush out
there<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.610> let<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.850> curl<00:02:15.120> spring<00:02:15.750> out

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
there it is you let the curl spring out

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.590 
there it is you let the curl spring out
a<00:02:15.959> bit<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.880> have<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.060> strip

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
a bit and you have this you have a strip

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.289 
a bit and you have this you have a strip
that's<00:02:18.900> straight<00:02:19.260> with<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> curl<00:02:20.489> at<00:02:20.760> one<00:02:21.090> end

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
that's straight with a curl at one end

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.110 
that's straight with a curl at one end
and<00:02:21.780> how<00:02:22.200> about<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.769> if<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.400> do<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.760> same

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
and how about this if you do the same

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.170 
and how about this if you do the same
with<00:02:24.720> another<00:02:24.750> strip<00:02:25.410> exactly<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.100> same<00:02:26.340> when

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
with another strip exactly the same when

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.449 
with another strip exactly the same when
you've<00:02:27.299> half<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.290> rolled<00:02:28.590> up<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.250> that

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
you've half of it rolled up like that

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.120 
you've half of it rolled up like that
just<00:02:30.150> turn<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.570> over<00:02:30.750> go<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.709> other<00:02:31.830> end

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
just turn it over go to the other end

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.180 
just turn it over go to the other end
and<00:02:32.340> again<00:02:32.940> start<00:02:33.900> rolling<00:02:34.560> from<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:35.070> other

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
and again start rolling from the other

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.330 
and again start rolling from the other
end<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:36.510> time<00:02:36.900> roll<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.590> back<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.950> itself

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
end this time roll it back on itself

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.120 
end this time roll it back on itself
like<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:41.910> take<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.330> brush<00:02:42.510> out

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
like that and you take the brush out

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.909 
like that and you take the brush out
look<00:02:44.130> at<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:45.630> have<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:45.989> sort<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.560> S

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:46.919 
look at this you have this sort of S

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.330 
look at this you have this sort of S
shape<00:02:47.430> with<00:02:48.380> spirals<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:50.040> he

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
shape with spirals that he

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.940 
shape with spirals that he
brilliant<00:02:51.150> isn't<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.900> if<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.110> kill<00:02:52.410> lots

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
brilliant isn't it and if you kill lots

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.979 
brilliant isn't it and if you kill lots
of<00:02:53.160> different<00:02:53.580> length<00:02:53.730> strips<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.360> paper<00:02:54.690> in

you can just make it up as you go along
you're<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.190> designer<00:03:23.340> I'm<00:03:23.819> going<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.000> put

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
you're the designer I'm going to put

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.140 
you're the designer I'm going to put
another<00:03:24.239> one<00:03:24.510> there<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.080> Fink<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.709> then<00:03:26.549> these

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
another one there a Fink and then these

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.940 
another one there a Fink and then these
straight<00:03:27.690> ones<00:03:27.930> have<00:03:28.170> done<00:03:28.350> two<00:03:28.650> straight

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
straight ones have done two straight

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.930 
straight ones have done two straight
ones<00:03:29.130> together<00:03:29.900> like<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.350> just<00:03:31.940> put

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
ones together like that and just put

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.390 
ones together like that and just put
them<00:03:33.060> into<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.360> position<00:03:33.540> there<00:03:34.200> maybe<00:03:34.560> and

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
them into a position there maybe and

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.699 
them into a position there maybe and
let's<00:03:35.700> say<00:03:35.970> for<00:03:36.180> putting<00:03:36.599> another<00:03:36.810> one<00:03:36.930> in

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
let's say for putting another one in

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.350 
let's say for putting another one in
there<00:03:37.950> like<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.340> again<00:03:38.670> one<00:03:38.880> of<00:03:38.910> these<00:03:39.060> ones

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
there like that again one of these ones

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.630 
there like that again one of these ones
were<00:03:40.140> straight<00:03:40.650> with<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.890> curl<00:03:41.160> at<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.340> end<00:03:41.519> of

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
were straight with a curl at the end of

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.520 
were straight with a curl at the end of
it<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.739> maybe<00:03:43.739> this<00:03:44.010> one<00:03:44.250> at<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:44.970> end<00:03:45.530> like

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
it and maybe this one at the end like

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.940 
it and maybe this one at the end like
that<00:03:47.090> you've<00:03:48.090> got<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:48.330> sort<00:03:48.630> of<00:03:48.950> simple

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
that you've got this sort of simple

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.089 
that you've got this sort of simple
