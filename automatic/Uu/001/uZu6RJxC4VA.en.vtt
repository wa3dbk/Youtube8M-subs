 brittany I join cursed slope in 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.190
 seaside for a shoot that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.190

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.190
 his fans that sometimes I will okay it has 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.190
 five or six present yourself yeah a little 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.480
 they killed what are you doing 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.809
 as you say I'm gonna go save 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.520
 Dia photographer in Brittany since 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.830
 now three and a half years I come 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.270
 a belfort at the origin and I got 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.020
 exiled here to recharge my batteries 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.430
 because I'm taking pictures of landscapes 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.370
 it's the landscape it's perfect we have 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.320
 skies that are excellent we have the tide 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.550
 and marinas up to 12 meters so 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.040
 private bank of what 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.350
 it's great against a low tide and 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.940
 a fad and landscapes change 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.150
 it really makes it possible to vary 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.900
 boards what do we want what is it 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.610
 excellent what kind of photo I 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.460
 works for the telegram I am rising 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.750
 of sports and then of show and then to 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.030
 side in big part of the photos 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.740
 of automobiles it's like saying the beginning 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.750
 of my photo activity that's why 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.240
 I started I specialized there 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.310
 in so I'm taking pictures between 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.159
 quotes car portrait so 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.930
 posed with lighting and all that and then 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.299
 I also do moving photos 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.469
 who are the little secrets 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.609
 this is what we see today is that 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.250
 that we will see today actually 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:43.070
 true today I have a friend who will us 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.320
 make the pleasure of bringing us his 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.790
 megan rs 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.950
 beautiful colors and more she is far 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.300
 to have it it'll be a pleasure to 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.840
 to work with because there forms 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.460
 that I love 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.170
 she's really violent like 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.300
 car ie the cars 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.160
 which are flat like platform sppa 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.900
 not interesting but the megane rs he 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.690
 is really good for that I have 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.610
 already done several times she head that 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.400
 is really nice to work in 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.080
 photo so it's going to be a pleasure but 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.050
 it will be pictures asked at the beginning 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.040
 communicates on the dike 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.160
 it's going to be really the top because in 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.370
 the more we invest it that is perfect 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.890
 as said in long exposure one must 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.510
 work the car so rest there that 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.940
 will make an effect through with the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.590
 car with the shape of the car that 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.959
 is going to be an excellent effect actually you 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.640
 combines the technique of landscape and jalil 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.500
 landscapes too because suddenly you can 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.150
 work that sea â€‹â€‹the light that 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.220
 is currently riding with the sky we are allies 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.709
 all in party and jemelle and cars 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.690
 in a natural element and that she is 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.830
 finally fell that are created to you 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.110
 to give this net a little car 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.060
 net blues man that everyone 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.950
 know this is my little secret it's 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.180
 what is called the rig 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.010
 so in fact the device placed on a 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.720
 bar longer or shorter it goes from 1 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.019
 meter 50 up to his part and up to seven 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.660
 meters 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.250
 I limit myself to 4 meters 50 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.540
 the camera is at the end the car ahead 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.370
 and that gives in so it's always 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.230
 the same is the long break and it's 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.590
 to give a net effect there is that the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.030
 car that will be net is enough 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.150
 particular c 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.290
 it's complex to mount messece gives 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.650
 his speed defeats that we can see 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.440
 in the commercials in the essays of 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.720
 homemade manufacturing 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.990
 these custom made is a small 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.720
 box who is an entrepreneur who has me 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.850
 made the crisis it made me measure the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.680
 park data terry stick the diameter 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.120
 the length that I wanted the number of 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.470
 bars pts on several bars that 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.910
 I assemble he made me that it is measured 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.520
 small metal bar and at all from the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.200
 stuffs next to hang the bar on 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.510
 the car hook the device to the 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.360
 bar this hero all a catch system 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.850
 of view there product owners do not 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.320
 are not afraid that turenne their car has 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.370
 never had any problems with its members 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.810
 for this question because 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.570
 that in general when the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.710
 proprios see you with the bar 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.700
 always on time freezes latency 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.080
 finally will not be doing it and 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.910
 the thing because it's good 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.110
 cars in general I've already done some 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.460
 porsche ferrari and all its means 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.520
 what they are really afraid of scratching the 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.920
 car but when goes up to close there 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.150
 see the system so it goes well there 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.030
 when he sees the pictures after they are 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.950
 content wages will ensure for can 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.080
 rework together so a worry they 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.010
 be confident but it's true that 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.530
 I too have a year old site when I see 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.460
 the same on the bar good that wants 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.650
 already happened once the device is 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.000
 fell fortunately just below 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.570
 I called it that there is a sucker 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.550
 who had let go 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.090
 so it's just right below but it's 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.040
 below natural little risk that it 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.330
 is part of the game that's what makes 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.320
 when you make it original photos 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.320
 need a risk it's like that
