00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.850
 municipality and went through a period of 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.799
 great 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.920
 development with the construction of 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.710

 stretch rosário are Luis was inaugurated 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.939
 in 1921 allowing the flow of the 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.340
 local production to the capital 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.740
 It is worth mentioning in this 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.840
 importance of benedito leite one of the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.930
 illustrious sons of the earth

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.990
 strategic point for the economy of the 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.210
 state 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.060
 Rosario stands out as a portal of 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.700
 entrance to the Maranhão sheets for 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.040
 after the construction of the transit highway 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.769
 gain has widened the possibility of 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.780
 integration with other municipalities 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.769
 holders of high tourist potential 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.069
 those who live are actively anticipating 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.730
 development 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.830
 to visit the city is worth knowing 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.560
 where the old station worked 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.049
 which today, despite being 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.239
 abandoned brings us back to the golden age 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.510
 in which the railroads were the main 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.820
 means of transportation of a Brazil that 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.470
 your first steps towards 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.470
 development of the interior 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.519
 in the city we can also highlight the 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.080
 governor square and make the 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.760
 stadium serejão 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:00.140
 the church our lady of the rosary and all 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.140
 greatness of itapecuru 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.060
 it is worth remembering that about eight 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.300
 kilometers below the city 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.450
 in the mouth of the river itapecuru is the 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.880
 ruins of the old porte de vera or the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.020
 calvary where fighting was fought 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:23.750
 between Portuguese and French in 1613 I 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:28.100
 already knew the focus and 45 of that heard 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.590
 tile there they win the fort was 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.280
 equipped by the Portuguese, having been 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.440
 taken by the Dutch in 1641 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.950
 the following year the Portuguese 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.520
 ambush on the stone of patience 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:46.040
 succeeded in resuming it in 1682 a strong 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.660
 was rectified in the government of Francisco 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.090
 in 1840 at the time of the 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.910
 revolution of the balayada was rebuilt 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.760
 under the orders of the then marques de caxias 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.160
 by the first lieutenant engineer the 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.950
 vieira da silva conflict being then 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.709
 removed several stones from the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.280
 and open a channel to facilitate the 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.769
 navigation is certainly a place where 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.290
 maranhão's history is more present 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.479
 than ever in popular culture 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.510
 highlight the bumba my ox where 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.840
 shines the ox of the rosary with the melody of 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.820
 his orchestra was adored and I 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.390
 I helped embroider the first drops of 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.370
 dumbo I went to us it's big obvious but he 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.480
 it's unheard of is ours 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:40.930
 on average the old 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:43.660
 the Creole drum and eln dance and 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:50.680
 are also cultural manifestations that 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:53.800
 stand out in the city the carnival the block 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.300
 carts drags thousands of people 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.300
 on Ash Wednesday 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:04.800
 another rosary highlight is your 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.710
 handicraft where the clay takes the 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.890
 various forms such as pots and jars 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.490
 filters 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:17.280
 so in rosary a strategic city 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.800
 whose importance is directly linked 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.460
 with the development history of the 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.460
 our state
