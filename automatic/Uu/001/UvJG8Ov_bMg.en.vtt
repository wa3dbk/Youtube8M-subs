doc<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:07.390> out<00:01:07.510> of<00:01:07.540> there<00:01:08.729> okay<00:01:09.729> ah<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:11.470> you<00:01:12.159> guys

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
doc get out of there okay ah if you guys

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.760 
doc get out of there okay ah if you guys
notice<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:13.240> bottom<00:01:13.570> of<00:01:13.689> that<00:01:13.840> left<00:01:14.080> foot<00:01:14.170> is

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
notice the bottom of that left foot is

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.950 
notice the bottom of that left foot is
actually<00:01:15.159> twisted<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.549> the<00:01:15.670> inside<00:01:16.060> this<00:01:16.689> is

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
actually twisted to the inside this is

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.980 
actually twisted to the inside this is
probably<00:01:17.229> congenital<00:01:17.890> anomaly<00:01:18.780> secondary<00:01:19.780> to

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
probably congenital anomaly secondary to

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.349 
probably congenital anomaly secondary to
trauma<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.859> feeding<00:01:21.549> and<00:01:21.789> their<00:01:21.880> own<00:01:22.000> foods

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
trauma and feeding and their own foods

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.649 
trauma and feeding and their own foods
or<00:01:22.689> calcium<00:01:23.320> concentrations<00:01:24.310> I<00:01:24.549> think<00:01:25.539> they

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
or calcium concentrations I think they

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.539 
or calcium concentrations I think they
should<00:01:25.840> probably<00:01:26.140> have<00:01:26.259> a<00:01:26.289> separate<00:01:26.799> feed<00:01:27.189> for

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
should probably have a separate feed for

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.190 
should probably have a separate feed for
every<00:01:27.759> species<00:01:28.000> of<00:01:28.210> duck<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:28.810> every<00:01:28.960> species

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
every species of duck and every species

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.899 
every species of duck and every species
of<00:01:29.350> waterfowl<00:01:29.799> as<00:01:30.159> well<00:01:30.310> as<00:01:30.429> well<00:01:30.579> as<00:01:30.700> poultry

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
of waterfowl as well as well as poultry

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.849 
of waterfowl as well as well as poultry
but<00:01:31.659> they<00:01:31.899> just<00:01:32.049> don't<00:01:32.200> get<00:01:32.350> that<00:01:32.530> lucky

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
but they just don't get that lucky

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.739 
but they just don't get that lucky
because<00:01:33.340> it's<00:01:33.640> not<00:01:33.759> that<00:01:33.909> much<00:01:33.939> research<00:01:34.450> and

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:34.749 
because it's not that much research and

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:37.169 
because it's not that much research and
it's<00:01:35.079> really<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.499> whole<00:01:35.590> lot<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.799> home<00:01:36.789> steel

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
it's really the whole lot of home steel

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.880 
it's really the whole lot of home steel
isn't<00:01:37.960> a<00:01:37.990> whole<00:01:38.109> lot<00:01:38.140> of<00:01:38.320> money<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.890> funky

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
isn't a whole lot of money and funky

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.690 
isn't a whole lot of money and funky
foot<00:01:42.070> duck<00:01:42.549> food<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:45.100> this<00:01:45.249> is<00:01:45.369> one<00:01:45.549> of<00:01:45.579> the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
foot duck food so this is one of the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.489 
foot duck food so this is one of the
things<00:01:45.880> that<00:01:45.969> happens<00:01:46.179> this<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:46.990> his<00:01:47.140> second

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
things that happens this is his second

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.620 
things that happens this is his second
recheck<00:01:47.859> it<00:01:48.100> was<00:01:48.579> hard<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:48.789> diagnose<00:01:49.179> before<00:01:49.600> I

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
recheck it was hard to diagnose before I

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.120 
recheck it was hard to diagnose before I
thought<00:01:49.929> it<00:01:50.049> might<00:01:50.079> have<00:01:50.289> just<00:01:50.350> been<00:01:50.619> a<00:01:50.740> sprain

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
thought it might have just been a sprain

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.130 
thought it might have just been a sprain
he<00:01:51.969> seems<00:01:52.329> a<00:01:52.450> little<00:01:52.600> bit<00:01:52.719> more<00:01:52.899> than<00:01:53.049> the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
he seems a little bit more than the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.380 
he seems a little bit more than the
sprayed<00:01:53.439> so<00:01:54.159> this<00:01:54.700> guy's<00:01:54.880> gonna<00:01:55.090> be<00:01:55.240> funky

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
sprayed so this guy's gonna be funky

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.279 
sprayed so this guy's gonna be funky
foot<00:01:55.719> forever<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:57.359> sometimes<00:01:58.359> there's<00:01:59.020> some

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
foot forever I sometimes there's some

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.840 
foot forever I sometimes there's some
physical<00:01:59.619> therapy<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.069> can<00:02:00.130> reverse<00:02:00.520> this

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
physical therapy that can reverse this

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.059 
physical therapy that can reverse this
or<00:02:01.240> at<00:02:01.329> least<00:02:01.389> improve<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:02.020> but<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.649> can't<00:02:02.979> even

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
or at least improve it but I can't even

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.499 
or at least improve it but I can't even
get<00:02:03.249> his<00:02:03.369> leg<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.639> straighten<00:02:03.909> out<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.299> think

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
get his leg to straighten out so I think

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.629 
get his leg to straighten out so I think
we're<00:02:04.659> beyond<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.049> physical<00:02:05.200> 30<00:02:05.590> part<00:02:05.859> anyway

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:06.639 
we're beyond the physical 30 part anyway

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.700 
we're beyond the physical 30 part anyway
other<00:02:07.119> than<00:02:07.359> that<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.810> just<00:02:08.110> want<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.500> world<00:02:08.619> to

other than that I just want the world to

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.630 
other than that I just want the world to
know<00:02:08.830> your<00:02:09.310> circle<00:02:09.670> um

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.210
