00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.980 
the sponge and the water will not come
down<00:04:33.160> as<00:04:33.430> fast<00:04:33.760> because<00:04:34.449> there's<00:04:34.660> going<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:34.930> be

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
down as fast because there's going to be

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.920 
down as fast because there's going to be
air<00:04:35.350> bubbles<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:36.130> will<00:04:37.000> get<00:04:37.240> trapped<00:04:37.570> in

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
air bubbles that will get trapped in

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.100 
air bubbles that will get trapped in
there<00:04:38.370> yeah<00:04:39.479> so<00:04:40.479> I'm<00:04:40.539> going<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:40.780> show<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:40.990> a

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
all back together and you get the water

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:54.300 
all back together and you get the water
filled<00:04:46.960> up<00:04:49.289> but<00:04:50.289> we're<00:04:50.500> going<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.770> take<00:04:53.310> our

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
little bit just let any air bubbles you

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.790 
little bit just let any air bubbles you
wanted<00:05:19.900> to<00:05:20.760> do<00:05:21.760> it<00:05:21.910> on<00:05:22.000> all<00:05:22.389> sides<00:05:22.810> because<00:05:23.650> if
