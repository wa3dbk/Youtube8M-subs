 brico a bit of us at the cost of you 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.370
 lay laminate flooring 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.590
 here are the tools you will need 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.170
 for your jobsite floorboards 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.140
 laminate gloves one under layer 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.160
 adhesive insulation a wedge 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.769
 bekale strikes a pencil a cutter of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.859
 scissors a master a square 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.500

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.550
 protection 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.190
 a mallet a miter saw a gun 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.570
 silicone silicon a saw 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.520
 multifunction ideally deposit the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.240
 floorboards in the room 48 hours 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.930
 before the break 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.940
 step 1 on a flat floor is clean 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.550
 we start by unrolling an under layer 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.560
 which will dampen the noise of the parts made 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.150
 the cuts necessary for the cutter to 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.250
 bypass obstacles like 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.360
 radiator hoses and do not let 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.550
 overflow the under layer on the wall 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.290
 a little thing what is the first 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.000
 flat tape with slats of 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.130
 parquet the second strip is laid edge 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.840
 on board without overlap and the 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.840
 two strips with adhesive for 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.550
 keep up last band 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.650
 sound insulation is too big 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.290
 we have couples stalling against the 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.060
 wall by marking well the fold one ends 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.220
 the cuts and we are ready for the step 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.030
 next 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.799
 2nd step 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.110
 the first slat strip arises 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.440
 against the wall if possible in the direction 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.820
 from the main entrance of the light 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.180
 be careful the side that has a tab 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.710
 must be towards oneself like those here the 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.950
 second latte is clicking in the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.540
 first in the length we position 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.580
 this first strip of parquet against 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.979
 the wall taking care to place a 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.630
 wedge between wall and lath to create 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.210
 a regular expansion joint 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.690
 about 8 mm between the wall and the 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.610
 parquet to finish this first 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.369
 parquet bank you have to measure the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.110
 length of the last slats 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.820
 be careful for that you have to return the 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.019
 nam and put it in the opposite direction 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.640
 of the break against a cane 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.930
 we find the place of the cut and we 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.930
 extends the very far away 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.280
 to cut the latte we can use 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.840
 a parquet couple adjusted the tool for 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.720
 wedge the batten according to its width 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.520
 is pressed the handle attention the tool 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.330
 is very convenient but you have to have 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.280
 good biceps 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.280
 if not used a jigsaw 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.200
 and here we have to apply the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.810
 last date that falls perfectly 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.310
 against the wall 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.080
 I was just then this first 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.830
 tape against the wall without forgetting the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.450
 wedges and we will place the second band 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.370
 we start with the fall of the last 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.709
 the soul with the side without language is 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.060
 against the wall and we clip the blades 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.150
 one after the other as for the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.069
 first bank when the second band 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.040
 is ready she can be clipping to the 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.230
 first and that's it 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.220
 repeat these operations it's very simple 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.320
 and work is progressing fast 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.870
 but stop you reach the level of a pipe 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.310
 the most aesthetic radiator will be 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.959
 make a cut in the middle of a joint 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.209
 we will measure the piece of slats 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.230
 who will come against the wall and the hold and 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.489
 to the middle of the pipe here 6 5 cm and 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.590
 we find a place that will need 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.380
 cut with a jigsaw to surround 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.200
 the pipe it is better to return 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.730
 the latte to not make a shine 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.470
 postpone this cutout on the other 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.269
 piece of rap that will surround pipes 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.010
 for a flawless finish 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.780
 there are small caches that 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.930
 have tightened the space around the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.930
 pipe 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.519
 and here he is surrounded properly 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.530
 can continue to move forward 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.209
 there are no more obstacles until 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.760
 that we reach the level of the doorframe of 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.560
 the door is placed the floorboards 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.200
 against the doorframe and we trace a 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.239
 landmark we will cut the doorframe for 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.620
 pass the blade underneath for that 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.780
 this multifunction is 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.280
 particularly practical it allows 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.310
 couples in places of access 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.310
 difficult 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.039
 we come to the end of the room to 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:20.019
 bypass the second heating pipes 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.019
 we proceed as for the previous 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.510
 and we finally arrive at the last lama 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.930
 pose is obviously he'll have to have the 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.639
 cut in all its length 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.290
 we start by measuring the width he 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.540
 will have to be filled by taking into account the 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.910
 wedge wall and is transferred onto the blade 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.440
 park and use another blade 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.300
 to draw a line of landmarks on 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.040
 full length 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.470
 we can then cut with the 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.520
 koop parquet but again the saw 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.259
 Jumping requires less force 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.669
 once the cuts are done the 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.220
 last band on your part that can 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.530
 to be placed for that we can use 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.150
 this wedge that will help you 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.550
 clip and adjust the band 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.060
 correctly and that's fine 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.190
 job 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.550
 and it's almost done you can go to 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.750
 the next step the complaints break 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.310
 step 3 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.710
 to do the cutting of the complaints you 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.660
 can use a tab box or 7 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.340
 6 special for bevel cuts 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.220
 it allows to make connections 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.810
 impeccable whose corners of the walls 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.250
 then the complaints are here all 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.250
 simply glued to silicone 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.480
 all that remains is to place the warehouse 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.480
 who is here just screwing 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.280
 it only took a few hours to 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.319
 lay this laminate parquet with these 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.729
 small finishing details the result 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:42.110
 is impeccable and the room is 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.110
 transformed to you to play
