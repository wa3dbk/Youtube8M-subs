interesting part we've had so much shock
technology<00:00:40.800> over<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> years<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:42.030> it

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
technology over the years that it

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.000 
technology over the years that it
actually<00:00:42.809> was<00:00:42.899> pretty<00:00:43.140> easy<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.440> us<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:43.950> need

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
actually was pretty easy for us we need

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.760 
actually was pretty easy for us we need
to<00:00:44.100> fine-tune<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.850> much<00:00:45.140> we<00:00:46.140> offer<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.530> lot

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
to fine-tune it so much we offer a lot

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.080 
to fine-tune it so much we offer a lot
of<00:00:46.800> shocks<00:00:47.129> out<00:00:47.309> there<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> Pro<00:00:47.820> Touring

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
of shocks out there for the Pro Touring

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.660 
of shocks out there for the Pro Touring
guys<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.960> two<00:00:49.140> problem<00:00:49.559> most<00:00:49.829> popular<00:00:50.460> ones

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
guys the two problem most popular ones

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.700 
guys the two problem most popular ones
are<00:00:50.969> your<00:00:51.690> double<00:00:51.989> adjustables

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
are your double adjustables

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
are your double adjustables
and<00:00:52.980> then<00:00:53.280> also<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.059> canister

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and then also we have this canister

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.080 
and then also we have this canister
double<00:00:55.020> adjustable<00:00:55.440> which<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:56.190> this

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
double adjustable which I have here this

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.610 
double adjustable which I have here this
piece<00:00:57.390> right<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.660> basically<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.590> have

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
piece right here basically what you have

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.650 
piece right here basically what you have
is<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.160> mono<00:00:59.370> tube<00:00:59.640> style<00:00:59.910> shock<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.600> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
is it's a mono tube style shock so you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.630 
is it's a mono tube style shock so you
get<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.020> big<00:01:01.289> piston<00:01:01.770> our<00:01:01.920> nice<00:01:02.129> smooth<00:01:02.609> ride

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
get that big piston our nice smooth ride

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.990 
get that big piston our nice smooth ride
and<00:01:03.559> this<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.159> actually<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> reservoir

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and this here is actually a reservoir

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
and this here is actually a reservoir
that<00:01:06.299> has<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> bladder<00:01:06.930> inside<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.680> you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that has a bladder inside it that you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.859 
that has a bladder inside it that you
can<00:01:07.890> put<00:01:08.070> adjustable<00:01:08.610> gas<00:01:08.790> pressure<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
can put adjustable gas pressure in and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.260 
can put adjustable gas pressure in and
and<00:01:10.110> what's<00:01:10.470> interesting<00:01:10.890> about<00:01:11.250> ours<00:01:11.790> is

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and what's interesting about ours is

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.609 
and what's interesting about ours is
there's<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.630> lot<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.869> shops<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:13.530> that

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
there's a lot of shops out there that

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.200 
there's a lot of shops out there that
you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.860> adjust<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.880> call<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
you can adjust what we call the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.999 
you can adjust what we call the
compression<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.140> rebound<00:01:16.500> you're<00:01:16.770> right

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
compression and the rebound you're right

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.429 
compression and the rebound you're right
however<00:01:17.670> when<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.000> adjust<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.840> seems<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
however when you adjust one it seems to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.469 
however when you adjust one it seems to
affect<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.920> other<00:01:19.950> one<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:20.970> much<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.360> it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
affect the other one not as much but it

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.270 
affect the other one not as much but it
seems<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.869> effective<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.710> our<00:01:22.740> racing

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
seems to effective with our racing

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.090 
seems to effective with our racing
tradition<00:01:23.810> we've<00:01:24.810> separated<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.530> years<00:01:25.770> ago

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
tradition we've separated that years ago

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100 
tradition we've separated that years ago
okay<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.820> when<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.240> compression<00:01:27.840> that's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
okay so when you just compression that's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.499 
okay so when you just compression that's
all<00:01:28.290> you're<00:01:28.470> gonna<00:01:28.560> adjust<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.299> this

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
all you're gonna adjust so now in this

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.770 
all you're gonna adjust so now in this
we<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.590> nice<00:01:32.400> truly<00:01:32.970> separate<00:01:33.390> circuit

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
we have a nice truly separate circuit

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
we have a nice truly separate circuit
for<00:01:33.990> compression<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.189> rebound<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.820> now

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
for compression and for rebound and now

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.410 
for compression and for rebound and now
you're<00:01:36.240> telling<00:01:36.509> me<00:01:36.540> there's<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.650> separate

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
you're telling me there's a separate

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.050 
you're telling me there's a separate
before<00:01:41.170> as<00:01:41.350> well<00:01:41.619> that's<00:01:42.009> right<00:01:42.250> what<00:01:42.729> you<00:01:42.880> can

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
before as well that's right what you can

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.640 
before as well that's right what you can
do<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.420> with<00:01:43.659> this<00:01:43.810> piece<00:01:44.049> right<00:01:44.259> here<00:01:44.320> there's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
do is with this piece right here there's

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.620 
do is with this piece right here there's
a<00:01:44.740> bulb<00:01:44.979> inside<00:01:45.460> here<00:01:45.729> that<00:01:46.119> holds<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.479> gas

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
a bulb inside here that holds the gas

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.039 
a bulb inside here that holds the gas
okay<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:48.130> can<00:01:48.310> bring<00:01:48.460> it<00:01:48.580> down<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.880> zero<00:01:49.049> or

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
okay you can bring it down to zero or

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.270 
okay you can bring it down to zero or
you<00:01:50.080> can<00:01:50.290> put<00:01:50.439> it<00:01:50.530> up<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.770> one<00:01:50.979> hundred<00:01:51.070> and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
you can put it up to one hundred and

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.660 
you can put it up to one hundred and
fifteen<00:01:51.700> hundred<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:52.060> twenty<00:01:52.360> psi<00:01:52.570> so<00:01:53.560> you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
fifteen hundred and twenty psi so you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.490 
fifteen hundred and twenty psi so you
pump<00:01:54.670> this<00:01:54.850> up<00:01:55.060> with<00:01:55.210> gas<00:01:55.479> it's<00:01:55.840> nitrogen<00:01:56.350> gas

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
pump this up with gas it's nitrogen gas

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.830 
pump this up with gas it's nitrogen gas
it<00:01:57.369> actually<00:01:57.789> acts<00:01:57.970> like<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:58.420> car<00:01:58.630> has<00:01:58.810> a

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
it actually acts like the car has a

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.450 
it actually acts like the car has a
stiffer<00:01:59.170> spring<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.799> puts<00:02:00.009> what<00:02:00.159> we<00:02:00.250> call

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
stiffer spring it puts what we call

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.580 
stiffer spring it puts what we call
preload<00:02:00.909> in<00:02:01.060> this<00:02:01.210> shaft<00:02:01.450> as<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.200> hear<00:02:02.380> this

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
preload in this shaft as you hear this

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.609 
preload in this shaft as you hear this
up<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:02.979> shaft<00:02:03.280> will<00:02:03.490> come<00:02:03.670> out<00:02:04.170> okay<00:02:05.200> that's

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
up the shaft will come out okay that's

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:06.270 
up the shaft will come out okay that's
correct

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
correct

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.479

big<00:02:30.489> bump<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:30.970> was<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.269> hydraulic<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:31.840> you

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
big bump and it was the hydraulic so you

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.240 
big bump and it was the hydraulic so you
got<00:02:32.049> the<00:02:32.140> ton<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> same<00:02:32.560> deal<00:02:32.739> but<00:02:32.950> exactly

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
got the ton of the same deal but exactly

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.979 
got the ton of the same deal but exactly
right<00:02:33.549> and<00:02:33.850> it's<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.569> wide<00:02:34.780> height

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989
