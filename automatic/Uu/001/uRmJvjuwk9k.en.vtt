00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.680 

and<00:00:40.320> back<00:00:40.589> of<00:00:40.859> the<00:00:40.980> deltoid<00:00:41.370> muscle<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.570> we're

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and back of the deltoid muscle so we're

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.509 
and back of the deltoid muscle so we're
going<00:00:42.839> to<00:00:42.899> use<00:00:43.280> fairly<00:00:44.280> lightweight

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
going to use fairly lightweight

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.720 
going to use fairly lightweight
dumbbells<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.170> 2<00:00:46.769> or<00:00:46.890> 3<00:00:47.129> pounds<00:00:47.640> I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
dumbbells on this a 2 or 3 pounds I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.840 
dumbbells on this a 2 or 3 pounds I
think<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.999> are<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> 3<00:00:48.449> pounds<00:00:48.659> here<00:00:49.699> and<00:00:50.699> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
think I are the 3 pounds here and the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.360 
think I are the 3 pounds here and the
first<00:00:51.120> exercise<00:00:51.719> we're<00:00:51.929> going<00:00:52.019> to<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.649> for

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
first exercise we're going to do is for

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.049 
first exercise we're going to do is for
the<00:00:54.319> front<00:00:55.319> of<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.800> deltoid<00:00:56.280> muscle<00:00:56.760> which<00:00:56.879> we

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the front of the deltoid muscle which we

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.590 
the front of the deltoid muscle which we
would<00:00:57.179> call<00:00:57.359> the<00:00:57.510> anterior<00:00:58.170> deltoid<00:00:58.649> muscle

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
would call the anterior deltoid muscle

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.059 
would call the anterior deltoid muscle
so<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:00.780> we're<00:01:00.929> going<00:01:01.019> to<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.739> one

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069 
so what we're going to do is this one

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:05.180 
so what we're going to do is this one
arm<00:01:02.639> at<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.819> time<00:01:03.379> raise<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> arm<00:01:04.710> up<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
arm at a time raise the arm up to

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.039 
arm at a time raise the arm up to
shoulder<00:01:05.580> level<00:01:06.380> like<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.960> recommend<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
shoulder level like so and recommend a

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.310 
shoulder level like so and recommend a
hold<00:01:10.200> each<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> few<00:01:10.890> seconds<00:01:11.579> and<00:01:12.320> ideally

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
hold each one a few seconds and ideally

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:23.550 
hold each one a few seconds and ideally
I<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.500> eight<00:01:13.979> reps<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:18.860> 3<00:01:20.090> 4

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.080 

five<00:01:26.410> so<00:01:27.410> typically<00:01:27.890> do<00:01:28.070> eight<00:01:28.340> of<00:01:28.370> this<00:01:28.700> and

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
five so typically do eight of this and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.030 
five so typically do eight of this and
like<00:01:29.180> I<00:01:29.300> said<00:01:29.510> this<00:01:29.630> is<00:01:29.780> for<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.050> anterior<00:01:30.890> or

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
like I said this is for the anterior or

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.750 
like I said this is for the anterior or
front<00:01:31.250> part<00:01:32.120> of<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:33.110> deltoid<00:01:33.650> muscle<00:01:34.190> which

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
front part of the deltoid muscle which

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.020 
front part of the deltoid muscle which
the<00:01:34.960> deltoid<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.200> really<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.190> main<00:01:37.400> shoulder

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
the deltoid is really the main shoulder

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.620 
the deltoid is really the main shoulder
muscle<00:01:39.280> okay<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:40.640> blue<00:01:40.760> we<00:01:41.000> have<00:01:41.119> eight<00:01:41.330> there

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
muscle okay so blue we have eight there

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.520 
muscle okay so blue we have eight there
the<00:01:42.410> next<00:01:42.890> one<00:01:43.880> we're<00:01:44.090> going<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.270> going<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:45.260> do

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
the next one we're going to going to do

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.109 
the next one we're going to going to do
is<00:01:45.890> for<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.520> medial<00:01:47.119> deltoid<00:01:47.630> muscle<00:01:48.200> so

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
is for the medial deltoid muscle so

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.210 
is for the medial deltoid muscle so
first<00:01:50.119> one<00:01:50.330> was<00:01:50.450> for<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:50.780> part<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.320> anterior

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
first one was for this part the anterior

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.480 
first one was for this part the anterior
delt<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:53.330> one<00:01:53.570> is<00:01:53.750> for<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.140> medial<00:01:54.590> delt<00:01:54.860> the

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
delt this one is for the medial delt the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.469 
delt this one is for the medial delt the
middle<00:01:55.790> of<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.030> deltoid<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.649> this<00:01:57.860> one

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
middle of the deltoid and so on this one

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.100 
middle of the deltoid and so on this one
we're<00:01:59.479> going<00:01:59.690> to<00:02:00.820> bend<00:02:01.820> over<00:02:01.970> just<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.450> tiny<00:02:02.750> bit

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
we're going to bend over just a tiny bit

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.609 
we're going to bend over just a tiny bit
about<00:02:03.950> 15<00:02:04.430> degrees<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.990> we're<00:02:06.200> just<00:02:06.320> going<00:02:06.590> to

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
about 15 degrees and we're just going to

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.639 
about 15 degrees and we're just going to
come<00:02:06.860> up<00:02:07.009> like<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:09.170> that's<00:02:09.350> how<00:02:09.500> we're

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
come up like so so that's how we're

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.190 
come up like so so that's how we're
going<00:02:09.739> to<00:02:09.800> do<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:10.220> one<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.789> it<00:02:11.420> is<00:02:11.630> for<00:02:11.989> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
going to do this one and it is for the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.900 
going to do this one and it is for the
medial<00:02:13.160> deltoid<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:19.160> course<00:02:19.400> remember<00:02:19.820> to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
medial deltoid and of course remember to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.710 
medial deltoid and of course remember to
breathe<00:02:20.120> while<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.600> do<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:25.060> okay<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.120> there

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
breathe while you do this okay so there

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.199 
breathe while you do this okay so there
we<00:02:27.140> have<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.410> medial<00:02:27.950> deltoid<00:02:28.400> muscle<00:02:29.030> I

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
we have the medial deltoid muscle I

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.479 
we have the medial deltoid muscle I
believe<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.630> did<00:02:29.840> eight<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.170> those<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.739> the

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
believe I did eight of those and the

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.090 
believe I did eight of those and the
next<00:02:31.519> thing<00:02:31.910> we're<00:02:32.030> going<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.239> do<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.720> for<00:02:32.989> the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
next thing we're going to do is for the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.070 
next thing we're going to do is for the
posterior<00:02:34.100> deltoid<00:02:34.670> muscle<00:02:35.239> now<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.750> would

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
posterior deltoid muscle now I would

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.660 
posterior deltoid muscle now I would
typically<00:02:36.440> take<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.769> little<00:02:37.100> break<00:02:37.400> between

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
typically take a little break between

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.490 
typically take a little break between
sets<00:02:38.560> probably<00:02:39.560> thirty<00:02:40.220> Seconds<00:02:40.820> to<00:02:41.500> 90

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
sets probably thirty Seconds to 90

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.130 
sets probably thirty Seconds to 90
seconds<00:02:43.209> but<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.510> take<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.720> little<00:02:44.900> break

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
seconds but you just take a little break

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.949 
seconds but you just take a little break
between<00:02:45.380> sets<00:02:45.890> if<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.400> desire<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.690> last

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
between sets if you desire to the last

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.720 
between sets if you desire to the last
one<00:02:48.290> we're<00:02:48.410> going<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.590> do<00:02:48.799> is<00:02:49.040> similar<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.610> the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
one we're going to do is similar to the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.390 
one we're going to do is similar to the
second<00:02:50.239> one<00:02:50.390> except<00:02:51.049> instead<00:02:51.799> of<00:02:51.950> having<00:02:52.190> our

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
second one except instead of having our

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.550 
second one except instead of having our
thumbs<00:02:52.760> around<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.600> dumbbells<00:02:54.049> like<00:02:54.170> this

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
thumbs around the dumbbells like this

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.569 
thumbs around the dumbbells like this
we're<00:02:55.549> gonna<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:55.910> our<00:02:56.060> thumbs<00:02:56.420> up<00:02:56.720> like<00:02:57.260> that

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
we're gonna have our thumbs up like that

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.420 
we're gonna have our thumbs up like that
so<00:02:58.579> what<00:02:59.090> we're<00:02:59.239> gonna<00:02:59.299> do<00:02:59.660> here<00:03:00.310> we're<00:03:01.310> gonna

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
so what we're gonna do here we're gonna

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.770 
so what we're gonna do here we're gonna
have<00:03:01.640> our<00:03:01.790> thumbs<00:03:02.090> up<00:03:02.329> and<00:03:02.510> we're<00:03:02.600> going<00:03:02.690> to

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
have our thumbs up and we're going to

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.840 
have our thumbs up and we're going to
point<00:03:02.989> them<00:03:03.200> skyward<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.100> this<00:03:04.519> is<00:03:04.640> going<00:03:04.790> to

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
point them skyward and this is going to

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.930 
point them skyward and this is going to
work<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.180> posterior<00:03:06.220> deltoid<00:03:07.220> or<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.670> back

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
work the posterior deltoid or the back

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.170 
work the posterior deltoid or the back
of<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.360> deltoid<00:03:08.810> muscle<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:10.610> this<00:03:10.820> one<00:03:11.000> is

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
of the deltoid muscle so this one is

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.430 
of the deltoid muscle so this one is
like<00:03:11.360> that

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.610 

now<00:03:16.440> what<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.650> typically<00:03:17.160> find<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:19.170> deltoid

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
now what I typically find is the deltoid

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.070 
now what I typically find is the deltoid
muscle<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:21.180> might<00:03:21.360> have<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.660> use<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> little

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
muscle you might have to use a little

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.720 
muscle you might have to use a little
less<00:03:22.200> weight<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:23.160> know<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.400> if<00:03:23.459> you're<00:03:23.580> using

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
less weight you know so if you're using

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.000 
less weight you know so if you're using
a<00:03:24.209> 3<00:03:24.540> pounds<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.470> might<00:03:25.620> want<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.860> go<00:03:25.950> to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
a 3 pounds you might want to go to

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.570 
a 3 pounds you might want to go to
2<00:03:26.250> pounds<00:03:26.850> or<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.569> posterior<00:03:28.050> delt<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:29.400> the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
2 pounds or the posterior delt of the

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.820 
2 pounds or the posterior delt of the
anterior<00:03:30.030> delt<00:03:30.270> one<00:03:30.540> typically<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.140> find<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.650> can

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
anterior delt one typically I find I can

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.670 
anterior delt one typically I find I can
use<00:03:31.980> more<00:03:32.220> weight<00:03:32.459> there<00:03:33.020> than<00:03:34.020> I<00:03:34.050> can<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
use more weight there than I can on the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.480 
use more weight there than I can on the
medial<00:03:35.040> or<00:03:35.280> posterior<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.630> posterior<00:03:37.110> delt

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
medial or posterior the posterior delt

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.680 
medial or posterior the posterior delt
definitely<00:03:38.490> use<00:03:38.580> less<00:03:38.850> weight<00:03:39.120> if<00:03:39.300> you<00:03:39.420> feel

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
definitely use less weight if you feel

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.990 
definitely use less weight if you feel
like<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.440> need<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:41.400> takes<00:03:41.700> care<00:03:41.940> of

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
like you need to that takes care of

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.180 
like you need to that takes care of
those<00:03:42.270> three<00:03:42.690> parts<00:03:43.110> of<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.380> deltoid<00:03:43.739> muscle

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
those three parts of the deltoid muscle

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.490 
those three parts of the deltoid muscle
for<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.340> last<00:03:44.670> exercise<00:03:45.420> I'm<00:03:45.959> gonna<00:03:46.170> have<00:03:46.350> to

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
for the last exercise I'm gonna have to

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.199 
for the last exercise I'm gonna have to
reposition<00:03:46.890> here<00:03:47.520> because<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.760> have<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.030> lay

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
reposition here because I have to lay

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.010 
reposition here because I have to lay
down<00:03:48.239> on<00:03:48.600> my<00:03:48.720> side<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.860> show<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:51.480> exercise

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
down on my side to show you the exercise

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.840 
down on my side to show you the exercise
that's<00:03:52.290> going<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.530> help<00:03:52.680> work<00:03:52.950> those<00:03:53.280> external

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
that's going to help work those external

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.240 
that's going to help work those external
rotators<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.230> shoulder<00:03:55.709> which<00:03:56.010> would<00:03:56.160> be

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
rotators of the shoulder which would be

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.720 
rotators of the shoulder which would be
the<00:03:56.340> rotator<00:03:56.760> cuff<00:03:58.070> so<00:03:59.070> for<00:03:59.280> this<00:03:59.430> last

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
the rotator cuff so for this last

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.270 
the rotator cuff so for this last
exercise<00:04:00.170> we're<00:04:01.170> just<00:04:01.320> gonna<00:04:01.470> use<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.709> single

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
exercise we're just gonna use a single

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.490 
exercise we're just gonna use a single
dumbbell<00:04:02.600> we're<00:04:03.600> gonna<00:04:03.750> lay<00:04:03.959> down<00:04:03.989> on<00:04:04.410> our

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
dumbbell we're gonna lay down on our

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.590 
dumbbell we're gonna lay down on our
side<00:04:04.800> so<00:04:05.280> we<00:04:05.400> can<00:04:05.430> do<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:05.820> on<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> weight<00:04:06.330> bench

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
side so we can do this on a weight bench

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.630 
side so we can do this on a weight bench
of<00:04:07.080> course<00:04:07.320> I'm<00:04:07.500> doing<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.860> on<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:08.010> chiropractic

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
of course I'm doing it on a chiropractic

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.180 
of course I'm doing it on a chiropractic
exam<00:04:09.060> table<00:04:09.540> in<00:04:09.630> my<00:04:09.780> office<00:04:10.019> we've<00:04:10.860> got<00:04:11.070> our

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
exam table in my office we've got our

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.250 
exam table in my office we've got our
dumbbell<00:04:11.780> we've<00:04:12.780> got<00:04:12.989> our<00:04:13.230> arm<00:04:14.989> against<00:04:15.989> our

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
dumbbell we've got our arm against our

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.979 
dumbbell we've got our arm against our
body<00:04:16.470> it's<00:04:16.890> gonna<00:04:17.070> stay<00:04:17.400> there<00:04:17.750> all<00:04:18.750> the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
body it's gonna stay there all the

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.219 
body it's gonna stay there all the
motion<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.799> coming<00:04:20.669> from<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.570> elbow<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:21.989> the

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
motion is coming from the elbow to the

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.350 
motion is coming from the elbow to the
wrist<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:23.640> is<00:04:23.760> gonna<00:04:23.910> work<00:04:24.120> those

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
wrist but this is gonna work those

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.469 
wrist but this is gonna work those
external<00:04:24.930> rotators<00:04:25.680> of<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.919> shoulder<00:04:26.580> what's

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
external rotators of the shoulder what's

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.380 
external rotators of the shoulder what's
your<00:04:27.660> tie<00:04:27.870> in<00:04:28.050> with<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.260> rotator<00:04:28.800> cuff<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:30.210> so

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
your tie in with the rotator cuff and so

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.140 
your tie in with the rotator cuff and so
typically<00:04:30.780> I'm<00:04:31.020> gonna<00:04:31.200> do<00:04:31.850> eight<00:04:32.850> repetitions

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
typically I'm gonna do eight repetitions

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:41.330 
typically I'm gonna do eight repetitions
on<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:34.910> like<00:04:35.910> so<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.960> once<00:04:40.680> again<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:41.130> want

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
on that like so and once again you want

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.659 
on that like so and once again you want
to<00:04:41.430> use<00:04:41.550> a<00:04:41.580> rather<00:04:41.820> light<00:04:42.180> weight<00:04:42.419> for<00:04:42.690> that

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
to use a rather light weight for that

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.940 
to use a rather light weight for that
I'm<00:04:44.669> going<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.940> turn<00:04:45.120> around<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.919> do<00:04:46.919> the

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
I'm going to turn around and do the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.719 
I'm going to turn around and do the
other<00:04:47.220> side<00:04:47.550> as<00:04:47.820> well

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.230 

like<00:04:53.729> this<00:04:55.130> so<00:04:56.130> working<00:04:56.550> those<00:04:56.699> external

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
like this so working those external

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.090 
like this so working those external
rotators<00:04:58.310> nice<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.580> slow

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
rotators nice and slow

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.530 
rotators nice and slow
with<00:05:02.100> the<00:05:02.250> motion<00:05:02.699> there<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:05.790> that<00:05:05.820> a<00:05:06.330> lot

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
with the motion there and so that a lot

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.050 
with the motion there and so that a lot
of<00:05:06.660> times<00:05:06.900> this<00:05:07.560> exercise<00:05:08.190> a<00:05:08.550> lot<00:05:08.729> of<00:05:08.850> times

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
of times this exercise a lot of times
