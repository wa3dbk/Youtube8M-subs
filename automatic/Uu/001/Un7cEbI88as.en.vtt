the<00:00:43.350> Leslie<00:00:43.590> sounds<00:00:44.550> phenomenal<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
the Leslie sounds phenomenal and the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.200 
the Leslie sounds phenomenal and the
stereo<00:00:46.800> version<00:00:47.250> there's<00:00:47.460> also<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.820> separate

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
stereo version there's also a separate

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.940 
stereo version there's also a separate
Leslie<00:00:48.750> simulator<00:00:49.020> which<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.559> don't<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:49.770> is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
Leslie simulator which I don't think is

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.220 
Leslie simulator which I don't think is
out<00:00:50.129> yet<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> prototype<00:00:51.840> so

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
out yet this is a prototype so

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.049 
out yet this is a prototype so
work-in-progress<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
work-in-progress I think it's going to

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.140 
work-in-progress I think it's going to
be<00:00:54.180> released<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.660> several<00:00:54.870> models

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.900 

there<00:00:59.780> are<00:00:59.900> that<00:01:00.380> there's<00:01:00.650> a<00:01:00.710> pedal<00:01:01.040> board<00:01:01.190> on

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
there are that there's a pedal board on

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.430 
there are that there's a pedal board on
this<00:01:02.150> keyboard<00:01:02.600> for<00:01:02.690> those<00:01:02.840> guys<00:01:03.020> who<00:01:03.200> play

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
this keyboard for those guys who play

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.250 
this keyboard for those guys who play
pedals<00:01:03.890> I<00:01:04.070> don't<00:01:04.760> what<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:05.630> can<00:01:05.840> easily<00:01:05.990> do

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
pedals I don't what you can easily do

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.890 
pedals I don't what you can easily do
for<00:01:06.500> most<00:01:06.620> guys<00:01:06.920> is<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:07.820> transfer<00:01:08.330> on<00:01:08.630> one<00:01:08.810> of

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
for most guys is to transfer on one of

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.930 
for most guys is to transfer on one of
the<00:01:08.990> buttons<00:01:09.170> all<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:09.980> sounds<00:01:10.520> for<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.670> pedal

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
the buttons all the sounds for the pedal

board into the lower manual so I can
pump<00:01:13.340> face<00:01:13.970> right<00:01:14.360> here<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:28.580> percussion<00:01:28.940> can

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
pump face right here the percussion can

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.100 
pump face right here the percussion can
be<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.970> can<00:01:32.180> hear<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.479> differences<00:01:32.930> right

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
be you can hear the differences right

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.920 
be you can hear the differences right
here<00:01:35.140> this<00:01:36.140> is<00:01:36.350> soft<00:01:36.590> percussion<00:01:37.930> fast

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930

lower kit manual I hit the draw bar key

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.780 
lower kit manual I hit the draw bar key
so<00:02:33.300> back

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.440 

it's<00:02:39.790> very<00:02:40.000> usable<00:02:40.599> it's<00:02:41.200> it's<00:02:42.150> very<00:02:43.150> similar

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
it's very usable it's it's very similar

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.640 
it's very usable it's it's very similar
