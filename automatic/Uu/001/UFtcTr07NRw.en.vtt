advanced warfare in the very near future

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.100 
advanced warfare in the very near future
you<00:00:33.610> never<00:00:33.760> know<00:00:34.030> but<00:00:34.060> today's<00:00:34.540> gear<00:00:34.780> set<00:00:34.989> was

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
you never know but today's gear set was

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.479 
you never know but today's gear set was
actually<00:00:35.470> introduced<00:00:35.829> by<00:00:35.980> somebody<00:00:36.280> down<00:00:36.460> in

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
actually introduced by somebody down in

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:37.950 
actually introduced by somebody down in
the<00:00:36.640> comments<00:00:37.000> section<00:00:37.270> below<00:00:37.300> on<00:00:37.540> one<00:00:37.810> of<00:00:37.870> my

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
the comments section below on one of my

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.479 
the comments section below on one of my
previous<00:00:38.199> videos<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.859> he<00:00:39.190> thought<00:00:39.309> it'd<00:00:39.460> be

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
previous videos and he thought it'd be

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.010 
previous videos and he thought it'd be
really<00:00:39.579> cool<00:00:40.000> sledgehammer<00:00:40.480> introduced<00:00:40.899> a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
really cool sledgehammer introduced a

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.110 
really cool sledgehammer introduced a
gladiator<00:00:41.649> gear<00:00:41.949> set<00:00:42.190> now<00:00:42.550> I<00:00:42.579> sat<00:00:42.820> around<00:00:42.940> a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
gladiator gear set now I sat around a

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.549 
gladiator gear set now I sat around a
little<00:00:43.329> bit<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:43.600> thought<00:00:43.750> about<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:43.989> gladiator

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
little bit and thought about a gladiator

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:45.930 
little bit and thought about a gladiator
gear<00:00:44.769> set<00:00:45.010> what<00:00:45.219> it<00:00:45.309> would<00:00:45.399> look<00:00:45.519> like<00:00:45.579> some

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
gear set what it would look like some

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.310 
gear set what it would look like some
stuff<00:00:46.120> like<00:00:46.300> that<00:00:46.480> it's<00:00:47.019> actually<00:00:47.109> really

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
stuff like that it's actually really

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.990 
stuff like that it's actually really
possible<00:00:47.980> that<00:00:48.100> I<00:00:48.129> could<00:00:48.219> come<00:00:48.460> into<00:00:48.609> the<00:00:48.789> game

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
possible that I could come into the game

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.669 
possible that I could come into the game
now<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.570> reason<00:00:49.870> why<00:00:49.930> I<00:00:49.989> think<00:00:50.109> it's<00:00:50.289> possible

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
now the reason why I think it's possible

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.049 
now the reason why I think it's possible
is<00:00:50.800> because<00:00:51.039> all<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.340> gear<00:00:51.489> sets<00:00:51.699> we've<00:00:51.850> seen

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
is because all the gear sets we've seen

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.060 
is because all the gear sets we've seen
so<00:00:52.269> far<00:00:52.300> have<00:00:52.929> a<00:00:52.960> really<00:00:53.320> common<00:00:53.679> theme<00:00:53.890> and

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
so far have a really common theme and

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.500 
so far have a really common theme and
the<00:00:54.160> gladiator<00:00:54.579> gear<00:00:54.760> set<00:00:54.969> kind<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.239> fits<00:00:55.420> with

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
the gladiator gear set kind of fits with

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.389 
the gladiator gear set kind of fits with
that<00:00:55.719> if<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.440> guys<00:00:56.559> think<00:00:56.769> about<00:00:56.829> it<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.160> lot<00:00:57.370> of

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
that if you guys think about it a lot of

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.279 
that if you guys think about it a lot of
the<00:00:57.550> gear<00:00:57.699> sets<00:00:57.910> we<00:00:58.030> have<00:00:58.059> have<00:00:58.690> an<00:00:58.839> ancient
