druid from Union to band transistor is a
really<00:01:59.000> cool<00:01:59.150> overdrive<00:01:59.660> pedal<00:01:59.960> it's<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.170> very

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
really cool overdrive pedal it's a very

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
it's not like a mid you know sort of

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.130 
it's not like a mid you know sort of
boosted<00:02:07.460> overdrive<00:02:07.940> like<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.240> ts9<00:02:08.660> style<00:02:09.020> or

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140

anything<00:02:09.320> like<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.590> very<00:02:09.920> full<00:02:10.190> range

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
anything like that very full range

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.850 
anything like that very full range
sounding<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.120> me<00:02:11.320> basically<00:02:12.320> this<00:02:12.470> pedal<00:02:12.740> was

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
sounding to me basically this pedal was

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.340 
sounding to me basically this pedal was
born<00:02:13.190> out<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:14.000> desire<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.690> give<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.230> the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
born out of a desire to give you the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.830 
born out of a desire to give you the
sound<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:16.100> like<00:02:16.610> when<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:16.940> nail<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.570> front

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
sound of like when you nail the front

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.350 
sound of like when you nail the front
end<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.170> 12ax7<00:02:18.530> driven<00:02:19.280> guitar<00:02:19.640> amp<00:02:19.880> with<00:02:20.330> a

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
end of a 12ax7 driven guitar amp with a

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.330 
end of a 12ax7 driven guitar amp with a
clean<00:02:20.690> boost<00:02:20.959> pedal<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.620> then<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.070> know<00:02:22.190> how

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
clean boost pedal and then you know how

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.070 
clean boost pedal and then you know how
good<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:22.760> can<00:02:22.970> sound<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.300> can<00:02:23.420> drive<00:02:23.660> an<00:02:23.840> amp

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
good that can sound you can drive an amp

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.600 
good that can sound you can drive an amp
into<00:02:24.320> overdrive<00:02:24.560> with<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.040> lot<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.250> healthy

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
into overdrive with a lot of healthy

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.130 
into overdrive with a lot of healthy
clean<00:02:25.820> boost<00:02:26.090> out<00:02:26.300> of<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.480> clean<00:02:26.690> boost<00:02:26.959> pedal

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
clean boost out of a clean boost pedal

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.800 
clean boost out of a clean boost pedal
but<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.830> only<00:02:28.010> disadvantage<00:02:28.280> can<00:02:28.820> be<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.510> it

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
but the only disadvantage can be that it

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.690 
but the only disadvantage can be that it
can<00:02:30.230> create<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.560> huge<00:02:30.800> volume<00:02:31.040> jump<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.550> can

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
can create a huge volume jump that can

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.160 
can create a huge volume jump that can
be<00:02:31.820> what<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:31.970> want<00:02:32.270> in<00:02:32.420> some<00:02:32.570> situations<00:02:33.050> but

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
be what you want in some situations but

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.140 
be what you want in some situations but
maybe<00:02:33.410> not<00:02:33.650> in<00:02:33.890> other<00:02:34.040> situations<00:02:34.700> so

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
maybe not in other situations so

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.690 
maybe not in other situations so
basically<00:02:35.480> what<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.780> tone<00:02:35.989> druid<00:02:36.320> does<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.830> it

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
basically what the tone druid does is it

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.820 
basically what the tone druid does is it
it<00:02:37.970> recreates<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.840> tone<00:02:39.110> of<00:02:39.350> like<00:02:39.530> when<00:02:39.709> you

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
it recreates the tone of like when you

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.410 
it recreates the tone of like when you
nail<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.340> front<00:02:40.549> end<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.760> an<00:02:40.850> amp<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.180> clean

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
nail the front end of an amp of a clean

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.120 
nail the front end of an amp of a clean
boost<00:02:41.630> pedal<00:02:41.870> but<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.530> can<00:02:42.650> get<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:42.920> sound

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
boost pedal but you can get that sound

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.009 
boost pedal but you can get that sound
at<00:02:43.340> any<00:02:43.370> volume<00:02:43.610> level<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.360> say<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.690> want<00:02:44.780> your

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
at any volume level so say you want your

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.110 
at any volume level so say you want your
clean<00:02:45.260> sound<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.799> your<00:02:45.890> amp<00:02:46.070> just<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.670> be<00:02:47.030> at

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
clean sound of your amp just to be at

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.030 
clean sound of your amp just to be at
one<00:02:47.269> level<00:02:47.450> then<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.840> want<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.140> have<00:02:48.560> that

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
one level then you want to have that

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.590 
one level then you want to have that
great<00:02:49.280> overdrive<00:02:49.760> characteristic<00:02:50.360> but<00:02:50.510> you

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
great overdrive characteristic but you

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.780 
great overdrive characteristic but you
don't<00:02:50.720> want<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.900> huge<00:02:51.200> volume<00:02:51.440> jump<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:52.549> can<00:02:52.700> do

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
don't want a huge volume jump you can do

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.430 
don't want a huge volume jump you can do
that<00:02:52.940> with<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.239> toned<00:02:53.450> rig<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.989> can<00:02:54.110> also<00:02:54.230> get

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
that with the toned rig you can also get

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.870 
that with the toned rig you can also get
a<00:02:54.470> huge<00:02:54.650> volume<00:02:54.860> jump<00:02:55.160> with<00:02:55.310> if<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.580> want<00:02:55.760> by

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.539 
a huge volume jump with if you want by
just<00:02:56.030> cranking<00:02:56.480> up<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.600> volume<00:02:56.989> but<00:02:57.230> yeah<00:02:57.950> you

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
just cranking up the volume but yeah you

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.520 
just cranking up the volume but yeah you
get<00:02:58.700> my<00:02:58.850> drift<00:02:58.910> it's<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.780> really<00:03:00.049> cool<00:03:00.170> sounding

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
get my drift it's a really cool sounding

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.759 
get my drift it's a really cool sounding
overdrive<00:03:00.920> pedal<00:03:01.360> so<00:03:02.360> I<00:03:02.810> used<00:03:03.350> it<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.620> that

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
overdrive pedal so I used it in that

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.050 
overdrive pedal so I used it in that
track<00:03:04.040> at<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.220> beginning<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.640> video<00:03:04.850> through

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
track at the beginning the video through
