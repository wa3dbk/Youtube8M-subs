one<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.910> most<00:00:09.059> important<00:00:09.450> things<00:00:09.599> to

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
one of the most important things to

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.169 
one of the most important things to
remember<00:00:09.780> when<00:00:10.170> you're<00:00:10.590> chipping<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.969> read

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
remember when you're chipping is to read

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.430 
remember when you're chipping is to read
the<00:00:12.210> green<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.719> like<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:13.019> would<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.200> putt

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
the green just like you would a putt

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.379 
the green just like you would a putt
this<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.280> an<00:00:14.400> opportunity<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.969> get<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.179> close

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
this is an opportunity to get it close

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.960 
this is an opportunity to get it close
maybe<00:00:15.719> even<00:00:15.990> make<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.859> if<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.369> read<00:00:17.730> that

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
maybe even make it so if you read that

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.970 
maybe even make it so if you read that
and<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.359> know<00:00:18.570> what<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:18.900> doing<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.830> give

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
and you know what it's doing you give

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.410 
and you know what it's doing you give
yourself<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.340> best<00:00:20.369> chance<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:20.820> success<00:00:21.029> or

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
yourself the best chance for success or

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.150 
yourself the best chance for success or
to<00:00:21.480> get<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.689> close<00:00:21.869> well<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> think<00:00:22.830> anybody

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
to get it close well I think anybody

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.500 
to get it close well I think anybody
who's<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> good<00:00:23.580> chipper<00:00:23.939> will<00:00:24.180> tell<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> that

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
who's a good chipper will tell you that

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.150 
who's a good chipper will tell you that
they're<00:00:24.750> also<00:00:24.900> probably<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.560> fairly<00:00:25.859> good

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
they're also probably a fairly good

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.070 
they're also probably a fairly good
green<00:00:26.400> reader<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.910> when<00:00:27.330> somebody<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.869> good

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
green reader and when somebody a good

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.660 
green reader and when somebody a good
chipper<00:00:28.380> gets<00:00:28.529> into<00:00:28.890> an<00:00:29.070> environment<00:00:29.369> where

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
chipper gets into an environment where

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.830 
chipper gets into an environment where
they're<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.000> hit<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> short<00:00:30.420> game<00:00:30.570> shot

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
they're going to hit a short game shot

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.749 
they're going to hit a short game shot
they<00:00:31.410> usually<00:00:31.590> read<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> shot<00:00:32.340> from<00:00:32.520> both

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
they usually read the shot from both

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.000 
they usually read the shot from both
angles<00:00:33.000> from<00:00:33.300> behind<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.809> pin<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.739> front

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
angles from behind the pin and in front

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.709 
angles from behind the pin and in front
of<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> pin<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.910> then<00:00:36.000> they<00:00:36.180> pick<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> shot

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
of the pin and then they pick a shot

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.420 
of the pin and then they pick a shot
that<00:00:36.960> most<00:00:37.140> likely<00:00:37.290> will<00:00:37.530> land<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> front

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that most likely will land on the front

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.610 
that most likely will land on the front
of<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> green<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.120> roll<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> putt<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
of the green and roll like a putt to the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.170 
of the green and roll like a putt to the

the slopes the lay of the land again is

front of me and I need to get the ball
airborne<00:00:56.850> I'll<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> same<00:00:57.719> thing<00:00:57.989> when

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
airborne I'll do the same thing when

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.319 
airborne I'll do the same thing when
I've<00:00:58.829> got<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> little<00:00:59.190> bit<00:00:59.370> more<00:00:59.520> ground<00:01:00.239> to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
I've got a little bit more ground to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.240 
I've got a little bit more ground to
cover<00:01:00.390> I'm<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.440> maybe<00:01:01.710> chip<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.129> an

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
cover I'm going to maybe chip with an

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.889 
cover I'm going to maybe chip with an
8-iron<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> 7-iron<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> ball

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
8-iron with a 7-iron just get the ball

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.289 
8-iron with a 7-iron just get the ball
on<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> ground<00:01:04.379> rolling<00:01:04.650> again<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.820> I've<00:01:06.030> read

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
on the ground rolling again if I've read

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.700 
on the ground rolling again if I've read
it<00:01:06.420> properly<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.110> predict<00:01:07.439> what<00:01:07.500> it's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it properly I can predict what it's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.390 
it properly I can predict what it's
going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.100> who<00:01:08.430> knows<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.700> might<00:01:08.850> make<00:01:09.000> it

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
going to do who knows I might make it

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.950 
going to do who knows I might make it
the<00:01:11.400> lay<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.729> land<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:12.390> dictates<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the lay of the land really dictates the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960 
the lay of the land really dictates the
shot<00:01:13.260> i'm<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.799> hit<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.939> can

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
shot i'm going to hit here as you can

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.420 
shot i'm going to hit here as you can
see<00:01:15.119> I've<00:01:15.509> got<00:01:15.570> two<00:01:16.200> fairly<00:01:16.619> large<00:01:17.009> bunkers

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
see I've got two fairly large bunkers

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.310 
see I've got two fairly large bunkers
one<00:01:17.729> has<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> pretty<00:01:18.240> steep<00:01:18.450> face<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.900> don't<00:01:18.960> want

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
one has a pretty steep face I don't want

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380 
one has a pretty steep face I don't want
to<00:01:19.380> miss<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:19.799> luckily<00:01:20.729> I've<00:01:20.939> got<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.150> pretty

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
to miss there luckily I've got a pretty

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
to miss there luckily I've got a pretty
good<00:01:21.600> lie<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> upslope<00:01:22.770> that's<00:01:23.159> going

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
good lie I'm on the upslope that's going

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
good lie I'm on the upslope that's going
to<00:01:23.400> determine<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.299> shot<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.750> hit<00:01:25.020> you

to determine the shot that I hit you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.810 
to determine the shot that I hit you
