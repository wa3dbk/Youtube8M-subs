00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
that I've been thinking about for the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.849 
that I've been thinking about for the
past<00:00:14.549> year<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.150> year<00:00:15.509> ago<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.960> went<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.260> VidCon<00:00:16.500> in

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
past year a year ago I went to VidCon in

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.519 
past year a year ago I went to VidCon in
LA<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.430> at<00:00:18.150> nights<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.930> were<00:00:19.050> walking<00:00:19.289> around

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
LA and at nights we were walking around

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.529 
LA and at nights we were walking around
somewhere<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.460> stumbled<00:00:20.880> upon<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.330> little

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
somewhere we stumbled upon this little

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.320 
somewhere we stumbled upon this little
place<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.199> served<00:00:22.980> something<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.820> tasted

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
place that served something that tasted

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.620 
place that served something that tasted
like<00:00:24.680> pieces<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.710> cloud<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.090> could<00:00:27.539> ever

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
like pieces of cloud if you could ever

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.570 
like pieces of cloud if you could ever
eat<00:00:27.930> cloud<00:00:28.260> that's<00:00:28.500> what<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.800> tasted<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.160> so

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
eat cloud that's what it tasted like so

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.800 
eat cloud that's what it tasted like so
I've<00:00:29.670> been<00:00:29.760> thinking<00:00:30.000> about<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.330> experience

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
I've been thinking about that experience

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.500 
I've been thinking about that experience
for<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.410> year<00:00:31.800> now<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.250> I've<00:00:32.730> been<00:00:32.790> trying<00:00:33.360> to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
for a year now and I've been trying to

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.060 
for a year now and I've been trying to
find<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> place<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.530> New<00:00:34.680> York<00:00:34.860> City

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
find a place like that in New York City

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.709 
find a place like that in New York City
I<00:00:35.130> thought<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.489> was<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.760> Tony's<00:00:36.239> shaved<00:00:36.510> ice

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
I thought it was like Tony's shaved ice

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.360 
I thought it was like Tony's shaved ice
and<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> wasn't<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:37.680> Tom<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.070> he<00:00:38.100> shaved

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and it wasn't because Tom when he shaved

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.250 
and it wasn't because Tom when he shaved
ice<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.850> kind<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.239> coerced<00:00:39.719> there's<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.050> lot<00:00:40.140> of

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
ice is kind of coerced there's a lot of

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.290 
ice is kind of coerced there's a lot of
ice<00:00:40.440> element<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.399> guys<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.850> think<00:00:42.210> I

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
ice element to it but guys I think I

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.610 
ice element to it but guys I think I
found<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.870> we're<00:00:42.989> gonna<00:00:43.050> go<00:00:43.260> inside<00:00:43.410> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
found it so we're gonna go inside and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:59.080 
found it so we're gonna go inside and
see<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.100> really<00:00:44.309> what<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.610> had<00:00:44.820> before

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.490 

this<00:01:00.090> definitely<00:01:00.390> looks<00:01:00.540> like<00:01:00.930> what<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.200> got<00:01:01.350> in

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
this definitely looks like what I got in

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500 
this definitely looks like what I got in

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
scooping I could tell the texture it's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.300 
scooping I could tell the texture it's
definitely<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:13.020> anything<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.650> Taiwan

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
feet of powder and you took a bite of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.880 
feet of powder and you took a bite of
that<00:01:41.820> powder<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:43.200> course<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.680> some

blueberry and condensed milk that's what

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.010 
blueberry and condensed milk that's what
it<00:01:46.350> will<00:01:46.440> taste<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:47.660> this<00:01:48.660> is<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:48.990> much

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it will taste like this is so much

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.719 
it will taste like this is so much
better<00:01:49.290> than<00:01:49.470> typical<00:01:49.649> shaved<00:01:50.070> ice<00:01:50.220> look<00:01:50.610> at

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
better than typical shaved ice look at

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.340 
better than typical shaved ice look at
this<00:01:50.850> there's<00:01:51.090> no<00:01:51.210> ice<00:01:51.479> chunks<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:51.990> here

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
this there's no ice chunks in here

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.900 
this there's no ice chunks in here
you<00:01:52.500> will<00:01:52.619> never<00:01:52.740> crunch<00:01:53.190> down<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.640> anything

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
you will never crunch down on anything

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.530
