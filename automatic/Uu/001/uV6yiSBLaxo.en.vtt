00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.750
 Since he did not know much about the car, 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.389
 make aunt this new project that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.980
 has armed two months to start the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.660
 competition but has been fighting the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.400
 first places and has won two stages 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.400
 the pilot of qatar 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.609
 be born tells us that we will try 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.410
 keep the pressure on peterhansel 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.160
 meanwhile pilots before and is times 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.019
 winner in both cars and motorcycles 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.910
 is doing a calm career without 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.500
 make mistakes and see how they 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.500
 developed only for the first places 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.790
 in france with 67 pilots who can 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.800
 win in the coat but three are out 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.560
 and he meant just robby gordon 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.050
 who has started more than dacca who supported 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.000
 the first day was lost had 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.830
 inconvenience turned and now we see 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.140
 also Carlos Sainz who has had 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.540
 problems with the gps problems of 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.340
 fuel these are the two rivals 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.729
 net that with which petar commented 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.680
 stays that we are already saying without 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.440
 chance to get a victory in the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.860
 dakar the stage today had a 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.320
 link of 284 kilometers and 172 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.530
 kilometers of competition a route 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.270
 completely different from motorcycles is 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.570
 that hour when robby gordon arrived 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.250
 was towed and also partly tuned 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.530
 by the team of grove 4 therefore 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.680
 headed by moral vetoes they tried to 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.470
 repair everything they could and bad 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.720
 lucky we were at our own pace 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.690
 let's continue in the race and 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.759
 we'll see how we finish this middle stage 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.310
 hour later it was the turn of Carlos there 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.040
 who looked very exhausted and has lost 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.250
 2 hours 30 minutes at the stage of the day 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.250
 from yesterday 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.580
 it's always a long day this morning and 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:09.060
 complicated we know that he is young and that 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.940
 could have this kind of problems what 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.520
 Well , at the moment, it has only 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.080
 happened in a car not in both and 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.080
 good has touched me now 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.770
 final stage in solo but not maybe not 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.050
 technically demanding after the 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.020
 dunes and sand but the day would be a lot 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.570
 more rocky would have enough 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.820
 problems some pilots on the route that 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.690
 was developed today 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.050
 impressive also the view that we 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.290
 offers robby gordon television 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.480
 party in position 27 and started a 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.120
 race against the clock and finished 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.850
 third stage today 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.770
 impressive the rhythm that robby employed 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.770
 gordon in this fifth stage 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.430
 two heads also heading far back 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.959
 but he also took advantage of 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:15.730
 the terrain and they are very good special 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.730
 partial and finished fifth in the stage 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.620
 meanwhile chicherit was at a 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.870
 step to win the stage yesterday 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.180
 today he was also trying to make a 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.640
 good competition but ended up very 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.370
 auto when having problems with the address 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.359
 that caused him to lose more than 15 minutes 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.359
 the present day 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.000
 each 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.790
 I do not have power steering, I've done that 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.620
 more than 160 kilometers and has a 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.110
 problem in the mine that has enough 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.920
 pain pilots and chari let's see if it 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.750
 can recover for tomorrow 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.250
 meanwhile and danny pumps has a 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.190
 weight very well the competition will remember 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.209
 could have a quiet stage and without 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.760
 problems what has allowed 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.060
 get first with one hour 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.190
 49 minutes and 10 seconds in the 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.270
 general classification is in fifth 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.610
 place 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:17.100
 meanwhile seen and also doing 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.950
 a race for the conservative goal by 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.239
 moments accelerating where it allows 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.290
 sixth in the fourth stage in the 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.290
 general ranking 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.010
 after both at the national level and 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.350
 we said ferreiro position 33 was the 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.400
 position 40 Gonzalez added in the 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.410
 position 60 72 for the Ferrán family 73 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.780
 for the high route team also 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.490
 they arrived, they lost 8 and morals while 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.610
 so much with the world to the toyota de jean 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.880
 days is still trying to count time 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.590
 he lost a lot in the previous stages 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.620
 now lost relationship has been 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.480
 in the fourth position and keeps the 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.540
 third place 33 minutes from the pointer 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.090
 peterhansel 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.020
 meanwhile nasser al-attiyah that 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.510
 no route today was first 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.730
 he tried to stay but it turned out 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:20.480
 difficult the ground the day that commented 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:23.500
 that the card changed continuously and 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.610
 meanwhile peterhansel at your pace 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.710
 printing speed in certain 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.300
 sectors we those problems and consumed 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.450
 the second best time in the stage and 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.960
 continues to gain the burden of the race 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.110
 space 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.710
 says that the aunt makes a bit easier 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.300
 lines continued to see beautiful landscapes and 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.420
 that allowed him to have a relationship 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.190
 calm the stage as we said to him 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.410
 the cni roma second alternation the 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.850
 third Gordon at the national level the 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.470
 better team but today was 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.630
 the one of ramón ferreyros along with jose 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.610
 Maria Rodriguez and then said Webber with 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.280
 alonso the carriage detergent was 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.560
 winning the competition and making the 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.950
