00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.860
 many of you probably have 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.200
 have long asked if you are in minecraft 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.990
 not an automatic storage 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.000
 At any rate , building a system can do that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.360
 I think most on the whole 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.910
 do sort and so on 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.430
 I have an automatic 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.770
 built sorting machine and although you see 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.170
 here already that I have to do four here 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.059
 and here it is just what's up 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.120
 ton rhein should if we look in here 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.980
 Here I have ten teams each 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.160
 third of the respective things that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.150
 means 14 stones here are ten earth 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.450
 blocks in it 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:53.280
 here are ten paving stones inside and there 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.900
 Here are 10 of the wood panels in there and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.840
 we can have it here the possibility 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.460
 once up here in the water 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.940
 throw in and they will 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.439
 automatically sorted into the sound here 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.079
 that means I will be from each one now 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.940
 every two pieces into the water 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:14.580
 that means two stones two earth two 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:21.690
 paving stones and two wooden beams and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.650
 Now let's see 12 12 12 and 12 that 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.680
 means they are all right 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.700
 sorted if I have it again 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.040
 demonstrate that there is no fake 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.630
 or so, so I 'm not going to be one now 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.659
 I do not know how many I threw in now 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.880
 so now have a total of twelve pieces that 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.950
 means now 22 wood should be in here 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:46.290
 its ok still takes a bit 24 24 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.780
 I mean yes and that means sorting them 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.850
 get in here automatically 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.500
 this can be continued with 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.210
 Any number of tones I have that now 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.189
 First only with four made because of that 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.510
 first time was the easiest but that 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.540
 is on an infinite throne 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.970
 expandable and I guess that can 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.259
 a lot of work has diminished 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.560
 that makes it all a bit 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.929
 easier and it works too 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.299
 impeccably so good I will 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.510
 now just complete all here 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.510
 purely 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.260
 so now he starts to all of them 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:26.379
 So all animals are pure and how to do it 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.590
 It is said that it takes a lot 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.420
 working from the saved quite a bit of time 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.680
 so much time you usually have 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.530
 or why not bother 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.450
 has and yes if I have a tutorial of it 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.370
 should do if you wish that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.909
 then write me I like that 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.219
 do 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.930
 it is not really that complicated 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:47.049
 you just have to get the idea and yes 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.849
 but understand the right link 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.019
 otherwise I would say you see yourself 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.019
 in the next video ciao
