00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.590
 do you want to quickly raise statistics 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.369
 pump all thin get rare 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.169
 medals then click on the link in the description 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.599
 Hello dear friends we are with you 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.680
 joker and most recently in his stream 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.840
 tweet channel 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.119
 yes by the way if you didn't know from me 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.550
 stream channel subscribe link 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.540
 right in front of you let's go ahead the noise from 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.720
 these i will wait 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.160
 but on purpose we continue in general on 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.410
 your stream channel on twitch 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.239
 I promised the guys to show one 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.519
 interesting loophole through which 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.710
 You can get to the castle on the map erlenberg 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.510
 Of course there are several ways to 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.910
 there is the most banal fill it just 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.039
 take and shove a tank in there but it's not 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.800
 interesting you can also just bump into 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.750
 the castle and also get there it all 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.760
 trite and uninteresting I found 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.789
 interesting way so if you 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.710
 Interestingly we sit down more comfortable we stock up 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.630
 something delicious though not necessary 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.899
 crowned stocked issue will be small 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.660
 in general, let's go so we are on 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.270
 Erlenberg card version 087 but nothing 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.610
 terrible 0-3 and all subsequent versions 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.680
 this loophole works to 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.630
 get to the castle for us on the meat one 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.850
 easy fast tank I took for example 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.369
 Christmas tree on the Christmas tree is desirable to put yes 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.770
 spiders 105 and act on my gasoline in general 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.290
 optional and one heavy tank for 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.060
 example we took the e75 which stood between 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.790
 lock and step on which we will 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.290
 if you give and so everything is ready the pilot in 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.780
 cockpit run ripley 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.610
 so we fly along the fence which 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.380
 located near the castle turn on 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.380
 it is with us and now we will be on the springboard 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.930
 fly fly wedding 75 and here 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.180
 in such an easy way with virtually no 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.400
 losses fall into females 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.530
 I hope you liked that release he 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.510
 turned out very small but in my opinion 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.340
 interesting so guys subscribe 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.770
 do not miss the following videos on the channel 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.600
 We look how to send a replay not to get 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.490
 release it will turn out also the sorcerer 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.440
 either see the last issue get 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.240
 much buzz and pleasure well or 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.490
 just subscribe to the channel to 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.510
 nothing not miss anything well and 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.760
 don't like the likes 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.300
 but what about the joker? 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.300
 as intended
