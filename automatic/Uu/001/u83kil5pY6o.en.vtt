00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.759
 Well, one will see if the prophecy of Michi Wagener rose 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.290
 in snow flurries, the second half starts 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.109
 Rapid tries to storm right away 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.619
 Thaler was scarce 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.869
 The Linzer have conquered the ball 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.179
 continues to happen again from Brehna 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.279
 Peter Petrick from the coupe 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.859
 if you are sure you could also have a penalty whistle but he is running 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.179
 continue to stumble Reitemann CC in slow motion pressed by Gothic 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.660
 and forgives this option 12 seconds after 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.910
 yes, what should be there for Rapid outside 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.230
 approaching was Institute with 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.590
 Do not sell here in follow up 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.830
 Corner brings nothing 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.830
 As you approach Balis I would both be dangerous 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.290
 when finally sensational value 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.410
 Ivanov from Russia from Lecher comes into play 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 and on the Liberopost Bremer sends her sex appeal 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.080
 this should give the game new impulses 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.080
 perhaps also a certain nonchalance in the rapid-defense 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.060
 What follows is a thunderstorm 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.740
 on that 11th 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.070
 Referee Does not give up but does not give a yellow card 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.270
 rather, you can continue playing 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.430
 it'll be all right 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.430
 The teacher's purpose in the finish is pretty frustrating 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.670
 Matt Lehnert 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.090
 Kroos foul here 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.950
 vom Bach has the man-decker of René Wagner 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.390
 and now there is Green Power Pop has been around a few times and so is 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.420
 The decision of the referee Stephane Grichting the snowstorm 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.840
 becomes a poet 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.960
 we believe that there are more points 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.960
 Brands of Sybase Inc good flank 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.740
 Bat gets the ball Red in Kreuzberg 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.930
 there is one by Pablo Beetz 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.930
 that's the equalizer in the once sixth minute 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.930
 what situation looked like and again 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:10.379
 Respect does not get the ball way 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.709
 Umsteiger 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.909
 Pavlovics of art with more standing would have to type up 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.849
 time together 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.010
 take a deep breath with coach Bob Dudley 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.679
 and three tapped open 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:24.549
 in front of a top player 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.859
 a technical brilliance here 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.449
 he leads the ball skillfully 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.229
 from the own half 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.229
 Donkey to the forchecking 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:37.499
 in he managed the duels 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.499
 Check here 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:47.089
 not to hide further to reissman 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.639
 really required 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.709
 Foul Diem Meier 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.840
 Hunziker stronger handsome also einsteckt you can the Bremer eruption 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.399
 was 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.229
 to play in PID in the future 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.259
 maybe sit clock 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:04.189
 TuS Eving again 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.389
 with some difficulty in the raffle 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.039
 which brings nothing but they still show this good free kick by Kocin 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.749
 once 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:13.670
 on 17 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.189
 slippery ground 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.719
 but like z Diaz this situation then draw members Stöger 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:25.839
 closer to that 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.519
 no question 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.519
 the yellow card 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:39.270
 and Leonie Maier can be public then there is a threefold relation 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.489
 if the covenant does not call fate Aline game city Peter Mio 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.639
 and a double change for the PID 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.809
 thought arm stump flower city of her from the deep blue 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.909
 MOS in the 73 minutes 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.869
 just under a quarter of an hour 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:58.830
 Do you still have the rapid team and there you still have to win? 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.199
 but the servants 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.199
 from the midfield always played well forward blog-g 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.949
 Fighting Penta plays here contradicting alone 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.249
 sixth possible until yesterday 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:13.649
 and forgives again 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:15.349
 drapes wrapped there 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.680
 up to more concentration at the 21-year-old refuses 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.680
 and his crew I'll go south again 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.539
 now followed acknowledge 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.840
 Constantin 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.840
 Jorgensen said they had modernization 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:44.240
 Closer to keep its forces in the pc version of Brink 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.090
 because also be 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.449
 a Libra with Inka Grings 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.009
 is still there 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.499
 and the 3 0 2 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.759
 by 79 7 million 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.800
 the 16 of the championship 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.180
 Goal of Rene Wagner 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.180
 you can see at the boxes 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:06.229
 the one with the heel from the window 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.759
 the winemakers moved off too late 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.759
 and in the second attempt the benefactor conquer Rapids 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:13.779
 Bubble Beatz 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.860
 two goal in this game a preliminary decision 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.580
 clearly 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.819
 the most die-hard rapids in the depot 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:21.870
 do not wait anymore 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.449
 that is still a lot 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:24.589
 a leader 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:27.279
 the third goal for Rapid 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.240
 to wait for René 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.740
 the relief is going to turn out with Einstein Christoph 4 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.159
 but the Lindsay will not give up 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.249
 because really well played courageously fought 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:43.969
 and now they are running naturally 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.969
 had found in shape 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.849
 completely alone against Bardowick again 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.039
 and now took his chance the first time 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.819
 that's the decision in this game in the 89th minute 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:58.770
 the subscription rights for Rapid 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.879
 that is what she means in the championship only in this session 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.369
 by René Wagner 

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:06.369
 Goal in this game 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.059
 not the better team 

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:11.439
 she was the happier one 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.439
 she was the team fought and necessarily 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.580
 But all in all, you have to say 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.580
 In this game, the winemakers can be sorry 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.650
 come on 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.880
 Prizes at the Game of the Day yet at Mike She Blade Satires hopefully 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.000
 the right death certificate we also come to them but will see it and 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.310
 Of course, now we come to interviews from the hanappi stadium 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.680
 Norbert Peter Schöttel is the first one planning he has his three hundredths 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.520
 is 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.250
 Bundesliga match probably a little bit different in ten bit 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.759
 presented more easily 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:57.639
 50 citizens had played pretty bad 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:58.899
 finally stops 

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:01.619
 Red Dead Redemption can do it 

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:05.489
 our biggest chances are forgiven and we citizens would be the Libra 

00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:06.599
 become 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:10.539
 so it is supposed to be built although it does not get over four hours over functions 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:13.040
 take care and have at least one of its sources 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.680
 if nothing if the chance pulls my poems us 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.539
 if so, four chances has to score four goals and that makes one 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:21.379
 Guest team from the plaintiff, the game was very close 

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:24.419
 and if you are a bit unsure how it is in it 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:25.789
 the CB 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:28.389
 and so happened moment Dorothy Parker 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:30.770
 but for their dates years more 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.759
 Zenica he undermines there get goals and that's even ready 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:38.249
 is in a game Robert Doisneau wants to be a Venneker 

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.279
 This uncertainty about the economy increased 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.080
 there will be times that there are allegations 

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:48.629
 now it is just that that is going back
