00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.480
 metz city authentic city with character 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.059
 historical or graoully reigned supreme 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.340
 until the day Métis landed 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.620
 inaugurated with great pomp in early October 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.450
 this futuristic-looking bus is the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.180
 result of a unique marriage between the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.439
 modernity and heritage 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.900
 two years of work for a project 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.730
 ambitious a pride for mayor but 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.320
 not without concessions had to pass 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.090
 by the street of the guard it is necessary the hall 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.130
 and expand it had to go through the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.579
 street judge michel had to move the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.620
 temple wall of the garden wall 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.390
 boufflers it was necessary to shake the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.280
 courthouse portal where that 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.590
 it was very complicated but we decided 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.180
 to close it in me otherwise well the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.050
 Métis could not pass in the city center 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.390
 Republic Square 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.590
 it had to happen and prevent 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.770
 cars to take this path for the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.449
 leave it to nonsense 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.850
 the half-breed may be the solution 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.469
 to reveal this city of metz we 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.809
 like or do not like the fortress 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.590
 from the east did indeed turn a page 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.930
 of its history 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.059
 among the messins the opinions are divided 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.870
 it brings cheerfulness it highlights 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.900
 a little heritage 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.310
 so I find it rather positive 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.590
 I did not recognize many places 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.659
 with the works that had everywhere so 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.040
 I tell myself that it will serve them well 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.869
 the world I wish it in any case me 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.010
 I recognize more too put it's true 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.210
 it 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:24.330
 very big transformation good it makes 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.460
 of change but in our day it is 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.710
 too disproportionate samana revival to the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.350
 city ​​in terms of visuals and I find 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.580
 that it is very very good 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.600
 the development of the middle deck even though 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.270
 if indeed if we are sure of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.530
 history goes well with 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.940
 the advancement of the city we go to the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.010
 future also I think with this kind 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:52.080
 and it's about that coherent 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:53.670
 and very well small on serpentines and 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.300
 street artists in the simplest 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.830
 apparatus 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.210
 it was the party for the start all 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.340
 was planned or almost 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.860
 the bill of the project inflated it passes 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.100
 from 143 to 240 million euros 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.500
 in question the protected heritage he has 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.480
 yet been redeveloped for the half-breed a 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.240
 green light that stuns some inhabitants 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.640
 me what exasperates me is that for 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.040
 to be able to do any work would it be 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.390
 that properly laid out the city by 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.620
 relation to the movement of persons 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.400
 disabled or people 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.860
 aging 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.830
 it's a disaster because the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.310
 France buildings let us not do 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.900
 and betis 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.540
 it's weird the way we could 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.250
 move the middle bridge precisely located 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.150
 between the cathedral and saulcy island 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.420
 makes waves 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.239
 the little that has been touched is the way 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.900
 bridge where the arcades were resumed at 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.060
 identically 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.910
 they were disassembled move and 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.790
 then glued to the enlargement of the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.280
 michel judge street bridge the same wall 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.620
 was dismounted stone by stone and he has 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.890
 been reassembled stone to stone of identical 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.319
 so we absolutely did not touch the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.840
 heritage and heritage are found 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.400
 much more beautiful heritage has 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.440
 enriched with the pompidou center 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.750
 today it is the half-breed who propels 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.250
 Mass in the 21st century and tomorrow 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.250
 will come the convention center
