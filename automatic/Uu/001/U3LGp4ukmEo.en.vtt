00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
the film about this time I thought that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.729 
the film about this time I thought that
he<00:00:36.540> should<00:00:36.780> think<00:00:36.960> twice<00:00:37.140> about<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.620> but

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
he should think twice about it but

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.110 
he should think twice about it but
they'll<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.190> go<00:00:38.700> ahead<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.090> describe<00:00:40.520> yep<00:00:41.550> Joe

concept for capturing the satellite
worked<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.530> fact<00:00:49.649> worked<00:00:49.890> perfectly<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
worked and in fact worked perfectly and

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.389 
worked and in fact worked perfectly and
I<00:00:51.809> essentially<00:00:52.500> had<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.860> lot<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.010> fun<00:00:53.219> on

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
I essentially had just a lot of fun on

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.549 
I essentially had just a lot of fun on
flight<00:00:53.610> day<00:00:53.640> 7<00:00:54.149> no<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.360> flight<00:00:54.570> day<00:00:54.600> 7<00:00:55.110> no<00:00:55.230> work

flight day 7 no on flight day 7 no work
there<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.949> took<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.489> big<00:00:56.969> load<00:00:57.120> off<00:00:57.149> my<00:00:57.329> mind

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
there was took a big load off my mind

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.630 
there was took a big load off my mind
because<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.859> flew<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.430> bit

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
because I flew out a little bit

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
because I flew out a little bit
differently<00:00:59.969> than<00:01:00.210> Joe<00:01:00.690> had<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.410> might

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
differently than Joe had you might

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.920 
differently than Joe had you might
remember<00:01:01.739> Joe<00:01:02.129> commenting<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> Sun<00:01:03.210> had

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
remember Joe commenting that the Sun had

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.630 
remember Joe commenting that the Sun had
bothered<00:01:04.140> him<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.860> his<00:01:05.010> eyes<00:01:05.159> during

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
bothered him it was in his eyes during

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.240 
bothered him it was in his eyes during
the<00:01:05.760> last<00:01:05.939> phase<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.710> you'll<00:01:07.710> see<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.189> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the last phase and you'll see here in a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.920 
the last phase and you'll see here in a
minute<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.700> when<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> Sun<00:01:09.479> finally<00:01:09.720> does

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
minute that when the Sun finally does

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.660 
minute that when the Sun finally does
come<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.619> fortunate<00:01:10.890> enough<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.250> use

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
come up I was fortunate enough to use

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.750 
come up I was fortunate enough to use
the<00:01:11.850> orbiters<00:01:12.299> nose<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.950> shadow<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.520> Sun

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the orbiters nose to to shadow the Sun

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.060 
the orbiters nose to to shadow the Sun
so<00:01:15.000> my<00:01:15.240> approach<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.869> satellite<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.770> you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so my approach to the satellite and you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.890 
so my approach to the satellite and you
can<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> shadow<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> nose<00:01:18.509> of

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
can see that the shadow of the nose of

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.420 
can see that the shadow of the nose of
the<00:01:18.990> orbiter<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> satellite<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the orbiter now is on the satellite and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.270 
the orbiter now is on the satellite and
on<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.090> me<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.619> my<00:01:22.740> docking<00:01:23.159> was

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
on and on me and then so my docking was

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
on and on me and then so my docking was
was<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.090> bit<00:01:24.299> easier<00:01:24.600> with<00:01:24.869> that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
was a little bit easier with that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.960 
was a little bit easier with that
information<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.560> Joe<00:01:26.159> had<00:01:26.340> given<00:01:26.640> me<00:01:26.759> from

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
information that Joe had given me from

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.100 
information that Joe had given me from
the<00:01:27.450> earlier<00:01:27.750> EBA<00:01:28.310> mmm<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:30.110> performed

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the earlier EBA mmm use performed

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.819 
the earlier EBA mmm use performed
flawlessly<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.400> heard<00:01:32.579> us<00:01:32.700> talk<00:01:33.180> about

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
flawlessly as as you heard us talk about

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.249 
flawlessly as as you heard us talk about
from<00:01:34.829> space<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.479> method<00:01:37.200> of

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
from space and this this method of

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.380 
from space and this this method of
capturing<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.860> satellite<00:01:38.280> certainly<00:01:39.180> worked

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
capturing the satellite certainly worked

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.039 
capturing the satellite certainly worked
well<00:01:39.659> when<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:41.299> you<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.420> see<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> arm<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
well when the you can see the arm in the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.389 
well when the you can see the arm in the
lower<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.439> corner<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.890> picture<00:01:44.040> which

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
lower right corner of the picture which

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.069 
lower right corner of the picture which
was<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> position<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.149> Anna<00:01:45.450> had<00:01:45.540> put<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.960> in

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
was a position that Anna had put it in

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.580 
was a position that Anna had put it in
to<00:01:46.320> assist<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.920> our<00:01:47.009> station<00:01:47.280> keeping<00:01:47.729> task

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
to assist in our station keeping task

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.749 
to assist in our station keeping task
notice<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> people<00:01:50.070> who<00:01:50.310> brought<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
notice that the people who brought that

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.120 
notice that the people who brought that
satellite<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.270> us<00:01:51.600> left<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.619> absolutely

enough the satellite originally was

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.060 
enough the satellite originally was
rotating<00:02:03.000> 50<00:02:03.540> revolutions<00:02:04.229> per<00:02:04.290> minute<00:02:04.469> but

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
rotating 50 revolutions per minute but

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.679 
rotating 50 revolutions per minute but

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
was slowed down by ground controllers

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.350 
was slowed down by ground controllers
very<00:02:07.049> painstakingly<00:02:07.829> over<00:02:08.099> many<00:02:08.910> many<00:02:09.090> weeks

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360

very painstakingly over many many weeks
time<00:02:09.979> position<00:02:10.979> then<00:02:11.160> slowed

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
time position then slowed

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.850 
time position then slowed
down<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.330> slowing<00:02:12.810> they<00:02:13.319> left<00:02:13.620> it

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
down and in the slowing they left it

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.460 
down and in the slowing they left it
still<00:02:14.610> turning<00:02:14.970> at<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> very<00:02:15.750> very<00:02:16.110> regular

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
still turning at a very very regular

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.180 
still turning at a very very regular
rate<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.510> made<00:02:18.660> our<00:02:18.810> job<00:02:19.080> absolutely<00:02:19.650> easy

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
rate so it made our job absolutely easy

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.390 
rate so it made our job absolutely easy
as<00:02:20.370> part<00:02:23.450> once<00:02:24.450> docked<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.590> procedure<00:02:26.040> then

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
as part once docked the procedure then

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400 
as part once docked the procedure then
was<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.940> use<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.420> menu<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.989> stop<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
was to use the a menu to stop the

was to use the a menu to stop the
rotation<00:02:28.530> which<00:02:29.430> was<00:02:30.330> equally<00:02:30.750> easy<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:32.580> can

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
rotation which was equally easy you can

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.900 
rotation which was equally easy you can
see<00:02:32.910> it's<00:02:33.090> now<00:02:33.390> quite<00:02:34.020> stable<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:35.550> MMU

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
see it's now quite stable and the MMU

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.729 
see it's now quite stable and the MMU
pilot<00:02:36.390> could<00:02:36.569> then<00:02:36.720> maneuver<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.290> satellite

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
pilot could then maneuver the satellite

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.150 
pilot could then maneuver the satellite
turn<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.660> wherever<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:39.840> wanted<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.800> such<00:02:41.130> a

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
turn it wherever we wanted it in such a

turn it wherever we wanted it in such a
way<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.459> anna<00:02:41.849> could<00:02:42.209> could<00:02:42.720> grab<00:02:43.319> the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
grapple fixture this is a sequence from

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.180 
grapple fixture this is a sequence from
the<00:02:46.769> first<00:02:47.250> rendezvous<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:49.709> worked<00:02:50.040> just

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
the first rendezvous and it worked just

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.130 
the first rendezvous and it worked just
like<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.519> in<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.760> simulator<00:02:50.940> getting<00:02:51.510> Joe

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
like it in the simulator getting Joe

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.229 
like it in the simulator getting Joe
commands<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:53.040> maneuver<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.850> such<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.060> I

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
commands to maneuver it such that I

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.990 
commands to maneuver it such that I
could<00:02:54.510> see<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.110> end<00:02:55.200> effector<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.549> grapple

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
could see the end effector the grapple

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000 
could see the end effector the grapple
target<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.840> went<00:02:58.049> very<00:02:58.530> well<00:02:58.650> very

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
target and it went very well very

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.340 
target and it went very well very
smoothly
