00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.110
 JAMES GRIME: Today I want to tell you 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.980
 that almost all integers contain the number 3. 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.990
 This therefore concerns whole numbers. 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.990
 I claim that almost all integers 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.240
 contain the number 3. 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.960
 That sounds strange doesn't it? 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.430
 Well, I can think of a lot of numbers 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.750
 containing a 3. 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.850
 For example 3, 33, 333, 3,333, and so on. 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.960
 I can also think of endless numbers 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.579
 that do not contain the number 3. 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.640
 7, 77, 777, and 7,777, and so on. 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.700
 How can it be that almost all units contain the number 3? 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.080
 23 contains the number 3. 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.730
 310 contains the number 3. 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.770
 9,002,023. 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.760
 First, let's look at the numbers smaller than 10. 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.120
 How many numbers smaller than 10 contain the number 3? 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.959
 That's only 3, isn't it? 

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:05.890
 Yes, that's just one. 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.500
 All right. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.940
 So from those numbers only the number 3 itself. 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.780
 What is the ratio then? 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.360
 Well, that's one in ten. 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.820
 Either 1/10. 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.350
 That is 0.1. 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.510
 Or 10%. 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.390
 What's the next step? 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.920
 Let's look at the numbers smaller than 100. 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.730
 We have 3. 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:31.310
 We have 13, 23, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93. 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.290
 You may have noticed that I skipped the thirties. 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.730
 So we also have 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 ... 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.151
 So we have 19 in total. 

00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:42.434
 19 out of 100, that is 0.19. 

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:45.170
 It is 19% what I say. 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.150
 The percentage has therefore increased. 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.940
 Let's look at the numbers smaller than 1000. 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.970
 Of course we have the 19 numbers we just had, don't we? 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.330
 But we have all those numbers again, 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.680
 but with a 1 in front. 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.320
 For example 103 and 113 and after that we get 200-as much. 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.440
 We also have 400-as many, and 500, 600, 700, 800, 900. 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.090
 And we can include all numbers in the 300 series, 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.820
 I just skipped it. 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.160
 All numbers from 300, 301, 302, 303, right? 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.050
 The total number of numbers is 271. 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.490
 What is the percentage here? 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.226
 It is approximately 0.271 ... 

00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:19.170
 27%. 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.660
 It gets even bigger. 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.990
 Have you seen which system we have applied 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.740
 for the latter? 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.260
 I suggested thinking a 1 for all previous numbers. 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.800
 We did the same for the 2 in front, 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.790
 and then the numbers from the 300 series. 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.040
 We can generalize this. 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.870
 The numbers that contain the number 3 ... Let's call them T. 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.000
 Let's call these 10. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.120
 Less than 10 to the power n. 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.420
 So these are the numbers that contain the number 3 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.070
 and are less than 10 to the power n. 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.580
 If you want to find the following ... 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.990
 That will be 10,000. 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.680
 Then you take the previous number of numbers, multiply 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.090
 that with 9, and you add 10 to the power n. 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.350
 And so you can find the next number. 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.050
 You can do that. 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.450
 And then you will find the next one that we are looking for. 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.665
 So we have a small formula here. 

00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:10.540
 Let's do it. 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.300
 Okay, I'm going to use my calculator. 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.700
 So 9 times 271, plus 1,000. 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.210
 And then I get 3,439. 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.750
 What is the ratio? 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.320
 That is approximately 0.3439. 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.800
 It keeps going up ... Around 34% already. 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.300
 It's getting bigger. 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.190
 And there is a very elegant way to calculate how many numbers 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.270
 contain the number 3. 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.000
 Imagine if I could write my numbers like this, 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.290
 with zeros. 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.630
 So this would be zero, but with all these zeros here. 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.120
 This is a four-digit number. 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.900
 Here you have another, and here another. 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.976
 How many different four-digit numbers are there? 

00:03:57.976 --> 00:03:59.860
 That is exactly 10 to the power 4. 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.000
 10 choices here, 10 choices here, 10 choices, 10 choices. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.610
 How many of these do not contain 3? 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.960
 If I am not allowed to use the number 3, then I have 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.060
 9 choices for this position, 9 choices for this position, 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.870
 9 choices for this position, 9 choices for this position. 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.959
 So that would be 9 to the power of 4. 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.670
 If you want to find out how many integers 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:33.935
 contain the number 3, it is 10 to the power n minus 9 to the power n. 

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:38.840
 You see, those are all my n-digit numbers minus the numbers 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.140
 that do not contain 3. 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.760
 The ratio is then this thing divided by 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.950
 this thing... 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.900
 Just 10 to the power n. 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.150
 That is this. 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.650
 And how large is that ratio? 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.930
 10 to the power n divided by 10 to the power n is 1, 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.050
 minus 9 to the power n divided by 10 to the power n. 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.570
 We can also write that ... 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.350
 9/10 to power n. 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.480
 That is the ratio of numbers that contain 3 to the total. 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.930
 And what happens? 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.550
 If this becomes very large, then it will break 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.830
 ever smaller and smaller. 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.780
 And it will go towards 1. 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.230
 This part will disappear. 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.440
 We don't even have to talk about it anymore. 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.840
 And that is 1. 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.830
 So it tends to 1 ... 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.500
 We say, when n grows up. 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.940
 So then this gets closer and closer to 1 min 0. 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.710
 If this gets closer to 0, if n gets bigger, 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.100
 this comes closer and closer to 1 min 0. 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.400
 So this whole thing is moving towards 100%. 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.700
 100% of all integers contains the number 3. 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.680
 And this is the official, technical definition of 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.690
 when I said that almost all numbers contain the number 3. 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.610
 "Almost all" sounds like a vague expression, 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.450
 but in mathematics it has precise meaning. 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.300
 It means that the ratio goes towards 100%, 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.565
 if you look at more and more numbers. 

00:06:13.565 --> 00:06:16.700
 BRADY HARAN: Is it just as true to say 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.345
 that almost all numbers contain the number 5? 

00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:20.710
 JAMES GRIME: That is just as true. 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.870
 And you can follow exactly the same reasoning to prove 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.120
 that almost all numbers contain the number 5. 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.000
 Then why did James choose 3 in this video? ... 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.800
 Then why did James choose 3 in this video? He thinks it just sounds better!
