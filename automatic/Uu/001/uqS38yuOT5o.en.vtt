00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:16.570
 Welcome to del carmen artesanal mi 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.240
 name is iris and today we are going to make a 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.520
 heart-shaped pompom here I am 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.939
 showing how we are going to do to 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.020
 make a heart as symmetrical 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.239
 possible 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.730
 I am using elements that in 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.160
 house we can have as the enamel a 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.129
 shadow can be a cap and so is 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.629
 how are we going to mark it and this once 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.629
 marked we are going to cut it 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.350
 no no 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.510
 to cut out the central circle them 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.760
 I recommend doing a hole in the 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:13.480
 half of it and after starting to 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.480
 cut it out seems to me the easiest way 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.740
 when we already have it trimmed what 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:29.310
 we are going to do is move this same 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.310
 figure to make one exactly the same 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.370
 once we have both 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.290
 little hearts in cardboard that is not 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.960
 It needs to be very thick when 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.540
 otherwise it is better if it is finite because 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.150
 we're going to present it double to do the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.490
 pompom the pompom is made of the form 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.040
 traditional in my case I will use 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.020
 two shades of pink 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.180
 here we will make a mariposita for 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.340
 make it much easier to introduce 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.100
 in the small hole that is quite small 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.660
 the canceled but very thick butterfly 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.100
 I tell them the little hole is so small 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.100
 that they will have to repeat 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.740
 remember that the tone of the beginning is 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.190
 the one that is going to be in the center of 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.190
 heart 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.610
 once I have my heart covered 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.640
 what I'm going to do is incorporate the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.610
 second color it is not necessary to tie it 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.980
 as you will see, I am not entering any 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.200
 no tip this after it is cut like this 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.659
 do not worry if it looks like it's 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.049
 messy and let's cover with this 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:54.090
 color all the outline of the pom pom as 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.209
 are looking at the picture I'm missing a 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.040
 bit that is already the hole is 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.189
 the hill so much I will use a needle 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.680
 of crochet to help me pass the wool 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:07.760
 that in this case I already put it double for 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.760
 to make it faster 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.659
 now we finish the pompom the second 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.580
 color in my case 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.799
 they can do it in a single color what 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.599
 let's do is cut the scissors 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.360
 have to go through the middle of the two 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.959
 cardboard and we have to cut everything 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.959
 the perimeter 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.840
 once we have it all trimmed 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.710
 with a thread that I suggest that it be from 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:03.330
 same tone let's make two nudity that 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.330
 is going to be what will sustain the comfort 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.920
 when it is already knotted we will get 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.230
 something half amorphous but you have to go 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.210
 shaping it with the scissors let's go 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.300
 trimming those little balls that are left 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.690
 uneven to the desired shape 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.940
 and it has been easy to make a pompom 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.700
 heart shape cited seems ideal to me 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.100
 for these valentine dates what 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.490
 can apply in a kid in a 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.560
 mobile and I do not know about you suggest me more 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.050
 ideas and later possibly 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.570
 let's do a tutorial to me I love how 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.880

 show them a beautiful navy job 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.720
 that she always does the jobs that 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.380
