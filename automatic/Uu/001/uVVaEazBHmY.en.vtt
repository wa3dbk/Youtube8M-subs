my<00:02:06.010> one<00:02:06.040> bad<00:02:06.430> one<00:02:07.440> we'll<00:02:08.440> see

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.720 

well<00:02:29.280> there<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.400> go<00:02:31.920> 75<00:02:32.920> rounds<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.460> butler

creek<00:02:34.560> one<00:02:35.560> little<00:02:35.800> failure<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.280> extract<00:02:36.760> and

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
creek one little failure to extract and

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.450 
creek one little failure to extract and
i<00:02:37.000> don't<00:02:37.150> think<00:02:37.300> that<00:02:37.360> was<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.600> mag's<00:02:37.930> fault

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
i don't think that was the mag's fault

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.890 
i don't think that was the mag's fault
so<00:02:39.460> these<00:02:39.700> old<00:02:39.970> ones<00:02:40.120> they<00:02:40.330> just<00:02:40.570> go<00:02:40.690> like<00:02:40.870> a
