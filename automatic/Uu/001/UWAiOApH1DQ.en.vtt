turn it on make a quick video and I

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.380 
turn it on make a quick video and I
don't<00:01:16.680> need<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.070> worry<00:01:17.280> about<00:01:17.370> and<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.180> gets

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
don't need to worry about and if it gets

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.070
