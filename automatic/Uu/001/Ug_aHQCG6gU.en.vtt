00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.330
 bending shoulders foot ground 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.780
 we hold the rein outside 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.850
 to bend at 45 degrees from the neck and 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.980
 we hold the inside leg to 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.199
 keep them from turning and make the horse 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.550
 walk in circles starting the arm 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.550
 with crossing of hands 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.000
 this week we are going to work what is 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.000
 the shoulder flex 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.470
 working the trot we will have the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.950
 long sale from outside for that led 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.980
 he moved his head a little 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.690
 but inside we let ourselves turn around to 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.970
 that continue to explode but with the camera 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.300
 when he left to force anything that 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.300
 see like this 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.700
 well also at this time 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.090
 that is giving a circle with the head 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.100
 outward and the most important thing is that 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.100
 I had already pressed it to achieve them 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.990
 to change the look and give it a 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.990
 medium 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.380
 and we do exactly the same thing to the side 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.270
 opposite we indicate that of trote since 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.010
 is working in trot 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.120
 we put out his head and this one we force a 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.120
 little for what grace 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.930
 remember that with life outside 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.970
 we put the head out and with 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.640
 the example rule and this what we're going 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.700
 to do is to prevent it from being turned around 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.790
 complete and this 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.200
 to bring a little bit of us that is 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.810
 giving the circles a little more 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.800
 stuck on us so he took her to 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.800
 this starts to wave 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.950
 and well last week we were 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.950
 working this what they are is of the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.230
 circles and the one above 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.490
 and good here is the result of 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.490
 five day work 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.560
 good as you see, this 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.830
 and start grabbing the trot it 's okay 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.489
 well-off who still lacks a little 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.680
 but as it is more stable and is 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.569
 pretty good and you have to demand little 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.930
 every day so that the 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.880
 weather 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.430
 each time and this carry a continuity 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.549
 and avoid this that the horse comes back 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.280
 this league does not appeal to schools 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.230
 because then the schools are many 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.359
 Many people asked me when is it 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.870
 the exact moment we put the schools 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:04.900
 the exact moment is when the 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.969
 This horse understands the indication without 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.609
 schools when they arrive he understands the 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:12.430
 exercise this we can already put 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.290
 schools if they set last week 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.489
 I started without schools because the mare 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.590
 he knew nothing about schools and he did not know 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.400
 nothing to make circles from above 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.410
 then this one since he got it understood 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.300
 in the speech of about two or three days 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.000
 I called the schools because I already 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.680
 he paid attention to the legs as to 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.200
 case the legs not with schools 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.080
 to demand a little more speed 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.070
 now you can use this the schools 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.060
 from the beginning this can have no 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.150
 you can use them 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.070
 what it can be is to deliver the sunsets 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.570
 but at the beginning of each exercise that 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.620
 we are given first arrangement with fire 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:05:00.340
 leg without touching it with schools and 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.160
 that respects your legs now if you already 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.140
 can this one 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.410
 use the schools nor very soft 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.790
 because it is not necessary 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.790
 the school very strong 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.009
 good as good is pretty fluid to 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.520
 both sides are not going to happen to 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.520
 next exercise 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.920
 flexed man disassembled 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.580
 We hold the outside rein for 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.430
 bend at 45 degrees to the neck we hold 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.230
 the rein inside to keep it from turning and 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.810
 make the horse family in circles 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.580
 our inner leg is separated 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.730
 of the horse to free him from 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.410
 space and the horse is closing and 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.570
 with the outside leg but we have the 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:56.150
 horse to tell him to close 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.150
 initial generation with crossing of hands 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.750
 well what are we going to do this section 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.750
 this 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.780
 I've already mounted and we're not going to do it 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.120
 little open that we're going to use in 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.550
 all the space around the arena because 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.190
 we're going to do is hold this the rein 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.680
 from outside so that he brings her 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.470
 head towards the outside with the 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.360
 rein in, we prevent him from giving 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.759
 full turn 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.550
 the leg inside we open it so that it 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:30.580
 led to it starts to get in and the 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:34.360
 outside leg we put it together to 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:36.719
 demand a bit of Brazil in this 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.719
 moment 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.299
 we say 23 steps we highlight 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:45.990
 remember that between always go 

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:48.000
 less to more 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.000
 first one step after two steps 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.770
 our steps 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.680
 and remember what we do aside what 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:58.490
 we have to do the other side to work 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:01.580
 like things get ahead and this 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.430
 we hold the rule from outside so that 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:07.430
 it came to bolt and which from outside and 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:10.160
 the store inside the most we prevent the 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.340
 took this turn completely and the 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.410
 we put a little leg in 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.780
 that the outside leg is open 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.230
 is pressing to demand that 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.230
 Brazil 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:28.249
 obviously right now this is the first 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.589
 Once it does, it's a bit slow 

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:33.469
 the mare already in the course of the two 

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:36.580
 days grabs him from this fluidity we start 

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:36.580
 to work this exercise 

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:50.330
 this exercise that look for the horse 

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:52.159
 do it together this is one in this 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.279
 because I've goes well the 

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:56.960
 stance gives this already ending not 

00:07:55.279 --> 00:08:00.919
 we assure that this flexible user 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.759
 we select laterally and good this one 

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:06.639
 when getting off our good stirrup 

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:10.009
 that is relaxed 

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:11.809
 and we flex again from below 

00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:14.349
 good would be everything see you in the 

00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:14.349
 next video
