00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.839
 hi how about i am triforce ya 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.990
 then let's do here the 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:11.650
 unboxing of the sony xperia the one that is a 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.260
 midrange sony equipment and then because 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.289
 it comes from the factory with android 4.1 and the 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.810
 living of the dual-core processor of a 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.080
 giga hertz in a giga in ram has 8 gb 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.100
 of internal memory and a display of 4.3 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.770
 inches with resolution of 4.80 by 853 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.500
 it seems to me 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.290
 has nfc of course 8 camera 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.970
 megapixels on the back in the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.910
 main part vga front camera and 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.320
 then you can record video on hd r then 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.730
 quickly will do here what in boxing 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.360
 this is the box to see if I do not have 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.550
 a lot of time in this and well as they 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.760
 I say only let's do the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.760
 unboxing 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:03.010
 what's in the box another girl plus the 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.010
 team that the whole box for that 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.980
 usb cable to micro usb data cable 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.030
 It also has with its charger adapter 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.030
 of wall here is 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.630
 with your hands free your hearing aids 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.160
 Standard 3.5 mm if she wanted 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.920
 you can put whatever you want 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.860
 they also come with a mica for the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.850
 screen so that it did not accelerate raye 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.570
 Minister 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.009
 and finally all the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.520
 are instructional guides use the 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.520
 Quick 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.520
 This equipment is factory-free which is 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.549
 imported is 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.909
 it can not be with any operator is 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.520
 a 3g team and I think it's also going 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.380
 to get to Mexico with the telcel operator 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.479
 obviously block nothing else for them 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.939
 but in this case as I say this is 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.289
 a factory-free imported equipment what 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.299
 can do with the operator that you 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.209
 like there is no problem 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.280
 its price is costing a little less than 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.700
 five thousand pesos so they're going to 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.830
 find in four thousand 804 thousand 900 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.209
 weights really quite accessible for 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.610
 its characteristics for its 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.650
 characteristics that have forgiveness like 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.440
 I tell you past double core a gig of 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.459
 ram 8 gigabytes of internal memory 4.3 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.220
 inches and the living vga front camera 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.680
 8 megapixel flash rear camera 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.950
 led power button here designed a 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.850
 little resemblance to the xperia zl 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.950
 to the button 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.520
 the volume button up and down here 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.790
 we have them 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.680
 the button to take pictures or so 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.680
 what button dedicated to the camera and also 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.380
 you can appreciate your speaker here is 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.970
 the nfc logo that little ticket 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.460
 so who can throw it away if you do not 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.070
 leave as you like the port 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.540
 microusb there to load it or also 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.450
 to connect the computer and 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.030
 transfer data and finally here 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.360
 up the hearing aid port 3.5 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.810
 standard millimeters in the back 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.560
 do not want to remove the battery so that 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.580
 reach to see nothing but this by watching 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.580
 how it opens 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.040
 click here is the little eyelash 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.400
 using without normal does not use micro sim and 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.829
 nothing of that a standard size 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.000
 your battery here as you can see the mobile 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:40.890
 it is replaceable the battery is 1 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.890
 mistake of one thousand 700 thousand jumpers 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.570
 and so that basically this what 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.010
 we have here and also of course 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:56.300
 can expand the microsd memory up 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.340
 32gb 2 basically that's all as 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.260
 I'm just saying it was a boxing that is 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.630
 a team I say quite accessible no 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.840
 I raise its price as they 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.550
 I say 4800 pesos is obviously more or 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.530
 shipping you can buy it in our 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.080
 Store extending to Android background 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.320
 point mx point net or by mail that the 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.900
 mail is contact at android 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.630
 mx point nothing and ask for it and request it 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.550
 They are sent immediately as 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.200
 basically that's all 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.370
 I am triforce this video is for 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.850
 android mx dot net 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.800
 and see you next time before 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.660
 forget to be quickly teams with the 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.030
 that could be 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.930
 compare in terms of features 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:45.280
 for even in that experience 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.320
 the xperia sees how someone sees the galaxy 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.340
 s2 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.340
 the galaxy nexus 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.340
 and several more teams out there then the 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.449
 screen is pretty good 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.449
 you can check 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.530
 4 points 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.910
 one of factory that is the living by 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.350
 course they can put it in language 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.580
 Spanish does not tire truly and for the 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.320
 video from the screen over there says 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.570
 clearly up top spanish mexico 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.580
 has English has several in rivas per 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.849
 then then neither does he kill any 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.740
 no problem 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.929
 and is compatible with any operator 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.849
 here in Mexico and also in other countries 

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:26.429
 they will grab us without any kind of 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.729
 problem networks 3g well now I do 

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:33.360
 dismissal 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.360
 and see you until next time
