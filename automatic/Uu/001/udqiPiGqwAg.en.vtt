stuff is some of the slats he came out
with<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.980> can<00:00:11.130> hook<00:00:11.250> up<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.700> get<00:00:11.790> an<00:00:11.910> extra<00:00:12.120> 18

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
with you can hook up and get an extra 18

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.240 
with you can hook up and get an extra 18
Q's<00:00:12.809> without<00:00:13.590> having<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> have<00:00:14.070> another

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
Q's without having to have another

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.930 
Q's without having to have another
module<00:00:14.990> and<00:00:15.990> some<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:17.250> got<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.460> do<00:00:17.609> to

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
module and some this is we got to do to

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.099 
module and some this is we got to do to
change<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:20.029> the<00:00:21.029> module<00:00:21.420> itself<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.900> order<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
change the the module itself in order to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.990 
change the the module itself in order to
hook<00:00:22.230> up<00:00:22.439> cable<00:00:22.890> things<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.699> one<00:00:23.820> done

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
hook up cable things you have one done

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.769 
hook up cable things you have one done
already<00:00:25.099> so<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.609> all<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.060> has<00:00:27.240> come<00:00:27.449> out<00:00:27.570> as

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
already so this all this has come out as

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.300 
already so this all this has come out as
you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:27.960> see<00:00:28.109> there's<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> three<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.160> now<00:00:29.250> you

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
you can see there's the three so now you

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.410 
you can see there's the three so now you
actually<00:00:29.609> come<00:00:29.730> up<00:00:29.760> with<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.060> actually<00:00:30.330> have

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
actually come up with you actually have

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.299 
actually come up with you actually have
some<00:00:30.510> spare<00:00:30.779> parts<00:00:30.810> for<00:00:31.260> other<00:00:31.380> modules<00:00:31.859> if

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
some spare parts for other modules if

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.190 
some spare parts for other modules if
you're<00:00:32.460> working<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.000> terminals<00:00:33.420> which<00:00:34.110> is

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
you're working on the terminals which is

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.040 
you're working on the terminals which is
kind<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.410> nice<00:00:35.030> but<00:00:36.030> I'll<00:00:36.149> he<00:00:36.390> see<00:00:36.570> ya<00:00:36.899> these

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
kind of nice but I'll he see ya these

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.720 
kind of nice but I'll he see ya these
queues<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.800> thought<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.280> actually<00:00:38.399> would

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
queues and I thought you actually would

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.200 
queues and I thought you actually would
lose<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.950> six<00:00:40.950> queues<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> bottom<00:00:41.700> but

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
lose the six queues at the bottom but

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.490 
lose the six queues at the bottom but
you<00:00:42.239> actually<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:43.020> them<00:00:43.260> right<00:00:43.469> here

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you actually have them right here

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.850 
you actually have them right here
they're<00:00:44.309> tiny<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.910> hell<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:46.170> see<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:46.739> that

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
they're tiny as hell but see if that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.160 
they're tiny as hell but see if that
focus<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.390> push<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
focus in there but if you push the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.920 
focus in there but if you push the
buttons<00:00:49.590> right<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:51.000> put<00:00:51.149> wires<00:00:51.420> still

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
buttons right here I can put wires still

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.090 
buttons right here I can put wires still
into<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.379> spots

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
into that spots

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.010 
into that spots
you<00:00:53.430> still<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.699> your<00:00:53.730> six<00:00:54.030> cues<00:00:54.360> get<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you still have your six cues get to you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.450 
you still have your six cues get to you
like<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.199> screwdriver<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.829> little<00:00:56.070> all<00:00:56.280> or

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
like a screwdriver a little all or

like a screwdriver a little all or
something<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.760> poke<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.280> hook<00:00:59.489> up

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
something to poke it and you hook up

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.740 
something to poke it and you hook up
with<00:00:59.670> these<00:00:59.789> are<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> cables<00:01:00.180> here's<00:01:00.629> that

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
with these are the cables here's that

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.070 
with these are the cables here's that
eighty<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.230> think<00:01:01.410> 80<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.829> 88<00:01:02.160> foot<00:01:02.430> cables

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
eighty I think 80 to 88 foot cables

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.539 
eighty I think 80 to 88 foot cables
Scott<00:01:04.080> does<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.470> these<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.890> sale<00:01:05.129> they're

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
Scott does have these for sale they're

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.060 
Scott does have these for sale they're
pretty<00:01:05.729> nice<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:06.180> 22<00:01:06.600> odd<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.710> nice<00:01:07.890> because

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
pretty nice or 22 odd it's nice because

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.789 
pretty nice or 22 odd it's nice because
you<00:01:08.220> got<00:01:08.340> our<00:01:08.430> right<00:01:08.729> angle<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:10.110> sits<00:01:10.439> flush

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
you got our right angle so it sits flush

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.830 
you got our right angle so it sits flush
instead<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.430> having<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.180> out<00:01:12.299> which

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
instead of having to be up and out which

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.810 
instead of having to be up and out which
what<00:01:13.619> happened<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.430> use<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> other

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
what happened if you use on the other

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.109 
what happened if you use on the other
side<00:01:15.560> like<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.189> cetology<00:01:17.640> sitting

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
side like this in cetology sitting

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.740 
side like this in cetology sitting
upwards<00:01:18.540> which<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.619> my<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.360> again<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.540> leave

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
upwards which is my and again so leave

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
upwards which is my and again so leave
the<00:01:21.840> slats<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.890> part<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.310> actually<00:01:23.549> have

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the slats this is part you actually have

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.450 
the slats this is part you actually have
to<00:01:23.790> replace<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.689> two<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.799> how<00:01:25.950> they<00:01:26.070> connect

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
to replace the two is how they connect

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.749 
to replace the two is how they connect
and<00:01:26.700> then<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.330> board<00:01:28.220> connects<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.490> three

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
and then this board connects the three

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.160 
and then this board connects the three
together<00:01:31.790> but<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.820> saw<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.900> those<00:01:33.990> new

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
together but that saw one of those new

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.080 
together but that saw one of those new
items<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> Cobra<00:01:35.100> slats<00:01:35.460> they're

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
items is the Cobra slats they're

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.179 
items is the Cobra slats they're
available<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.659> parallel<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.619> series<00:01:37.650> in

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
available in parallel and in series in

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.800 
available in parallel and in series in
series<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> connector<00:01:39.030> would<00:01:39.119> be<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
series the connector would be here and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.789 
series the connector would be here and
in<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> back<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:42.380> pretty<00:01:43.380> much<00:01:43.439> prefer

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
in the back I pretty much prefer

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.020 
in the back I pretty much prefer
parallel<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.369> Allah<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.670> mean<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:44.909> you're

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
parallel for Allah I mean if you're

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.580 
parallel for Allah I mean if you're
doing<00:01:45.180> powered<00:01:45.420> musical<00:01:45.869> series<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.350> great

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
doing powered musical series is great

doing powered musical series is great
for<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> simple<00:01:47.130> fact<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.640> check

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
for a simple fact you can check

for a simple fact you can check
continuity<00:01:48.060> better<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:49.470> parallel<00:01:49.920> usually

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
continuity better but parallel usually

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.869 
2016 these ones by March 2017 I believe
right<00:02:08.780> focusing<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.400> anyways<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.580> says<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
right focusing on it anyways it says it

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.569 
right focusing on it anyways it says it
right<00:02:11.910> there

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
right there

right there
not<00:02:14.579> focusing<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.239> but<00:02:17.599> but<00:02:18.599> uh<00:02:18.629> another

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
not focusing on it but but uh another

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.619 
not focusing on it but but uh another
item<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:21.060> uh<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:22.500> Cobra<00:02:22.890> booster<00:02:23.430> as<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.540> can

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
item is uh the Cobra booster as you can

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.380 
item is uh the Cobra booster as you can
see<00:02:24.829> it<00:02:25.829> helps<00:02:26.129> jump<00:02:26.370> your<00:02:26.519> signal<00:02:26.879> about<00:02:27.030> 12

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
see it helps jump your signal about 12

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.619 
see it helps jump your signal about 12
DBM<00:02:27.870> which<00:02:28.560> comes<00:02:28.769> out<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.950> about<00:02:29.159> 3<00:02:29.819> 500<00:02:30.450> feet

DBM which comes out to about 3 500 feet
I<00:02:30.659> believe<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.049> was<00:02:31.700> but<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.730> see<00:02:32.939> a<00:02:33.180> downfall

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
I believe it was but you see a downfall

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.270 
I believe it was but you see a downfall
is<00:02:33.989> it<00:02:34.530> has<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.950> be<00:02:35.069> plugged<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:37.189> but<00:02:38.189> that's

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
is it has to be plugged in but that's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.020 
is it has to be plugged in but that's
what<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.549> looks<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:42.920> video<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.579> as<00:02:44.670> Cobra

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
what it looks like video but as Cobra

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
meter and 3 meter antenna I guess you

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.890 
meter and 3 meter antenna I guess you
call<00:02:55.560> them<00:02:55.709> extensions<00:02:56.250> they<00:02:56.879> hook<00:02:57.150> into<00:02:57.359> the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
call them extensions they hook into the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.530 
call them extensions they hook into the
side<00:02:58.109> of<00:02:58.139> the<00:02:58.319> module<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.980> then<00:02:59.849> you<00:02:59.939> can<00:03:00.150> you

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
side of the module and then you can you

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.039 
side of the module and then you can you
know<00:03:00.569> put<00:03:00.930> an<00:03:01.260> antenna<00:03:01.650> up<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.939> dowel<00:03:03.510> or<00:03:03.989> a

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
know put an antenna up on a a dowel or a

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.559 
know put an antenna up on a a dowel or a
piece<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.409> rebar<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:05.790> give<00:03:05.909> this<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.209> 10<00:03:06.480> up

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
piece of rebar you give this a 10 up

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.000 
piece of rebar you give this a 10 up
higher<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.049> get<00:03:07.170> signal<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:07.799> that's<00:03:07.920> what

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
higher you get signal but that's what

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.410 
higher you get signal but that's what
that<00:03:08.099> blue<00:03:08.220> chose<00:03:08.370> all<00:03:08.489> for<00:03:08.760> has<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.180> help<00:03:09.359> of

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
that blue chose all for has the help of

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.599 
that blue chose all for has the help of
this<00:03:09.569> signal<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.950> if<00:03:11.040> you're<00:03:11.129> doing<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:11.370> an<00:03:11.459> 8

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
this signal so if you're doing like an 8

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.280 
this signal so if you're doing like an 8
or<00:03:11.639> 10<00:03:11.909> inch<00:03:12.060> shell<00:03:12.269> it's<00:03:12.840> gonna<00:03:12.959> be<00:03:13.049> farther

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
or 10 inch shell it's gonna be farther

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.869 
or 10 inch shell it's gonna be farther

away from you that would come in
perfectly<00:03:15.359> handy<00:03:16.019> now<00:03:16.769> thought<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.549> myself

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
perfectly handy now thought to myself

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.710 
perfectly handy now thought to myself
self<00:03:18.810> ha<00:03:19.379> I<00:03:19.910> want<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.970> use<00:03:21.120> this<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.510> I'm<00:03:21.599> in

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
self ha I want to use this and I'm in

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.619 
self ha I want to use this and I'm in
the<00:03:21.810> field<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.739> need<00:03:22.859> electricity<00:03:23.359> the<00:03:24.359> few

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
the field you need electricity the few

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.150 
the field you need electricity the few
options<00:03:24.810> I'm<00:03:25.169> you<00:03:25.260> can<00:03:25.349> hook<00:03:25.500> up<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.739> car<00:03:25.919> but

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
options I'm you can hook up to a car but

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.349 
options I'm you can hook up to a car but
they<00:03:26.220> need<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.370> have<00:03:26.489> your<00:03:26.579> car<00:03:26.639> close<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.239> you

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
they need to have your car close to you

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.180 
they need to have your car close to you
so<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:27.930> thought<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.500> think<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.919> must<00:03:29.069> put<00:03:29.159> a

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
so I thought I think I must put a

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.699 
so I thought I think I must put a
portable<00:03:29.669> power<00:03:29.819> supply<00:03:30.319> so<00:03:31.319> this<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.560> where

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
portable power supply so this is where

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.319 
portable power supply so this is where
this<00:03:31.799> thing<00:03:32.040> comes<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.400> now<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.090> is<00:03:33.209> from

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
this thing comes in now this is from

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.920 
this thing comes in now this is from
brick<00:03:34.069> Brookstone<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.220> was<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:36.090> can<00:03:36.299> see<00:03:36.510> it's

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
brick Brookstone it was you can see it's

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.619 
brick Brookstone it was you can see it's
got<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.079> clock<00:03:37.409> your<00:03:38.159> voltage<00:03:38.609> which<00:03:39.480> your

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
got a clock your voltage which your

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.930 
got a clock your voltage which your
power<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.109> at<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:41.069> also<00:03:41.190> has<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> pretty<00:03:41.609> bright

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
power is at it also has a pretty bright

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.089 
power is at it also has a pretty bright
light<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:44.220> also<00:03:44.370> goes<00:03:44.549> into<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.879> red<00:03:45.150> flashing<00:03:45.510> I

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
light it also goes into a red flashing I

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.729 
light it also goes into a red flashing I
like<00:03:47.099> almost<00:03:47.370> like<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.579> house<00:03:47.849> signal<00:03:48.739> jumper

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
like almost like a house signal jumper

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.390 
like almost like a house signal jumper
cables<00:03:50.099> are<00:03:50.220> in<00:03:50.310> here<00:03:51.979> in<00:03:52.979> case<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.310> never

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
cables are in here in case you never

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.759 
cables are in here in case you never
know

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.000 

it<00:03:56.190> also<00:03:56.340> can<00:03:56.579> work<00:03:56.669> for<00:03:56.909> 12<00:03:57.150> volts<00:03:57.479> and<00:03:58.349> also

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
Cobra stuff so we have the slats to

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.670 
Cobra stuff so we have the slats to
extend<00:05:00.470> out<00:05:00.650> almost<00:05:01.610> do<00:05:01.789> like<00:05:01.910> a<00:05:01.940> front<00:05:02.680> cables

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680
