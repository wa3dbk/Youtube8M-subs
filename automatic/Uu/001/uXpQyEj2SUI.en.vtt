00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
just like yesterday for myself so the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.680

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
these are ones that i thought were the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.810

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
fire reds those had actual fire right so

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.389 
fire reds those had actual fire right so
my<00:02:06.299> mistake<00:02:06.630> i<00:02:06.750> pointed<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.409> another

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
my mistake i pointed that out in another

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.760 
my mistake i pointed that out in another
video<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.060> was<00:02:09.209> totally<00:02:09.390> wrong<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.530> reason

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
video and I was totally wrong the reason

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.410 
video and I was totally wrong the reason
why<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.920> thought<00:02:11.250> these<00:02:11.520> ones<00:02:11.760> were<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.940> fire

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
why I thought these ones were the fire

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.650 
why I thought these ones were the fire
is<00:02:12.569> because<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.550> mean<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.060> red<00:02:15.209> accents

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
is because of the I mean the red accents

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.990 
is because of the I mean the red accents
and<00:02:15.780> stuff<00:02:15.959> but<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:17.280> honestly<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.610> bought<00:02:17.819> them

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
and stuff but and honestly I bought them

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.270 
and stuff but and honestly I bought them
around<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.450> same<00:02:18.630> time<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.040> fact

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
around the same time and so the fact

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.650 
around the same time and so the fact
that<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.550> screw<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.000> up<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.420> kind<00:02:21.599> of

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
that I screw that up is kind of

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.809 
that I screw that up is kind of
hilarious<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:22.170> myself<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.890> had<00:02:23.190> both<00:02:23.400> pairs

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
hilarious to myself but I had both pairs

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.400 
hilarious to myself but I had both pairs

soon<00:04:51.700> if<00:04:51.970> you<00:04:52.000> guys<00:04:52.240> think<00:04:52.270> it's<00:04:52.600> bad<00:04:52.780> form<00:04:53.560> for

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
soon if you guys think it's bad form for

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.890 
soon if you guys think it's bad form for

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
them to re-release them again do you

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.630 
them to re-release them again do you
think<00:04:56.140> that<00:04:56.290> they<00:04:56.890> shouldn't<00:04:57.130> be<00:04:57.250> so<00:04:57.460> limited

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
think that they shouldn't be so limited

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.950 
think that they shouldn't be so limited
when<00:04:58.000> they<00:04:58.120> release<00:04:58.420> them<00:04:58.630> i<00:04:58.750> mean<00:04:58.780> i'm

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
when they release them i mean i'm

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.090 
when they release them i mean i'm
curious<00:04:59.260> you<00:04:59.350> guys<00:04:59.470> it's<00:04:59.650> thoughts<00:04:59.800> i<00:04:59.920> think

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
curious you guys it's thoughts i think

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.710 
curious you guys it's thoughts i think
that<00:05:00.220> they're<00:05:00.370> smart<00:05:00.700> about<00:05:01.330> it<00:05:01.390> though<00:05:01.570> the

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
that they're smart about it though the

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.970 
that they're smart about it though the
fact<00:05:01.930> that<00:05:01.990> they<00:05:02.140> make<00:05:02.290> it<00:05:02.440> more<00:05:02.590> limited

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
fact that they make it more limited

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.190 
fact that they make it more limited
makes<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:03.340> so<00:05:03.490> they're<00:05:03.610> not<00:05:03.730> like<00:05:04.200> converse

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
makes it so they're not like converse

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.930 
makes it so they're not like converse
and<00:05:05.410> stuff<00:05:05.620> not<00:05:05.890> nothing<00:05:06.340> against<00:05:06.580> converse

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
and stuff not nothing against converse

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.970 
and stuff not nothing against converse
