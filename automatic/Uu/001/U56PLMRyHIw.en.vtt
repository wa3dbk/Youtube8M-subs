skeletons throwing and even though the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.509 
skeletons throwing and even though the
skeletons<00:02:12.300> being<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:13.019> know<00:02:13.140> surrounded<00:02:13.980> with

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
skeletons being you know surrounded with

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.820 
skeletons being you know surrounded with
fireballs<00:02:15.120> he's<00:02:15.450> still<00:02:15.720> holding<00:02:16.349> out<00:02:16.590> pretty

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
fireballs he's still holding out pretty

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.199 
fireballs he's still holding out pretty
well<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.510> cubies<00:02:18.510> almost<00:02:18.810> dead<00:02:18.989> actually

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
well and cubies almost dead actually

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.030 
well and cubies almost dead actually
just<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.269> couple<00:02:21.480> more<00:02:21.660> hits<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.110> yep<00:02:22.530> one<00:02:23.010> more

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
just a couple more hits and yep one more

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.830 
just a couple more hits and yep one more
hit<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.340> he<00:02:23.459> should<00:02:23.849> be<00:02:24.030> dead<00:02:24.239> no<00:02:24.450> he's<00:02:24.630> gonna

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
hit and he should be dead no he's gonna

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.890 
hit and he should be dead no he's gonna
take<00:02:24.989> one<00:02:25.170> more<00:02:25.819> okay<00:02:26.819> so<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.090> QB<00:02:27.390> died<00:02:27.569> and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
take one more okay so the QB died and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.770 
take one more okay so the QB died and
the<00:02:28.290> cubies<00:02:28.650> life<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.130> not<00:02:29.340> all<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:29.760> much<00:02:29.970> but

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
the cubies life is not all that much but

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.030 
the cubies life is not all that much but
as<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.019> can<00:02:31.170> see<00:02:31.319> he's<00:02:31.500> still<00:02:31.769> really

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
as you can see he's still really

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.710 
as you can see he's still really
powerful<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.670> he<00:02:32.849> was<00:02:33.030> able<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.269> bring<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
powerful and he was able to bring the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.750 
powerful and he was able to bring the
mutant<00:02:34.019> skeletons<00:02:34.410> health<00:02:34.620> all<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.430> way<00:02:35.549> down

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
mutant skeletons health all the way down

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.530 
mutant skeletons health all the way down
to<00:02:36.120> 74<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.470> he<00:02:37.739> is<00:02:37.920> quite<00:02:38.160> dangerous<00:02:38.370> now<00:02:39.330> let's

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
to 74 so he is quite dangerous now let's

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.000 
to 74 so he is quite dangerous now let's
do<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:39.870> on<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> larger<00:02:40.470> scale<00:02:40.680> because<00:02:40.890> we

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
do this on a larger scale because we

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.440 
do this on a larger scale because we
have<00:02:41.160> those<00:02:41.400> WTF<00:02:42.330> s<00:02:42.510> interfering<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:44.450> yeah

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
have those WTF s interfering and yeah

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.270 
have those WTF s interfering and yeah
it's<00:02:45.599> getting<00:02:45.840> kind<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.049> weird<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.920> let's<00:02:47.099> go

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
it's getting kind of weird so let's go

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.610 
it's getting kind of weird so let's go
over<00:02:47.370> here<00:02:47.730> somewhere<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.569> we'll<00:02:49.200> juice<00:02:49.470> or

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
over here somewhere and we'll juice or

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.370 
over here somewhere and we'll juice or
like<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.910> because<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.090> QB<00:02:51.599> seems<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.049> attack

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
like a because the QB seems to attack

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.819 
like a because the QB seems to attack
the<00:02:52.950> skeletons<00:02:53.819> on<00:02:54.000> their<00:02:54.150> own<00:02:54.299> so<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.900> think<00:02:55.440> a

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
the skeletons on their own so I think a

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.650 
the skeletons on their own so I think a
large-scale<00:02:56.370> battle<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.819> possible<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.540> this

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
large-scale battle is possible in this

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.900 
large-scale battle is possible in this
case<00:02:57.920> so<00:02:58.920> what<00:02:59.010> we're<00:02:59.099> going<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.370> do<00:02:59.519> is<00:02:59.760> we're

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
case so what we're going to do is we're

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.830 
case so what we're going to do is we're
going<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.090> spawn<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.390> whole<00:03:00.599> bunch<00:03:00.750> of

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
going to spawn a whole bunch of

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.390 
going to spawn a whole bunch of
skeletons<00:03:01.079> hopefully<00:03:01.709> they<00:03:01.860> won't<00:03:02.069> run<00:03:02.220> off

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
skeletons hopefully they won't run off

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.449 
skeletons hopefully they won't run off
let's<00:03:03.269> do<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.540> right<00:03:03.720> here<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.170> like<00:03:04.290> a

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
let's do that right here just like a

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.240 
let's do that right here just like a
whole<00:03:05.459> line<00:03:05.670> them<00:03:06.350> five<00:03:07.350> six<00:03:07.859> seven<00:03:08.160> eight

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
whole line them five six seven eight

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.620 
whole line them five six seven eight
nine<00:03:08.310> ten<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.359> let's<00:03:10.109> bond<00:03:10.350> ten<00:03:10.590> cubies<00:03:11.630> one

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
nine ten and let's bond ten cubies one

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.949 
nine ten and let's bond ten cubies one
two<00:03:12.959> three<00:03:13.410> four<00:03:13.799> five<00:03:14.160> six<00:03:14.609> seven<00:03:15.239> eight<00:03:15.390> nine

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
two three four five six seven eight nine

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.800 
two three four five six seven eight nine
ten<00:03:18.380> whoa<00:03:19.519> it's<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.579> huge<00:03:20.970> battle<00:03:21.299> everyone's

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
ten whoa it's a huge battle everyone's

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.809 
ten whoa it's a huge battle everyone's
on<00:03:21.959> fires<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.620> can't<00:03:22.859> read<00:03:23.150> there<00:03:24.150> we<00:03:24.269> go

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.220 

stay<00:03:27.819> back<00:03:28.000> far<00:03:28.299> enough<00:03:28.329> so<00:03:28.659> that<00:03:28.719> we<00:03:28.840> can<00:03:28.959> keep

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
stay back far enough so that we can keep

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.080 
stay back far enough so that we can keep
track<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.560> all<00:03:29.799> of<00:03:29.859> them<00:03:30.069> I<00:03:30.310> seem<00:03:30.939> to<00:03:31.030> be

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
track of all of them I seem to be

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.979 
track of all of them I seem to be
scattering<00:03:31.629> in<00:03:31.810> all<00:03:31.930> directions<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:34.450> can<00:03:34.659> do

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
scattering in all directions you can do

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.530 
scattering in all directions you can do
it<00:03:35.170> cuber<00:03:35.609> yeah<00:03:36.609> I<00:03:36.670> have<00:03:36.909> a<00:03:36.939> feeling<00:03:37.150> all<00:03:37.420> the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
it cuber yeah I have a feeling all the

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.569 
it cuber yeah I have a feeling all the
cuties<00:03:37.840> are<00:03:37.870> going<00:03:38.109> to<00:03:38.170> die<00:03:38.349> unless<00:03:39.159> they're

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
cuties are going to die unless they're

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.849 
cuties are going to die unless they're
able<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.819> keep<00:03:40.030> their<00:03:40.239> distance<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.900> just<00:03:41.140> you

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
able to keep their distance and just you

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.530 
able to keep their distance and just you
know<00:03:41.890> fireball<00:03:42.430> these<00:03:42.670> skeletons<00:03:43.090> from<00:03:43.389> a

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
know fireball these skeletons from a

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.099 
know fireball these skeletons from a
distance<00:03:43.930> but<00:03:44.170> oh<00:03:45.450> right<00:03:46.450> here<00:03:46.689> for<00:03:46.870> example

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
distance but oh right here for example

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.080 
distance but oh right here for example
the<00:03:47.409> skeleton<00:03:47.769> is<00:03:47.829> surrounded<00:03:48.310> by<00:03:48.430> three<00:03:48.939> or

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
the skeleton is surrounded by three or

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.640 
the skeleton is surrounded by three or
four<00:03:49.120> Kiwis<00:03:49.780> never<00:03:50.260> mind

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
four Kiwis never mind

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.259 
four Kiwis never mind
please<00:03:51.370> go<00:03:51.549> back<00:03:51.579> up<00:03:51.939> now<00:03:52.090> so<00:03:53.819> yeah<00:03:54.819> let's<00:03:55.150> see

please go back up now so yeah let's see

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.880 
please go back up now so yeah let's see
what<00:03:55.389> happens

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890

hmmm<00:04:01.670> I<00:04:01.820> see<00:04:02.060> very<00:04:02.270> few<00:04:02.840> cuties<00:04:03.410> now<00:04:03.680> oh<00:04:04.300> the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
hmmm I see very few cuties now oh the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.520 
hmmm I see very few cuties now oh the
skeletons<00:04:05.660> would<00:04:05.750> have<00:04:05.900> fighting<00:04:06.260> each<00:04:06.350> other

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
skeletons would have fighting each other

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.660 
skeletons would have fighting each other
no<00:04:07.330> don't<00:04:08.330> do<00:04:08.450> that

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
got quite a bit of distance there but is

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.260 
got quite a bit of distance there but is
he<00:04:40.040> even<00:04:40.220> attacking<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.970> skeletons

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.909 

and<00:04:49.940> he's<00:04:50.940> going<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.210> die<00:04:51.300> okay<00:04:51.690> so<00:04:52.349> clearly

and he's going to die okay so clearly

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.339 
and he's going to die okay so clearly
the<00:04:53.190> skeletons<00:04:53.580> won<00:04:53.759> this<00:04:53.940> one<00:04:54.180> even<00:04:54.630> in<00:04:55.080> the

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
the skeletons won this one even in the

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.999 
the skeletons won this one even in the
massive<00:04:55.740> battle<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:57.060> are<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.360> victors

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
massive battle you are the victors

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.460 
massive battle you are the victors
except<00:04:59.009> you're<00:04:59.190> killing<00:04:59.729> each<00:04:59.819> other<00:05:02.060> hmm

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
except you're killing each other hmm

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.809 
except you're killing each other hmm
let's<00:05:04.470> actually<00:05:04.620> watch<00:05:04.919> this<00:05:05.160> to<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.430> end<00:05:05.550> I

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
let's actually watch this to the end I

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:11.089 
let's actually watch this to the end I
want<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.060> see<00:05:06.210> which<00:05:06.389> one<00:05:06.599> survives<00:05:10.009> look<00:05:11.009> at

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
want to see which one survives look at

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:18.120 
want to see which one survives look at
that<00:05:11.900> it's<00:05:12.900> all<00:05:13.020> on<00:05:13.199> fire

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.170 

eleven

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.030 

so<00:05:22.750> their<00:05:22.900> punch<00:05:23.140> doesn't<00:05:23.530> do<00:05:23.590> that<00:05:23.860> much

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
so their punch doesn't do that much

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.250 
so their punch doesn't do that much
damage<00:05:24.070> but<00:05:24.670> it's<00:05:24.820> enough<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:26.910> enough<00:05:27.910> to<00:05:28.260> you

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
damage but it's enough to enough to you

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.600 
damage but it's enough to enough to you
know

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
know

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.360 
know
severely<00:05:30.610> hurt<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.270> creature<00:05:32.040> the<00:05:33.040> creatures

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
severely hurt a creature the creatures

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.900 
severely hurt a creature the creatures
not<00:05:33.520> quick<00:05:33.790> enough<00:05:34.060> to<00:05:34.090> get<00:05:34.720> out<00:05:34.840> of<00:05:34.960> its<00:05:35.080> way

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
not quick enough to get out of its way

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.850 
not quick enough to get out of its way
like<00:05:36.910> the<00:05:37.060> QB<00:05:37.390> for<00:05:37.570> example<00:05:38.020> Oh<00:05:40.590> both<00:05:41.590> of<00:05:41.770> them

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
like the QB for example Oh both of them

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.070 
like the QB for example Oh both of them
survived<00:05:42.220> and<00:05:42.580> they<00:05:42.700> aren't<00:05:43.000> attacking<00:05:43.630> each

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
survived and they aren't attacking each

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.650 
survived and they aren't attacking each
other<00:05:44.190> so<00:05:45.190> yeah<00:05:45.310> you<00:05:45.430> guys<00:05:45.610> won<00:05:45.880> good<00:05:46.390> job

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
other so yeah you guys won good job

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.380 
other so yeah you guys won good job
let's<00:05:47.470> see<00:05:47.620> their<00:05:47.740> health<00:05:47.940> seven<00:05:48.940> health<00:05:49.120> and

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
let's see their health seven health and

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.630 
let's see their health seven health and
18<00:05:50.020> health<00:05:50.230> so<00:05:50.410> they<00:05:50.530> just<00:05:50.890> barely<00:05:51.160> made<00:05:51.490> it

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
18 health so they just barely made it

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.580 
18 health so they just barely made it
and<00:05:51.910> I<00:05:52.630> was<00:05:52.780> thinking<00:05:52.840> of<00:05:53.080> doing<00:05:53.140> a<00:05:53.440> whole

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
and I was thinking of doing a whole

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.590 
and I was thinking of doing a whole
bunch<00:05:53.620> of<00:05:53.890> this<00:05:54.010> arena<00:05:54.730> battle<00:05:55.090> stuff<00:05:55.330> because

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
bunch of this arena battle stuff because

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.600 
bunch of this arena battle stuff because
it's<00:05:56.020> really<00:05:56.260> simple<00:05:56.470> to<00:05:56.650> make<00:05:56.830> and<00:05:57.070> it

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
it's really simple to make and it

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.610 
it's really simple to make and it
doesn't<00:05:57.880> take<00:05:58.030> that<00:05:58.060> much<00:05:58.210> time<00:05:58.480> so<00:05:58.810> you<00:05:59.500> guys

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
doesn't take that much time so you guys

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.990 
doesn't take that much time so you guys
let<00:05:59.770> me<00:05:59.830> know<00:05:59.950> which<00:06:00.190> creatures<00:06:00.610> you<00:06:00.730> want<00:06:00.880> to

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
battle next or you want me to buy the

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.980 
battle next or you want me to buy the
next<00:06:03.130> rather<00:06:03.400> and<00:06:03.670> I'll<00:06:04.540> put<00:06:04.690> them<00:06:04.810> together

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
next rather and I'll put them together

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.380 
next rather and I'll put them together
and<00:06:05.380> see<00:06:05.770> what<00:06:05.860> happens<00:06:05.920> so<00:06:06.910> next<00:06:07.150> time<00:06:07.270> I'm

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
and see what happens so next time I'm

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.550 
and see what happens so next time I'm
thinking<00:06:07.660> of<00:06:07.720> doing<00:06:07.750> like<00:06:08.140> the<00:06:10.290> what<00:06:11.290> are<00:06:11.410> they

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
thinking of doing like the what are they

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.670 
thinking of doing like the what are they
mutant<00:06:12.160> skeletons<00:06:12.640> and<00:06:12.850> the<00:06:13.680> emperor

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
mutant skeletons and the emperor

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.440 
mutant skeletons and the emperor
scorpion<00:06:15.010> because<00:06:15.310> the<00:06:15.520> emperor<00:06:15.790> scorpion<00:06:16.060> is

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
scorpion because the emperor scorpion is

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.050 
scorpion because the emperor scorpion is
quite<00:06:16.750> powerful<00:06:17.370> and<00:06:18.370> let's<00:06:18.640> set<00:06:18.880> them<00:06:18.970> up

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
quite powerful and let's set them up

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.250 
quite powerful and let's set them up
somewhere<00:06:19.360> else<00:06:19.390> just<00:06:19.720> so<00:06:19.780> you<00:06:19.900> can<00:06:20.050> take<00:06:20.230> a
