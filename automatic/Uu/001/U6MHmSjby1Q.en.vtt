00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
and attack link so why do I think halo 4

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.860 
and attack link so why do I think halo 4
will<00:00:35.190> incorporate<00:00:35.430> such<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> radical<00:00:36.239> element

as a day/night mechanic into its
gameplay<00:00:38.730> well<00:00:39.719> there's<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.469> few<00:00:40.680> scraps<00:00:41.040> of

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
gameplay well there's a few scraps of

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.590 
gameplay well there's a few scraps of
evidence<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> point<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.420> direction

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600

it's<00:00:43.530> by<00:00:43.710> no<00:00:43.739> means<00:00:43.890> conclusive<00:00:44.309> evidence<00:00:44.940> but
