00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 Today I'm going to teach you to do a 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.500
 super different invitation is a 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.960
 Birthday weathervane is very simple 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.870
 the first thing is to put glue, nor 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.870
 with the glue and place it in the center of the paper. 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:27.050
 a small amount of funding 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.800
 you take the edge 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:37.670
 a little bit to be able to affirm the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.440
 come back over here a bit more 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:48.629
 How much will you always doublet the tip? 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:55.920
 reverse doubled a button 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:01:00.660
 but the audience uses hot glue but you 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.229
 can also use common there it takes 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.869
 a little more to fix but she also 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.869
 Do this work to think 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:23.439
 here we have already given the 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:26.110
 people have already given a marriage format and 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:30.159
 here in all bands have an address 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.229
 party both on the front and on the 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.170
 the back of the wedding so that 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:42.610
 it is very clear that an invitation, 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:49.330
 A lot of people see people will need a 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:51.220
 button on the middle button one foot on the ball this 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.319
 Here you are I 'm recognizing that already. 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.819
 that comes with rods and I now I 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.360
 here I'm using it as a 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:02.439
 structure for the total treatment a 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.340
 piece of wire and only then how does the 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.369
 people are going to do 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.190
 It's already stuck I come in here 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.769
 that already has a circle that I did 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.530
 you can do the circle by drawing the 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.930
 invitation can in this case I made the invitation 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.910
 I sent a print to print 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.750
 but you can make an invitation all in 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:30.930
 home you come here give a snack here 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.930
 exactly where you put it 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:44.049
 code you come here with it may 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.840
 to go through here is actually that 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.959
 will help the wedding to spin 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:57.310
 I come here because this is 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:58.720
 a wire on the button to have a 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.230
 movement 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.230
 he think here in the other 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.090
 and I'm going to get into the hole I made because 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.010
 this one does not come with a hole we do 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.920
 a well and that is very simple is 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.010
 faithful to the tip of the scissors he is ready 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.840
 here we will also make a hole 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:27.240
 We come with any tips do 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.630
 a hole on one side a hole on the other 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.630
 this part stayed was you come here and 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.630
 through 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:46.150
 in which case you want to drink some more 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:54.570
 because as plastic it has not been yet 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:04:02.950
 spent most or that you and ends 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:05.680
 They saw the love to fix it so as not to hurt 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.260
 we can not what it is that in this case 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.980
 here the party of a child is this 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.140
 invitation and certainly it goes to the hand 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.480
 of a child 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.480
 We did the tasting, it's ready here. 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:27.700
 You can place up to 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:33.280
 down it means you and every 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:38.020
 one in the air more more exquisite nÃ© na 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.440
 invitation delivery you boot inside 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.440
 a little bag 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:54.280
 that with charm and the person feels super 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:01.600
 happy to be receiving an invitation 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:05.080
 different, my car is not going to stone us 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:10.750
 to produce we made one for Grandma 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:14.020
 then everything was done with the name and what 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:18.070
 It's interesting on the day of the party you can 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:23.349
 condemn children to take the invitation 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:27.160
 and you invite 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:32.130
 put a piece of a barbecue stick 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:35.710
 it is made of wood in this way and 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:38.050
 in the land itself because in this case here 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.430
 the picnic ready invitation is what neither 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.940
 her name 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.340
 I hope you like it and enjoy this 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:49.080
 Our idea is after we came back with 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.080
 hands and ideas andrÃ¡s
