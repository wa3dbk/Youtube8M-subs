00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
out I thought well I need to get it this

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.410 
out I thought well I need to get it this
year<00:02:47.860> definitely<00:02:48.460> needs<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.970> go<00:02:49.090> ahead<00:02:49.300> and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
year definitely needs to go ahead and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.240 
year definitely needs to go ahead and
get<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.720> but<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.470> caused<00:02:50.650> me<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.950> have<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.070> pay

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
get it but that caused me to have to pay

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.480

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
the end of the day it was worth it so if

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.090 
the end of the day it was worth it so if
