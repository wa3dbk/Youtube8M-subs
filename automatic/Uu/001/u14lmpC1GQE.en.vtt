is you have you should have

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.950 
is you have you should have
understanding<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.670> better<00:00:23.910> color<00:00:24.510> contrast

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
understanding for better color contrast

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.689 
understanding for better color contrast
for<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.800> effect<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.750> this<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.369> original<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
for this effect so this is original and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.179 
for this effect so this is original and
this<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> effect<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.410> put<00:00:31.740> for

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
this is the effect that I have put for

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.260 
this is the effect that I have put for
this<00:00:32.369> image<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.870> really<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.440> beautiful

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
this image and it's really a beautiful

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.799 
this image and it's really a beautiful
effect<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.750> photo<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.940> let's<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.510> ah

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
effect with this photo so let's see ah

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.990 
effect with this photo so let's see ah
how<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.040> eat<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> Photoshop<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.190> have

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
how do I eat in the Photoshop so I have

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.990 
how do I eat in the Photoshop so I have
hide<00:00:45.539> all<00:00:45.750> all<00:00:47.270> this<00:00:48.770> layers<00:00:49.770> layer<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.460> this

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
hide all all this layers layer and this

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.330 
hide all all this layers layer and this
brightness<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.320> firstly<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.829> will<00:00:52.949> go<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:54.199> this

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
brightness so firstly I will go to this

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.250 
brightness so firstly I will go to this
brightness<00:00:56.340> contrast<00:00:56.610> tool<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.989> type

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
brightness contrast tool for this type

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.349 
brightness contrast tool for this type
of<00:00:58.289> effect<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.250> should<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.609> less<00:00:59.940> contrast

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
of effect you should have less contrast

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.119 
of effect you should have less contrast
so<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.690> will<00:01:01.050> put<00:01:01.859> its<00:01:02.100> contrast<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:03.799> minus<00:01:04.799> 50

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
so I will put its contrast to minus 50

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.250 
so I will put its contrast to minus 50
and<00:01:05.720> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.900> see<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> difference<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.610> is

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
and you can see the difference this is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.640 
and you can see the difference this is
before<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.799> after<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:12.650> secondly

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
before and this is after and secondly

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.210 
before and this is after and secondly
you<00:01:14.100> make<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> new<00:01:14.670> layer<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:16.009> have<00:01:17.009> chosen

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
you make a new layer and I have chosen

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.880 
you make a new layer and I have chosen
these<00:01:17.490> colors<00:01:18.110> that<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.409> orange

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
these colors that is orange

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.280 
these colors that is orange
I<00:01:20.040> want<00:01:20.759> orange<00:01:21.240> light<00:01:21.420> from<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.840> side<00:01:22.080> from

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
I want orange light from this side from

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.010 
I want orange light from this side from
the<00:01:22.710> upper<00:01:23.310> head<00:01:23.490> or<00:01:23.670> upper<00:01:24.299> part<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> set

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the upper head or upper part of the set

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.700 
the upper head or upper part of the set
and<00:01:26.479> as<00:01:27.479> well<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:27.930> blue<00:01:28.170> shade<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:30.710> you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and as well as blue shade and my and you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.249 
and as well as blue shade and my and you
can<00:01:31.920> note<00:01:32.729> down<00:01:32.759> these<00:01:33.119> colors<00:01:33.540> both<00:01:33.960> colors

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
can note down these colors both colors

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.359 
can note down these colors both colors
that<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.280> zero<00:01:35.869> d25<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:39.560> for<00:01:40.560> this

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that it is zero d25 for a then for this

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.530 
that it is zero d25 for a then for this
foreground<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.840> double<00:01:43.409> 7<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:44.130> double

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
foreground it is a double 7 to double

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.770 
foreground it is a double 7 to double
zero<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:47.100> i<00:01:48.710> will<00:01:49.710> go<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.189> gradient<00:01:50.939> tool

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
zero so i will go to this gradient tool

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.280 
zero so i will go to this gradient tool
then<00:01:52.590> i<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:53.100> choosen<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.960> radial<00:01:54.960> option

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
then i have choosen this radial option

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.580 
then i have choosen this radial option
then<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.280> will<00:01:56.430> make<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:58.399> gradient<00:01:59.399> of<00:02:00.590> these

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
then I will make a gradient of these

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.050 
then I will make a gradient of these
both<00:02:01.860> curves

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.490 

control<00:02:07.060> jet<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:07.900> I<00:02:09.569> want<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.750> factor<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.290> this

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
control jet and I want a factor of this

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.120 
control jet and I want a factor of this
orang2<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.580> version<00:02:13.360> only<00:02:13.569> then<00:02:14.290> set<00:02:14.920> its

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
orang2 this version only then set its

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.780 
orang2 this version only then set its
blend<00:02:15.490> mode<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.700> screen<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:20.290> that's<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.610> can

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
blend mode to screen so that's you can

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.240

this ml then go to adjustment layer then

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.420 
this ml then go to adjustment layer then
choose<00:02:34.780> curve

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
choose curve

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:44.060
