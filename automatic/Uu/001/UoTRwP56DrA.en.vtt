00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.510

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.810
 where we will be able to recharge the ammunition 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.779
 to throw fireworks worth what 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.690
 I had already uploaded in xbox as I say 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:39.000
 sorry on pc 3 and then 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.140
 and here we are going to take care of zombies that are going to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.360
 throw rocket launchers vouchers 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.280
 forgiveness throws fire throws fires 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.440
 artificial and if we are going to kill each 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.290
 one then we will be able to collect the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.250
 ammunition if we buy the weapon is worth as 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.230
 you see here is the fight 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.410
 and if you have the weapon 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.900
 You can fill to the top this is worth it 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.820
 they got them out of the pendency and the 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.130
 past of lcd christmas but already what 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.500
 they removed ok then if you've stayed 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.630
 without ammunition for this weapon which will 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.920
 I recommend that you take advantage of this game and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.970
 fill it up is awkward and so what? 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.430
