00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:19.020
 Today's program will talk about 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.990
 refuge you like Mandarin like 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.060
 listening to hertha will set up an aquarium already 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.560
 now has a set up and have no refuge at 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.970
 company that you will like 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.300
 Today's tip you 're riding your 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.430
 aquarium already designed to change the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.010
 blood and does not have a 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.590
 study well the equipment you have 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.469
 use the required equipment and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.800
 leave as much room as possible for the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:52.230
 Refuge is what a refuge is a refuge. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.180
 part of your aquarium that you will leave 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.170
 basically for storing 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.289
 biology 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.270
 there will contain substrate in the range of 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.930
 10 centimeters as long as you can 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.200
 put rocks many rocks and this will 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.470
 have it store biology for 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.540
 supplying your display is for example 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.360
 my aquarium I have two getaway 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.369
 has 1 in the pietro that external that is the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 My, I say change and circulation. 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.830
 basically none the slower 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.350
 you can make the passage of water through 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.350
 this refuge is the ideal 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.770
 my first refuge is the one to show 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.490
 for you 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.140
 a 50's cannon comes down from the boot 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.770
 I made a curve 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.149
 in it, passing through the refuge below 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.850
 substrate it rises and goes to fall is 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.920
 pure skiing compartment me 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:59.130
 I came down directly from the boot 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.149
 small holes in the sides just 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.360
 for water comes out very slowly very slowly 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.840
 basically have no movement in that 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.840
 my refuge 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.040
 and even if you are seeing is going to be 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.950
 basically algae will be substrate and 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.500
 in the range of about 45 cents of substrate 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.910
 algae I think about four five 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.860
 types of algae 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.450
 I will not even dare to say the name that 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.790
 very complicated men I go 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.730
 prefer to place in GC here for you 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.650
 is the part of lighting lighting 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.570
 you do not need to worry too much 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.980
 you can pick up any lamp 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.560
 preference over 5,000 catar is these 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.360
 compact home can touch 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.150
 quietly your refuge in this 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.450
 second refuge that was my old change 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.870
 I did what I got is a pipe made 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.170
 an adaptation of the booster pump 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.630
 directly to the refuge with the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.320
 very slow circulation is basically 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.380
 This person does not have much secret is a 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.739
 recess in your blood or 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.840
 outside the aquarium connected to your 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.850
 display ok so that's what this is for 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.370
 refuge store a maximum of biology 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.910
 possible to understand that you like 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.950
 Mandarin head scooter is I think until 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.570
 corals feed on a little of this 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.940
 macro life itself is the nitrate phosphate 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.190
 Can you have greater control? 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:43.400
 when you have a well assembled and refuge 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:45.440
 sold these algae from the refuge with them 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.739
 play very fast 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.150
 it's a few weeks or 15-20 days 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.910
 one month 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.120
 you will see those have almost tripled to 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.880
 quantity within itself says of this 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.750
 refuge is you who has space as I do 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.790
 mount ooo a little bigger refuge 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.470
 you can also use it as a 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.090
 quarantine species 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.650
 usually the staff is afraid of 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.810
 buy the fish put straight into the 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.710
 I, for example, display all the fish that 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:20.040
 I get put first in my 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:24.950
 refuge superfood he's after 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.950
 the ten 15 days put on my display 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.880
 because I advise you to put together a 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.900
 quarantine a little higher because when 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.670
 the fish when it is from an import 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.950
 stayed a few days in the shop in the normally 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.450
 is a very small frame of space 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.330
 fish is stressed 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.890
 you arrive puts it straight into your 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.290
 display there fight between them for 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.500
 food dispute over 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.740
 fish is already stressed from the 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.970
 storage if you put it directly 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.370
 in your on your display is you will have a 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.810
 little more difficult to feed 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.160
 and ok here at your refuge you will have 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.800
 more ease 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.560
 You'll be able to see it, you'd better. 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.410
 to be able to feed better and when it is 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.480
 the main display it can be 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.600
 quietly your three days without eating 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:29.510
 that it is normal for the baby to be inside the 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.510
 display when you have just placed an aquarium 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.600
 before finalizing I would like to thank 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.540
 very personal from campy quarry to 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:44.040
 Sergio ricardo for being legally supportive 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:46.770
 the help riff liked the video it was cool 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.350
 useful share our short page 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.450
 because our intention is this is to do 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.000
 with which the marine aquarium is more 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.640
 possible for more and more 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.510
 There are new people and teaching 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.950
 OK 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.950
 a hug until the next program
