going to start getting old and stuff is
going<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.010> start<00:03:11.189> happening<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.970> like<00:03:12.959> with

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
going to start happening to it like with

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.839 
going to start happening to it like with
a<00:03:13.170> maple<00:03:13.409> board<00:03:13.739> your<00:03:13.920> cockades<00:03:14.430> going<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.760> go

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
a maple board your cockades going to go

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.640 
a maple board your cockades going to go
down<00:03:15.060> your<00:03:15.329> pops<00:03:15.540> going<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.900> go<00:03:16.019> down<00:03:16.260> your

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
down your pops going to go down your

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.580 
down your pops going to go down your
bordeaux<00:03:16.950> like<00:03:17.129> flattened<00:03:17.579> out<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.760> little<00:03:18.030> bit

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
bordeaux like flattened out a little bit

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.729 
bordeaux like flattened out a little bit
and<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.739> will<00:03:20.480> break<00:03:21.480> easier<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.140> course<00:03:22.170> and

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
and it will break easier of course and

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.660 
and it will break easier of course and
the<00:03:23.129> maple<00:03:23.489> on<00:03:23.670> these<00:03:23.909> bamboo<00:03:24.239> boards<00:03:25.489> like<00:03:26.489> I

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
the maple on these bamboo boards like I

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.330 
the maple on these bamboo boards like I
got<00:03:26.909> these<00:03:27.569> really<00:03:27.959> weird<00:03:28.349> pressure<00:03:28.920> cracks

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
got these really weird pressure cracks

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.930 
got these really weird pressure cracks
that<00:03:29.970> went<00:03:30.239> all<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.689> way<00:03:30.720> down<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.230> board<00:03:31.940> you

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
that went all the way down the board you

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.440 
that went all the way down the board you
can<00:03:33.120> see<00:03:33.329> these<00:03:33.480> pressure<00:03:33.840> cracks<00:03:35.450> that

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
can see these pressure cracks that

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.869 
can see these pressure cracks that
little<00:03:36.870> old<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:38.400> razor<00:03:38.670> tail<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:41.400> happened

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
little old the razor tail it happened

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.629 
little old the razor tail it happened
fast<00:03:41.909> at<00:03:42.450> first<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.349> then<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.129> slowed<00:03:44.459> down

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
fast at first and then it slowed down

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.929 
fast at first and then it slowed down
almost<00:03:45.389> came<00:03:45.689> to<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:45.900> stop<00:03:46.549> didn't<00:03:47.549> really<00:03:47.670> get

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
almost came to a stop didn't really get

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.640 
almost came to a stop didn't really get
that<00:03:48.180> better<00:03:48.420> razortail<00:03:48.780> but<00:03:49.200> some<00:03:49.379> people

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
that better razortail but some people

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.069 
that better razortail but some people
that<00:03:49.799> had<00:03:49.980> my<00:03:50.159> boards<00:03:50.489> did<00:03:53.599> yeah<00:03:54.599> instead<00:03:54.930> of

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
that had my boards did yeah instead of

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.050 
that had my boards did yeah instead of
breaking<00:03:55.409> they<00:03:55.799> really<00:03:56.159> just<00:03:56.189> bend<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.879> whole

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
breaking they really just bend a whole

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.949 
breaking they really just bend a whole
lot<00:03:57.359> that's<00:03:57.840> all<00:03:58.049> that<00:03:58.230> happens<00:03:59.480> so<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.540> mean

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
lot that's all that happens so I mean

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.229 
lot that's all that happens so I mean
they're<00:04:01.109> pretty<00:04:01.230> strong<00:04:01.650> I'd<00:04:02.489> say<00:04:02.760> stronger

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
they're pretty strong I'd say stronger

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.430 
they're pretty strong I'd say stronger
than<00:04:03.359> maple<00:04:04.010> on<00:04:05.010> have<00:04:05.879> nice<00:04:06.150> concave<00:04:06.720> nice<00:04:07.079> pop

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
than maple on have nice concave nice pop

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.250 
than maple on have nice concave nice pop
they're<00:04:08.010> cheap<00:04:08.750> apparently<00:04:09.750> it's<00:04:09.900> good<00:04:10.079> for

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
they're cheap apparently it's good for

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.970 
they're cheap apparently it's good for
the<00:04:10.319> environment<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:12.769> don't<00:04:13.769> know<00:04:13.829> about

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
the environment I don't know about

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.339 
the environment I don't know about
bamboo<00:04:14.340> boards<00:04:14.760> replacing<00:04:15.329> maple<00:04:15.750> but<00:04:16.019> I

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
bamboo boards replacing maple but I

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.039 
bamboo boards replacing maple but I
think<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.070> it's<00:04:17.639> a<00:04:17.699> good<00:04:17.729> alternative<00:04:18.049> if

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
think that it's a good alternative if

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.229 
think that it's a good alternative if
you<00:04:19.199> had<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.409> money<00:04:19.609> shabana<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.880> try<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.120> out

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
you had the money shabana and try it out

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.899 
you had the money shabana and try it out
for<00:04:21.419> yourself<00:04:22.190> hope<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.430> enjoyed<00:04:23.880> that
