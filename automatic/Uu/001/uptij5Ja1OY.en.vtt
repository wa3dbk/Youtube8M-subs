00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.840
 while the titans made their way through their primordial landscape they found 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.829
 a number of hostile elemental beings 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.629
 these elementals who worshiped a race of infinitely evil beings

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.670
 the colossal titans 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.100
 although the elementals were powerful beyond mortal understanding 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.990
 their combined forces could not stop the powerful titans 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.520

 evil gods under the surface of the world 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.330
 without the power of the ancient gods to keep their fiery spirits

 linked to the physical world the elementals were expelled to a plane

 abyssal where they should fight against each other for all eternity 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.950
 with the departure of the elementals 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.850
 nature calmed down and the world was heading towards a peaceful harmony 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.790
 the titans said that the threat had been contained and they began to 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.200
 to work 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.509

 the titans for many moved and shaped the world 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.099
 until at last there was a perfect continent 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.959
 in their center they created a lake of sparkling energies 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.440
 the lake they called the well of eternity 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.879

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.759
 to life so that it would take root in the rich soil of the earth
