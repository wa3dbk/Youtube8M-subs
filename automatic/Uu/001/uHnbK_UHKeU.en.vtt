00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
did that what I had to do was assemble

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.899 
did that what I had to do was assemble
the<00:01:37.229> parts<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.680> garage<00:01:38.009> upstairs<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the parts in the garage upstairs and

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.370 
the parts in the garage upstairs and
bring<00:01:39.060> down<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.420> pieces<00:01:39.630> separately<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
bring down the pieces separately and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.910 
bring down the pieces separately and
assemble<00:01:40.860> down<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.180> lower<00:01:42.360> frame

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
assemble down here so the lower frame

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.160 
assemble down here so the lower frame
was<00:01:44.060> moved<00:01:45.060> down<00:01:45.149> there's<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:45.600> piece<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
was moved down there's one piece and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.980 
was moved down there's one piece and
then<00:01:46.259> when<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.770> got<00:01:47.040> down<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.990> attached

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
then when I got down here I attached

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.499 
then when I got down here I attached
these<00:01:49.439> two<00:01:49.680> 3/4<00:01:50.280> inch<00:01:50.399> plywood<00:01:50.700> pieces<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
these two 3/4 inch plywood pieces the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.990 
these two 3/4 inch plywood pieces the
first<00:01:51.540> one<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.079> regular<00:01:52.290> plywood<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.159> then<00:01:53.790> so

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
first one is regular plywood and then so

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.880 
first one is regular plywood and then so
I'd<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> nice<00:01:54.570> smooth<00:01:55.110> surface<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
I'd have a nice smooth surface on the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.219 
I'd have a nice smooth surface on the
top<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.939> top<00:01:57.149> piece<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.890> 3/4<00:01:58.890> inch

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
top this is top piece is 3/4 inch

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.340 
top this is top piece is 3/4 inch
hardwood<00:02:01.229> maple<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.549> top<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.200> that

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
hardwood maple on the top and so that

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.959 
hardwood maple on the top and so that
gave<00:02:04.439> me<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.619> nice<00:02:04.829> smooth<00:02:05.219> work<00:02:05.490> surface

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
gave me a nice smooth work surface

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.100 
gave me a nice smooth work surface
without<00:02:06.869> splinters<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.740> what

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
without splinters and what

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.520 
without splinters and what
and<00:02:08.380> it's<00:02:09.330> glued<00:02:10.330> together<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:10.990> then<00:02:11.110> screwed

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
and it's glued together and then screwed

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.700 
and it's glued together and then screwed
down<00:02:11.710> into<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.190> support<00:02:12.610> crossbeams<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:13.990> it's

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
down into the support crossbeams so it's

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.610 
down into the support crossbeams so it's
not<00:02:14.950> gonna<00:02:15.100> warp<00:02:15.460> or<00:02:15.730> curved<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:17.260> it's<00:02:17.470> very

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
not gonna warp or curved so it's very

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.170 
not gonna warp or curved so it's very
solid<00:02:18.810> workbench<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:21.460> shelves<00:02:21.910> if<00:02:22.060> I

solid workbench and the shelves if I

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.020 
solid workbench and the shelves if I

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
reason I made it so I could attach these

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
on there pretty solid it's not going

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.610 
on there pretty solid it's not going
anywhere<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.940> then<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.660> added<00:02:52.840> some<00:02:53.020> pegboard

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
anywhere and then I added some pegboard

hanging tools and then the things I
think<00:02:59.440> I'll<00:02:59.709> use<00:02:59.739> more<00:03:00.160> than<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.400> most<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:00.970> just

my taco armors tool scissors which I

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.120 
my taco armors tool scissors which I
seem<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.870> use<00:03:07.959> all<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.320> time<00:03:08.530> or<00:03:08.709> in<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.830> front

a shelf here I wanted to make this show
up<00:03:21.910> high<00:03:22.120> enough<00:03:22.330> that<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.600> had<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.780> open<00:03:23.170> space

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
up high enough that I had to open space

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.979 
up high enough that I had to open space
a<00:03:23.830> good<00:03:24.310> amount<00:03:24.549> of<00:03:24.610> open<00:03:24.730> space<00:03:24.910> under<00:03:25.540> and

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
a good amount of open space under and

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.360 
a good amount of open space under and
yet<00:03:26.170> still<00:03:26.440> had<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.590> little<00:03:26.769> bit<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:27.040> room<00:03:27.250> to

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
yet still had a little bit of room to

yet still had a little bit of room to
put<00:03:27.489> stuff<00:03:27.730> here<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:28.870> course<00:03:29.080> I've<00:03:29.230> room

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410

on the top my leg slide plus my tumbler
things<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.620> use<00:03:33.340> but<00:03:33.610> not<00:03:33.730> particularly<00:03:34.180> often

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
things I use but not particularly often

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.780 
things I use but not particularly often
then<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.380> also<00:03:35.530> built<00:03:35.830> a<00:03:35.980> shelf<00:03:36.220> at<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.400> bottom

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
then I also built a shelf at the bottom

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.420 
then I also built a shelf at the bottom
I<00:03:36.910> wanted<00:03:37.209> to<00:03:37.299> have<00:03:37.420> room<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.780> put<00:03:37.959> stuff<00:03:38.170> under

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
I wanted to have room to put stuff under

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.130 
I wanted to have room to put stuff under
but<00:03:39.430> still<00:03:39.760> have<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:39.910> good<00:03:40.150> sizeable<00:03:40.780> amount<00:03:41.019> of

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
but still have a good sizeable amount of

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.650 
but still have a good sizeable amount of
room<00:03:41.320> if<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.190> need<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.459> put<00:03:42.640> something<00:03:42.850> bigger

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
room if I need to put something bigger

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.370 
room if I need to put something bigger
under<00:03:44.260> here<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:45.690> made<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.870> at<00:03:47.019> this<00:03:47.140> height

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
under here so I made it at this height

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.810 
under here so I made it at this height
so<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.620> could<00:03:47.799> slide<00:03:47.980> some<00:03:48.220> smaller<00:03:48.700> stuff

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
so I could slide some smaller stuff

clutter<00:04:29.480> this<00:04:29.990> was<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.380> this<00:04:30.770> place<00:04:31.010> was<00:04:31.220> a

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
clutter this was a this place was a

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.610 
clutter this was a this place was a
disaster<00:04:31.720> but<00:04:32.720> now<00:04:32.930> I<00:04:32.960> have<00:04:33.230> it<00:04:33.260> mostly

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.340 
can put the computer here and the cord I
can<00:04:39.260> still<00:04:39.500> reach<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:39.890> and<00:04:40.150> sit<00:04:41.150> it<00:04:41.300> if<00:04:42.020> I<00:04:42.170> need

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
can still reach it and sit it if I need

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.470 
can still reach it and sit it if I need
to<00:04:42.470> look<00:04:42.590> up<00:04:42.740> some<00:04:42.980> videos<00:04:43.670> on<00:04:43.910> YouTube<00:04:44.330> or

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
some instructional videos I can still

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.960 
some instructional videos I can still
move<00:04:46.430> that<00:04:46.670> over<00:04:46.820> there<00:04:48.580> so<00:04:49.580> I<00:04:49.610> kind<00:04:49.820> of<00:04:49.850> like
