can hear that there's really no grabbing
of<00:00:54.049> the<00:00:54.229> dental<00:00:54.739> pick<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:56.690> then<00:00:57.080> you've<00:00:57.199> got

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
of the dental pick and then you've got

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.799 
of the dental pick and then you've got
this<00:00:57.650> one<00:01:01.059> so<00:01:02.059> what<00:01:02.180> we're<00:01:02.299> trying<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.540> do<00:01:02.659> is

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
smooth that out so that we can get a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.399 
smooth that out so that we can get a
nice<00:01:04.659> finish<00:01:05.659> on<00:01:05.840> there<00:01:06.170> with<00:01:06.590> our<00:01:06.860> paint

nice finish on there with our paint

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.740 
nice finish on there with our paint
alright<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:09.710> let's<00:01:10.130> do<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.460> unboxing<00:01:10.490> here<00:01:13.750> so

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
alright so let's do the unboxing here so

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.150 
alright so let's do the unboxing here so
what<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:14.930> got<00:01:15.080> formula<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:17.290> measuring<00:01:18.290> cup

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:30.540 

formula<00:01:22.160> B<00:01:24.580> some<00:01:25.580> instructions<00:01:29.380> paintbrush

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
formula B some instructions paintbrush

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.510 
formula B some instructions paintbrush
and<00:01:31.550> a<00:01:31.790> master<00:01:32.120> stick<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:33.740> we've<00:01:33.950> already<00:01:34.160> done

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
and a master stick so we've already done

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.690 
and a master stick so we've already done
the<00:01:34.760> mixture<00:01:35.150> for<00:01:35.360> this<00:01:35.510> is<00:01:35.750> two<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.140> one<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.700> a

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
the mixture for this is two to one to a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.360 
the mixture for this is two to one to a
to<00:01:37.940> one<00:01:38.780> Part<00:01:39.080> B<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.710> we've<00:01:39.860> already<00:01:40.040> measured

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
to one Part B and we've already measured

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.950 
to one Part B and we've already measured
this<00:01:40.670> up<00:01:40.880> on<00:01:41.060> our<00:01:41.090> scale<00:01:41.560> so<00:01:43.690> let's<00:01:44.690> go<00:01:44.870> ahead

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
this up on our scale so let's go ahead

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.050 
this up on our scale so let's go ahead
and<00:01:45.080> mix<00:01:45.350> this<00:01:45.560> together<00:01:45.800> and<00:01:46.100> get<00:01:46.820> this

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
and mix this together and get this

00:01:47.060 --> 00:02:00.290 
and mix this together and get this
started

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.640 

another<00:02:01.300> cure<00:02:01.570> time<00:02:01.810> for<00:02:02.050> this<00:02:02.170> they're

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
another cure time for this they're

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.320 
another cure time for this they're
saying<00:02:03.100> roughly<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:04.000> it's<00:02:04.240> going<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.510> be

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
saying roughly that it's going to be

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.510 
saying roughly that it's going to be
three<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.540> three-and-a-half<00:02:07.930> hours<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:09.399> what

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
three to three-and-a-half hours so what

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.340 
three to three-and-a-half hours so what
we're<00:02:09.670> gonna<00:02:09.729> do<00:02:10.060> is<00:02:10.209> we're<00:02:10.390> gonna<00:02:10.479> mix<00:02:11.140> this

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
we're gonna do is we're gonna mix this

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.650 
we're gonna do is we're gonna mix this
up<00:02:11.730> paint<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:12.940> on<00:02:13.150> let<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.660> set<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:15.660> we're

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
up paint this on let it set and we're

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.180 
up paint this on let it set and we're
going<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.840> go<00:02:16.959> out<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.260> actually<00:02:17.410> paint<00:02:17.950> these

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
going to go out and actually paint these

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.190 
going to go out and actually paint these
and<00:02:18.580> then<00:02:19.270> what<00:02:19.420> we'll<00:02:19.540> do<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.870> we'll<00:02:19.990> do<00:02:20.170> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
and then what we'll do is we'll do a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.680 
and then what we'll do is we'll do a
final<00:02:20.560> at<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.280> end<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.640> see<00:02:21.850> if<00:02:21.880> we<00:02:22.270> can<00:02:22.450> see

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
final at the end to see if we can see

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.830 
final at the end to see if we can see
any<00:02:22.840> rich<00:02:23.110> marks<00:02:23.560> or<00:02:23.800> any<00:02:23.980> layer<00:02:24.610> hikes<00:02:24.940> on<00:02:25.390> any

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
any rich marks or any layer hikes on any

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:40.670 
any rich marks or any layer hikes on any
of<00:02:25.990> these<00:02:26.110> Marvins<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:36.010> looks<00:02:36.220> pretty<00:02:36.580> mixed

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:03:52.369 

so<00:02:41.680> I'll<00:02:41.950> pick<00:02:42.160> one<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.489> these<00:02:42.550> guys

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.199 

so<00:03:53.069> I'm<00:03:53.129> wearing<00:03:53.340> this<00:03:53.609> on<00:03:53.819> pretty<00:03:54.090> thick

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
so I'm wearing this on pretty thick

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.390 
so I'm wearing this on pretty thick
because<00:03:55.049> what<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:55.409> is<00:03:55.469> is<00:03:55.709> basically<00:03:56.069> a

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
because what this is is basically a

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.259 
because what this is is basically a
gloss<00:03:56.700> coating<00:03:57.829> that's<00:03:58.829> supposed<00:03:59.219> to<00:03:59.400> get

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
gloss coating that's supposed to get

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.709 
gloss coating that's supposed to get
into<00:04:00.420> all<00:04:00.629> the<00:04:00.780> pores<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:05.329> make<00:04:06.329> it<00:04:06.480> nice<00:04:06.659> and

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:06.719

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:12.679 
into all the pores and make it nice and
smooth<00:04:10.879> so<00:04:11.879> I'm<00:04:11.939> going<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.120> do<00:04:12.269> is<00:04:12.420> there's<00:04:12.629> a

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
smooth so I'm going to do is there's a

show you right now as you can see the

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.930 
show you right now as you can see the
crevice<00:06:00.030> down<00:06:00.389> here<00:06:00.870> kind<00:06:01.710> of<00:06:01.919> got<00:06:02.070> filled<00:06:02.669> in

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
crevice down here kind of got filled in

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.260 
crevice down here kind of got filled in
when<00:06:03.599> the<00:06:03.960> smooth<00:06:04.650> on<00:06:04.889> kind<00:06:05.430> of<00:06:05.520> pulled<00:06:05.849> in

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
when the smooth on kind of pulled in

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.960 
when the smooth on kind of pulled in
down<00:06:06.479> to<00:06:07.200> the<00:06:07.320> bottom<00:06:07.650> of<00:06:07.770> this<00:06:07.919> and<00:06:08.340> then<00:06:08.820> you

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
down to the bottom of this and then you

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.790 
down to the bottom of this and then you
can<00:06:09.060> see<00:06:09.270> a<00:06:09.300> nest<00:06:09.510> on<00:06:09.870> vapor<00:06:10.139> see<00:06:10.410> how<00:06:10.530> deep

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
can see a nest on vapor see how deep

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.100 
can see a nest on vapor see how deep
that<00:06:10.830> that<00:06:11.430> is<00:06:11.669> so<00:06:12.360> basically<00:06:12.690> there's<00:06:12.960> an

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
that that is so basically there's an

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.950 
that that is so basically there's an
issue<00:06:13.229> with<00:06:13.410> that<00:06:14.240> basically<00:06:15.240> when<00:06:15.599> you<00:06:15.720> paint

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
issue with that basically when you paint

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.540 
issue with that basically when you paint
it<00:06:16.139> on<00:06:16.260> you<00:06:16.470> might<00:06:16.620> want<00:06:16.860> to<00:06:16.919> do<00:06:17.070> a<00:06:17.099> couple<00:06:17.370> of

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
it on you might want to do a couple of

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.120 
it on you might want to do a couple of
thin<00:06:17.820> layers<00:06:18.090> and<00:06:19.020> kind<00:06:19.320> of<00:06:19.410> build<00:06:19.650> up<00:06:19.830> so<00:06:20.099> that

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
thin layers and kind of build up so that

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.790 
thin layers and kind of build up so that
you<00:06:20.310> don't<00:06:20.460> have<00:06:20.669> the<00:06:20.910> issue<00:06:21.060> that<00:06:21.240> I<00:06:21.419> did<00:06:21.800> but

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
you don't have the issue that I did but

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.560 
you don't have the issue that I did but
as<00:06:22.889> you<00:06:23.039> can<00:06:23.160> see<00:06:23.220> it<00:06:23.729> filled<00:06:24.030> it<00:06:24.210> in<00:06:24.300> nicely

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
as you can see it filled it in nicely

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.810 
as you can see it filled it in nicely
you<00:06:25.260> can<00:06:25.410> barely<00:06:25.830> tell<00:06:26.070> that<00:06:26.130> those<00:06:26.430> are<00:06:26.669> there

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
you can barely tell that those are there

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.870 
you can barely tell that those are there
on<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:27.240> very<00:06:27.389> top<00:06:27.750> I<00:06:28.110> think<00:06:28.770> with<00:06:29.160> two<00:06:29.610> coats

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
on the very top I think with two coats
