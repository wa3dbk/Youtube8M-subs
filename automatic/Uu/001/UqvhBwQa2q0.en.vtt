00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
this wood here that's what I used to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.539 
this wood here that's what I used to
have<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.330> my<00:01:15.600> snake<00:01:16.500> enclosure<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.430> it's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
have in my snake enclosure and it's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.280 
have in my snake enclosure and it's
sanitary<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.270> about<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> year<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:18.900> because

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
sanitary for about a year now because

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.050 
sanitary for about a year now because
the<00:01:19.380> snakes<00:01:19.650> rate<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.220> too<00:01:20.400> big<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> now

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
so I thought the ferrets could make use

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.330 
so I thought the ferrets could make use
of<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:26.299> there's<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.770> lot<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> by<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.070> litter
