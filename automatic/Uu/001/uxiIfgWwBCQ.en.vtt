00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.479
 olano 

00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:06.060
 p I kept thinking something that I give to you school and not many and listened 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.449
 much your dreams of what you want to create 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.199
 and there is something very recurrent especially women 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.039
 That has to do with 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.960
 create a family marry and have children creates an incredible relationship and I 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.779
 I love it seems super good but like I kept thinking 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.489
 because it is such a recurring theme and because it seems something that in 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.489
 last one is not working then this video 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.739
 I think it's more for women 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.230
 in case that man also remains of him because at the moment he does not understand much 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 better what is happening with your woman 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.860
 after the decision it seems that it is costing them more work women 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.990
 I ask that you forgive me the culture 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.460
 percent and there's already a lot written about this but 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.040
 it seemed that culturally 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.450
 we have forced the woman to function in an increasingly masculine way 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.850
 increasingly more objective the directional 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.940
 it seems good that it pushes us to the woman to whom 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.360
 think like a man so that it works like a man so it would never work 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.350
 it's a job 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.010
 it has to be like man has to do pop titled his first to be 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.580
 someone objective who is not vulnerable in that he is not fickle but demands that 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.090
 it reached the goal 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.470
 Obviously that the birth of one way or another the relationships 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.420
 every time I have done and I have a woman 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.250
 percent but that extraordinary relationship remains 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.870
 I ask him but as the conditions were given he was healthy objective always 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.189
 is 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.689
 is that I imagined married that I always thought of myself 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.889
 with children being like this creating in this n 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.680
 and seldom dt roberto sensini 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.420
 so rarely do they talk to me about 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.340
 d 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.630
 comes someone who makes me fly percent like when we were teenagers 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.950
 like when we were little 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.580
 honestly what he started thinking 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.100
 is it seems that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.930
 we have pushed women to think such a way 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.550
 in which now 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 ten years objectively with respect to the relationship 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.550
 It seemed like it does not work, it's like they're all clear on what it is that 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.749
 They are looking for 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.439
 to create the relationship 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:12.410
 but not in 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.959
 who want to feel 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.129
 perhaps 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.209
 of with an example a stupid 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.800
 it seems that we are all capable of the net the cake that will be happy 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.330
 I wish we all wanted the cake that I want because it is complete but it is 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.149
 another topic we'll talk about that 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.549
 it seems that we are all with a cake and instead of just 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.130
 get carried away by that paper asked why s 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.700
 it looks like it's not the correct brown they went back to try and let's see what 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.469
 pass 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.639
 it does not seem that what they do is 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.319
 I know what I want then marriages showing I know where 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.730
 I want to arrive as men objectively 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.880
 and then it seems that on the plate 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.270
 so that on the set with the shape of the cake they are looking for that 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.869
 achieve trying the cake 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:00.169
 it seems that he is already on the set of how this guy should be like 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.179
 it should be the relationship it's about 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.090
 toned by the contract 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.779
 we look for a cake that is left to the pact 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:10.969
 and then what ended up running for me turns out to surpass rivals like 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.419
 if I go with my dish they look for a cake that fits 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.759
 ended up tasting the cakes that I like 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.759
 yes, not looking for a cake that is left on the plate 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.409
 women look if you have not been looking for the name kelly m 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.040
 the qualities of what you're looking for instead of just 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.309
 try out 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:34.469
 who you want to be with 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.489
 such is the gift if she 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.879
 stop looking for man that is exactly how your goals say 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:41.929
 what to do 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.910
 so that your voice of the married woman 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.910
 then with the relationship you want and so on 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.549
 and just come with a small piece of furniture 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.319
 with the wrong one with concrete among all teaching bodies they say it is 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.099
 dangerous that suffers this evil 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.099
 you pray with whom you have to be people dies at that moment 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.369
 reward for vulnerable December 31 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:09.859
 sensitive recovers everything is finished in which two people deliver everything 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:10.749
 efe 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.719
 if woman can not be an argument 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.659
 we are not looking for the goal 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.049
 but we are simply here in droughts at that time 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.620
 we will leave the correct in a few words 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.680
 let it rest on the cake 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.550
 that your plate is perfect 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.949
 and just try the pies until the scary is such that it seems that 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:29.620
 That's wrong 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.499
 the one that moves you the wrong fuck pasta from the environment 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.319
 and when you find a cake 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.740
 with which you have an incredible time 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.559
 with what fears that add the extraordinary 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:46.569
 with which you feel woman 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.059
 with a candÃ¡s a cake that you love and that I love you 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:51.870
 then there yes 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.809
 well a plate 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:57.059
 instead of having your plate look for a cake that fits 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:59.029
 soon the posts 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:02.169
 being a woman you do not objectively think 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.370
 without the wind will be given towers 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.089
 and when you find that its cost 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:08.659
 make your dish 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:10.650
 when you find that man 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.990
 that you did not expect 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.370
 that was not the one the base in the woman that you always imagined was going to be 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:21.169
 with 50 until that you are made ger 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.940
 that will make you feel like you always dreamed of feeling but as maybe 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:27.430
 you had never imagined that I could feel p 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.070
 with him he already feels his project of life that you want him to do 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.729
 instead of having the project 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.190
 and look for the man who merkel
