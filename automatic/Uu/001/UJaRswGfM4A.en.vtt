all right well here are some tomato
cuttings<00:00:05.839> over<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.870> week<00:00:07.049> old

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
cuttings over a week old

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.470 
cuttings over a week old
I<00:00:07.440> decided<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.429> do<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.580> little<00:00:08.790> experiment<00:00:09.150> to

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
I decided to do a little experiment to

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.509 
I decided to do a little experiment to
see<00:00:09.719> how<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.929> super<00:00:10.469> thrive<00:00:10.800> would<00:00:11.040> look<00:00:11.370> like

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
see how a super thrive would look like

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.980 
see how a super thrive would look like
the<00:00:11.670> routing<00:00:11.969> scene<00:00:12.389> as<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:12.780> kinda

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
the routing scene as I was kinda

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.599 
the routing scene as I was kinda
skeptical<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:15.680> here<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.100> results<00:00:17.490> us

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
skeptical and here is the results us

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.050 
skeptical and here is the results us
right

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
right

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.120 
right
these<00:00:18.750> ones<00:00:18.930> are<00:00:19.050> also<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> bit<00:00:19.500> smaller<00:00:19.890> these

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
these ones are also a bit smaller these

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.599 
these ones are also a bit smaller these
ones<00:00:20.369> are<00:00:20.609> tap<00:00:21.420> water<00:00:21.689> these<00:00:21.990> ones<00:00:22.580> have<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
ones are tap water these ones have a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.179 
ones are tap water these ones have a
quarter<00:00:24.000> teaspoon<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.930> SuperDrive<00:00:25.590> very

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
quarter teaspoon of a SuperDrive very

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.929 
quarter teaspoon of a SuperDrive very
gallant<00:00:27.529> these<00:00:28.529> are<00:00:28.680> also<00:00:28.800> smaller<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.609> that

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
gallant these are also smaller so that

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.569 
gallant these are also smaller so that
may<00:00:30.410> have<00:00:31.410> made<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.650> difference<00:00:32.070> probably<00:00:32.430> not

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
may have made a difference probably not

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.620 
may have made a difference probably not
but<00:00:33.390> yet<00:00:34.050> they<00:00:34.200> tend<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.469> account<00:00:35.420> here<00:00:36.420> are

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
but yet they tend to account here are

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.319 
but yet they tend to account here are
the<00:00:36.750> roots<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.110> these<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.790> ones<00:00:38.969> will<00:00:39.120> just

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
the roots on these the ones will just

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.299 
the roots on these the ones will just
tap<00:00:39.480> water<00:00:39.690> I'll<00:00:39.960> put<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.980> background

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
tap water I'll put it in the background

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.970 
tap water I'll put it in the background
sings<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.260> make<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> little<00:00:43.500> bit<00:00:43.649> more<00:00:43.770> clear

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
sings to make it a little bit more clear

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.160 
sings to make it a little bit more clear
hold<00:00:44.190> on

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.139 

so<00:00:50.860> you<00:00:50.920> can<00:00:51.220> see<00:00:51.399> there's<00:00:51.579> plenty<00:00:51.910> of<00:00:51.970> roots

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
so you can see there's plenty of roots

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.330 
so you can see there's plenty of roots
enough<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.110> plan<00:00:53.380> it<00:00:53.559> which<00:00:53.890> will<00:00:54.100> I'll

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
enough to plan it which will I'll

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.979 
enough to plan it which will I'll
probably<00:00:54.579> be<00:00:54.730> playing<00:00:54.879> in<00:00:55.149> just<00:00:55.329> a<00:00:55.510> few<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
probably be playing in just a few and

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.340 
probably be playing in just a few and
now<00:00:59.620> we'll<00:00:59.829> look<00:00:59.860> at<00:01:00.129> these<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:05.019> you<00:01:05.140> can

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
now we'll look at these and you can

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:25.290 
now we'll look at these and you can
clearly<00:01:05.710> see<00:01:05.920> there's<00:01:06.310> a<00:01:06.369> lot<00:01:06.729> more<00:01:24.300> here's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
clearly see there's a lot more here's

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:36.919 
clearly see there's a lot more here's
another<00:01:25.630> one<00:01:25.869> it's<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.110> bit<00:01:26.289> older<00:01:32.340> I'll<00:01:33.340> just

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:02:05.249 

here's<00:01:37.929> the<00:01:40.470> water<00:01:41.470> and<00:02:03.840> celebrating<00:02:04.840> depend

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
here's the water and celebrating depend

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:12.930 
here's the water and celebrating depend
on<00:02:10.620> clearly<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.739> can<00:02:11.950> move<00:02:12.130> without<00:02:12.280> hormones

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
on clearly you can move without hormones

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.000 
on clearly you can move without hormones
or<00:02:13.180> anything<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:13.750> as<00:02:13.900> easily<00:02:14.110> but<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.860> does

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
or anything just as easily but it does

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.360 
or anything just as easily but it does
speed<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.400> up<00:02:15.549> and<00:02:15.880> super<00:02:16.120> time
