00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
here the cockpit a bit tricky to open

here the cockpit a bit tricky to open
because<00:01:19.070> there's<00:01:19.190> nothing<00:01:19.399> really<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.729> grip

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
because there's nothing really to grip

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.999 
because there's nothing really to grip
onto<00:01:21.340> there<00:01:22.340> you<00:01:22.399> go<00:01:22.610> what's<00:01:23.000> that<00:01:23.119> one<00:01:23.210> there

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
onto there you go what's that one there

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.609 
onto there you go what's that one there

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
it holds two seats it has two seats to

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.400 
it holds two seats it has two seats to
hold<00:01:27.770> two<00:01:27.950> figures<00:01:28.899> sticky<00:01:29.899> goes<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.229> back

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
hold two figures sticky goes in back

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:37.889 
hold two figures sticky goes in back
there<00:01:32.770> up<00:01:33.770> here<00:01:34.009> you<00:01:34.130> got<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.340> bird's<00:01:34.550> nest

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.300 

which<00:01:38.899> pops<00:01:39.200> out<00:01:39.380> easily<00:01:41.560> one<00:01:42.560> figure<00:01:42.950> fits<00:01:43.160> in

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
which pops out easily one figure fits in

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.249 
which pops out easily one figure fits in
there<00:01:43.550> it<00:01:44.179> can<00:01:44.300> also<00:01:44.420> come<00:01:44.690> right<00:01:44.929> out<00:01:44.959> if<00:01:45.200> you

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
there it can also come right out if you

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.410 
there it can also come right out if you
want<00:01:45.410> to<00:01:45.470> stick<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.679> figure<00:01:45.920> in<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.360> think

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
want to stick the figure in so I think

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.770 
want to stick the figure in so I think
it<00:01:47.660> can<00:01:47.750> go<00:01:47.869> right<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.200> there<00:01:50.259> next<00:01:51.259> bit<00:01:52.780> it's

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
it can go right in there next bit it's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.669 
it can go right in there next bit it's
the<00:01:53.929> inside<00:01:54.289> cavity<00:01:54.560> bit<00:01:55.810> now<00:01:56.810> this<00:01:57.020> in<00:01:57.229> here<00:01:57.530> I

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
the inside cavity bit now this in here I

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.070 
the inside cavity bit now this in here I
don't<00:01:57.800> you<00:01:58.039> can<00:01:58.099> see<00:01:58.369> very<00:01:58.610> well<00:01:58.670> but<00:01:59.660> there<00:01:59.959> is

can probably store a couple figures in

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.910 
can probably store a couple figures in
there<00:02:57.840> quite<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.379> few<00:03:00.049> that<00:03:01.049> close<00:03:01.319> up<00:03:01.560> nice<00:03:01.739> and

there quite a few that close up nice and
easily<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:03.150> then<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.599> have<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:04.019> bit<00:03:04.200> here

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
easily and then we have this bit here

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.369 
easily and then we have this bit here

the top which rotates and looking inside
rotates<00:03:19.349> as<00:03:19.530> well<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:26.819> ship<00:03:27.030> itself<00:03:27.419> also

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
rotates as well the ship itself also

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.240 
rotates as well the ship itself also
moves<00:03:28.459> just<00:03:29.459> by<00:03:29.579> rolling<00:03:29.819> along<00:03:30.799> of<00:03:31.799> course<00:03:32.099> it

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
moves just by rolling along of course it

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.580 
moves just by rolling along of course it
is<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> client<00:03:32.669> over<00:03:32.879> to<00:03:32.970> make<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.180> has<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.480> roll

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.949
