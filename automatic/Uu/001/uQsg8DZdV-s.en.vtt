welcome<00:00:00.539> to<00:00:00.659> NCIX<00:00:01.140> tech<00:00:01.410> tips<00:00:01.620> there's<00:00:02.070> more

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
welcome to NCIX tech tips there's more

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.280 
welcome to NCIX tech tips there's more
to<00:00:02.490> choosing<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.939> monitor<00:00:03.300> than<00:00:03.480> just<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.959> size

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
to choosing a monitor than just the size

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.630 
to choosing a monitor than just the size
so<00:00:04.859> we're<00:00:04.980> going<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.130> be<00:00:05.250> talking<00:00:05.460> about

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
so we're going to be talking about

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.299 
so we're going to be talking about
resolution<00:00:06.540> as<00:00:06.660> well<00:00:07.200> as<00:00:07.319> pixel<00:00:07.740> density<00:00:08.130> and

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
resolution as well as pixel density and

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.190 
resolution as well as pixel density and
how<00:00:08.730> they<00:00:08.910> affect<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.330> way<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.750> image<00:00:10.050> is

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
how they affect the way the image is

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.810 
how they affect the way the image is
displayed<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.830> screen<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.370> terms<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.700> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
displayed on the screen in terms of the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.110 
displayed on the screen in terms of the
overall<00:00:11.969> sharpness<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.370> reduction<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.519> what

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
overall sharpness and reduction of what

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.740 
overall sharpness and reduction of what
are<00:00:15.210> called<00:00:15.260> jaggies<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.770> Knicks<00:00:20.660> see<00:00:21.660> us

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
are called jaggies the Knicks see us

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.210 
are called jaggies the Knicks see us
view<00:00:22.050> 27-inch<00:00:23.779> wqhd<00:00:24.779> or<00:00:25.260> whatever<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.010> yeah

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
view 27-inch wqhd or whatever it is yeah

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.029 
view 27-inch wqhd or whatever it is yeah

2560<00:00:29.039> by<00:00:29.310> 1440<00:00:30.090> monitor<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.230> it's<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.439> 27-inch

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
2560 by 1440 monitor so it's a 27-inch

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.970 
2560 by 1440 monitor so it's a 27-inch
but<00:00:32.700> what<00:00:32.850> sets<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.390> 27-inch<00:00:34.170> monitor<00:00:34.290> apart

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
but what sets this 27-inch monitor apart

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
but what sets this 27-inch monitor apart
from<00:00:35.190> others<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.090> sharpness<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.780> clarity

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
from others is the sharpness and clarity

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.590 
from others is the sharpness and clarity
of<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> image<00:00:38.010> because<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.730> pixels<00:00:39.090> are<00:00:39.360> much

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
of the image because the pixels are much

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.200 
of the image because the pixels are much
more<00:00:40.079> dense<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.800> also<00:00:40.980> has<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> wide<00:00:41.670> variety<00:00:41.879> of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
more dense it also has a wide variety of

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.610 
more dense it also has a wide variety of
features<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.809> comes<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> very<00:00:43.200> attractive

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
features and comes at a very attractive

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.369 
features and comes at a very attractive
price<00:00:44.190> point<00:00:44.520> because<00:00:44.989> manufacturing<00:00:45.989> panels

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
price point because manufacturing panels

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.440 
price point because manufacturing panels
with<00:00:46.530> higher<00:00:46.739> pixel<00:00:47.010> density<00:00:47.190> does<00:00:48.059> require

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
with higher pixel density does require

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.930 
with higher pixel density does require
more<00:00:48.920> manufacturing<00:00:49.920> precision<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.730> is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
more manufacturing precision and it is

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.910 
more manufacturing precision and it is
more<00:00:51.180> difficult<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.199> got<00:00:52.350> height<00:00:52.590> adjust

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
more difficult so it's got height adjust

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.250 
more difficult so it's got height adjust
tilt<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.910> has<00:00:54.480> pivot<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.079> also<00:00:55.980> actually<00:00:56.250> has

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
tilt it has pivot and also actually has

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.189 
tilt it has pivot and also actually has
there<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> go<00:00:58.500> full<00:00:58.859> rotation<00:00:59.390> HDMI<00:01:00.390> IN<00:01:00.600> DVI

this NCIX tech tips to let you know how
it<00:01:25.380> goes<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.400> games<00:01:26.670> having<00:01:27.150> higher

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
it goes because for games having higher

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.800 
it goes because for games having higher
pixel<00:01:27.600> density<00:01:27.979> reduces<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> need<00:01:29.400> for

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
pixel density reduces the need for

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.149 
pixel density reduces the need for
anti-aliasing<00:01:30.810> technology<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.770> make<00:01:31.920> lines

you<00:03:41.550> probably<00:03:41.790> saw<00:03:41.970> this<00:03:42.090> before<00:03:42.300> but<00:03:42.570> we<00:03:42.720> had

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
you probably saw this before but we had

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.080 
you probably saw this before but we had
two<00:03:43.110> documents<00:03:43.650> side<00:03:43.830> by<00:03:43.860> side<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.550> allows<00:03:44.970> you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
two documents side by side it allows you

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.150 
two documents side by side it allows you
to<00:03:45.180> easily<00:03:45.330> cross<00:03:45.750> reference<00:03:46.230> without<00:03:46.769> using

to easily cross reference without using

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.310 
to easily cross reference without using
multi<00:03:47.459> monitors<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.630> text<00:03:48.959> is<00:03:49.080> still

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
multi monitors and the text is still

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.170 
multi monitors and the text is still
readable<00:03:49.620> with<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.250> trade-off<00:03:50.670> being<00:03:50.940> that

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
readable with the trade-off being that

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.590 
readable with the trade-off being that
as<00:03:51.390> text<00:03:51.900> does<00:03:52.230> get<00:03:52.530> smaller<00:03:53.100> people<00:03:54.030> with<00:03:54.420> who

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
as text does get smaller people with who

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.750 
as text does get smaller people with who
use<00:03:54.750> glasses<00:03:55.260> or<00:03:55.470> have<00:03:55.709> poor<00:03:55.980> eyesight<00:03:56.010> might

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
use glasses or have poor eyesight might

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.979 
use glasses or have poor eyesight might
have<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:56.940> little<00:03:57.180> bit<00:03:57.269> more<00:03:57.420> trouble<00:03:57.630> so<00:03:57.840> that's

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
have a little bit more trouble so that's

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.449 
have a little bit more trouble so that's
where<00:03:58.200> increasing<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.709> size<00:03:58.920> helps<00:03:59.250> as<00:03:59.430> well

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
where increasing the size helps as well

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.360 
where increasing the size helps as well
with<00:04:00.150> gaming<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.840> just<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.680> mean<00:04:01.860> honestly

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
with gaming it just I mean honestly

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.100 
with gaming it just I mean honestly
gaming<00:04:02.730> on<00:04:02.820> a<00:04:02.850> large<00:04:03.120> format<00:04:03.540> monitor<00:04:03.959> is

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
gaming on a large format monitor is

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.880 
gaming on a large format monitor is
great<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:04.950> if<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.220> pixels<00:04:05.580> are<00:04:05.700> huge<00:04:05.730> then<00:04:06.510> it

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
great but if the pixels are huge then it

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.470 
great but if the pixels are huge then it
it<00:04:07.890> can<00:04:08.250> detract<00:04:08.550> from<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.940> experience<00:04:09.420> I

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
it can detract from the experience I

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.660 
it can detract from the experience I
mean<00:04:09.570> if<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:09.750> were<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.930> game<00:04:10.110> on<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.380> TV<00:04:10.830> that's

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
mean if you were to game on a TV that's

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.600 
mean if you were to game on a TV that's
42<00:04:12.090> inches<00:04:12.540> big<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.860> right<00:04:14.190> in<00:04:14.310> front<00:04:14.340> of

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
42 inches big and is right in front of

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.430 
42 inches big and is right in front of
you<00:04:14.730> like<00:04:14.910> at<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.090> desktop<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.810> wouldn't<00:04:16.380> be

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
you like at a desktop it wouldn't be

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.630 
you like at a desktop it wouldn't be
that<00:04:16.620> great<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:16.890> an<00:04:16.980> experience<00:04:17.040> because<00:04:17.549> you

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
that great of an experience because you

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.780 
that great of an experience because you
can<00:04:17.760> actually<00:04:18.000> see<00:04:18.570> black<00:04:19.410> squares<00:04:19.980> around

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
can actually see black squares around

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.490 
can actually see black squares around
each<00:04:21.000> individual<00:04:21.630> pixel<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.109> doesn't<00:04:22.380> look

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
each individual pixel it doesn't look

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.779 
each individual pixel it doesn't look
that<00:04:22.530> great<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.100> having<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.610> high

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789
