so<00:00:08.780> let's<00:00:08.960> start<00:00:09.200> with<00:00:09.350> some<00:00:09.560> basic<00:00:09.980> shoe

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
so let's start with some basic shoe

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.610 
so let's start with some basic shoe
Anatomy<00:00:10.670> what<00:00:11.540> I'm<00:00:11.660> pointing<00:00:11.870> out<00:00:12.170> here<00:00:12.469> is<00:00:12.590> a

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
Anatomy what I'm pointing out here is a

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.879 
Anatomy what I'm pointing out here is a
heel<00:00:13.040> counter<00:00:13.280> of<00:00:13.639> this<00:00:13.850> particular<00:00:14.090> shoe

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
heel counter of this particular shoe

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.130 
heel counter of this particular shoe
next<00:00:15.889> I'm<00:00:16.070> indicating<00:00:16.820> where<00:00:17.210> a<00:00:17.240> gel<00:00:17.660> pocket

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
next I'm indicating where a gel pocket

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.190 
next I'm indicating where a gel pocket
exists<00:00:18.590> it's<00:00:18.710> sort<00:00:18.890> of<00:00:18.980> tough<00:00:19.220> to<00:00:19.400> see<00:00:20.080> from<00:00:21.080> a

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
exists it's sort of tough to see from a

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.990 
exists it's sort of tough to see from a
lateral<00:00:21.710> view<00:00:21.920> or<00:00:22.160> if<00:00:22.310> we<00:00:22.430> spin<00:00:22.699> the<00:00:22.730> shoe

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
lateral view or if we spin the shoe

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.750 
lateral view or if we spin the shoe
sideways<00:00:23.600> you<00:00:24.260> can<00:00:24.500> see<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:24.920> upper<00:00:25.460> of<00:00:25.700> the

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
sideways you can see the upper of the

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.950 
sideways you can see the upper of the
shoe<00:00:27.160> next<00:00:28.160> we'll<00:00:28.340> move<00:00:28.460> on<00:00:28.700> to<00:00:29.030> the<00:00:29.390> midsole

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
shoe next we'll move on to the midsole

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.369 
shoe next we'll move on to the midsole
which<00:00:30.350> is<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:30.740> white<00:00:31.010> layer<00:00:31.310> and<00:00:32.140> lastly<00:00:33.140> the

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
which is the white layer and lastly the

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:40.400 
which is the white layer and lastly the
outer<00:00:33.590> sole<00:00:34.070> of<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.309> shoe

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.689 

simple<00:00:41.410> starting<00:00:41.859> point<00:00:42.100> when<00:00:42.250> it<00:00:42.340> comes<00:00:42.550> to

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
simple starting point when it comes to

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.340 
simple starting point when it comes to
screening<00:00:43.090> for<00:00:43.269> premature<00:00:43.660> wear<00:00:44.079> of<00:00:44.109> your

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
screening for premature wear of your

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.529 
screening for premature wear of your
running<00:00:44.680> shoes<00:00:44.710> is<00:00:45.160> to<00:00:45.699> simply<00:00:46.059> determine

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
running shoes is to simply determine

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.840 
running shoes is to simply determine
whether<00:00:46.719> or<00:00:46.809> not<00:00:46.960> they're<00:00:47.199> glued<00:00:47.469> properly<00:00:48.070> so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
whether or not they're glued properly so

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.180 
whether or not they're glued properly so
in<00:00:48.969> this<00:00:49.059> particular<00:00:49.300> case<00:00:49.899> you<00:00:50.230> can<00:00:50.800> see<00:00:51.159> that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
in this particular case you can see that

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.430 
in this particular case you can see that
there's<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.550> pulling<00:00:51.909> away<00:00:52.059> of<00:00:52.449> the<00:00:52.480> outer<00:00:52.930> sole

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
there's a pulling away of the outer sole

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.219 
there's a pulling away of the outer sole
from<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.100> midsole<00:00:54.519> so<00:00:55.300> this<00:00:55.480> is<00:00:55.659> no<00:00:55.809> longer<00:00:56.079> a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
from the midsole so this is no longer a

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:02.750 
from the midsole so this is no longer a
viable<00:00:56.500> training<00:00:57.129> shoe

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.130 

so<00:01:03.760> when<00:01:03.940> it<00:01:04.060> comes<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.420> assessing<00:01:04.900> for

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
so when it comes to assessing for

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.590 
so when it comes to assessing for
symmetry<00:01:05.530> of<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.830> shoe<00:01:06.160> what<00:01:07.030> you<00:01:07.150> need<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.360> do

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
symmetry of the shoe what you need to do

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.780 
symmetry of the shoe what you need to do
is<00:01:07.630> start<00:01:08.050> by<00:01:08.260> resting<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.890> shoe<00:01:09.160> on<00:01:09.370> a<00:01:09.460> level

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
is start by resting the shoe on a level

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.240 
is start by resting the shoe on a level
platform<00:01:10.570> inside<00:01:11.200> it<00:01:11.380> from<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.800> posterior

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
platform inside it from the posterior

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.600 
platform inside it from the posterior
aspect<00:01:12.910> or<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.270> rear<00:01:13.450> view<00:01:13.780> I<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.280> simple

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
aspect or the rear view I have a simple

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.000 
aspect or the rear view I have a simple
goniometer<00:01:16.600> which<00:01:16.750> is<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:16.960> majoring<00:01:17.500> stiff<00:01:17.800> it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
goniometer which is a majoring stiff it

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.850 
goniometer which is a majoring stiff it
gives<00:01:18.220> us<00:01:18.370> angular<00:01:18.880> degrees<00:01:19.300> to<00:01:20.080> truly<00:01:20.470> assess

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
gives us angular degrees to truly assess

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.620 
gives us angular degrees to truly assess
for<00:01:20.890> whether<00:01:21.310> or<00:01:21.460> not<00:01:21.550> this<00:01:21.760> shoe<00:01:22.000> is<00:01:22.030> resting

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
for whether or not this shoe is resting

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.320 
for whether or not this shoe is resting
level<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:24.370> want<00:01:24.550> to<00:01:24.640> make<00:01:24.670> sure<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:25.210> the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
level so you want to make sure that the

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.750 
level so you want to make sure that the
heel<00:01:25.630> counter<00:01:25.900> is<00:01:26.320> resting<00:01:27.040> level<00:01:27.430> on<00:01:27.640> the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
heel counter is resting level on the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.510 
heel counter is resting level on the

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
sole of the platform of the shoe a lot

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.070 
sole of the platform of the shoe a lot
of<00:01:30.550> times<00:01:30.850> what<00:01:31.060> you'll<00:01:31.240> notice<00:01:31.420> is<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.840> shoes

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
of times what you'll notice is the shoes

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.560 
of times what you'll notice is the shoes
either<00:01:32.320> canted<00:01:32.980> inward<00:01:33.430> or<00:01:33.670> outward<00:01:33.790> in

either canted inward or outward in

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.120 
either canted inward or outward in
either<00:01:35.200> case<00:01:35.590> it's<00:01:35.920> problematic

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.700 

to<00:01:42.119> assess<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.509> stability<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.469> shoe

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
to assess for stability of the shoe

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.469 
to assess for stability of the shoe
again<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.460> want<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.670> place<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> firm

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
again you want to place it on a firm

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.779 
again you want to place it on a firm
level<00:01:45.780> surface<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:47.310> want<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.549> rock<00:01:47.759> it
