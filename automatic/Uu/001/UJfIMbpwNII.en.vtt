you<00:03:32.610> ever<00:03:32.730> read<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:32.970> one<00:03:33.090> about<00:03:33.120> white<00:03:33.450> snake

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
you ever read the one about white snake

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.420 
you ever read the one about white snake
was<00:03:33.960> supposed<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.260> be<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.380> vampire<00:03:34.770> because

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
was supposed to be a vampire because

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.490 
was supposed to be a vampire because
there's<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.730> lot<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.030> snake<00:03:36.690> vampire<00:03:37.140> evidence

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
there's a lot of snake vampire evidence

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.740 
there's a lot of snake vampire evidence
and<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.770> think<00:03:38.040> because<00:03:38.300> Twilight<00:03:39.300> came<00:03:39.540> out

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
and I think because Twilight came out

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.720 
and I think because Twilight came out
before<00:03:39.990> the<00:03:40.380> last<00:03:40.590> book<00:03:40.860> but<00:03:41.040> there<00:03:41.310> was<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.490> lot
