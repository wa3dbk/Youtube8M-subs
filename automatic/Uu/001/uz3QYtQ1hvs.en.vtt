00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
definitely has a lot more driver aids

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.950 
definitely has a lot more driver aids
and<00:00:58.640> other<00:00:58.909> vehicles<00:00:59.390> I've<00:00:59.510> driven<00:00:59.690> it's

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
and other vehicles I've driven it's

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.719 
and other vehicles I've driven it's
actually<00:01:00.140> morally<00:01:00.649> built<00:01:01.159> more<00:01:01.339> for<00:01:01.399> road

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
actually morally built more for road

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.840 
actually morally built more for road
courses<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:02.769> you<00:01:03.769> know<00:01:03.860> twisty<00:01:04.339> roads<00:01:04.580> and

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
courses and you know twisty roads and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.490 
courses and you know twisty roads and
that<00:01:04.940> sort<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.239> driving<00:01:05.630> but<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:06.289> know<00:01:06.380> I've

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
that sort of driving but you know I've

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.779 
that sort of driving but you know I've
got<00:01:06.619> heated<00:01:06.830> seats<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:07.399> I<00:01:07.430> think<00:01:07.549> I'd<00:01:07.729> be

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
got heated seats so I think I'd be

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.130 
got heated seats so I think I'd be
probably<00:01:08.000> more<00:01:08.119> comfortable<00:01:08.509> than<00:01:08.630> them<00:01:08.810> so

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
probably more comfortable than them so

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.139 
probably more comfortable than them so
we'll<00:01:09.530> see<00:01:09.710> if<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:09.830> plays<00:01:10.220> into<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:10.549> at<00:01:10.700> all<00:01:10.820> I

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
we'll see if that plays into it at all I

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.730 
we'll see if that plays into it at all I
wouldn't<00:01:11.750> say<00:01:11.869> I<00:01:11.930> have<00:01:12.080> some<00:01:12.259> street<00:01:12.560> drag
