00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.309
 Hello, today I want to introduce you 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.759
 overview of the gaming keyboard from the company 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.699
 roccat 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.869
 q-fix model is a membrane 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.310
 backlit keyboard 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.250
 its average price at the moment 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.140
 amounts to 4500 rubles fx suit 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.849
 comes in a big black box on 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.289
 which bright inscriptions highlighted 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.689
 key features and benefits 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.640
 This keyboard because of the large 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.380
 the number of additional keys that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.360
 designed to record macros 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.940
 keyboard is positioned as a model 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.800
 for emo games but nonetheless it is not 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.710
 means that you can only play on it 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.510
 such games on the back of the box already 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.670
 painted in more detail and all the main 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.860
 features and specifications 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.530
 data models as well as in more detail 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.850
 painted software 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.920
 which incidentally is necessary 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.840
 Download manufacturerâ€™s site separately 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.899
 well now let's see what 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.489
 located inside besides the keyboard itself 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.960
 in the box you can also find such 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.479
 colorful color booklet 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.310
 which are once again painted all the main 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.060
 characteristics and advantages of this 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.220
 keyboard 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.110
 since i already said this is gaming 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.110
 backlit membrane keyboard 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.520
 the main difference between a fx suit and a regular suit 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.920
 is to highlight 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.479
 if on the youngest model the usual suit 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.210
 you can be content with only one color 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.100
 blue backlight then on the eldest 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.110
 fx suit models can be customized under 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.119
 any taste here by the way the level of brightness 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.740
 backlight also adjusts with a separate 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.049
 The keyboard has six levels 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.939
 backlight and not so much on the very 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.189
 at the maximum level she was too 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.170
 bright but maybe it's better because 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.329
 the keyboard will no longer be so distracting 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.220
 you from the gameplay and again 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.689
 The disadvantage of this keyboard is 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.540
 is that it has a glossy 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.100
 surface if out of the box it looks 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.960
 wonderful because in her she was 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.729
 protected by special stickers on these 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.409
 areas but with everyday 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.290
 using I think it will bring some 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.340
 discomfort since every day 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.850
 will need to be cleaned from prints 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.590
 fingers of minor scratches and dust though 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.090
 such an execution option is definitely 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.610
 there is a mass of fans 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.380
 buttons have an average move and more like 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.270
 on the laptop rather than the usual 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.020
 keyboard keys which we are all so 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.180
 accustomed to 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.980
 but so no less print on not very 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.800
 comfortable and pleasant and also important for 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.200
 gaming this keyboard has a long key 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.420
 shift because the keyboard has 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.400
 I use now this key is short and 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.030
 This adds a lot of inconvenience to the game. 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.310
 process 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.110
 top of the keyboard is located 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.810
 multimedia keys which are also 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.280
 are configured and also highlighted with 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.900
 the left side is located 5 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.330
 special keys for assignment 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.520
 macros all keys have this 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.380
 rough finish so print on not 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.050
 very comfortable as already said fingers not 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.190
 slide and generally carefully fixed 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.800
 on each key 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.690
 the bottom row of the keyboard is located in 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.610
 3 special switch buttons 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.410
 default buttons t1 and t3 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.989
 designed to switch between 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.540
 profiles and button t2 designed 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.130
 to call a special software keyboard 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.260
 from the store is equipped with a special 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.450
 palm rest made of rough 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.340
 matte plastic which of course is 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.410
 undoubted advantage because during 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.000
 lengthy online battles your hands do not 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.700
 will slide on the keyboard 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.500
 non-removable stand that of course can 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.540
 be for someone a minus but for 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.940
 me this is only a plus because there 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.130
 nothing creaks no backlash and in general 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.890
 I used to play it with a stand under 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.750
 wrist as you see all the keys 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.209
 well highlighted and how 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.100
 English characters and Russian so 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.140
 There is no clear uniform illumination. 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.480
 you will meet even with more expensive analogs 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.610
 where english characters are highlighted 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.769
 passed Russian well, not that straight 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.870
 perfect top keyboard area 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.190
 is a luminous indicator a 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.920
 selected profile 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.989
 switching between them buttons t1 and t3 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.989
 accompanied by steep for the right signal 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.440
 backlight on the keyboard as much as possible 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.440
 customized besides the highlight color 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.750
 You can also select and or 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.720
 from except the usual constant glow 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.820
 you can choose for example the pulsation mode 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.250
 or whatever it is called breathing mode 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.170
 By the way, in order to write 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.630
 macro and not necessarily leave the game 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.060
 by pressing the special key rick that 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.320
 there is a record you can record macros 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.360
 right during the game 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.430
 since the keyboard is gaming she 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.770
 supports up to 12 simultaneous keystrokes 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.810
 even though it is true volume 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.060
 it's mechanical on the back 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.460
 The keypad is 5 rubber not 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.380
 slide zones and 2 rubberized midges 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.780
 it gives her good stability 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.300
 even on the most sliding table when 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.010
 intense battles native software 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.470
 The keyboards are very functional and 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.330
 allows you to customize it from and year here 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.470
 there are several tabs on the first 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.780
 main control tab 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.510
 you can customize fn and 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.600
 key t i have switching keys 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.210
 tab modes and season control you 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.190
 can customize buttons go shift zones 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.850
 on this tab you can customize 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.230
 media keys and f-ki 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.030
 on tab 2 article control here 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.760
 accordingly setting the backlight and 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.200
 other keyboard chips check the church 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.120
 as I said before you can choose 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.550
 any either on this line or already from 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.230
 existing presets are also here you 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.330
 can choose backlight mode either 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.940
 one color glow or glow 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.460
 alternately several colors glow 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.860
 constantly this glow as I said 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.580
 breathable i.e. throbbing 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.770
 backlight 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.960
 the same slider can adjust it 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.880
 brightness in the end we have good 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.340
 keyboard with excellent ergonomics and 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.130
 high level of customization as if 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.750
 backlight or appointment mattress keys with 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.180
 excellent workmanship and 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.590
 having done well this keyboard 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.740
 yet there is only one 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.910
 significant disadvantage is her price which 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.950
 at the time of this writing 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.289
 averaged 4 and a half 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.789
 thousand rubles but as we know for external 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.580
 functional beauty as well as for 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.139
 quality you have to pay thanks to all 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.210
