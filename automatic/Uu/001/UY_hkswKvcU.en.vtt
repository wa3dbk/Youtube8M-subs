00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:06.110 

so<00:00:03.989> I'm<00:00:04.050> working<00:00:04.230> on<00:00:04.500> my<00:00:04.649> mom's<00:00:04.859> car<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.550> on

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
so I'm working on my mom's car and on

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.790 
so I'm working on my mom's car and on
her<00:00:06.300> car<00:00:06.540> when<00:00:06.840> you<00:00:06.930> go<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.170> put<00:00:07.380> the<00:00:07.470> windows

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:07.800 
her car when you go to put the windows

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.540 
her car when you go to put the windows
up<00:00:07.950> or<00:00:08.160> down

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
up or down

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.670 
up or down
she's<00:00:09.000> got<00:00:09.090> tape<00:00:09.389> over<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.900> passenger<00:00:10.440> side

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680 
she's got tape over the passenger side

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.990 
she's got tape over the passenger side
window<00:00:10.890> because<00:00:11.220> whenever<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.640> push<00:00:11.850> the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
window because whenever you push the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.690 
window because whenever you push the
switch<00:00:12.150> or<00:00:12.480> even<00:00:12.660> bump<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.769> causes<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
switch or even bump it it causes the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.519 
switch or even bump it it causes the
passenger<00:00:15.269> window<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.630> go<00:00:15.780> down<00:00:16.019> as<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.289> see

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
passenger window to go down as you see

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.439 
passenger window to go down as you see
here<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.849> so<00:00:19.550> basically<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.909> has<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.269> do<00:00:21.419> with

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
here and so basically it has to do with

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.509 
here and so basically it has to do with
the<00:00:21.869> module<00:00:22.529> because<00:00:22.829> everything's<00:00:23.249> run

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
the module because everything's run

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.950 
the module because everything's run
through<00:00:23.759> here<00:00:23.909> like<00:00:24.029> how<00:00:24.179> many<00:00:24.269> pins<00:00:24.659> are<00:00:24.929> on

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
through here like how many pins are on

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.550 
through here like how many pins are on
this<00:00:25.199> connector<00:00:25.679> it's<00:00:26.460> out<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.699> control

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
this connector it's out of control

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.839 
this connector it's out of control
anyway<00:00:28.560> there's<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.829> whole<00:00:29.039> little<00:00:29.369> computer

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
anyway there's a whole little computer

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.089 
anyway there's a whole little computer
circuit<00:00:30.300> setup<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.140> goes<00:00:31.319> inside<00:00:31.739> of<00:00:31.919> there

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
circuit setup that goes inside of there

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.290 
circuit setup that goes inside of there
and<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.079> as<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:34.500> look<00:00:34.530> at<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.039> over<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
and so as we look at it over here the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.150 
and so as we look at it over here the
way<00:00:36.449> that<00:00:36.629> this<00:00:36.780> switch<00:00:37.019> works<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.769> it<00:00:37.949> just

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
way that this switch works is it just

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.009 
way that this switch works is it just
has<00:00:38.309> little<00:00:38.670> pads<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.510> when<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.870> look

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
has little pads on it like when you look

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.369 
has little pads on it like when you look
at<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> calculator<00:00:41.010> or<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.910> lot<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.989> other<00:00:43.079> things

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
at a calculator or a lot of other things

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.840 
at a calculator or a lot of other things
that<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.620> take<00:00:43.800> apart<00:00:43.949> that<00:00:44.340> look<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.640> that

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that you take apart that look like that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.229 
that you take apart that look like that
and<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.929> the<00:00:46.079> window<00:00:46.410> switch<00:00:47.239> corresponds

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
and so the window switch corresponds

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.560 
and so the window switch corresponds
with<00:00:48.989> these<00:00:49.230> little<00:00:49.500> pads<00:00:49.800> here<00:00:50.339> you<00:00:51.269> can<00:00:51.390> see

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
with these little pads here you can see

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.810 
with these little pads here you can see
there<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.199> then<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.370> say<00:00:53.519> you've<00:00:53.670> got<00:00:53.789> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
there and then like I say you've got a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.660 
there and then like I say you've got a
bajillion<00:00:54.210> pin<00:00:54.690> connector<00:00:55.289> with<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.399> tons

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
bajillion pin connector with just tons

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.540 
bajillion pin connector with just tons
of<00:00:56.940> opportunity<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.079> failure<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.399> we're

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
of opportunity for failure so what we're

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.649 
of opportunity for failure so what we're
going<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> do<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.030> we're<00:01:00.149> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> go<00:01:00.449> through

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
going to do is we're going to go through

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.299 
going to do is we're going to go through
and<00:01:00.780> retouch<00:01:01.109> those<00:01:01.350> little<00:01:01.589> solder<00:01:01.800> joints

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
and retouch those little solder joints

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.700 
and retouch those little solder joints
so<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.909> got<00:01:03.059> my<00:01:03.210> soldering<00:01:03.629> iron<00:01:03.659> all<00:01:04.110> fired<00:01:04.409> up

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
so I got my soldering iron all fired up

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.440 
so I got my soldering iron all fired up
it<00:01:05.070> looks<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.370> it's<00:01:05.640> hot<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.000> ready<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> go

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
it looks like it's hot and ready to go

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.110 
it looks like it's hot and ready to go
and<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.920> we'll<00:01:08.040> go<00:01:08.160> through<00:01:08.190> this<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.030> if

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
and so we'll go through this and see if

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.550 
and so we'll go through this and see if
we<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.420> come<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> deal<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
we can come up with what the deal is I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.080 
we can come up with what the deal is I
don't<00:01:10.620> see<00:01:10.800> any<00:01:11.070> burn<00:01:11.310> marks<00:01:11.730> or<00:01:11.880> anything

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
don't see any burn marks or anything

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.430 
don't see any burn marks or anything
it's<00:01:12.810> probably<00:01:12.870> just<00:01:13.260> something

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
it's probably just something

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.740 
it's probably just something
intermittent<00:01:14.210> anytime<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.330> send<00:01:15.510> a<00:01:15.600> signal

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
intermittent anytime you send a signal

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.870 
intermittent anytime you send a signal
into<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.320> thing<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.890> freaks<00:01:17.250> out<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.580> just

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
into this thing it freaks out and just

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.610 
into this thing it freaks out and just
puts<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> window<00:01:18.540> down<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.350> we're<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
puts the window down so we're going to

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.320 
puts the window down so we're going to
try<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.370> if<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.520> doesn't<00:01:20.880> work<00:01:21.120> then

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
try that and if that doesn't work then

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.510 
try that and if that doesn't work then
we<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.750> replace<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.620> first<00:01:23.310> thing

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
we have to replace it but first thing

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.430 
we have to replace it but first thing
you<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.910> do<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.570> go<00:01:25.050> through<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.380> just

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
you want to do is go through and just

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.930 
you want to do is go through and just
make<00:01:25.680> sure<00:01:25.710> all<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:26.100> solder<00:01:26.370> joints<00:01:26.820> are

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
make sure all your solder joints are

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.670 
make sure all your solder joints are
good<00:01:27.120> especially<00:01:27.840> something<00:01:28.230> like<00:01:28.380> this

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
good especially something like this

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.140 
good especially something like this
where<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:28.980> gets<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.220> bunch<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.520> stress<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
where it gets a bunch of stress and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.500 
where it gets a bunch of stress and
switches<00:01:30.600> right<00:01:30.810> next<00:01:31.260> to<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.360> like

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
switches right next to you know like

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.910 
switches right next to you know like
where<00:01:33.690> it's<00:01:33.810> being<00:01:33.960> pressed<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.770> right

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
where it's being pressed on is right

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.860 
where it's being pressed on is right
next<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.550> it<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.820> flex<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.270> board<00:01:36.510> and

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
next to here it can flex the board and

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.130 
next to here it can flex the board and
create<00:01:37.440> all<00:01:37.560> kinds<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.950> havoc<00:01:38.160> so<00:01:39.020> what<00:01:40.020> I'll

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
create all kinds of havoc so what I'll

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.200 
create all kinds of havoc so what I'll
do<00:01:40.320> I'll<00:01:40.620> film<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.250> couple<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.730> these<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.120> then

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
do I'll film a couple of these and then

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
do I'll film a couple of these and then
I'll<00:01:42.330> get<00:01:42.450> off<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.840> camera<00:01:43.230> and<00:01:43.290> do<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> good

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
I'll get off the camera and do a good

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.780 
I'll get off the camera and do a good
job<00:01:44.060> but<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.480> just<00:01:45.660> touch<00:01:45.930> them<00:01:46.080> like<00:01:46.260> this

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
job but you just touch them like this

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.430 
job but you just touch them like this
heat<00:01:47.790> them<00:01:47.910> up<00:01:48.030> till<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.630> solder<00:01:48.900> go<00:01:49.110> shiny

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
heat them up till the solder go shiny

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.520 
heat them up till the solder go shiny
and<00:01:50.010> then<00:01:50.190> just<00:01:50.400> slide<00:01:50.730> it<00:01:50.910> up<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.060> pin<00:01:53.330> Shoni

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
and then just slide it up the pin Shoni

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.060 
and then just slide it up the pin Shoni
come<00:01:55.530> get<00:01:55.680> shiny<00:01:55.980> on<00:01:56.160> my<00:01:56.280> knife<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:58.070> so

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
come get shiny on my knife it's a so

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.170 
come get shiny on my knife it's a so
anyway<00:01:59.430> that's<00:01:59.850> all<00:02:00.000> we're<00:02:00.150> doing<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:02.180> what

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
anyway that's all we're doing is what

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.850 
anyway that's all we're doing is what
happens<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.750> over<00:02:03.780> time<00:02:04.260> because<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.620> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
happens is over time because of the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.160 
happens is over time because of the
stress<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.550> flexing<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.810> kind<00:02:07.110> of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
stress and the flexing you get kind of

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.229 
stress and the flexing you get kind of
like<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.380> bull's-eye<00:02:08.310> break<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.940> know<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.209> a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
like a bull's-eye break you know like a

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.730 
like a bull's-eye break you know like a
little<00:02:09.360> circular<00:02:09.690> break<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.379> only<00:02:10.500> makes

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
little circular break that only makes

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.380 
little circular break that only makes
partial<00:02:11.160> contact<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.880> can<00:02:12.000> create<00:02:12.120> all<00:02:12.360> kinds

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
partial contact and can create all kinds

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.410 
partial contact and can create all kinds
of<00:02:12.720> havoc<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:13.500> almost<00:02:13.770> always<00:02:14.270> where<00:02:15.270> you've

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
of havoc it's almost always where you've

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.370 
of havoc it's almost always where you've
got<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.660> pin<00:02:15.930> connect

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
got a pin connect

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.020 
got a pin connect
you're<00:02:16.500> going<00:02:16.740> into<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.070> green<00:02:17.340> board<00:02:17.700> that's

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
you're going into a green board that's

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.930 
you're going into a green board that's
usually<00:02:18.450> where<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.750> happens<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:20.070> anyway<00:02:20.700> wish

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
usually where it happens so anyway wish

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.720 
usually where it happens so anyway wish
me<00:02:21.090> luck

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
me luck

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.070 
me luck
so<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.820> can<00:02:23.910> see<00:02:24.060> I've<00:02:24.240> got<00:02:24.420> just<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.810> green

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
so you can see I've got just a green

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.600 
so you can see I've got just a green
board<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.500> haven't<00:02:25.770> put<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.070> whole<00:02:26.190> thing<00:02:26.460> all

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
board I haven't put the whole thing all

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.820 
board I haven't put the whole thing all
that<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.970> haven't<00:02:27.480> put<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.080> whole<00:02:28.260> thing<00:02:28.500> back

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
heart she tried so hard with me anyway I

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.500 
heart she tried so hard with me anyway I
go<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.500> put<00:02:37.710> this<00:02:37.860> on<00:02:38.070> there<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.580> this<00:02:39.300> just

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
go to put this on there and this just

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.870 
go to put this on there and this just
has<00:02:39.690> those<00:02:39.870> little<00:02:39.960> pads<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.800> complete<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
has those little pads that complete the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.510 
has those little pads that complete the
circuit<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.750> all<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.110> conductive<00:02:43.710> so<00:02:44.370> when

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
circuit and all that conductive so when

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.190 
circuit and all that conductive so when
you<00:02:44.610> hit<00:02:44.760> down<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.240> have<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.630> hit<00:02:45.750> both<00:02:45.960> of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
you hit down you have to hit both of

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.810 
you hit down you have to hit both of
them<00:02:46.500> when<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.680> hit<00:02:46.800> up<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.160> have<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.340> both<00:02:47.610> of

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
them when you hit up you have to both of

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.150 
them when you hit up you have to both of
them<00:02:47.970> see<00:02:48.930> which<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.320> which<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.710> is<00:02:49.920> down

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
them see which is which this is down

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.850 
them see which is which this is down
this<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.730> up<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.290> can<00:02:52.350> see<00:02:52.440> I've<00:02:52.710> got

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
this is up so as you can see I've got

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.040 
this is up so as you can see I've got
the<00:02:53.040> window<00:02:53.430> up<00:02:53.640> maybe<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.660> see<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:54.960> the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
the window up maybe you can see in the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.170 
the window up maybe you can see in the
frame<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.410> can't<00:02:55.650> tell<00:02:55.860> from<00:02:56.040> here<00:02:56.340> but<00:02:57.000> it's

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
frame I can't tell from here but it's

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.820 
frame I can't tell from here but it's
working<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.660> lot<00:02:57.810> better<00:02:58.140> now<00:02:58.470> than<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.710> was

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
working a lot better now than it was

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.220 
working a lot better now than it was
before<00:02:59.190> so<00:03:00.230> we'll<00:03:01.230> go<00:03:01.410> ahead<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.770> try<00:03:02.010> again<00:03:02.130> I

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
before so we'll go ahead and try again I

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.930 
before so we'll go ahead and try again I
was<00:03:04.230> still<00:03:04.470> intermittent<00:03:05.130> before<00:03:05.460> I<00:03:05.490> couldn't

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
was still intermittent before I couldn't

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.940 
was still intermittent before I couldn't
get<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.210> window<00:03:06.480> up<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.840> save<00:03:07.050> my<00:03:07.260> life<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.770> mean

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
get the window up to save my life I mean

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.620 
get the window up to save my life I mean
it<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:08.130> wasn't<00:03:08.400> working<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:09.060> I've<00:03:09.480> gone

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
it just wasn't working so I've gone

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.210 
it just wasn't working so I've gone
through<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.930> I've<00:03:10.020> touched<00:03:10.260> some<00:03:10.590> selective

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
through and I've touched some selective

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.510 
through and I've touched some selective
points<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:12.000> solder<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.890> so<00:03:13.890> now<00:03:14.040> I've<00:03:14.220> pushed

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
points of solder and so now I've pushed

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.900 
points of solder and so now I've pushed
down<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:16.440> make<00:03:16.650> sure<00:03:16.800> I'm<00:03:16.920> lined<00:03:17.160> up<00:03:17.430> here

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.030 

that's<00:03:20.910> down<00:03:21.210> it's<00:03:22.200> funny<00:03:22.380> cos<00:03:22.560> up<00:03:22.710> is<00:03:22.860> down

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
that's down it's funny cos up is down

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.130 
that's down it's funny cos up is down
and<00:03:23.160> down<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.490> up<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.630> goes<00:03:24.780> into<00:03:25.020> this

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
and down is up so it goes into this

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.500 
and down is up so it goes into this
automatic<00:03:25.830> go<00:03:25.980> down<00:03:26.280> mode<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:27.090> that's<00:03:27.270> the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
automatic go down mode and that's the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.510 
automatic go down mode and that's the
problem<00:03:27.780> is<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.890> see<00:03:29.070> now<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.400> not

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
problem is that you see now it's not

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.410 
problem is that you see now it's not
going<00:03:29.760> up<00:03:29.940> gonna<00:03:30.870> hit<00:03:31.110> down<00:03:31.350> again<00:03:31.710> nothing<00:03:32.640> go

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
going up gonna hit down again nothing go

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.420 
going up gonna hit down again nothing go
to<00:03:33.480> hit<00:03:33.720> up<00:03:33.900> nothing<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.130> still

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
to hit up nothing so it still

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.850 
to hit up nothing so it still
something's<00:03:35.850> not<00:03:36.030> quite<00:03:36.240> right

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
something's not quite right

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.500 
something's not quite right
so<00:03:37.860> I'll<00:03:37.920> go<00:03:38.100> through<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.460> I'll<00:03:38.580> hit<00:03:39.240> some<00:03:39.450> more

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
so I'll go through it I'll hit some more

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.930 
so I'll go through it I'll hit some more
points<00:03:40.080> I<00:03:40.200> can<00:03:40.800> hear<00:03:40.980> clicking<00:03:41.580> so<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.850> know

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
points I can hear clicking so I know

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.880 
points I can hear clicking so I know
that<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.300> relays<00:03:42.720> inside<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.380> this<00:03:43.500> thing<00:03:43.740> are

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
that the relays inside of this thing are

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.910 
that the relays inside of this thing are
working<00:03:44.250> properly<00:03:45.170> you<00:03:46.170> got<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.440> turn<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.740> off

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
working properly you got to turn it off

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.180 
working properly you got to turn it off
before<00:03:47.730> doing<00:03:48.030> anything<00:03:48.360> cuz<00:03:48.830> it'll<00:03:49.830> think

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
before doing anything cuz it'll think

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.770 
before doing anything cuz it'll think
that<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.460> lost<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.880> computer<00:03:51.390> and<00:03:51.570> you'll<00:03:51.690> get

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
that it lost a computer and you'll get

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.140 
that it lost a computer and you'll get
trouble<00:03:52.170> codes<00:03:52.410> into<00:03:53.010> body<00:03:53.370> codes<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.970> stuff

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
trouble codes into body codes and stuff

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.750 
trouble codes into body codes and stuff
and<00:03:54.510> just<00:03:54.810> not<00:03:55.740> pretty<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.100> I'll<00:03:56.280> turn<00:03:56.490> it<00:03:56.640> off

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
and just not pretty so I'll turn it off

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.400 
and just not pretty so I'll turn it off
I'll<00:03:57.030> go<00:03:57.150> hit<00:03:57.390> some<00:03:57.450> more<00:03:57.690> on<00:03:58.380> the<00:04:00.410> goodness

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
I'll go hit some more on the goodness

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.760 
I'll go hit some more on the goodness
let<00:04:01.650> go<00:04:01.860> so<00:04:02.580> maybe<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.930> lights<00:04:04.470> on<00:04:04.680> the

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
let go so maybe it's the lights on the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.000 
let go so maybe it's the lights on the
door<00:04:04.950> went<00:04:05.190> up<00:04:05.900> but<00:04:06.900> what<00:04:07.290> I'm<00:04:07.440> saying<00:04:07.710> is

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
door went up but what I'm saying is

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.220 
door went up but what I'm saying is
you've<00:04:08.610> got<00:04:08.790> relays<00:04:09.300> that<00:04:09.720> are<00:04:09.840> on<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.050> back

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
you've got relays that are on the back

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.500 
you've got relays that are on the back
of<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:10.590> thing<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.670> relays<00:04:12.060> are<00:04:12.270> still

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
of this thing and the relays are still

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.030 
of this thing and the relays are still
working<00:04:12.930> because<00:04:13.050> sometimes<00:04:13.560> those<00:04:13.740> will<00:04:13.950> be

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
working because sometimes those will be

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.310 
working because sometimes those will be
the<00:04:14.160> problem<00:04:14.430> in<00:04:15.270> this<00:04:15.390> case<00:04:15.450> it's<00:04:15.870> not<00:04:16.049> it's

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
the problem in this case it's not it's

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.170 
the problem in this case it's not it's
probably<00:04:16.620> just<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.890> solder<00:04:17.130> joint<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.790> I'll<00:04:17.970> go

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
probably just a solder joint so I'll go

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.820 
probably just a solder joint so I'll go
hit<00:04:18.330> it<00:04:18.450> some<00:04:18.630> more<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.840> added<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.350> bunch<00:04:19.500> more

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
hit it some more I added a bunch more

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.670 
hit it some more I added a bunch more
solder<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.670> too<00:04:21.390> much<00:04:21.630> in<00:04:21.840> fact<00:04:22.080> I<00:04:22.350> had<00:04:22.530> to

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
solder to it too much in fact I had to

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.880 
solder to it too much in fact I had to
get<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.040> stripped<00:04:23.610> wire<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.360> suck<00:04:25.290> some<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.650> it

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
get a stripped wire and suck some of it

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.320 
get a stripped wire and suck some of it
back<00:04:26.100> up<00:04:26.340> off<00:04:26.550> because<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:26.850> have<00:04:27.030> two<00:04:27.180> of<00:04:27.270> the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
back up off because I have two of the

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.550 
back up off because I have two of the
pins<00:04:27.540> touching<00:04:28.020> you<00:04:28.110> got<00:04:28.229> to<00:04:28.290> be<00:04:28.350> really

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
pins touching you got to be really

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.910 
pins touching you got to be really
careful

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
careful

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.400 
careful
from<00:04:29.220> for<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.760> when<00:04:30.720> you're<00:04:30.810> doing<00:04:31.020> this<00:04:31.080> is

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
from for that when you're doing this is

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.620 
from for that when you're doing this is
it<00:04:31.590> for<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.800> beginning<00:04:32.160> solder<00:04:32.640> person<00:04:33.330> this<00:04:33.510> is

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
it for a beginning solder person this is

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.150 
it for a beginning solder person this is
if<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:33.900> have<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.140> little<00:04:34.380> experience<00:04:34.770> maybe

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
if you have a little experience maybe

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.190 
if you have a little experience maybe
practice<00:04:35.730> on<00:04:35.880> some<00:04:36.060> old<00:04:36.180> junky<00:04:36.570> stuff<00:04:36.600> and<00:04:37.080> get

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
practice on some old junky stuff and get

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.260 
practice on some old junky stuff and get
good<00:04:37.350> at<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.650> first

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
good at it first

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.210 
good at it first
but<00:04:39.270> anyway<00:04:39.810> it's<00:04:40.500> working<00:04:40.830> a<00:04:40.920> whole<00:04:41.040> lot

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
but anyway it's working a whole lot

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.930 
but anyway it's working a whole lot
better<00:04:41.460> now

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
better now

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.660 
better now
these<00:04:42.240> were<00:04:42.450> actually<00:04:42.600> really<00:04:43.230> solder<00:04:43.670> bear

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
these were actually really solder bear

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.120 
these were actually really solder bear
they<00:04:45.270> didn't<00:04:45.540> have<00:04:45.690> much<00:04:46.490> solder<00:04:47.490> on<00:04:47.850> there

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
they didn't have much solder on there

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.840 
they didn't have much solder on there
so<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.340> goes<00:04:50.490> down<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:52.650> now<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:53.130> I<00:04:53.190> do<00:04:53.250> this<00:04:53.550> a

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
so it goes down and now that I do this a

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.840 
so it goes down and now that I do this a
lot<00:04:54.530> just<00:04:55.530> doing<00:04:55.830> awesome<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.280> second<00:04:56.640> ago

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
lot just doing awesome a second ago

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
lot just doing awesome a second ago
there<00:04:57.360> we<00:04:57.480> go

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
there we go

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.020 
there we go
I<00:04:57.950> suppose<00:04:58.950> that<00:04:58.980> helps<00:04:59.340> if<00:04:59.460> you<00:04:59.580> line<00:04:59.790> it<00:04:59.940> up

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
I suppose that helps if you line it up

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.530 
I suppose that helps if you line it up
correctly<00:05:00.420> so<00:05:04.640> anyway<00:05:05.640> that's<00:05:06.000> a<00:05:06.180> whole<00:05:06.360> lot

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
correctly so anyway that's a whole lot

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.170 
correctly so anyway that's a whole lot
better<00:05:06.570> than<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.170> was<00:05:07.430> they<00:05:08.430> say<00:05:08.700> it<00:05:09.000> could

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
better than it was they say it could

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.030 
better than it was they say it could
probably<00:05:09.390> use<00:05:09.720> a<00:05:09.750> new<00:05:10.050> one<00:05:10.080> of<00:05:10.320> these<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:10.920> a

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
probably use a new one of these and a

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.370 
probably use a new one of these and a
new<00:05:11.160> one<00:05:11.340> on<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.580> driver's<00:05:12.000> side<00:05:12.030> if<00:05:13.020> I<00:05:13.170> go<00:05:13.320> to

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
new one on the driver's side if I go to

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.800 
new one on the driver's side if I go to
do<00:05:13.560> it<00:05:13.680> on<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.890> driver's<00:05:14.310> side<00:05:17.540> well<00:05:18.540> that's

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
do it on the driver's side well that's

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.720 
do it on the driver's side well that's
the<00:05:18.930> driver<00:05:19.200> one<00:05:19.470> guess<00:05:20.040> it<00:05:20.190> helps<00:05:20.430> if<00:05:20.520> you<00:05:20.610> get

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
the driver one guess it helps if you get

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.330 
the driver one guess it helps if you get
the<00:05:20.850> right<00:05:20.970> switch<00:05:24.470> yeah<00:05:25.470> that's<00:05:25.650> been<00:05:25.860> funky

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
the right switch yeah that's been funky

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.330 
the right switch yeah that's been funky
again<00:05:30.020> go<00:05:31.020> up<00:05:31.050> it<00:05:31.380> won't<00:05:31.500> go<00:05:31.740> up<00:05:31.920> and<00:05:32.190> then<00:05:32.310> you

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
again go up it won't go up and then you

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.670 
again go up it won't go up and then you
hit<00:05:32.550> let<00:05:33.240> go<00:05:33.450> of<00:05:33.570> it<00:05:33.890> anyway

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.840 

probably<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.830> right<00:05:38.950> thing<00:05:39.010> to<00:05:39.280> do<00:05:39.520> is<00:05:39.670> to

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
probably the right thing to do is to

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.730 
probably the right thing to do is to
take<00:05:40.060> out<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.390> driver's<00:05:40.810> side<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.260> touch<00:05:41.530> up

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
take out the driver's side and touch up

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.900 
take out the driver's side and touch up
the<00:05:41.920> solder<00:05:42.160> on<00:05:42.460> that<00:05:42.730> as<00:05:42.940> well<00:05:43.260> but<00:05:44.260> anyway<00:05:44.920> at

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
the solder on that as well but anyway at

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.370 
the solder on that as well but anyway at
least<00:05:45.970> this<00:05:46.330> is<00:05:46.450> a<00:05:46.480> lot<00:05:46.720> better<00:05:46.960> than<00:05:47.020> it<00:05:47.230> was

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
least this is a lot better than it was

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.020 
least this is a lot better than it was
it<00:05:47.560> used<00:05:47.680> to<00:05:47.860> be<00:05:47.980> no<00:05:48.100> matter<00:05:48.250> what<00:05:48.610> you<00:05:48.790> did<00:05:48.970> it

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
it used to be no matter what you did it

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.880 
it used to be no matter what you did it
when<00:05:49.450> this<00:05:49.630> is<00:05:49.690> just<00:05:50.020> committed<00:05:50.470> to<00:05:50.590> going

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
when this is just committed to going

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:58.160 
when this is just committed to going
down<00:05:51.070> and<00:05:51.370> you're<00:05:51.520> just<00:05:51.730> hosed<00:05:52.020> as<00:05:53.040> cold

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.600 

anyway<00:05:59.170> at<00:05:59.290> least<00:05:59.350> you<00:05:59.650> can<00:05:59.800> get<00:05:59.950> it<00:06:00.100> to<00:06:00.220> go<00:06:00.400> up

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
anyway at least you can get it to go up

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.520 
anyway at least you can get it to go up
and<00:06:00.760> down<00:06:01.000> with<00:06:01.180> some<00:06:01.360> reliability<00:06:01.900> have<00:06:02.500> a

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
and down with some reliability have a

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.470 
and down with some reliability have a
price<00:06:02.920> ease<00:06:03.130> out<00:06:03.310> most<00:06:03.640> of<00:06:03.850> time<00:06:04.030> when<00:06:04.210> I<00:06:04.240> go<00:06:04.420> to

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
price ease out most of time when I go to

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.870 
price ease out most of time when I go to
get<00:06:04.630> these<00:06:04.780> for<00:06:05.110> a<00:06:05.140> Subaru<00:06:05.560> Toyota<00:06:06.100> whatever<00:06:06.550> I

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
get these for a Subaru Toyota whatever I

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.480 
get these for a Subaru Toyota whatever I
wind<00:06:07.360> up<00:06:07.510> being<00:06:07.660> a<00:06:07.840> hundred<00:06:08.020> bucks<00:06:08.290> or<00:06:08.590> more<00:06:08.620> so

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
wind up being a hundred bucks or more so

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.740 
wind up being a hundred bucks or more so
that's<00:06:09.820> why<00:06:10.030> I'm<00:06:10.150> doing<00:06:10.210> this<00:06:10.660> first<00:06:11.460> anyway
