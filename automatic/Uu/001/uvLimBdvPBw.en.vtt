00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
Virginia Tech has an offense that's as

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.299 
Virginia Tech has an offense that's as
good<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.480> their<00:00:42.600> defense<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.200> year<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:44.160> then

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
good as their defense this year but then

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.740 
again you know Georgia Tech always a
tough<00:00:46.110> team<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.649> as<00:00:47.579> an<00:00:47.730> underdog<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.420> more

than a touchdown what's your take on
this<00:00:50.340> line<00:00:50.399> Virginia<00:00:50.910> Tech<00:00:51.090> minus<00:00:51.420> seven<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
this line Virginia Tech minus seven and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.080 
this line Virginia Tech minus seven and
a<00:00:51.809> half<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.430> think<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> fair<00:00:53.789> line

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
a half I think it's a fair line

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.389 
a half I think it's a fair line
interesting<00:00:55.079> enough<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.710> public<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.190> paying

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
interesting enough the public is paying

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.790 
interesting enough the public is paying
the<00:00:56.550> dog<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.809> believe<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.379> because<00:00:58.530> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the dog and I believe it's because of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.590 
the dog and I believe it's because of
the<00:00:59.070> unique<00:00:59.399> style<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.940> offense<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the unique style of offense at the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.319 
the unique style of offense at the
Georgia<00:01:00.930> Tech<00:01:01.280> team<00:01:02.280> runs<00:01:02.640> they<00:01:02.850> run<00:01:03.059> from<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
Georgia Tech team runs they run from the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.660 
Georgia Tech team runs they run from the
triple-option<00:01:03.930> offense<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.860> know<00:01:05.040> they

have<00:01:05.850> taken<00:01:06.630> Washington<00:01:07.229> back<00:01:07.500> although<00:01:07.920> they

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
have taken Washington back although they

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.550

defensive<00:01:28.890> starters<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.670> they<00:01:30.509> had<00:01:30.720> all<00:01:30.960> this

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
defensive starters and they had all this

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200 
defensive starters and they had all this
time<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.530> prepare<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.790> triple<00:01:33.119> option

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
time to prepare for the triple option

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.420 
time to prepare for the triple option
and<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.110> my<00:01:34.320> opinion<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.920> finding<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and that in my opinion is finding the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.399 
and that in my opinion is finding the
key<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.210> beating<00:01:36.420> georgia<00:01:36.930> tech<00:01:37.170> is

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
key to beating georgia tech is

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.219 
key to beating georgia tech is
preparation<00:01:38.070> time<00:01:38.630> if<00:01:39.630> you're<00:01:39.810> playing<00:01:39.990> them

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
preparation time if you're playing them

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.810 
preparation time if you're playing them
at<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> bowl<00:01:40.619> game<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.250> six<00:01:41.549> weeks

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
at a bowl game you have six weeks

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.149 
at a bowl game you have six weeks
basically<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.450> prepare<00:01:42.950> against<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.130> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
basically to prepare against that of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.859 
basically to prepare against that of
that<00:01:44.490> type<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.729> offense<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.390> that's<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that type of offense and that's for the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.780 
that type of offense and that's for the
opponent<00:01:46.740> does<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.100> an<00:01:47.189> advantage<00:01:47.490> against

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
opponent does have an advantage against

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.620 
opponent does have an advantage against
Georgia<00:01:48.119> Tech<00:01:48.420> uh<00:01:48.829> I<00:01:49.850> have<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> lien<00:01:51.119> Duffy<00:01:51.509> on

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
Georgia Tech uh I have a lien Duffy on

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.480 
Georgia Tech uh I have a lien Duffy on
Virginia<00:01:52.020> Tech<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.560> they<00:01:52.680> are<00:01:52.829> ranked<00:01:53.189> team

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
Virginia Tech here they are ranked team

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.569 
Virginia Tech here they are ranked team
I<00:01:53.670> think<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> deserve<00:01:54.360> infinitely<00:01:54.780> ranked

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
I think you deserve infinitely ranked

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.990 
I think you deserve infinitely ranked
21st<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.149> think<00:01:57.390> both<00:01:57.540> poles<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:59.340> Georgia

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
21st and I think both poles and Georgia

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.499 
21st and I think both poles and Georgia
Tech<00:02:00.210> could<00:02:00.810> sputter<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.579> offense<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.820> lot<00:02:03.479> of

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
Tech could sputter on offense a lot of

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.330 
Tech could sputter on offense a lot of
life<00:02:03.930> strange<00:02:04.290> things<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.829> happen<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.250> that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
life strange things can happen in that

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580 
life strange things can happen in that
high-risk<00:02:05.880> offense<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.170> as<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:07.560> know

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
high-risk offense and as we know

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.160 
high-risk offense and as we know
Virginia<00:02:07.979> Tech<00:02:08.310> has<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
Virginia Tech has a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.610 
Virginia Tech has a
strong<00:02:10.170> history<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:11.690> creating<00:02:12.690> turnovers<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
strong history of creating turnovers and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.240 
strong history of creating turnovers and
special<00:02:14.129> team<00:02:14.340> placed<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.599> think<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:16.250> team

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
special team placed so I think the team

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.160 
special team placed so I think the team
to<00:02:17.340> take<00:02:17.519> hers<00:02:17.760> Virginia<00:02:18.209> Tech<00:02:18.420> yeah<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.959> really

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
definitely try to buy down to seven but

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.440 
definitely try to buy down to seven but
you<00:02:23.220> know<00:02:23.340> they've<00:02:23.760> got<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.090> experience

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
you know they've got the experience

they've handled this Georgia Tech team

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.369 
they've handled this Georgia Tech team
before<00:02:26.489> they<00:02:26.970> beat<00:02:27.150> him<00:02:27.209> by<00:02:27.360> 11<00:02:27.750> last<00:02:27.900> year<00:02:28.170> and

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
before they beat him by 11 last year and

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.229 
before they beat him by 11 last year and
