00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.340
[William Kentridge: "Return"]

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.400
So, this piece of paper that's going around
at the back is eventually going to be her mouth,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.130
and this piece at the front is eventually
going to be an upper lip,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.710
and that will be one eye.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.869
If you watch those two coming into relative
position...

00:00:55.569 --> 00:01:00.960
All of these sequences are designed to be
shown on the fire screen

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.339
at the La Fenice Opera House in Venice.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.000
And it's an insane project because it's a
projection on a fire screen--

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.090
so, you're working on a film which is designed
not to be watched,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.820
because people are coming to watch the opera,
not the film.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.780
And then you need darkness for your projection,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.540
but there's light in the opera house when
people are coming in.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.860
And then as their attention is fixed by the
orchestra finishing tuning up,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.500
so your film gets switched off and 
the opera begins.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.860
So the chaos of the project is mirrored by
the piece being about chaos

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.420
and disintegration and regathering.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.500
So it's kind of the opposite of entropy--

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.460
it's things gathering into forms rather than
disintegrating from forms.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.660
So you have something that's kind of a mess,
but when they find the right position,

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.670
they come into lose their three dimensionality
and become a two-dimensional flat image.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.950
I like the kind of simple illusion of magic.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.879
That's also about,

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:20.900
"What is this chaos that we are, which we
somehow force into a pattern of coherence?"

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.900
There still is a kind of strange utopianism
in the chaos finding its own order.
