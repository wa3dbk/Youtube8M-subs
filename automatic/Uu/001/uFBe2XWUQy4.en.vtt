00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
yellow to start with but I just figured

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.490 
yellow to start with but I just figured
I<00:04:35.680> might<00:04:35.830> as<00:04:35.890> well<00:04:36.130> do<00:04:36.340> them<00:04:36.430> in<00:04:36.610> person<00:04:37.500> this

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
I might as well do them in person this

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.580 
I might as well do them in person this
does<00:04:38.770> look<00:04:38.950> a<00:04:39.070> little<00:04:39.190> bit<00:04:39.460> darker<00:04:39.640> but<00:04:40.590> yeah

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
does look a little bit darker but yeah

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.860 
does look a little bit darker but yeah
