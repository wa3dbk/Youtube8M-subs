00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:27.949 
London this is what the app looks like
and<00:03:18.070> so<00:03:19.070> now<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:21.590> get<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.190> move<00:03:22.370> over

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.640 

so<00:03:28.739> pretty<00:03:29.010> cool<00:03:29.340> weather<00:03:29.970> app<00:03:30.470> probably<00:03:31.470> a

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
so pretty cool weather app probably a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:41.920 
so pretty cool weather app probably a
little<00:03:31.769> more<00:03:32.010> than<00:03:32.189> you<00:03:32.340> really<00:03:32.549> need<00:03:32.670> but<00:03:35.060> and

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.710 

it's<00:03:42.930> doing<00:03:43.739> pretty<00:03:43.769> good<00:03:44.159> with<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:45.060> CPU<00:03:45.450> it's

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
it's doing pretty good with the CPU it's

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.750 
it's doing pretty good with the CPU it's
definitely<00:03:46.170> maxing<00:03:46.620> out<00:03:46.739> at<00:03:46.799> some<00:03:47.129> point<00:03:47.159> so

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
definitely maxing out at some point so

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.880 
definitely maxing out at some point so
wouldn't<00:03:48.659> be<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.840> best<00:03:49.049> machine<00:03:49.560> they<00:03:49.709> have

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
wouldn't be the best machine they have

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.119 
wouldn't be the best machine they have
windows<00:03:50.280> on<00:03:50.519> but<00:03:50.939> it's<00:03:51.659> only<00:03:52.079> compatible<00:03:52.859> with

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
windows on but it's only compatible with

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.289 
windows on but it's only compatible with
Windows<00:03:54.409> XP<00:03:55.409> so<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.370> fact<00:03:56.579> that<00:03:56.670> it's<00:03:56.879> working

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
Windows XP so the fact that it's working

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.309 
Windows XP so the fact that it's working
with<00:03:57.450> this<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:58.170> pretty<00:03:58.500> great<00:04:00.319> memories

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
with this is pretty great memories

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.020 
with this is pretty great memories
running<00:04:01.650> about<00:04:01.799> half<00:04:02.040> mass<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:03.409> CPUs<00:04:04.579> at<00:04:05.579> idle

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
running about half mass and CPUs at idle

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.069 
running about half mass and CPUs at idle
is<00:04:06.180> about<00:04:06.930> five<00:04:07.650> six<00:04:08.190> seven<00:04:08.549> let's<00:04:08.760> go<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:12.750> fond

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
is about five six seven let's go to fond

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.710 
is about five six seven let's go to fond
of<00:04:13.230> their<00:04:13.730> new<00:04:14.730> set<00:04:14.970> up<00:04:15.120> there<00:04:15.329> but<00:04:15.540> that's

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
of their new set up there but that's

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.689 
of their new set up there but that's
alright<00:04:16.079> let's<00:04:16.650> go<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:16.889> YouTube

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
alright let's go to YouTube

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:30.679 
alright let's go to YouTube
do<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.389> have<00:04:18.539> connection<00:04:19.049> yeah

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.779 

a<00:04:30.749> dress<00:04:31.529> for<00:04:31.769> awareness<00:04:32.219> cannot<00:04:32.489> find

a dress for awareness cannot find

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:43.720 
a dress for awareness cannot find
YouTube<00:04:33.259> check<00:04:34.259> the<00:04:34.439> spelling

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:52.680 

hmm<00:04:44.780> maybe<00:04:45.140> I'm<00:04:45.290> not<00:04:45.470> connect<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:46.330> you<00:04:47.330> -<00:04:49.300> okay

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.700 

now<00:04:53.690> maybe<00:04:54.050> I<00:04:54.140> just<00:04:54.380> can't<00:04:54.530> spell

Microsoft<00:05:00.710> Surface<00:05:00.860> keynote<00:05:01.759> let's<00:05:02.029> take<00:05:02.210> a

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
Microsoft Surface keynote let's take a

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.119 
Microsoft Surface keynote let's take a
look<00:05:02.419> at<00:05:02.479> that<00:05:04.240> so<00:05:05.240> this<00:05:05.389> is<00:05:05.599> video<00:05:05.779> and<00:05:06.409> I'm

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:07.129 
look at that so this is video and I'm

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:12.060 
look at that so this is video and I'm
the<00:05:07.249> spy<00:05:07.520> Ron<00:05:07.759> one<00:05:07.999> point<00:05:08.209> five

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:30.420 

with<00:05:12.670> Windows<00:05:12.970> 8<00:05:28.890> so<00:05:29.890> it<00:05:29.980> looks<00:05:30.130> like<00:05:30.190> the

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
with Windows 8 so it looks like the

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.650 
with Windows 8 so it looks like the
audio<00:05:30.790> is<00:05:30.940> not<00:05:31.150> sinking

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:52.970 

still<00:05:37.660> with<00:05:37.810> a<00:05:37.930> smaller

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:02.850 

better<00:05:55.650> pause<00:05:56.650> it<00:05:59.430> open<00:06:00.430> fullscreen<00:06:01.860> maybe

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
better pause it open fullscreen maybe

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:17.690 
better pause it open fullscreen maybe
it's<00:06:03.070> a<00:06:03.780> Ethernet<00:06:04.780> issue<00:06:04.960> I'll<00:06:05.440> say

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.720 

now<00:06:18.700> I'm<00:06:18.910> gonna<00:06:19.060> guess<00:06:19.420> that<00:06:20.100> it<00:06:21.100> is<00:06:21.340> the

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 
now I'm gonna guess that it is the

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:29.490 
now I'm gonna guess that it is the
processor<00:06:27.330> processor<00:06:28.330> is<00:06:28.750> running<00:06:28.900> at<00:06:29.169> 100%

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
processor processor is running at 100%

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
processor processor is running at 100%
so<00:06:31.410> there's<00:06:32.410> a<00:06:32.500> very<00:06:32.710> good<00:06:32.770> chance<00:06:32.919> that<00:06:33.370> it's

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
so there's a very good chance that it's

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.950 
so there's a very good chance that it's
the<00:06:33.669> processor<00:06:34.180> but<00:06:34.330> it<00:06:34.450> could<00:06:34.540> also<00:06:34.690> be<00:06:34.930> the

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
the processor but it could also be the

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.580 
the processor but it could also be the
video<00:06:35.880> driver<00:06:36.880> since<00:06:37.330> it's<00:06:37.540> not<00:06:37.660> an<00:06:38.139> exact

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
video driver since it's not an exact

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.250 
video driver since it's not an exact
match<00:06:39.180> but<00:06:40.440> I<00:06:41.440> think<00:06:41.800> it's<00:06:41.980> the<00:06:43.230> processor<00:06:44.230> to

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
match but I think it's the processor to

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.950 
match but I think it's the processor to
be<00:06:44.530> honest<00:06:45.090> memory<00:06:46.090> is<00:06:46.180> a<00:06:46.240> little<00:06:46.360> bit<00:06:46.720> tight

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
be honest memory is a little bit tight

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.990 
be honest memory is a little bit tight
as<00:06:47.169> well<00:06:47.350> I<00:06:47.650> had<00:06:48.190> more<00:06:48.340> memory<00:06:48.639> I'd<00:06:48.730> throw<00:06:48.910> it

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
as well I had more memory I'd throw it

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.330 
as well I had more memory I'd throw it
in<00:06:49.120> but<00:06:49.330> I<00:06:49.360> don't<00:06:49.770> so<00:06:52.110> full<00:06:53.110> screen<00:06:53.380> video<00:06:53.500> not

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
in but I don't so full screen video not

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.490 
in but I don't so full screen video not
so<00:06:54.610> much<00:06:57.419> just<00:06:58.419> watching<00:06:58.630> standard<00:06:59.230> video

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
so much just watching standard video

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.320 
so much just watching standard video
seems<00:06:59.950> to<00:07:00.010> be<00:07:00.190> ok<00:07:01.860> and<00:07:02.860> that's<00:07:03.760> about<00:07:04.090> it

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
seems to be ok and that's about it

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.909 
seems to be ok and that's about it
that's<00:07:04.540> probably<00:07:04.900> all<00:07:05.050> you<00:07:05.169> need<00:07:05.320> to<00:07:05.470> know<00:07:05.650> if

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
that's probably all you need to know if

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.460 
that's probably all you need to know if
you<00:07:06.130> find<00:07:07.120> that<00:07:07.270> there<00:07:07.480> is<00:07:07.510> a<00:07:07.690> video<00:07:07.930> a<00:07:08.110> better

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
you find that there is a video a better

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.770 
you find that there is a video a better
