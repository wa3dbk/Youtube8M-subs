00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.010

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.019
 complemented by vegetables being the zucchini 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.939
 dominated and through the use of a 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.129
 chili pepper will be the whole thing 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.230

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.739

 fish fillet we start with the 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.090
 preparatory work halves the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.429
 zucchini and subsequently lifted in 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.360
 very thin slices 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.149

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.440
