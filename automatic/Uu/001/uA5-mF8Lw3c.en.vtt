00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.419 
solid or
and<00:02:07.240> almost<00:02:08.240> straight<00:02:08.830> doesn't<00:02:09.830> really<00:02:10.220> drop

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
and almost straight doesn't really drop

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.050 
and almost straight doesn't really drop
down<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.880> point<00:02:11.090> not<00:02:11.420> as<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.570> cutable<00:02:11.900> point

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
down to the point not as a cutable point

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.120 
down to the point not as a cutable point
so<00:02:14.060> that's<00:02:14.270> for<00:02:14.480> wood<00:02:14.780> crafting<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.500> botanic

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
so that's for wood crafting and botanic

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.340 
so that's for wood crafting and botanic
and<00:02:16.250> wood<00:02:16.580> processing<00:02:16.850> chores<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.690> whatnot

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
and wood processing chores and whatnot

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.699 
and wood processing chores and whatnot
but<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:19.340> my<00:02:19.610> city<00:02:19.880> Kari<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.540> made<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.320> extra

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
but this is my city Kari I made it extra

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.900 
but this is my city Kari I made it extra
sharp<00:02:22.070> with<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.540> lower<00:02:23.540> than<00:02:23.810> factory<00:02:24.200> angle

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
sharp with the lower than factory angle

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.840 
sharp with the lower than factory angle
so<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.270> would<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:27.200> know<00:02:27.320> performance<00:02:28.310> job<00:02:28.550> is

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
so it would you know performance job is

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.430 
so it would you know performance job is
a<00:02:28.880> city<00:02:29.209> knife<00:02:29.420> through<00:02:29.660> heavy<00:02:29.900> clothing<00:02:30.200> if

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
a city knife through heavy clothing if

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.060 
a city knife through heavy clothing if
necessary<00:02:31.209> not<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.630> happens<00:02:33.170> but<00:02:33.590> you

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
necessary not that that happens but you

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.630 
necessary not that that happens but you
never<00:02:34.280> know<00:02:35.080> in<00:02:36.080> any<00:02:36.320> case<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.890> hadn't<00:02:37.280> seen<00:02:37.459> one

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
never know in any case I hadn't seen one

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.220 
never know in any case I hadn't seen one
in<00:02:37.670> person<00:02:37.760> before<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.540> haven't<00:02:38.750> seen<00:02:39.050> any

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
in person before and I haven't seen any

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.800 
in person before and I haven't seen any
