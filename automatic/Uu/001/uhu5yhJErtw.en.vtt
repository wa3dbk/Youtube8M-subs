00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 you get the first video of this kind 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.520
 because I've thought about you 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.910
 megapixel and little bit closer to 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.849
 bring 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.230
 so james muir line especially 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.210
 be successful in solo choir and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.160
 theater today with the eternal careys 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.139
 start but before there is an equal 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.210
 reminder for the upcoming videos because 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.740
 related to the research what's up to date 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.840
 the strongest pc's on a given 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.590
 I have to say that it is very 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.820
 very difficult 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.810
 nevertheless what should one go exactly for it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.430
 and because what should you look for 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.680
 they are based on the popularity 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.210
 give after the band rage that is too 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.560
 an indicator that they are very 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.690
 strong will and maybe after 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.100
 windshield of a screen where but the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.540
 one or the other traffic in between 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.280
 insidious because it perhaps only a 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.050
 plays and with success defended thereby 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.309
 a closer look at the solo cinema 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.530
 or on the themes animal maybe in 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.750
 team was particularly strong and then 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.460
 of course it depends on the elo 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.280
 it makes a big difference what 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.559
 a master carries animal and what a bronze 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.090
 four game object because at the goflex is 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.770
 very much subjective and me again 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.600
 get some news hey markt 7 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.609
 that and that is however so and so I have 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.770
 Yes, I played to zero lately 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.070
 yes of course yes is yes, yes, yes 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.690
 OK 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.040
 in the facts I have now made 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.880
 everything with a little bit 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.590
 included 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.390
 So we look at popularity 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.590
 road bike on teamwork still solo me 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.450
 try everything somehow together to 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.860
 combine well we start now and that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.140
 with the good way 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.580
 because if it is an absolute special case 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.500
 usually in the current patch 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.420
 I would not have set her up 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.270
 I'm honest because currently specifically in the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.700
 solution she is super attractive super 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.710
 dear no matter which one he picks if 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.119
 the whole client is flooded with it 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.640
 and I personally can do it well too 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.540
 understand if we have one now 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.759
 massive damage and somehow 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.070
 really crass slate game scaling though 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.299
 i even the best or careys this 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.890
 day later and there are still 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.509
 trainings in the current meter and is 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.930
 one of the champions where i can say ok 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.340
 in solo you can brutally carey with that 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.680
 usually the labels very much 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.540
 vulnerable positions you can 10 0 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.729
 to go from berlin and come suddenly 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.960
 the 0 4 rap and one shot happens 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.500
 is not excluded that his 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.090
 bavaria paws 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.979
 Well, but if it still is 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.689
 one of the best of her popularity 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.979
 speaks for itself of course 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.390
 this date also its weaknesses 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.640
 usually you would the landingpage 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.350
 but before him the left face on the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.840
 Board will only reject certain postage 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.179
 dominated 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.760
 fit good support trixl every penny 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.349
 lane, that's just another good one 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.000
 very strong chaman the current patch 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.769
 is it your goal is a very 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.390
 special case because she is not 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.550
 as popular as the waves if you are now 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.590
 only on solo choir but interrupts in the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.580
 more comparative and just in tiebreak is 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.840
 she is a monster 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.790
 because she is one of the few who 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.730
 careys supporting your own team 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.769
 your ultimate is the bang are yours 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.629
 dancer brother but also to yourself 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.910
 accelerate the opening to dare 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.920
 or the engaged in distress since 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.079
 this utility is on the ultimate 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.190
 Extremely strong others are big ones 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.540
 advantages with her that you have one more 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.010
 good wave clears to the length or 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.720
 put pressure and she is for the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.880
 lack of mobility outside the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.620
 ultimate that he is not a desch she is 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.989
 pretty sure because of her shield 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.000
 she currently brings a lot with her 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.110
 to the solo kio but also the team race 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.829
 That is why the big ones too dominate 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.079
 popularity 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.030
 So in the high complete and I am too 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.680
 honestly if you are successful in solo 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.599
 his goal is not ipic 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.190
 bad as already mentioned the advantages 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.560
 and another very ironic advantage 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.329
 is that her natural other long ago 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.889
 Strengthens a winner can without problems 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.049
 to have a bad landing face 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.609
 as long as their solo lanes are strong 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.109
 because if I'm an extremely vulnerable 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.389
 topping and still in the fight 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:22.120
 ill jiji accelerate your synergy 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.769
 is simply extremely high and with the team 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.260
 It does not matter how the team works 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.609
 for her as strong as we can anyway 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.989
 definitely in this patch only to everyone 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.069
 recommend another brisanter 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.380
 of course pick a bit 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.660
 he was tricked by 513 he is calista 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.519
 this champion also still 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.109
 very very strong certainly meets 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.150
 Tweet the complete display a bit 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.130
 harder but so loosely looks anyway 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.519
 still very successful she has a good one 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.380
 lending facility with their super what you can 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.940
 also rarely has good as a self-employed 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.040
 played and she is capable of 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.569
 to share the mobility wonderfully and 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.790
 really good domination in too 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.470
 I have to have a later gameplay 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.239
 while saying that in one-on-one 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.370
 other camps are just the better 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.440
 just build that up again 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.440
 but absolutely give shine with it 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.480
 lifestyle through durability digital 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.269
 I can also extremely calista due 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.260
 the really stable lending facility 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.849
 recommend it though a bit tarnished 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.349
 was comparative perhaps one 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.060
 a bit weaker in solo 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.409
 nevertheless very strong the band rage 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.299
 also speaks a bit of good for yourself 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:21.200
 next we will now take us 13 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.420
 together because we have it 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.490
 astana and we have these are 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.770
 also very high settled very 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.060
 I can really love being in solo coffee 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.890
 the only problem is the one you put 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.480
 theoretically have the landing face 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.220
 because she needs a bit above 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.020
 really the home team to achieve but 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.880
 as said the support responsible 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.010
 if he does his job well you are 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.780
 extremely good with this pigs 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.940
 it is told chris tanner is great 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.560
 mobile is super autonomous others own 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.900
 of course and of course in the 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.580
 location towers too psychologically very important 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.680
 Of course he is, as I said 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.850
 since seconds a little different for now 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.290
 similar aspects apply 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.240
 that means she also pushes it 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.740
 monster she has very very good starts 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.670
 that would not offer much text 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.530
 a high range with the 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.510
 rocket launcher and played well maxime 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.220
 absolutely shunned that Germany 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.900
 and I basically do it too 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.760
 Special case this day is off 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.350
 to express chills and because of these 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.370
 special case that you with your arrow 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.170
 can open up 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.640
 this ability has a lot of carry 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.590
 seldom that they are the definite when 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.520
 not a fight to dust but he is in 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.140
 the situation due to the damage and 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.940
 anyway I'm personally paid though 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.630
 not a big friend of mine i would me 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.310
 do not recommend 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.260
 in the current patch but it is still 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.790
 still very strong everything clearly related 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.740
 One can still count on the hypo carey role 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.750
 Look , he is also in 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.490
 The location in the lake is massive 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.720
 Percentage chance to shine too 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.670
 this mixed form very much 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.140
 unpleasant and the weakness of lehning 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.850
 Face has to be said about the supporter 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.500
 be bridged but technically 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.180
 you can also advise him very high but 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.010
 I would not recommend it 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.240
 it is not so simple number good and 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.950
 Now we finally come to the 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.750
 pigs related to the article roll the 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.460
 always go which are always efficient 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.080
 but her job just in the later 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.730
 do not make the course of play outstanding 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.340
 Well, that includes chorkina 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.530
 Thanks to the postbank for the funds 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.240
 super strong even when it comes to points 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.830
 be the only weakness he 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.090
 Do not bring it home in the same way 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.770
 hurt back out like the more often 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.150
 above character as he can 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.530
 he does not shine for it 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.030
 before and that should be used 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.980
 The same applies to the music for grapes 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.020
 very mobile later 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.120
 he bets on the stock exchange but in the late gm 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.340
 decreases later are war-critical 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.200
 this is also the first way away 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.370
 you can always play honestly 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.140
 The next view became the one 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.330
 but also always can play 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.580
 not so outstanding is lucia good 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.500
 played is a lanes very dominant 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.360
 good damage also the effects are 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.040
 later puts the right cheap with laser 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.420
 spring but i am honest he has to 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.800
 his lane is already completely destroyed 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.289
 really later gets deep 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.120
 Well that has always been so natural 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.740
 there are more cherry and who here 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.930
 since then had not found again 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.789
 I'm also super light with this way 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.800
 side in any case, but it is good 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.569
 As said nothing after 10 o'clock 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.280
 you can not mention everything pack yet 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.229
 times the video he should only as 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.669
 Orientation is yes and as I said 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:54.199
 I've done it all on each one 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.430
 making position which means that 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.289
 will probably escape again here 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.449
 his and you can there the corresponding 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.370
 Roll up when I watch the videos 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.650
 you've done that, you 've got that 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.139
 bad luck that the first just run 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.680
 a look about skin pure have fun 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.680
 in the fight
