00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.460
 Good evening to everyone, the recipe that goes 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.150
 present today is the meatloaf 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.589
 swine 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.809
 I know a lot of people who do not like 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.759
 meat little but I do not know if 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.769
 get good kind of meat because 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.630
 recipe is made with this type of meat 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.029
 You already ask me what's good. 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.220
 beef the team falls 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.859
 I do not know the answer anymore because I did 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.840
 with this type of meat and a differential 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.220
 of this recipe is that we eat with 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.130
 sauce and the fingers I use the egg then 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.480
 it may be that you is not know and is 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.270
 the way I do at home where I 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.550
 I really like your written recipe. 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.649
 will find on my blog just access the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.399
 link in the video description goes straight into the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.739
 recipe and new ones can print well then 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.600
 Let's go to today's recipe, I'll start 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.950
 recipe first time taking the meat 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.600
 here I am giving conferences in 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.480
 but you can do it with a 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.190
 long is also good and I cut like this 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.960
 more or less this thickness can not 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.440
 be very thick and also not too thin 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.539
 and in this format here I got the most out 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.600
 fat that was in the flesh and left 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.909
 So now you have to get a screen. 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.640
 so if you have and have 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.850
 to beat the meat until it stays that way 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.580
 in the very thin format and now I'm going to hit 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.890
 here ends all the load with a hammer and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.840
 after I hit and gets thinner and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.020
 It grows in size, it looks just as well. 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:31.590
 and now I season with lemon the salt 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.170
 only you can do August and the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.150
 pepper and now I will take a 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.820
 structured here and have to leave 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.920
 reserve at least two works 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.530
 so I'm going to mess I'll leave it reserved 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.640
 this meat 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.220
 now after two hours I left 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.020
 reserved in the refrigerator now went to talk 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.700
 so here I have the wheat flour and 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.969
 along with the wheat flour I go 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.229
 adding water gradually and I will move 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:07.009
 com went to get a point 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.009
 so I went and put water on 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.290
 here I went to touch until at last the point 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.110
 This is the mass point. 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.610
 she stays like this is not too thick 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.560
 and neither too thin and the mass is the first 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.450
 step into the flesh 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.120
 The second step to meat meat I 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.819
 I'm going to use French bread is revealed but 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.040
 It has to be cold is in the thick part I 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.870
 said here that part of us here can not 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.599
 be that even flour does not have to 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.599
 to remain so still so silent 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.329
 big and then you leave the French bread 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.140
 well hard that it speaks easier there 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:51.730
 so now I'm going to get into the flesh 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.730
 now gets the car wrapped in the mass 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:03:16.730
 the excess with the hand even so new has 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:18.889
 that involves well so it looks ugly 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.019
 when my shape and then reflect 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:26.239
 he stays beyond beautiful and looks good 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:28.940
 then the wrap will stay 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.280
 This way, after now, I'll make everyone 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.540
 so here today to catch everyone after 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.480
 when it was like this 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:41.980
 Now I'll make the sauce to make the 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.980
 sauce I'll use the English sauce shoyu 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:50.209
 the sesame oil law of the sac for the 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.340
 cuisine and ketchup 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.159
 now just mix the ingredients and 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.530
 sauce is ready there was nothing on the fire and 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.569
 that's all it's in the ingredients and it's 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.260
 very easy because just mix it is already 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.120
 ready 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:09.379
 now I'm going to fry my look that is already 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:12.079
 Hot stirring does not let it stay. 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:16.130
 so after you take it as you stand 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:19.099
 sideways now here I will turn already have 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.400
 you can find the 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:24.000
 burned 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.669
 as if you're already closing browned 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.900
 Good, I'll finish painting here. 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.180
 I'll take 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.889
 I do not have an agreement here is a way 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.490
 that you can only eat several 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.770
 shapes 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.199
 You can eat with lemon or you can 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.080
 eating here I put mayonnaise and here 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.270
 I have cargo is one of the options 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.759
 if you do not want to eat with sauce 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.650
 sauce after it is ready so one 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.580
 just a little bit thicker for the 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.699
 ketchup 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.520
 but it stays cyberlink of the same then it is 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:57.110
 trying to put too much that is not well 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.699
 strong, then try to put some 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.570
 Then for those who like sauce, put it like this. 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:07.320
 in the flesh and ate some forms that you 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.410
 and can I eat I'll cut a piece of 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:17.970
 meat for you will you to only there that 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:20.430
 the breadcrumbs are thick it stays like this 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:30.720
 crispier and is more enjoyable to 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:33.960
 eat also very hot outside and stay 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:38.039
 with gold looking to make a season 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:41.610
 so it's not having the mouth and not the dog. 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:45.419
 So it's gotta be good for the meat to stay 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.830
 no white boy and it is well to crunchy 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.370
 part outside too 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.380
 After that, it was okay, you guys. 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.169
 because he likes to show that he can put 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.330
 to show along with sauce also a 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.570
 option also for those who like it then only 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:04.199
 for the zones of you is is like and is 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:08.240
 increase revenue stays so I hope 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:08.240
 You liked it better.
