00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.469
 I explain the function of the 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.930
 cord loop help that is the 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:15.490
 loop help with the hook like that 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:18.700
 have thread-mentioned and that is the 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.460
 accompanying leather packaging snort 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.140
 Nodes are needed in the fishing area 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.720
 they should be solid 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.470
 the windows number is there 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.210
 critical 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:34.000
 that's the little sleeping knot that 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.370
 is the big sleeping knot both 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.840
 Knots have a high bond number for 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.690
 the strength of the knot is represented 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.530
 I 'd rather take this one 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:51.640
 piece of twine cord lay it double way 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.950
 she had around my four fingers and now 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.010
 I have an upper and an lower level 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.870
 sleep under the bend should one 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.660
 diameter of about twelve centimeters 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.039
 have and top about one 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:11.320
 length of four centimeters namely only 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:13.900
 sleep help and ask in the 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.409
 Pull the upper loop through until 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.409
 to listen 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.820
 then I bring the loop aid to 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.820
 rotate around the thread 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.230
 the looped knots are ready 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.820
 a high commitment time for the 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.820
 strength of running 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.710
 explain now manufacture one 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.320
 small loop with the sleep and 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:57.340
 Helping a string would be twofold 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.260
 what the length is about 15 cm 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.340
 the double string would be my two 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:09.740
 finger so i read a superstar one 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.320
 I 'll hang you down then 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.200
 just sleep help through the hook in 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.350
 oberstaufen pull through to the stop 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.660
 Now I turn my fingers through 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:26.020
 The legs sleep help 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.020
 and the cord 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.099
 I pull the knot with my fingers 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.099
 end of the bend 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.090
 and finished the little bend
