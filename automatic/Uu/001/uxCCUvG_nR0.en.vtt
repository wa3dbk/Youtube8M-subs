00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.470 

I<00:00:08.960> have<00:00:09.960> read<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.710> black<00:00:11.130> tire<00:00:11.580> covers<00:00:12.120> do<00:00:12.450> a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
I have read that black tire covers do a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.070 
I have read that black tire covers do a
better<00:00:12.780> job<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.380> blocking<00:00:14.240> UV<00:00:15.240> rays<00:00:15.570> from<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
better job of blocking UV rays from the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.529 
better job of blocking UV rays from the
Sun<00:00:16.199> what<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.340> think<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.000> UV<00:00:18.330> rays

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
Sun what do you think and the UV rays

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.390 
Sun what do you think and the UV rays
are<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.960> bad<00:00:19.380> guys<00:00:19.650> they<00:00:19.859> aren't<00:00:20.039> they<00:00:20.220> they

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
are the bad guys they aren't they they

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.849 
are the bad guys they aren't they they
will<00:00:20.550> do<00:00:20.699> lots<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.600> damage<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.020> are<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> black

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
will do lots of damage so are the black

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.099 
will do lots of damage so are the black
covers<00:00:23.160> better<00:00:24.380> no<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:26.210> I<00:00:27.210> had<00:00:27.689> some<00:00:27.930> people

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
covers better no and I had some people

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.250 
covers better no and I had some people
ask<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.619> after<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.220> posted<00:00:29.970> down<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.570> my<00:00:30.900> blog

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
ask that after I posted down on my blog

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.490 
ask that after I posted down on my blog
about<00:00:31.880> white<00:00:32.880> covers<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.719> keeping<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> heat

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
about white covers and keeping the heat

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.500 
about white covers and keeping the heat
down<00:00:35.540> I<00:00:36.540> did<00:00:36.750> some<00:00:37.200> black<00:00:37.790> comparison<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
down I did some black comparison and the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.920 
down I did some black comparison and the
black<00:00:39.719> covers<00:00:40.200> coat<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.070> tires<00:00:41.570> yes<00:00:42.570> black

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
black covers coat the tires yes black

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.770 
black covers coat the tires yes black
covers<00:00:43.350> will<00:00:43.649> block<00:00:44.070> UV<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.969> piece<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.539> plywood

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
covers will block UV a piece of plywood

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.440 
covers will block UV a piece of plywood
will<00:00:46.230> block<00:00:46.500> UV<00:00:47.070> big<00:00:47.670> sheet<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.030> cardboard

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
will block UV big sheet of cardboard

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.709 
will block UV big sheet of cardboard
will<00:00:48.870> block<00:00:49.140> UV<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:51.420> want<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> be

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
will block UV but you don't want to be

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.170 
will block UV but you don't want to be
carrying<00:00:52.050> around<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.350> big<00:00:52.500> sheet<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.800> cardboard

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
carrying around a big sheet of cardboard

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.119 
carrying around a big sheet of cardboard
so<00:00:54.180> if<00:00:54.329> you're<00:00:54.539> confronted<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.500> black<00:00:55.920> or

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
so if you're confronted with black or

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.670 
so if you're confronted with black or
white<00:00:56.370> go<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.910> white<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.750> black<00:00:58.199> will

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
white go with white because black will

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.520 
white go with white because black will
keep<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.399> tires<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.090> matter<00:01:01.079> fact<00:01:01.289> there's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
keep the tires and matter fact there's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.650 
keep the tires and matter fact there's
the<00:01:01.710> results<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.250> our<00:01:02.340> gauge<00:01:02.579> when<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.180> see<00:01:03.420> at

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the results of our gauge when you see at

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.840 
the results of our gauge when you see at
98<00:01:04.320> degrees<00:01:04.460> was<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.640> cover<00:01:06.799> temperature

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
98 degrees was the cover temperature

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.950 
98 degrees was the cover temperature
when<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> pulled<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.990> cover<00:01:10.320> off<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.310> saw<00:01:12.150> 99

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
when I pulled the cover off I saw 99

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.590 
when I pulled the cover off I saw 99
degrees<00:01:14.090> 30<00:01:15.090> minutes<00:01:15.240> later<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.560> tire<00:01:17.040> was

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
degrees 30 minutes later that tire was

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.670 
degrees 30 minutes later that tire was
136<00:01:18.600> degrees<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:20.850> means<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.450> aging<00:01:22.140> four

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
136 degrees that means it is aging four

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.490 
136 degrees that means it is aging four
times<00:01:23.159> faster<00:01:23.729> because<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.659> age<00:01:24.840> rate<00:01:25.229> is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
times faster because the age rate is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.910 
times faster because the age rate is
geometric<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:27.180> keeping<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> tires<00:01:28.110> cool<00:01:28.530> is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
geometric so keeping the tires cool is

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.999 
geometric so keeping the tires cool is
pretty<00:01:29.700> important<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:31.049> tires<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.619> seven

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
pretty important my tires are seven

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.219 
pretty important my tires are seven

what<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.670> mean<00:01:44.790> gee<00:01:45.290> aging<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.409> geometric

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
what do you mean gee aging is geometric

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.660 
what do you mean gee aging is geometric
explain<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.590> when<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.799> increase<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
explain that when you increase the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.679 
explain that when you increase the
temperature<00:01:50.970> by<00:01:51.840> 18<00:01:52.409> degrees<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:54.030> chemical

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
temperature by 18 degrees the chemical

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.950 
temperature by 18 degrees the chemical
reaction<00:01:55.259> rate<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.860> age<00:01:56.070> at<00:01:56.369> which<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.689> rate

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
reaction rate the age at which the rate

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.810 
reaction rate the age at which the rate
at<00:01:58.200> which<00:01:58.229> tires<00:01:58.890> aid

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
at which tires aid

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.370 
at which tires aid
dulls<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.469> if<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:01.920> up<00:02:01.950> 18<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:03.060> twice<00:02:03.479> if

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
dulls so if you go up 18 it's twice if

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.639 
dulls so if you go up 18 it's twice if
you<00:02:04.590> go<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:04.860> 36<00:02:05.640> another<00:02:06.060> 18<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:07.020> now<00:02:07.229> four

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
you go up 36 another 18 it's now four

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.669 
you go up 36 another 18 it's now four
times<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:09.119> go<00:02:09.270> up<00:02:09.360> another<00:02:09.629> 18<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.470> now

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
times if you go up another 18 it's now

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.250 
times if you go up another 18 it's now
eight<00:02:11.009> times

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
eight times

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.460 
eight times
so<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.620> can<00:02:14.189> you<00:02:14.819> can<00:02:14.970> imagine<00:02:15.209> how<00:02:15.689> hot<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.200> tire

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
so it can you can imagine how hot a tire

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.350 
so it can you can imagine how hot a tire

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
at a time you just took a couple of

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.050 
at a time you just took a couple of
years<00:02:27.840> off<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.409> tire<00:02:28.650> light<00:02:28.980> wrong<00:02:29.400> well<00:02:29.939> you

years off the tire light wrong well you

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.729 
years off the tire light wrong well you
notice<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.780> mean<00:02:30.989> will<00:02:31.109> you<00:02:31.140> notice<00:02:31.530> that
