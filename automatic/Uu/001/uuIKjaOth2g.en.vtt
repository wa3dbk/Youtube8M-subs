00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
two-speed leaver drag reel as you can

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.939 
two-speed leaver drag reel as you can
see<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.689> was<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.869> two-speed<00:00:22.230> mechanism<00:00:22.769> right

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
see it was the two-speed mechanism right

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.890 
see it was the two-speed mechanism right
in<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> handle<00:00:23.369> very<00:00:24.029> easy<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.390> use<00:00:24.570> right<00:00:24.869> now

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
in the handle very easy to use right now

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.420 
in the handle very easy to use right now
you're<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.199> high<00:00:25.289> gear<00:00:25.529> ratio<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.920> push<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.279> in

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
you're in high gear ratio you push it in

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.359 
you're in high gear ratio you push it in
and<00:00:26.599> then<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:28.260> drops<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.650> down<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.949> low<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
and then that drops it down to low and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.130 
and then that drops it down to low and
then<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:30.060> flick<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.840> to

then you just flick it like that to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.100 
then you just flick it like that to
bring<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.160> back<00:00:32.309> up<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.180> high<00:00:33.329> gear<00:00:33.540> ratio<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
bring it back up to to high gear ratio a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.720 
bring it back up to to high gear ratio a

you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.000> got<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> five<00:01:30.420> point<00:01:30.659> five<00:01:30.810> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you know you got a five point five to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.929 
you know you got a five point five to
one<00:01:31.110> high<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> low<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.490> nice<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.820> well

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
one high but the low is nice and well

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.670 
one high but the low is nice and well
it's<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.119> two<00:01:33.270> point<00:01:33.540> seven<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.590> instead

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
it's a two point seven to one so instead

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340 
it's a two point seven to one so instead
of<00:01:34.829> getting<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.360> six<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.509> four<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.960> some
