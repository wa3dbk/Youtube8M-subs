00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.710 
when I was 10 years old
my<00:00:09.320> mother<00:00:09.860> decided<00:00:10.730> that<00:00:11.120> I<00:00:11.240> needed<00:00:11.450> to<00:00:11.630> learn

my mother decided that I needed to learn

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.510 
my mother decided that I needed to learn
an<00:00:11.900> instrument<00:00:12.050> because<00:00:12.800> I<00:00:13.160> was<00:00:13.430> in

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:13.520 
an instrument because I was in

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.460 
an instrument because I was in
elementary<00:00:13.670> school<00:00:14.270> and<00:00:14.600> everyone<00:00:15.290> was

starting to play the recorder but

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.200 
starting to play the recorder but
because<00:00:18.080> of<00:00:18.109> my<00:00:19.070> lack<00:00:19.310> of<00:00:19.490> an<00:00:19.610> arm<00:00:19.789> I<00:00:19.910> wasn't

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210

through<00:00:22.760> a<00:00:23.060> few<00:00:23.150> options<00:00:24.110> one<00:00:24.619> of<00:00:24.650> them<00:00:24.830> was

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
through a few options one of them was

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.430 
through a few options one of them was
singing<00:00:25.310> and<00:00:25.580> other<00:00:25.730> ones<00:00:25.940> the<00:00:26.150> drums<00:00:26.449> no<00:00:27.289> one

rational mindset
we<00:00:33.350> started<00:00:33.710> anyways<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:34.280> we<00:00:34.340> came<00:00:34.579> from<00:00:34.730> the

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
we started anyways and we came from the

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.530 
we started anyways and we came from the
premise<00:00:35.180> of<00:00:35.420> why<00:00:35.780> not<00:00:36.050> I<00:00:37.360> went<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.510> a

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
premise of why not I went to a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.110 
premise of why not I went to a
rehabilitation<00:00:38.840> center<00:00:39.770> in<00:00:39.950> Toronto<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:41.030> I

rehabilitation center in Toronto and I

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.360 
rehabilitation center in Toronto and I
had<00:00:41.300> this<00:00:41.480> device<00:00:41.960> made<00:00:42.680> for<00:00:42.920> me<00:00:43.010> it's<00:00:43.160> called

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
had this device made for me it's called

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.420 
had this device made for me it's called
a<00:00:43.579> spatula<00:00:44.260> because<00:00:45.260> it's<00:00:45.590> like<00:00:45.739> you<00:00:46.100> can<00:00:46.250> cope

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
a spatula because it's like you can cope

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.229 
a spatula because it's like you can cope
it<00:00:46.930> not<00:00:47.930> really<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.800> violin<00:00:49.219> is<00:00:49.460> complicated

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
it not really the violin is complicated

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.510 
it not really the violin is complicated
enough<00:00:50.630> and<00:00:50.989> I've<00:00:51.170> realized<00:00:51.590> after<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.280> fact

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
enough and I've realized after the fact

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.830 
enough and I've realized after the fact
now<00:00:52.730> that<00:00:52.910> I'm<00:00:53.030> working<00:00:53.210> with<00:00:53.420> young<00:00:53.809> children

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
took years it was also because I was

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.440 
took years it was also because I was
horribly<00:01:30.650> uncoordinated<00:01:31.310> as<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.850> kid<00:01:32.119> as<00:01:32.240> well

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
and I'm also socially as well when you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.929 
and I'm also socially as well when you
grow<00:01:34.700> up<00:01:34.759> differently<00:01:35.299> as<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.020> kid<00:01:36.409> it's<00:01:36.939> very

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
difficult to to fit in so that's where

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.030 
difficult to to fit in so that's where
the<00:01:41.330> music<00:01:41.689> side<00:01:41.900> came<00:01:42.170> in<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.619> lot<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:42.860> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
rehab just for physical needs but I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.980 
rehab just for physical needs but I
think<00:01:47.479> this<00:01:47.600> was<00:01:47.750> also<00:01:48.079> an<00:01:48.380> emotional<00:01:48.680> one<00:01:49.990> I'm

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
think this was also an emotional one I'm

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.960 
think this was also an emotional one I'm
in<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.320> arts<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:51.860> education<00:01:51.950> program<00:01:52.700> right

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
now at Harvard and a lot of what we deal

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.910 
now at Harvard and a lot of what we deal
with<00:01:56.150> are<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.869> issues<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.439> marginalization

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
with are the issues of marginalization
