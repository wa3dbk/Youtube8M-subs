00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.950
 we are in the professional section 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.300
 answer back 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.540
 and in this case a question 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.760
 what Carlos Martínez has done for us 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.040
 social network physical sports that out there 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.240
 you can send the questions and now you 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.840
 get more interesting 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.570
 I will answer them in the program and good in 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.210
 this case carlos martínez tells us 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.400
 literally it is good to run on an empty stomach 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.460
 newly lifted to lower tissue 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.260
 adipose or lose good muscle mass 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.720
 we have already answered this many times 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.660
 but what is clear that he says good 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:49.660
 if it's good to run that when running 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:52.560
 we understand running not walking fast 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.080
 fasting is good to do an activity 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.840
 cardiovascular because because the study 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.920
 of glucose is very low and right away 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.750
 begin to burn fat make it 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.060
 same thing that happens for those who do not have 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.500
 time to do it on an empty stomach 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.979
 do it after the training of 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.900
 weights below so that too 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.940
 you can start to burn fat since 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.000
 your glucose and glycogen storage 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.000
 It's work 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.640
 but the subject is in what Carlos says 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.220
 martínez de si is good to run evident 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.790
 in running is not good because running 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.040
 it means going to an intensity too 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.229
 raised as to so that our 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.920
 metabolism our body have time 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.730
 enough to release fat in 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.480
 blood 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.500
 that carnitine intervenes will break the 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.830
 molecule grace the comunitat have 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.930
 digested and that digested thriller is 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.640
 say to be shredded penetrate the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.190
 cell membrane to the cell and to the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.630
 mitochondria the combustion of the 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.970
 conversion of fats and fats 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.960
 Energy 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.180
 with what this is 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.810
 a process that our body requires 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.759
 weather 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.710
 you have to do the average intensity like 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.259
 we have said many times so much tony 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.739
 Gutiérrez like myself that really 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.270
 the formula to apply for the system 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.920
 of cardio work properly would be 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.920
 220 beats that is the maximum that gives 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.250
 the heart before a cardiac arrest 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.390
 subtract your age and apply 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.370
 final result 60 percent and so 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.480
 there are too many exact pulsations 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.420
 that you have to go fast walking 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.180
 to consume the greatest amount of fat 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.940
 and not practically consume glycogen and 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.040
 do not destroy muscle glycogen 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.750
 essential for your muscle 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.390
 maintain an adequate amount of water 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.269
 retained and adequate tension and a 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.450
 insured growth therefore it is not 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.959
 good to run on an empty stomach or run in 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.370
 fasting or running at any time 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.080
 see you to burn fat to catch 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.300
 license or for 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.300
 to do a half marathon or to 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.210
 To test the mosos me 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.520
 It looks perfect but to burn fat 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.750
 the best thing is to walk fast always 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.820
 applying formula 220 minus 60 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.569
 our age and the final result 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.269
 60 percent apply 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.269
 I think it's answered correctly 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:38.670
 we went to francisco martín 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.460
 and francisco martín also of physics 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.680
 sports tells us on a diet low in 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.440
 hydrates and rich in proteins to lower 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.480
 adipose tissue what would be the minimum of 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.580
 hydrates the diet to maintain the 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.720
 glycogen storage of the liver and 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.890
 46 years old man correct muscles 92 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.270
 kilos of weight 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.920
 we have to know also what amount 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.490
 of lean tissue has what real weight 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.590
 muscular has 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.540
 46 years good 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.849
 logically to lower adipose tissue 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.730
 we always have to go restrictive in 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.769
 how much hydrate is ingested 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.299
 optimal amount protein even by 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.769
 over the necessary so that we have 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.000
 chances that the excess will 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.889
 convert glycogen into glucose but 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.479
 very restrictive without hydrates we have already 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.800
 said many times that the best way to 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.410
 lose fat fast keep the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.560
 accelerated metabolism is the diets of 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.220
 charges and downloads in this case you 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.220
 I would recommend 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.580
 I would recommend you take hydrates by 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.950
 morning newly raised since you have the 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.740
 low glucose accompanied by proteins that 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.540
 we could be in about 30 45 grams that 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.850
 it can be about 100 grams of rice that 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.490
 after boiling or 250 more or less than 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:56.220
 be after the bid or about 50 grams of 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:58.530
 cereals 75 grams of raw cereals 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.230
 we could also take before the 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.370
 training between 30 and 45 grams and 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.070
 after multifiber training 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.650
 having done cardio about 30 45 grams 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.500
 the other meals is to say for the 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.810
 tomorrow before after training 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.730
 assuming we understand in the afternoon 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.340
 although it is not in the morning if it were for 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.950
 the morning would be freshly raised and I try 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.530
 and after the hydrate training and the rest 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.620
 of meals if we make 6 protein intakes 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.280
 only protein with cellulose or vegetable that 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.800
 it is vegetable vegetable vegetables 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.900
 then the best way to take 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.620
 hydrates to make sure that 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:40.940
 we lose fat is generally 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.130
 about 30 grams of hydrates in the morning 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.650
 freshly raised accompanied by protein 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.540
 and then the return to ingest before the 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.370
 I train and after training if 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.320
 we train in the morning only those of 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.410
 after training the rest of 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.840
 food is protein that will guarantee that 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.030
 we are consuming all day 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.130
 fat and using fat as energy 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.600
 and that we have enough energy 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.190
 to do a multifiber training 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.120
 and a workout with some 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.120
 cardiovascular included 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.100
 we go to another section 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.170
 Y 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.110
 two
