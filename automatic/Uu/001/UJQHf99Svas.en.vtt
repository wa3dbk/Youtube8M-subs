previous review flying a helicopter

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.540

right there we have a printed piece and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.380 
right there we have a printed piece and
this<00:02:03.010> is<00:02:03.070> where<00:02:03.340> we<00:02:03.490> can<00:02:03.580> stick<00:02:03.790> in<00:02:03.940> our<00:02:04.090> angry

this is where we can stick in our angry

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.030 
this is where we can stick in our angry
forest<00:02:04.810> policeman<00:02:05.230> who<00:02:05.410> got<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.710> short<00:02:05.950> end

forest policeman who got the short end
of<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.250> stick<00:02:06.490> when<00:02:06.760> he<00:02:06.850> asked<00:02:07.030> for<00:02:07.150> a<00:02:07.180> real

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
of the stick when he asked for a real

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.250 
of the stick when he asked for a real
car<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:07.900> here's<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.800> view<00:02:09.009> from<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.310> front<00:02:09.489> and

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
car and here's a view from the front and

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.869 
car and here's a view from the front and
there's<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.379> back<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.829> over<00:02:12.609> on<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:12.819> side

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
there's the back and over on this side

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.429 
there's the back and over on this side
we<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.299> a<00:02:13.390> compartment<00:02:13.719> that<00:02:13.989> can<00:02:14.109> open<00:02:14.349> up

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
we have a compartment that can open up

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.030 
we have a compartment that can open up
and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.490 
and
is<00:02:15.159> where<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.310> store<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.730> flashlight<00:02:16.120> and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
is where you store the flashlight and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.990 
is where you store the flashlight and
over<00:02:17.500> on<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.680> side<00:02:17.739> this<00:02:18.549> is<00:02:18.700> where<00:02:18.879> you

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
over on this side this is where you

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.080 
over on this side this is where you
store<00:02:19.299> the<00:02:20.079> handcuffs<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.680> what<00:02:21.370> no<00:02:21.700> snacks

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
store the handcuffs and what no snacks

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.580 
store the handcuffs and what no snacks
well<00:02:23.019> that's<00:02:23.200> odd

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
well that's odd

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.380 
well that's odd
and<00:02:23.680> I'm<00:02:24.250> guessing<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:24.730> thing<00:02:24.939> doesn't<00:02:25.239> go

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
and I'm guessing this thing doesn't go

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.209 
and I'm guessing this thing doesn't go
very<00:02:25.420> fast<00:02:25.930> because<00:02:26.140> if<00:02:26.469> it<00:02:26.590> did<00:02:26.769> his<00:02:27.010> hat

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
very fast because if it did his hat

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:31.530 
very fast because if it did his hat
would<00:02:27.340> fly<00:02:27.519> off<00:02:27.689> and<00:02:29.640> here<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.030> heavy<00:02:31.299> lift

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
would fly off and here is the heavy lift

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.599 
would fly off and here is the heavy lift
helicopter<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.409> as<00:02:32.799> you<00:02:32.890> can<00:02:33.010> see<00:02:33.159> is<00:02:33.310> heavily

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
helicopter and as you can see is heavily

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.580 
helicopter and as you can see is heavily
inspired<00:02:33.819> by<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.209> Chinook<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:34.780> here's<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
inspired by the Chinook and here's the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.069 
inspired by the Chinook and here's the
view<00:02:35.739> from<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.220> side<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:37.689> first<00:02:37.930> thing

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
view from the side and the first thing

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.330 
view from the side and the first thing
you're<00:02:38.170> probably<00:02:38.230> noticed<00:02:38.739> is<00:02:38.859> that<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.099> is

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
you're probably noticed is that this is

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.580 
you're probably noticed is that this is
a<00:02:39.370> pretty<00:02:39.790> big<00:02:40.090> model<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.659> it<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:40.959> it's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
a pretty big model and it is it's

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.220

actually 17 inches long and 7 inches

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.619 
actually 17 inches long and 7 inches
tall<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:44.799> yeah<00:02:44.950> it's<00:02:45.189> pretty<00:02:45.340> big<00:02:45.579> but<00:02:46.359> over<00:02:46.540> on

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
tall so yeah it's pretty big but over on

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:47.610 
tall so yeah it's pretty big but over on
this<00:02:46.750> side<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:47.049> where<00:02:47.139> you<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.319> plate<00:02:47.500> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
this side is where you can plate the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.960 
this side is where you can plate the
inside<00:02:47.950> by<00:02:48.129> lifting<00:02:48.280> up<00:02:48.489> these<00:02:48.639> compartments

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
inside by lifting up these compartments

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.660 
inside by lifting up these compartments
but<00:02:49.510> I'll<00:02:49.599> have<00:02:49.750> more<00:02:49.989> on<00:02:50.049> that<00:02:50.079> later<00:02:50.670> here's

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
but I'll have more on that later here's

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.429 
but I'll have more on that later here's
the<00:02:51.819> view<00:02:52.000> from<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.329> back<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.959> I<00:02:53.019> really<00:02:53.230> love

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
the view from the back and I really love

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.589 
the view from the back and I really love
how<00:02:53.590> they<00:02:53.709> made<00:02:53.859> this<00:02:54.010> loading<00:02:54.340> ramp<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:55.389> they

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
how they made this loading ramp and they

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.270 
how they made this loading ramp and they
can<00:02:55.750> open<00:02:55.959> up<00:02:56.079> by<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.799> much

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
can open up by that much

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.460 
can open up by that much
but<00:02:58.209> when<00:02:58.359> you<00:02:58.450> close<00:02:58.659> it<00:02:58.720> you'll<00:02:59.139> notice<00:02:59.379> that

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
but when you close it you'll notice that

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.050 
but when you close it you'll notice that
there's<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.739> small<00:02:59.980> little<00:03:00.189> gap<00:03:00.310> up<00:03:00.459> here<00:03:00.730> well

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
there's a small little gap up here well

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.879 
there's a small little gap up here well
it's<00:03:01.180> really<00:03:01.269> not<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.780> noticeable<00:03:02.049> once<00:03:02.680> you

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
it's really not that noticeable once you

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.949 
it's really not that noticeable once you
start<00:03:03.129> it<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.340> long<00:03:03.540> there's<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.599> view<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:04.870> the

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
start it to long there's a view of the

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.789 
start it to long there's a view of the
inside<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.530> it's<00:03:06.220> pretty<00:03:06.519> spacious<00:03:07.799> here's

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
inside and it's pretty spacious here's

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.129 
inside and it's pretty spacious here's
the<00:03:09.010> other<00:03:09.159> side<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:10.239> side<00:03:10.299> cannot<00:03:10.870> open

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
the other side and this side cannot open

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:12.780 
the other side and this side cannot open
up<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.470> because<00:03:12.129> of<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.340> you'll<00:03:12.579> notice

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
up and because of that you'll notice

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.559 
up and because of that you'll notice
that<00:03:12.849> the<00:03:12.970> window<00:03:13.180> was<00:03:13.209> actually<00:03:13.480> more

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
that the window was actually more

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.300 
that the window was actually more
straight<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:13.930> time<00:03:14.109> around<00:03:14.319> but<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.099> part

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
straight this time around but this part

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.479 
straight this time around but this part
can<00:03:15.430> open<00:03:15.639> up<00:03:15.700> it's<00:03:15.970> loading<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.299> other<00:03:16.510> pilot

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
can open up it's loading the other pilot

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.920 
can open up it's loading the other pilot
here's<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.609> view<00:03:18.760> of<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:18.939> front<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.810> I

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
here's the view of the front and I

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.119 
here's the view of the front and I
really<00:03:20.109> like<00:03:20.199> how<00:03:20.319> they<00:03:20.440> made<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.680> front<00:03:20.919> -

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
really like how they made the front -

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.710 
really like how they made the front -
it's<00:03:21.430> pretty<00:03:21.639> smooth<00:03:21.879> down<00:03:22.060> here<00:03:22.329> for<00:03:22.659> the

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
it's pretty smooth down here for the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.050 
it's pretty smooth down here for the
most<00:03:22.900> part<00:03:23.109> at<00:03:23.199> least<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:24.549> think<00:03:24.729> this<00:03:24.849> part

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
most part at least and I think this part

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.119 
most part at least and I think this part
over<00:03:25.150> here<00:03:25.269> totally<00:03:25.629> works<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.169> there's<00:03:27.069> a

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
over here totally works and there's a

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.300 
over here totally works and there's a
view<00:03:27.340> from<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.549> top<00:03:27.879> and<00:03:28.919> there's<00:03:29.919> the<00:03:30.159> bottom

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
view from the top and there's the bottom

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.280 
view from the top and there's the bottom
now<00:03:31.120> you'll<00:03:31.269> notice<00:03:31.449> that<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.690> landing<00:03:32.019> gear

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
now you'll notice that the landing gear

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.649 
now you'll notice that the landing gear
kind<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.099> schools<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.519> lot<00:03:33.639> which<00:03:33.940> is<00:03:34.060> OK<00:03:34.479> at

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
kind of schools a lot which is OK at

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.659 
kind of schools a lot which is OK at
first<00:03:34.930> but<00:03:35.650> if<00:03:35.829> you're<00:03:35.979> playing<00:03:36.159> with<00:03:36.340> this<00:03:36.519> on

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
first but if you're playing with this on

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.189 
first but if you're playing with this on
a<00:03:36.699> smooth<00:03:36.970> surface<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.659> notice<00:03:37.900> that<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.109> can

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
a smooth surface you notice that you can

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.050 
a smooth surface you notice that you can
move<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.650> helicopter<00:03:39.190> a<00:03:39.220> lot<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.819> we<00:03:39.940> could

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
move the helicopter a lot and we could

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.670 
move the helicopter a lot and we could
go<00:03:40.180> crazy<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.930> now<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:43.989> show<00:03:44.229> you<00:03:44.290> guys<00:03:44.440> the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
go crazy and now to show you guys the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.199 
go crazy and now to show you guys the
inside<00:03:44.709> we'll<00:03:45.400> start<00:03:45.639> by<00:03:45.729> loading<00:03:45.940> in<00:03:46.180> the

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
inside we'll start by loading in the

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.879 
inside we'll start by loading in the
pilots<00:03:46.629> and<00:03:46.930> you<00:03:47.049> can<00:03:47.169> do<00:03:47.260> that<00:03:47.379> by<00:03:47.500> opening<00:03:47.829> up

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
pilots and you can do that by opening up

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.050 
pilots and you can do that by opening up
these<00:03:48.040> two<00:03:48.220> parts<00:03:48.489> right<00:03:48.549> there<00:03:48.669> in<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:48.909> front

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
these two parts right there in the front

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.939 
these two parts right there in the front
which<00:03:49.900> is<00:03:50.019> actually<00:03:50.290> pretty<00:03:50.440> cool<00:03:50.560> looking

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
which is actually pretty cool looking

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.379 
which is actually pretty cool looking
from<00:03:51.099> the<00:03:51.190> front<00:03:51.220> they<00:03:51.699> kind<00:03:51.909> of<00:03:52.000> remind<00:03:52.239> me<00:03:52.299> of

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
from the front they kind of remind me of

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:53.309 
from the front they kind of remind me of
the<00:03:52.750> DeLorean

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
the DeLorean

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.349 
the DeLorean
but<00:03:53.919> anyway<00:03:54.220> is<00:03:54.400> pretty<00:03:54.639> easy<00:03:54.819> to<00:03:54.940> slide<00:03:55.239> in

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
but anyway is pretty easy to slide in

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.610 
but anyway is pretty easy to slide in
the<00:03:55.449> pilot<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:56.079> don't<00:03:56.109> have<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.349> rip<00:03:56.530> out

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
the pilot you don't have to rip out

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.069 
the pilot you don't have to rip out
anything<00:03:57.329> and<00:03:58.329> we'll<00:03:58.479> just<00:03:58.629> slide<00:03:58.780> them<00:03:58.930> in

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
anything and we'll just slide them in

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.589 
anything and we'll just slide them in
there<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.409> there<00:04:00.129> we<00:04:00.220> go<00:04:00.340> pretty<00:04:00.970> simple<00:04:01.120> and

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
there and there we go pretty simple and

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.449 
there and there we go pretty simple and
we<00:04:01.780> can<00:04:01.900> do<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.079> same<00:04:02.260> for<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.739> other<00:04:02.859> side

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.869 

not<00:04:06.459> bad

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
not bad

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.610 
not bad
and<00:04:07.750> there's<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.139> view<00:04:08.260> from<00:04:08.349> the<00:04:08.500> front

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
and there's the view from the front

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.710 
and there's the view from the front
again<00:04:08.949> and<00:04:09.069> as<00:04:09.729> you<00:04:09.849> can<00:04:09.909> see<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.419> really

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
again and as you can see the and really

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.030 
again and as you can see the and really
see<00:04:10.930> through<00:04:11.109> the<00:04:11.290> front<00:04:11.470> windshield<00:04:11.709> but

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
see through the front windshield but

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.640 
see through the front windshield but
that's<00:04:12.220> ok<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:12.729> now<00:04:13.569> we<00:04:13.629> can<00:04:13.840> load<00:04:13.959> in<00:04:14.079> the<00:04:14.199> ATV

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
that's ok and now we can load in the ATV

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.129 
that's ok and now we can load in the ATV
you<00:04:15.099> can<00:04:15.220> do<00:04:15.310> that<00:04:15.459> by<00:04:15.609> opening<00:04:15.909> up<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.930> ramp

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
you can do that by opening up the ramp

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.810 
you can do that by opening up the ramp
and<00:04:17.289> should<00:04:17.620> open<00:04:17.829> this<00:04:17.949> part<00:04:18.190> -<00:04:18.370> this<00:04:18.609> Way's<00:04:18.789> a

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
and should open this part - this Way's a

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.879 
and should open this part - this Way's a
little<00:04:19.030> easier<00:04:19.329> it's<00:04:19.659> a<00:04:19.690> little<00:04:19.930> mint<00:04:20.079> and<00:04:20.799> you

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
little easier it's a little mint and you

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.680 
little easier it's a little mint and you
just<00:04:21.009> drive<00:04:21.250> right<00:04:21.280> in<00:04:21.639> and<00:04:22.479> if<00:04:22.570> you<00:04:22.659> look

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
just drive right in and if you look

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.220 
just drive right in and if you look
closely<00:04:23.400> there's<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.700> tire<00:04:25.029> right<00:04:25.330> there

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
closely there's a tire right there

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.780 
closely there's a tire right there
and<00:04:26.350> what<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:26.650> do<00:04:26.770> is<00:04:26.890> you<00:04:27.010> slide<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.430> bumper

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
and what you do is you slide the bumper

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.430 
and what you do is you slide the bumper
of<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.030> ATV<00:04:28.240> underneath<00:04:28.660> it<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:28.990> that's<00:04:29.260> what

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
of the ATV underneath it and that's what

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.960 
of the ATV underneath it and that's what
holds<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.740> in<00:04:29.860> place<00:04:30.040> while<00:04:30.280> you're<00:04:30.460> in<00:04:30.700> the

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
holds it in place while you're in the

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.180 
holds it in place while you're in the
air<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:32.080> way<00:04:32.260> doesn't<00:04:32.440> fall<00:04:32.770> backwards

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
air this way doesn't fall backwards

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.830 
air this way doesn't fall backwards
while<00:04:33.490> you're<00:04:33.580> flying<00:04:33.700> around<00:04:34.000> well<00:04:34.630> this<00:04:34.720> of

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
while you're flying around well this of

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.940 
while you're flying around well this of
course<00:04:34.870> you<00:04:35.110> don't<00:04:35.260> really<00:04:35.350> like<00:04:35.590> them<00:04:35.740> then

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
course you don't really like them then

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.250 
course you don't really like them then
you<00:04:36.010> just<00:04:36.190> drop<00:04:36.310> them<00:04:36.490> off<00:04:36.580> any<00:04:36.760> time<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.630> then

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
you just drop them off any time and then

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.590 
you just drop them off any time and then
we<00:04:38.350> close<00:04:38.560> that<00:04:38.620> up<00:04:39.240> now<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.300> only

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
we close that up now the only

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.660 
we close that up now the only
disappointing<00:04:41.200> thing<00:04:41.440> is<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:42.400> cannot

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
disappointing thing is that you cannot

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.860 
disappointing thing is that you cannot
play<00:04:42.940> with<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.180> mid<00:04:43.360> section<00:04:43.570> right<00:04:43.840> there

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
play with the mid section right there

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.040 
play with the mid section right there
which<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:45.010> really<00:04:45.130> disappointing<00:04:45.820> because<00:04:46.050> if

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
which is really disappointing because if

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.420 
which is really disappointing because if
you<00:04:47.200> look<00:04:47.320> at<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.470> instruction<00:04:47.890> book<00:04:48.070> you

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
you look at the instruction book you

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.370 
you look at the instruction book you
actually<00:04:48.670> get<00:04:48.850> about<00:04:49.120> six<00:04:49.480> by<00:04:49.630> six<00:04:49.930> tons<00:04:50.170> worth

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
actually get about six by six tons worth

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.620 
actually get about six by six tons worth
of<00:04:50.530> playing<00:04:50.860> space<00:04:51.130> right<00:04:51.340> there<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:52.510> you

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
of playing space right there and you

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.440 
of playing space right there and you

don't<00:05:21.490> know<00:05:21.610> how<00:05:21.910> you<00:05:22.120> can<00:05:22.240> justify<00:05:22.510> having<00:05:22.930> it

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
don't know how you can justify having it

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.830 
don't know how you can justify having it
there<00:05:23.200> because<00:05:24.100> I<00:05:24.510> don't<00:05:25.510> think<00:05:25.630> you<00:05:25.690> should

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
there because I don't think you should

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.080 
there because I don't think you should
fly<00:05:26.170> and<00:05:26.380> drink<00:05:26.590> at<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.740> same<00:05:26.890> time<00:05:27.160> but<00:05:27.370> if

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
fly and drink at the same time but if

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.730 
fly and drink at the same time but if
that's<00:05:28.270> what<00:05:28.450> keeps<00:05:28.570> you<00:05:28.720> up<00:05:28.780> in<00:05:28.930> here<00:05:29.110> then<00:05:29.410> I

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
that's what keeps you up in here then I

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.370 
that's what keeps you up in here then I
guess<00:05:30.010> it's<00:05:30.160> okay<00:05:30.660> but<00:05:31.660> overall<00:05:31.960> this<00:05:32.170> is<00:05:32.230> a

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
guess it's okay but overall this is a

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.290 
guess it's okay but overall this is a
pretty<00:05:32.680> cool<00:05:32.860> model<00:05:33.220> and<00:05:33.400> now<00:05:33.790> we<00:05:33.850> can<00:05:34.030> move<00:05:34.150> on

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
pretty cool model and now we can move on

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.030 
pretty cool model and now we can move on
to<00:05:34.480> the<00:05:34.690> recommendations<00:05:37.920> overall<00:05:38.920> I<00:05:38.950> think

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
to the recommendations overall I think

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.710 
to the recommendations overall I think
this<00:05:39.280> is<00:05:39.430> a<00:05:39.460> really<00:05:39.700> good<00:05:39.880> set<00:05:40.120> and<00:05:40.360> I<00:05:40.390> totally
