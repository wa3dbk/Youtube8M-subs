00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.610
 you have to be very careful always with 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.559
 the all is worth I am now here a little 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.870
 risking month but should not because 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:22.050
 is that the george says it really 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.510
 because when you touch it, there is a 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.780
 hammer blows and leaves you nailed 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.780
 on the floor 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.300
 let's see let's open from behind because 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.690
 I want me to open the one that opens up 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.690
 the zip line 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.370
 and look since we are going to buy 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.370
 speed cola 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.629
 this one did not want to load the diva time yes 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.629
 ok let's buy the oci spears cola 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.230
 but good now with the voice 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.230
 we will earn a lot of money 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.960
 burned 3 burned bastard 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.020
 ok now we can hold a bit here 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.020
 to see one of the 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.440
 one of the strategies we can do 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.370
 at the beginning of the whole is to prepare us 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.220
 it's worth buying everything 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.750
 box to buy drinks buy everything and 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.660
 throw us around here and stay here as 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.960
 I am now worth with this closed door 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.830
 and with this also then all the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.180
 Zombies will come and here he went to the shit 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.460
 will come here inside the beginning I think that 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.799
 they do not come 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.750
 Ok then everything will come not there or 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.549
 from here inside that is going to be the 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.260
 responsible very very fast but I think 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.070
 that inside is even faster 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.900
 so well the beginning is a bitch is 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.990
 to see why the fuck we're in 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.560
 round 10 I will be able to make so many points 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.560
 as I said 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.200
 that man who has better gone out there but 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.200
 now we are in money 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.630
 because we will also have to open a 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.520
 door and everything 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.869
 better is to have to buy the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.670
 every 47 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.200
 Well this area is the widest 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.690
 map voucher here is where all the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.300
 world to calmly dizzy 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.110
 always anything that happens to us 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.050
 normal 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.980
 whatever it is whatever we have 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.260
 to pay that we have to kill more 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.390
 quietly or whatever we come 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.099
 here also with the chongo and all 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.510
 we can be doing ironing and now 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.209
 we have scored a goal but then 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.240
 I will buy it because good this ammunition 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.790
 come from very hard 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.380
 OK 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.600
 in the next we will improve 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.550
 and he's here to see if we can leave 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.440
 one and the ior one of the things that I 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.910
 I also recommend is when a 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.130
 death machine fixes that do not remain 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.790
 almost everything is worth to me we are going to try to leave 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.790
 only one 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.290
 to piss off the ior 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.490
 to take us year to the water and now 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.760
 take the nobel machine that is the go to 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.830
 empty at the moment 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.000
 Death to death machine careful to 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.620
 walk on your back that if you have 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.189
 caught with the george and the machine 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.189
 death is over 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.299
 just like here what I do is 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.610
 approaching when he gives me the host 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.830
 he accepted fuck bastard 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.690
 I approach and it will be that empty attempt 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.790
 funny in the chest the head about 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.960
 head especially when you forget 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.400
 giving against two for out is worth 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.140
 now zombies will be arriving there 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.569
 be attentive to me right away 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.999
 finish 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.030
 and I knew that they had been for the 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:40.160
 army 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.120
 ok we have the georges enough 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.040
 weakened 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.620
 we have two drinks we are about to 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.240
 buy the third one and improve and already the 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.740
 next will buy us the fourth 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.180
 drink may it be is in the kuwait 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.720
 since many of you will ask 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.820
 he has already gone to hell 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.390
 many ask if they discount 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.100
 revive if they kill us if we will 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.440
 we take a revive george I'm sure 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.000
 that someone would ask if we 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.000
 we took a revival george to 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.480
 and then they kill us they discount us what 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.130
 what it means is that we can take it out 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.440
 all the setbacks we want 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.359
 they will kill us and the last one 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.170
 we will buy the machine 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.030
 let us buy another 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.030
 so if you discount 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:31.629
 in the same way if they are taken from us 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.629
 we can all take out the george vale 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.199
 here you already know that you can not be fixed 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.110
 now and if one comes, I'm not going to turn 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.000
 shoot I give another turn is already 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.830
 also here it is good to learn the 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.480
 backs there is one there is another one 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.770
 The zombies respond to know where they are 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.599
 they can get caught 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.699
 Balearon followed by the improvement 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.060
 we will leave a good one in this round 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.820
 I think we're going 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.440
 and I'm also fine tuning the drink is going to 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.360
 be the riva 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.169
 Y 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.000
 look at this hammer 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:08.030
 until it opens there 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.140
 will not reopen because it is not going to 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.590
 use the strategy that I am 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.730
 explaining but if you were if I 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.620
 I would have prepared to endure here 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.980
 inside now no hammer would come out 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.930
 is 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.510
 until we opened we're going basically 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.340
 worth another death to another machine 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.540
 end of round the same thing happened to us 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.560
 for the we do it again let's try 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.560
 do not kill the zombie now 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.510
 although it is difficult to prove 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.700
 but they are not going to kill him anymore 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.750
 many hearts because he will leave us 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.750
 piglia today we are going to blows and omar 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.060
 alaya to kill this nothing to endure 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.160
 mascots 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.450
 I will try to control it to not 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.220
 finish killing is worth it because it 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.220
 will be close to dying at all but not 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.180
 for this 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.310
 or fuck me 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.590
 I'm friends 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:22.870
 you have this shit I'll put 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.610
 I'm going to put this because I'm the 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.700
 I put shit because yes because yes 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.750
 because because I get the age and you know or 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.340
 be that now what I'm going to do is 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.930
 get to round 11 and on Saturday you 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.720

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.250
 asshole and see now value is and 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.350
 do the strategy is to teach them 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.790
 or not now now I will value it worth it 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.650
 that good now I do not know if to connect in 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.580
 been in the next since the wind 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.580
 come are current
