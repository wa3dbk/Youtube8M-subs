 Highstreet had 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.840
 No 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.199
 ca 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.809
 r 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.309
 since this circumstance was produced by ca Alexander in Iraq 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.970
 therefore, be the case 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.919
 Has acquired dollars 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.319
 Mendelssohn 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:33.489
 Today's lecture revolves around the theme of how movie sets can get bigger 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.250
 do as they are 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.920
 First, a simple method that is suitable for example for windows 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.260
 and Ruth just create a wallpaper and kill it directly 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.660
 Bankruptcy can be but depending on the lighting give it an ugly states 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.810
 so that's it so man suddenly relaxes the picture then it works too 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.810
 Pans more realistic 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.220
 Now let's switch the studio off and on 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.200
 how to draw that part of it a shadow on the background image 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.180
 This effect can be done by a light source directly on the image ob 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.180
 weaknesses 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.630
 But the question remains how to make such a wallpaper 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.210
 you just offered such a city 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.649
 No fun that's a trick you realize that in the repetitions 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 only the part Hero was really built 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.290
 he was simply recorded several times in different positions 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.619
 nobody sits but i get to show you a graphics program 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:26.509
 we insert that last picture but the plague the previous one 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.279
 therefore we need a mask 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:39.039
 I like their children I just rough but that should be done thoroughly 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:53.589
 a mask is a layer that determines which parts should be transparent 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.589
 and which not 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.249
 I add Thomas Giesen to black wanted transparency 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:05.259
 and for the area at Asos 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.259
 and behold, the desired part appears 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.659
 that's what you do with all the other pictures 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.969
 in the tenth digital was copied and reduced 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.969
 but still the sky is missing 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.029
 Deutz koalieren so that fits 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.359
 Antonia neither a mask 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:46.829
 with the tool needs advance 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.829
 you can make great transitions 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:58.049
 The same principle can be found, for example, in the Lindenhof a band 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:02.649
 or a city 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.319
