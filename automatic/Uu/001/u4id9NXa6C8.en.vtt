00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.849
 lafon noirot active and recognized by the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.490
 professionals and users for 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.759
 its incomparable quality of comfort with 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.870
 more than 12 years of experience and success 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.220
 this success 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.710
 we owe it to the creation of our 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.470
 technocentre entirely dedicated to its 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.750
 conception its realization and its 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.730
 development but it is also the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.070
 mastery and know-how acquired in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.840
 our own foundry which allowed us to 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.399
 develop and patent 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.640
 most manufacturing processes 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.040
 innovative because the active cast to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.600
 a specific application 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.420
 our engineers created a cast iron 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.760
 special with an alloy of materials 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.129
 first rigorously dosed and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.559
 introduced into our furnaces at 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.180
 very precise moments of the process 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.879
 thermodynamic qualities of the cast iron 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.620
 active are multiplied by 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.700
 the introduction of a specially mixed 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.420
 invented at the time of casting in 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.220
 our foundry 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.960
 we do not just stick the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.840
 resistance behind a block of cast iron 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.040
 but I am tired of it or in the diffusion of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.770
 Heat is not homogeneous 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.630
 the differences in dilation created from 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.390
 noises and resistance showed 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.450
 high temperature which reduces its 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.030
 lifetime we integrate these two 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.250
 elements in one and the same body of 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.970
 heats up to guarantee an extraordinary 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.299
 heat diffusion the silence and the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.299
 longevity 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.759
 the tour de force to god here in our 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.090
 automated smelter or we put at 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.509
 point a unique industrial process that 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.610
 we are the only ones to master the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.000
 resistance and placed in the heart of the mold 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.579
 before casting in order to merge with 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.340
 the fault and to form only one and 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.850
 same homogeneous heating element and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.850
 monoblock 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.470
 furthermore wildlife is today a 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.920
 very interesting product in term 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.780
 ecology and sustainable development 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.970
 recyclable to infinity realized with 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.299
 zero-discharge processes by washing of 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.459
 fumes 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.230
 active melting requires very little 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.769
 of energy during its manufacture 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.290
 compared to the service rendered compare 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.150
 on this graph the energy costs of 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.930
 manufacturing compared to their 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.470
 use for example of an oven to 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.750
 microwave 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.079
 we use an average of five minutes per 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.879
 day be 90 hours a year and a 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.420
 active cast iron radiator that will 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.730
 operate more than 1100 hours a year 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.769
 actually the ecological impact of the 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.069
 manufacture of the latter is 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.000
 really very limited our radiators have 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.000
 different aesthetics 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.780
 it exists as well in mode it beats 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.540
 horizontal or vertical and 3 and in 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.909
 a wide range of power 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.829
 as many thermodynamic parameters 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:16.500
 own to everyone that necessarily requires 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.660
 a specific shape cast 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.120
 active cast with its inertia 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.340
 dynamic keeping in the room a 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.290
 constant hot spot and guarantees 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.400
 unparalleled performance in our 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.400
 wide range of radiators
