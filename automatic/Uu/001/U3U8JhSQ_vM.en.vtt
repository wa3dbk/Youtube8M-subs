00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the main thing about a float and fly is

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.599 
the main thing about a float and fly is
if<00:00:21.390> they're<00:00:21.539> all<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> same<00:00:21.900> size<00:00:22.109> wait<00:00:22.769> he's

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
if they're all the same size wait he's

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.540 
if they're all the same size wait he's
just<00:00:23.699> 16<00:00:24.119> ounce<00:00:24.359> jig<00:00:24.630> head<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.289> that's<00:00:26.189> one<00:00:26.460> of

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
just 16 ounce jig head and that's one of

a little bit of light blue on it and you
have<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:32.669> size<00:00:32.940> float<00:00:33.630> for

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
have to this is the right size float for

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.930 
have to this is the right size float for
that<00:00:34.469> size<00:00:34.710> fly<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.239> 78<00:00:36.870> inch<00:00:37.200> float<00:00:37.940> you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
that size fly it's a 78 inch float you

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.389 
that size fly it's a 78 inch float you
can<00:00:39.059> get<00:00:39.149> them<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.329> bass<00:00:39.510> pro<00:00:39.750> shop<00:00:40.129> but<00:00:41.129> that

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
can get them a bass pro shop but that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.119 
can get them a bass pro shop but that
that's<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.390> mean<00:00:43.079> that's<00:00:43.230> basically<00:00:43.410> it's

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
that's the I mean that's basically it's

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.040 
that's the I mean that's basically it's
not<00:00:44.370> anything<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.360> special<00:00:45.690> there's

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
not anything that special there's

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.270 
not anything that special there's
nothing<00:00:46.610> too<00:00:47.610> outrageous<00:00:47.820> about<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
nothing too outrageous about it's just a

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.250 
nothing too outrageous about it's just a
16,000<00:00:50.280> g<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.449> got<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> real<00:00:51.899> good<00:00:52.050> hook

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
16,000 g can it's got a real good hook

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.290 
16,000 g can it's got a real good hook
usually<00:00:52.680> must<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.070> hook<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.489> most<00:00:53.670> most<00:00:54.120> my

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
usually must that hook and most most my

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.410 
usually must that hook and most most my
flies<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:56.430> basically<00:00:56.730> diverse<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
flies and it's basically diverse like a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.470 
flies and it's basically diverse like a
crappie<00:00:57.719> fly<00:00:57.989> there's<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> whole<00:00:58.680> lot<00:00:58.890> of

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
crappie fly there's not a whole lot of

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
crappie fly there's not a whole lot of
specialty<00:01:00.480> stuff<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> way

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500
