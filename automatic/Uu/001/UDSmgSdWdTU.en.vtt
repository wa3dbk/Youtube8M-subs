okay guys so to kick things off this is

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.660 
okay guys so to kick things off this is
using<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.260> plastic<00:02:12.830> optic<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.370> this<00:02:13.520> was

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
using the plastic optic and this was

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.850 
using the plastic optic and this was
just<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:13.970> couple<00:02:14.210> of<00:02:14.360> shots<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.320> flowers

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
just a couple of shots of the flowers

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.890 
just a couple of shots of the flowers
that<00:02:16.070> was<00:02:16.220> behind<00:02:16.430> me<00:02:16.730> then<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.210> jump<00:02:17.630> straight

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
that was behind me then I jump straight

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.650 
that was behind me then I jump straight
into<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.380> fisheye<00:02:18.830> now<00:02:19.460> that's<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.120> cross

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
into the fisheye now that's the cross

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.870 
into the fisheye now that's the cross
shot<00:02:20.900> but<00:02:21.050> I've<00:02:21.170> cropped<00:02:21.440> down<00:02:21.740> that<00:02:22.400> with<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
shot but I've cropped down that with the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.460 
shot but I've cropped down that with the
wider<00:02:23.120> edge<00:02:23.390> that's<00:02:23.660> how<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.960> appears<00:02:24.290> on<00:02:24.440> a

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
wider edge that's how it appears on a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.380 
wider edge that's how it appears on a
full-frame<00:02:25.010> camera<00:02:25.460> so<00:02:25.610> here's<00:02:25.820> just<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.180> bunch

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
full-frame camera so here's just a bunch

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.060 
full-frame camera so here's just a bunch
of<00:02:26.540> different<00:02:26.810> shots<00:02:26.960> this<00:02:27.350> one<00:02:27.590> again<00:02:27.860> was

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
of different shots this one again was

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.890 
of different shots this one again was
with<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.430> plastic<00:02:28.880> optic<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.330> just<00:02:29.540> like<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
with the plastic optic I just like the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.080 
with the plastic optic I just like the
dreamy<00:02:30.230> effect<00:02:30.620> on<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.190> this<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:31.880> what

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
dreamy effect on that and this is what

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.360 
dreamy effect on that and this is what
lens<00:02:32.300> babies<00:02:32.750> all<00:02:33.020> about<00:02:33.410> that<00:02:33.710> fence<00:02:34.070> is<00:02:34.280> on

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
lens babies all about that fence is on

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.120 
lens babies all about that fence is on
an<00:02:34.550> angle<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:35.030> my<00:02:35.330> camera<00:02:35.870> but<00:02:36.320> by<00:02:36.560> shifting

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
an angle to my camera but by shifting

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.760 
an angle to my camera but by shifting
the<00:02:37.280> front<00:02:37.550> element<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.180> can<00:02:38.720> have<00:02:38.959> that<00:02:39.170> focal

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
the front element I can have that focal

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.070 
the front element I can have that focal
plane<00:02:40.070> on<00:02:40.370> an<00:02:40.640> angle<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.120> more<00:02:41.570> than<00:02:41.750> one<00:02:41.930> of

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
plane on an angle so more than one of

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.470 
plane on an angle so more than one of
those<00:02:42.230> poles<00:02:42.680> are<00:02:42.950> in<00:02:43.130> focus<00:02:43.459> whereas<00:02:44.330> with

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
those poles are in focus whereas with

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.449 
those poles are in focus whereas with
the<00:02:44.570> normal<00:02:44.990> lens<00:02:45.170> just<00:02:45.320> one<00:02:45.800> would<00:02:46.100> have<00:02:46.250> been

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
the normal lens just one would have been

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.310 
the normal lens just one would have been
and<00:02:46.760> then<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.060> later<00:02:47.270> ones<00:02:47.570> out<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:48.080> focus

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
and then the later ones out of focus

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.190 
and then the later ones out of focus
here<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.040> shift<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.730> plane<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.330> everything<00:02:51.020> to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
here I shift the plane and everything to

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.199 
here I shift the plane and everything to
the<00:02:51.320> sides<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:51.980> are<00:02:52.070> out<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.220> focus<00:02:52.520> but<00:02:53.150> a

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
the sides of it are out of focus but a

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.420 
the sides of it are out of focus but a
number<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.750> them<00:02:53.930> are<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.260> focus<00:02:54.770> it's<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.160> fun

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
number of them are in focus it's so fun

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.490 
number of them are in focus it's so fun
to<00:02:55.580> play<00:02:55.760> with<00:02:56.090> he's<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.660> series<00:02:57.110> of<00:02:57.140> shots

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
to play with he's a series of shots

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.320 
to play with he's a series of shots
using<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.950> double<00:02:58.310> glass<00:02:58.459> optic<00:02:58.790> where<00:02:59.270> I've

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
using the double glass optic where I've

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.630 
using the double glass optic where I've
just<00:02:59.420> moved<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.140> sweetspot<00:03:00.620> around<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.400> show

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
just moved the sweetspot around to show

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.310 
just moved the sweetspot around to show
all<00:03:01.970> different<00:03:02.450> effects<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:02.870> can<00:03:03.050> create

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
all different effects you can create

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.410 
all different effects you can create
really<00:03:03.620> not<00:03:03.950> moving<00:03:04.340> my<00:03:04.489> vantage<00:03:04.880> point<00:03:04.910> much

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
really not moving my vantage point much

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.990 
really not moving my vantage point much
at<00:03:05.630> all<00:03:05.750> but<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:06.920> know<00:03:06.950> showing<00:03:07.489> how<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:07.700> can

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
at all but you know showing how you can

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.120 
at all but you know showing how you can
really<00:03:08.270> hone<00:03:08.660> in<00:03:08.690> on<00:03:08.959> an<00:03:09.140> area<00:03:09.320> here's<00:03:09.830> another

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
really hone in on an area here's another

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.190 
really hone in on an area here's another
one<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.340> like<00:03:10.580> these<00:03:10.820> Turkish<00:03:11.360> lights<00:03:11.720> hanging

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
one I like these Turkish lights hanging

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.900 
one I like these Turkish lights hanging
in<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.410> restaurant<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.040> everything<00:03:13.340> else<00:03:13.760> is

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
in the restaurant and everything else is

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.640 
in the restaurant and everything else is
out<00:03:14.060> of<00:03:14.090> focus<00:03:14.360> these<00:03:15.110> are<00:03:15.350> just<00:03:15.470> some

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
out of focus these are just some

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.440 
out of focus these are just some
different<00:03:16.040> shots<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.519> flowers<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.060> that's

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
different shots of flowers so that's

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.900 
different shots of flowers so that's
using<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.260> normal<00:03:18.410> optic<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:19.670> that's

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
using the normal optic and then that's

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.240 
using the normal optic and then that's
