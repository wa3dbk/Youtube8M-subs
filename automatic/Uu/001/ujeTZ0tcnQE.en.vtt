00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.580
 so hello everybody for a long time there was no video 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.170
 but the reason came the parcel I 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.260
 now came home it turned out that the courier 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.849
 delivered me the package I ordered not 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:20.119
 so long ago from the ozon.ru store 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:25.769
 like that in general looks at the parcel 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:27.840
 ozon.ru and they have a fraction of what is here 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.779
 whether December in general some period was 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.649
 free courier delivery 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:39.210
 I thought why you have. if i 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.059
 free courier will deliver it 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.420
 right after all, and so I think that 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:55.680
 nothing is right to pace these 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:01:07.610
 everybody as a center for issuing orders like here 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:07.610
 sever all on piece tear 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.580
 no box no scooter 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.340
 mailing by the way went to now 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.700
 I'll tell you at once such power is packed 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.700
 notably 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.170
 I'm probably a little something that is not 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.690
 so do it with a knife quicker yaki 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:53.190
 I do not know somewhere, rubbed the stationery knife 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:56.460
 so here you can see already so it’s all we 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.030
 throwing out and here we have this 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.050
 funny subject kk u jumps we 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:09.740
 we get it 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:13.940
 and when discarding and we have this game 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:17.010
 kingdoms of amalur reckoning 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.030
 here even in Russian here is from 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.530
 recognized masters 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:29.040

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.040

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.000
 Choose your destiny on the back 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.760
 reborn your no longer defined 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.640
 fate amalur at your hands so here 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.019
 such a game is such a stick 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:57.060
 we will unpack at once and a disk that in principle 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:03:00.450
 pull so let's see what we have 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.390
 inside I hope the inclusion of what is not there 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.680
 not to burn when playing against playstation 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.110
 3 resin 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.690
 I have no time job doesn’t work 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.580
 someone's 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.990
 that's what it means to not even unpack 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.260
 playstation games 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:22.270
 Only a few days ago. May 3 game now I 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.980
 I will show all that I have so here 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.750
 beautiful box ordered by the way I her 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.450
 just for 300 rubles so i think it is not 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.920
 very expensive for playing on playstation i 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.970
 just played recently on the computer on 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.970
 I liked the joystick 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:49.379
 so the code is there just for an hour to close it 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:04:01.349
 so here we do here we have a disc 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:04:03.930
 I'll show you now 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:10.379
 drive here we have the first leaflet skoda 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:15.560
 Now I had you well as network admission 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:19.650
 ask him for a pass and a free suit 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:23.070
 just about in general for mass effect 3 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.710
 some kind of crap and so this one 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.360
 looks like a leaf 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:33.419
 so much further and much 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.639
 apparently yes she is very poor poor 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:42.479
 generally terrible shame shame very 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:45.659
 boy nothing 3 weave 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:49.639
 worth it and we'll play yet see we know 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:54.210

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:58.590

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:01.440

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:09.570

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:12.960
 edition front side back so here 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.780
 Generally such a hole and I promised everything 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:20.010

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:27.870
 a little here again as the year was 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:29.820
