you can see I'm using a flip and I don't
really<00:00:32.850> know<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.360> if<00:00:33.600> you're<00:00:33.930> supposed<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
really know what if you're supposed to

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.729 
really know what if you're supposed to
find<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.739> balance<00:00:34.920> point<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.820> what<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.989> I'm

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
find a balance point but what so I'm

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.200 
find a balance point but what so I'm
just<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.129> experiment<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.000> I'm

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
just going to experiment with it I'm

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.510 
just going to experiment with it I'm
going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> go<00:00:39.540> around<00:00:39.660> twice<00:00:40.129> one<00:00:41.129> time<00:00:41.340> I'm

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
going to go around twice one time I'm

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.670 
going to go around twice one time I'm
going<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> hold<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.030> right<00:00:42.690> down<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
going to hold it right down here and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.100 
going to hold it right down here and
then<00:00:43.980> maybe<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.399> next<00:00:44.550> time<00:00:44.730> pull<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
then maybe the next time pull it up a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.650 
then maybe the next time pull it up a
little<00:00:46.230> higher<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.910> think<00:00:48.539> it's

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
little higher like like I think it's

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.130 
little higher like like I think it's
supposed<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.379> we'll<00:00:50.250> see<00:00:50.520> i<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.140> some

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
supposed to be we'll see i have a some

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.459 
supposed to be we'll see i have a some
stairs<00:00:52.469> which<00:00:52.829> i<00:00:53.010> mentioned<00:00:53.640> earlier<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:55.260> i

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
stairs which i mentioned earlier but i

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.930 
stairs which i mentioned earlier but i
refer<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.129> them<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.399> stairs<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.879> go

refer to them as the stairs that go

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
refer to them as the stairs that go
nowhere<00:00:57.059> because<00:00:57.570> they<00:00:57.750> got<00:00:57.899> three<00:00:58.590> or<00:00:58.680> four

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
nowhere because they got three or four

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.220 
nowhere because they got three or four
sets<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.280> stairs<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.910> go<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.420> do

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
sets of stairs that just go up and do

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.670 
sets of stairs that just go up and do
nothing<00:01:02.809> starting<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.019> little<00:01:04.110> dark<00:01:04.470> so
