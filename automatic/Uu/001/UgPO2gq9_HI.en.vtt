00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
University of Hawaii said but if the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.700 
University of Hawaii said but if the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
results of the Opera researchers turned

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.250 
results of the Opera researchers turned
out<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:47.010> be<00:04:47.130> true<00:04:47.310> it<00:04:48.090> could<00:04:48.360> be<00:04:48.420> the<00:04:48.600> first

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
out to be true it could be the first

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.680 
out to be true it could be the first
hand<00:04:49.680> that<00:04:49.860> neutrinos<00:04:50.370> can<00:04:51.000> take<00:04:51.210> a<00:04:51.240> shortcut

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
hand that neutrinos can take a shortcut

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.430 
hand that neutrinos can take a shortcut
through<00:04:51.900> space<00:04:52.310> through<00:04:53.310> extra<00:04:53.790> dimensions

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
through space through extra dimensions

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.710 
through space through extra dimensions
special<00:04:55.440> relativity<00:04:55.970> only<00:04:56.970> holds<00:04:57.360> in<00:04:57.480> flat

special relativity only holds in flat

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.740 
special relativity only holds in flat
space<00:04:57.980> so<00:04:58.980> if<00:04:59.460> there<00:04:59.790> is<00:04:59.880> a<00:04:59.910> warped<00:05:00.330> fifth

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
space so if there is a warped fifth

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.110 
space so if there is a warped fifth
dimension<00:05:01.290> it<00:05:01.800> is<00:05:01.950> possible<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:02.640> on<00:05:02.850> other
