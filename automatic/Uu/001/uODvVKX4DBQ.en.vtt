00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.509 
everything seemed to fall right in place
here's<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.399> few<00:02:07.880> things<00:02:08.380> where<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.560> driver<00:02:11.500> was

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
here's a few things where the driver was

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.759 
here's a few things where the driver was
quite<00:02:13.519> a<00:02:13.549> good<00:02:13.700> fit<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.060> finish<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.260> far<00:02:15.530> we've

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
quite a good fit and finish so far we've

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.650 
quite a good fit and finish so far we've
stuck<00:02:16.040> in<00:02:16.190> an<00:02:16.459> errata<00:02:16.790> wheel<00:02:17.060> tub<00:02:17.360> on<00:02:17.510> both

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660

slowly<00:02:27.530> but<00:02:27.799> surely<00:02:27.830> working<00:02:28.280> away<00:02:28.580> over<00:02:28.910> to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
slowly but surely working away over to

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.289 
slowly but surely working away over to
the<00:02:29.440> side<00:02:30.440> of<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.620> car<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.130> left<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.910> center

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
the side of the car I left the center

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.890 
the side of the car I left the center
section<00:02:32.600> in<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.920> when<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.430> set<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.060> new

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
section in so that when I set the new

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.920 
section in so that when I set the new
outer<00:02:36.519> trunk<00:02:37.519> drops<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.180> would<00:02:38.390> kind<00:02:38.810> of

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
outer trunk drops and I would kind of

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.199 
outer trunk drops and I would kind of
get<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.470> good<00:02:39.709> guesstimate<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.340> if<00:02:40.880> they<00:02:41.150> were

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
get a good guesstimate of if they were

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.150 
get a good guesstimate of if they were
in<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.930> right<00:02:42.079> spot<00:02:42.440> or<00:02:42.470> if<00:02:42.739> there<00:02:42.920> was<00:02:43.010> any

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
in the right spot or if there was any

more playing or cutting their grind and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.770 
more playing or cutting their grind and
that<00:02:45.590> needed<00:02:45.859> to<00:02:45.950> be<00:02:46.100> done<00:02:46.280> well<00:02:47.269> I<00:02:47.359> get<00:02:47.570> it<00:02:47.660> all

everything<00:03:01.400> lines<00:03:01.519> up<00:03:01.760> correctly<00:03:03.070> once<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.220> had

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
everything lines up correctly once I had

the<00:03:04.810> outer<00:03:06.340> drops<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.640> I<00:03:08.890> decided<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.040> go<00:03:10.190> ahead

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
the outer drops in I decided to go ahead

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.250 
the outer drops in I decided to go ahead
and<00:03:10.489> cut<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.760> center<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.150> floor<00:03:11.359> out<00:03:11.600> that

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
and cut the center of the floor out that

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.920 
and cut the center of the floor out that
was

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
to be so I really didn't need that

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.149

center was correct

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.800

next Randy used an HTP air nibbler to
trim<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.170> new<00:04:10.200> trunk<00:04:10.650> supports<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.400> then<00:04:11.819> he

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
trim the new trunk supports and then he

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.699 
trim the new trunk supports and then he
clamped<00:04:12.269> them<00:04:12.390> in<00:04:12.540> with<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.780> new<00:04:12.959> tail<00:04:13.230> panel<00:04:13.530> we

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
clamped them in with a new tail panel we

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.949 
clamped them in with a new tail panel we
got<00:04:13.890> from<00:04:14.099> desert<00:04:14.400> Valley<00:04:14.609> auto<00:04:14.849> parts<00:04:15.299> then

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
got from desert Valley auto parts then

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.420 
got from desert Valley auto parts then
the<00:04:16.109> forward<00:04:16.350> part<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.739> trunk<00:04:17.039> floor<00:04:17.250> was

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
the forward part of the trunk floor was

the forward part of the trunk floor was
screwed<00:04:17.729> tight<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.239> all<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.750> seams<00:04:19.019> were

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
screwed tight and all the seams were

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.800 
screwed tight and all the seams were
welded<00:04:19.560> up<00:04:19.669> finally<00:04:20.669> he<00:04:20.910> ground<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.299> welds<00:04:21.690> on

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
welded up finally he ground the welds on

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.719 
welded up finally he ground the welds on
top<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.440> bottom<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:23.250> make<00:04:23.430> for<00:04:23.669> an

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
top and bottom to make for an

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.050 
top and bottom to make for an
undetectable<00:04:24.450> repair<00:04:25.250> in<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.430> rear

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
undetectable repair in the rear

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.350 
undetectable repair in the rear
I<00:04:27.090> met<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.979> trunk<00:04:28.979> patches<00:04:29.490> with<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:30.240> new

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
I met the trunk patches with the new

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.560 
I met the trunk patches with the new
rear<00:04:30.570> body<00:04:30.810> panel<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.349> we<00:04:31.470> put<00:04:31.710> in<00:04:31.940> I<00:04:32.940> was

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
rear body panel that we put in I was

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.409 
rear body panel that we put in I was
able<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.960> weld<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:34.349> right<00:04:34.560> along<00:04:34.680> that<00:04:35.280> seam<00:04:35.639> to

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
able to weld it right along that seam to

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.839 
able to weld it right along that seam to
where<00:04:36.599> it<00:04:36.720> was<00:04:36.900> virtually<00:04:37.770> undetectable<00:04:38.490> from

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
where it was virtually undetectable from

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.450 
where it was virtually undetectable from
the<00:04:38.970> underneath<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.860> was<00:04:40.860> able<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:41.160> drag<00:04:41.430> a

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
the underneath and was able to drag a

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.940 
the underneath and was able to drag a
flat

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.600 

but<00:04:45.950> have<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.570> had<00:04:47.570> to<00:04:47.840> overlap<00:04:48.710> about<00:04:49.190> two

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
but have I had to overlap about two

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.570 
but have I had to overlap about two
inches<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:50.000> each<00:04:50.210> each<00:04:50.720> metal<00:04:51.200> to<00:04:52.130> make<00:04:52.280> sure

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
inches of each each metal to make sure

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.140 
inches of each each metal to make sure
the<00:04:53.180> strength<00:04:53.540> was<00:04:53.840> there<00:04:54.050> for<00:04:54.290> the<00:04:54.380> trunk<00:04:54.710> and

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
the strength was there for the trunk and

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.970 
the strength was there for the trunk and
that<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.180> had<00:04:56.450> plenty<00:04:56.660> of<00:04:56.810> metal<00:04:57.170> to<00:04:57.380> grind<00:04:57.830> away

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
that I had plenty of metal to grind away

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.420 
that I had plenty of metal to grind away
and<00:04:58.340> be<00:04:58.700> able<00:04:58.760> to<00:04:58.940> work<00:04:59.120> later
