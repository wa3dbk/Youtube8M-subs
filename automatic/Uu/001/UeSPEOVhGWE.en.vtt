00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.920
Did you hear that?

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:18.858
And what if they really turn out to be black and on top of that alive?

00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:25.111
Yes. We are standing face to face with them.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.700
Livid as a TB death rattle,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.920
Livid as the droppings of a man with jaundice

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.380
livid as jealousy,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.700
Hail, the livid!

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.220
This play was written by the white and is destined for the white audience.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.091
What? So that your sons won’t know shackles?

00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:59.891
It’s a beautiful dream, only you don’t know your sons just yet.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.680
I’m dying without issue.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.220
I’m counting on your sense of honour.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.920
Give my bloody uniform to the army museum. Aim! Fire!

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.600
You are Africa!

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:24.640
Oh the wonderful night! And I hate you!

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.020
I hate you for the effort which is rejecting you.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.060
The hatred for you.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.240
It would require so little

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.380
and I could enjoy your face,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.840
your body, your moves, and your heart.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.280
Are you white?

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.840
First thing I have to tell you are that, they are not white.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.140
They either are lying or are mistaken.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.120
They are pink, or even yellow.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.560
Are you yellow?

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.020
Yes.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.820
The Blacks
