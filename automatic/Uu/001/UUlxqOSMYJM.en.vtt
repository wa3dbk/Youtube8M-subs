00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.890 
themselves um but in my case well I
thought<00:00:27.240> they<00:00:27.570> did

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
thought they did

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.989 
thought they did
I<00:00:27.929> thought<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:28.499> knew<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:29.400> actually

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:29.999 
I thought they knew but actually

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.200 
I thought they knew but actually
apparently<00:00:30.539> they<00:00:30.929> didn't<00:00:31.259> so<00:00:31.829> um<00:00:32.310> yeah<00:00:32.880> I
