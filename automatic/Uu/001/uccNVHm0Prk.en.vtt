00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
wide and it causes everything to get

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.430 
wide and it causes everything to get
messed<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.369> if<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> runs<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.180> side<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.380> as

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
you can see here what i'm doing here is

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.990 
you can see here what i'm doing here is
i'm<00:00:37.230> making<00:00:37.590> everything<00:00:37.890> compressed<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
i'm making everything compressed to the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.389 
i'm making everything compressed to the
middle<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> field<00:00:39.870> which<00:00:40.140> will<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
middle of the field which will and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.910 
middle of the field which will and
you'll<00:00:41.969> see<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.050> couple<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.410> plays<00:00:43.680> here

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
you'll see it in a couple of plays here

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.250 
you'll see it in a couple of plays here
maybe<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.399> one<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> can't<00:00:45.120> remember<00:00:45.329> right

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
maybe this one I can't remember right

maybe this one I can't remember right
here<00:00:46.440> you'll<00:00:46.710> see<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.890> right<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.480> by

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
here you'll see it right here by

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.060 
here you'll see it right here by
compressing<00:00:49.020> everything<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> middle<00:00:50.039> of

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
compressing everything to the middle of

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.430 
compressing everything to the middle of
the<00:00:50.129> field<00:00:50.399> you're<00:00:51.210> basically<00:00:51.420> taking<00:00:51.989> away

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the field you're basically taking away

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.410 
the field you're basically taking away
anything<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> inside<00:00:53.820> you're<00:00:54.090> forcing

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
anything to the inside you're forcing

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.850 
anything to the inside you're forcing
all<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> runs<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.079> go<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> outside<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
all the runs to go to the outside and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.250 
all the runs to go to the outside and
when<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.460> compress<00:00:57.149> everything<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:58.050> take

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
when you compress everything you take

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.590 
when you compress everything you take
away<00:00:58.530> those<00:00:58.680> polling<00:00:59.100> bloggers<00:00:59.550> they<00:01:00.420> can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
away those polling bloggers they can

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
see here I'm just pinching the line I'm

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.670 
see here I'm just pinching the line I'm
pinching<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> line<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.080> pinching<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
pinching the line and pinching the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.670 
pinching the line and pinching the
linebackers<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> had<00:01:22.200> two<00:01:22.439> guys

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
linebackers you can see I had two guys

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.980 
linebackers you can see I had two guys
right<00:01:23.070> there<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.430> make<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.759> play<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.479> was

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
right there to make that play it was

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.020 
right there to make that play it was
just<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.380> fluke<00:01:25.650> where<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> blocker<00:01:26.400> took<00:01:26.820> two

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
just a fluke where the blocker took two

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.260 
just a fluke where the blocker took two
of<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:27.240> guys<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.670> you'll<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.090> right

there and the blocker just takes them
both<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.090> that's<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> want

so<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.840> compressing<00:01:43.409> everything

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770

right and the left with one set up so
that's<00:02:06.119> all<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.360> need<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> do<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.899> obviously

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
that's all you need to do and obviously

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.339 
that's all you need to do and obviously
this<00:02:07.409> stops<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:08.520> will<00:02:08.580> stop<00:02:09.000> traps<00:02:09.450> this

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
this stops this will stop traps this

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.380 
this stops this will stop traps this
will<00:02:10.560> stop<00:02:10.860> any<00:02:11.190> runs<00:02:11.520> up<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.760> middle<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
will stop any runs up the middle and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.640 
will stop any runs up the middle and
you're<00:02:12.750> not<00:02:12.870> sacrificing

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
you're not sacrificing

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.880 
you're not sacrificing
anything<00:02:14.159> in<00:02:14.250> coverage<00:02:14.579> at<00:02:14.790> all<00:02:15.739> so<00:02:16.739> it's

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
anything in coverage at all so it's

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.440 
anything in coverage at all so it's
simply<00:02:17.189> just<00:02:17.220> making<00:02:17.790> one<00:02:17.879> adjustment<00:02:18.269> to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
simply just making one adjustment to

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.839 
simply just making one adjustment to
stop<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> run<00:02:19.019> play<00:02:19.340> now<00:02:20.340> I'm<00:02:20.459> going<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.700> go<00:02:20.790> to

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
stop a run play now I'm going to go to

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.259 
stop a run play now I'm going to go to
the<00:02:21.150> 46<00:02:22.140> normal<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:23.340> play<00:02:23.579> is<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:24.030> just

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
the 46 normal and the play is you just

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.589 
the 46 normal and the play is you just
do<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> cover<00:02:24.689> three<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.500> base<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:25.799> line<00:02:26.159> and

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
do a cover three and you base a line and

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.940 
do a cover three and you base a line and
what<00:02:27.599> I've<00:02:27.689> found<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:28.049> be<00:02:28.200> effective<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.799> if

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
what I've found to be effective is if

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.619 
what I've found to be effective is if
sometimes<00:02:29.459> if<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.730> spread<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.209> line<00:02:30.390> or

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
sometimes if you spread the line or

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.780 
sometimes if you spread the line or
pinch<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.109> line<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:32.040> really<00:02:32.220> depends<00:02:32.609> on<00:02:32.730> what

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
pinch the line it really depends on what

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.479 
pinch the line it really depends on what
you<00:02:32.970> want<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.359> but<00:02:33.829> both<00:02:34.829> ways<00:02:35.099> I've<00:02:35.310> found

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
you want to do but both ways I've found

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.160 
you want to do but both ways I've found
to<00:02:35.640> be<00:02:35.760> rather<00:02:35.939> effective<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.810> first<00:02:36.930> play

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
to be rather effective the first play

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.690 
to be rather effective the first play
that<00:02:37.349> doesn't<00:02:37.560> showcase<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:38.250> effectiveness

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
that doesn't showcase the effectiveness

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.240 
that doesn't showcase the effectiveness
of<00:02:38.879> this<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.329> this<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.680> different<00:02:41.069> a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
of this but this is just a different a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.649 
of this but this is just a different a
different<00:02:41.310> look<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.120> give<00:02:42.269> I'm<00:02:42.450> going<00:02:42.599> to

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
different look you can give I'm going to

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.809 
different look you can give I'm going to
pinch<00:02:42.959> or<00:02:43.349> crash<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.859> line<00:02:44.010> down<00:02:44.280> right<00:02:44.549> here

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
pinch or crash the line down right here

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.610 
pinch or crash the line down right here
and<00:02:44.849> as<00:02:45.629> you<00:02:45.750> can<00:02:45.870> see<00:02:47.060> once<00:02:48.060> again<00:02:48.230> Matt<00:02:49.230> Elam

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.710

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
is free off the edge there because

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.449 
is free off the edge there because
everything<00:02:52.079> is<00:02:52.200> being<00:02:52.379> compressed<00:02:52.769> down<00:02:53.220> to

everything is being compressed down to
