hi<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.480> John<00:00:06.810> Kendall<00:00:07.080> from<00:00:07.259> gue<00:00:07.589> UK<00:00:08.040> and

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
hi this is John Kendall from gue UK and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.430 
hi this is John Kendall from gue UK and
today<00:00:09.300> I'm<00:00:09.480> going<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.719> be<00:00:09.780> talking<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.200> sport

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
today I'm going to be talking to sport

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.430 
today I'm going to be talking to sport
over<00:00:10.650> TV<00:00:10.889> about<00:00:11.429> pinning<00:00:11.700> techniques<00:00:12.440> what

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
over TV about pinning techniques what

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.600 
over TV about pinning techniques what
we're<00:00:13.590> going<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:13.889> looking<00:00:14.009> at<00:00:14.280> is

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
we're going to be looking at is

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.400 
we're going to be looking at is
different<00:00:15.150> methods<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.690> propulsion<00:00:16.080> that

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
different methods of propulsion that

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.310 
different methods of propulsion that
enable<00:00:16.830> us<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.920> get<00:00:17.160> closer<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> bottom

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
enable us to get closer to the bottom

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.870 
enable us to get closer to the bottom

stir up less silt and impact on the
environment<00:00:21.500> significantly<00:00:22.500> less<00:00:22.769> than<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
environment significantly less than the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.529 
environment significantly less than the
traditional<00:00:24.140> recreational<00:00:25.140> flutter<00:00:25.590> kick

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
traditional recreational flutter kick

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.269 
traditional recreational flutter kick
now<00:00:27.539> before<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.080> can<00:00:28.199> start<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.830> propulsion

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
now before we can start with propulsion

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.740 
now before we can start with propulsion
we<00:00:29.519> need<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.760> think<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.029> little<00:00:30.119> bit<00:00:30.300> more<00:00:30.539> than

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
we need to think a little bit more than

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.440 
we need to think a little bit more than
our<00:00:30.900> basic<00:00:31.230> platform<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> water<00:00:32.450> what

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
our basic platform in the water what

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.790 
our basic platform in the water what
we're<00:00:33.570> looking<00:00:33.840> at<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.350> try<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.620> get<00:00:34.739> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
we're looking at is just try and get a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.010 
we're looking at is just try and get a
nice<00:00:35.100> solid<00:00:35.550> body<00:00:35.910> position<00:00:36.390> where<00:00:36.989> our

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
nice solid body position where our

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.470 
nice solid body position where our
shoulders<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.739> our<00:00:38.219> knees<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> same

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
shoulders and our knees are the same

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.979 
shoulders and our knees are the same
depth<00:00:39.829> nice<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> flat<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:42.000> our<00:00:42.149> head<00:00:42.360> tilted

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
depth nice and flat with our head tilted

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.940 
depth nice and flat with our head tilted
upwards<00:00:43.379> our<00:00:43.920> knees<00:00:44.250> bent<00:00:44.850> upwards<00:00:45.350> our<00:00:46.350> arms

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
upwards our knees bent upwards our arms

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.889 
upwards our knees bent upwards our arms
can<00:00:47.190> come<00:00:47.340> forwards<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.450> give<00:00:48.629> us<00:00:48.719> more

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
can come forwards to give us more

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.529 
can come forwards to give us more
stability<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.649> well<00:00:49.969> this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.390> call

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
stability as well this is what we call

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.610 
stability as well this is what we call
our<00:00:51.690> basic<00:00:52.050> trim<00:00:52.440> position<00:00:57.289> once<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.590> our

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
our basic trim position once we have our

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.229 
our basic trim position once we have our
basic<00:00:59.070> trim<00:00:59.340> position<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.879> everything

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
basic trim position with everything

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.000 
basic trim position with everything
nicely<00:01:00.449> balanced<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.859> start

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
nicely balanced then we can start

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.640 
nicely balanced then we can start
looking<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.520> our<00:01:02.789> propulsion<00:01:03.149> techniques<00:01:03.690> we

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
looking at our propulsion techniques we

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.780 
looking at our propulsion techniques we
have<00:01:04.799> two<00:01:04.979> techniques<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.430> we're<00:01:05.610> going<00:01:05.729> to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
have two techniques that we're going to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.820 
have two techniques that we're going to
look<00:01:05.850> at<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.299> video<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:07.439> one<00:01:07.710> we

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
look at in this video the first one we

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.010 
look at in this video the first one we
call<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> frog<00:01:08.369> kick<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
call the frog kick so now we can see the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.020 
call the frog kick so now we can see the
diver<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.290> screen<00:01:13.790> demonstrating<00:01:14.790> towards

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
diver on screen demonstrating towards

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.390 
diver on screen demonstrating towards
the<00:01:15.150> Frog<00:01:15.360> kick<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.009> he's<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the Frog kick we can see that he's in a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.670 
the Frog kick we can see that he's in a
good<00:01:17.640> trim<00:01:18.150> position<00:01:18.630> his<00:01:18.930> knees<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.560> his

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
good trim position his knees and his

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280 
good trim position his knees and his
shoulders<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.340> same<00:01:20.610> depth<00:01:20.850> his<00:01:21.810> feet<00:01:22.080> are

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
shoulders or the same depth his feet are

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.200 
shoulders or the same depth his feet are
lifted<00:01:22.439> his<00:01:22.860> head<00:01:23.070> his<00:01:23.250> back<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.670> his<00:01:23.850> arms<00:01:24.119> are

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
lifted his head his back of his arms are

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.230 
lifted his head his back of his arms are
forward<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.630> give<00:01:24.780> him<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.049> stability<00:01:26.240> in

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
forward to give him that stability in

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
forward to give him that stability in
order<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.600> make<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> frog<00:01:28.080> kick<00:01:28.320> he<00:01:28.829> separates

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
order to make a frog kick he separates

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.510 
order to make a frog kick he separates
his<00:01:29.549> feet<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.509> twists<00:01:31.170> his<00:01:31.290> ankles<00:01:31.710> brings

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
his feet and twists his ankles brings

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.069 
his feet and twists his ankles brings
his<00:01:32.700> feet<00:01:32.939> back<00:01:33.150> together<00:01:33.390> again<00:01:33.689> almost

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
his feet back together again almost

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.030 
his feet back together again almost
making<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.590> clapping<00:01:35.130> motion<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.759> his<00:01:35.790> fins

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
making a clapping motion with his fins

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.219 
making a clapping motion with his fins
he<00:01:38.040> slightly<00:01:38.490> extends<00:01:39.150> his<00:01:39.270> legs<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.750> he<00:01:39.960> claps

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
he slightly extends his legs as he claps

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.800 
he slightly extends his legs as he claps
the<00:01:40.409> fins<00:01:40.590> together

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
the fins together

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.960 
the fins together
we<00:01:42.260> can<00:01:42.440> then<00:01:42.560> see<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:42.799> he<00:01:43.070> glides<00:01:43.460> for<00:01:43.940> a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
we can then see that he glides for a

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.760 
we can then see that he glides for a
while<00:01:44.210> this<00:01:45.080> is<00:01:45.229> one<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.560> nice<00:01:45.740> things

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
while this is one of the nice things

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.100 
while this is one of the nice things
about<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.490> fall<00:01:46.700> kick<00:01:46.909> that<00:01:47.540> we<00:01:47.630> get<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.810> kick

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
about the fall kick that we get a kick

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.469 
about the fall kick that we get a kick
and<00:01:48.470> then<00:01:48.650> a<00:01:48.710> glide<00:01:49.070> phase<00:01:49.369> this<00:01:50.030> makes<00:01:50.299> it

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
and then a glide phase this makes it

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.730 
and then a glide phase this makes it
very<00:01:50.600> efficient<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.900> second<00:01:57.290> kick<00:01:57.530> that

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
very efficient the second kick that

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.260 
very efficient the second kick that
we're<00:01:57.860> going<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:58.130> look<00:01:58.310> at<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.790> modification

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
we're going to look at is a modification

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.859 
we're going to look at is a modification
of<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.080> traditional<00:02:00.560> flutter<00:02:00.800> kick<00:02:01.780> what<00:02:02.780> we

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
of the traditional flutter kick what we

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.810 
of the traditional flutter kick what we
do<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.140> we<00:02:03.259> start<00:02:03.530> in<00:02:03.740> our<00:02:03.860> trimming<00:02:04.220> position

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
do is we start in our trimming position
