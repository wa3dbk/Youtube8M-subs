hey<00:00:05.580> guys<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.690> tutorial<00:00:06.870> I<00:00:07.439> show<00:00:08.069> you

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
hey guys in this tutorial I show you

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.730 
hey guys in this tutorial I show you
some<00:00:08.460> very<00:00:08.700> simple<00:00:09.000> keyframing<00:00:09.450> methods

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.560 

this<00:00:14.740> video<00:00:15.129> is<00:00:15.400> going<00:00:15.639> to<00:00:15.730> be<00:00:15.849> pretty<00:00:16.270> simple

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
this video is going to be pretty simple

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.499 
this video is going to be pretty simple
I'm<00:00:17.320> making<00:00:18.010> it<00:00:18.130> mostly<00:00:18.520> for<00:00:18.820> people<00:00:19.000> who<00:00:19.360> are

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
I'm making it mostly for people who are

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.230 
I'm making it mostly for people who are
new<00:00:19.720> to<00:00:19.750> anime<00:00:20.230> studio<00:00:20.680> or<00:00:21.189> for<00:00:21.939> people<00:00:22.060> who

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
new to anime studio or for people who

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.839 
new to anime studio or for people who
are<00:00:22.539> transferring<00:00:23.230> from<00:00:23.500> flash<00:00:23.860> to<00:00:24.490> anime

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
are transferring from flash to anime

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.019 
are transferring from flash to anime
studio<00:00:25.300> because<00:00:26.259> the<00:00:27.039> way<00:00:27.220> the<00:00:27.400> layers<00:00:27.699> and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
studio because the way the layers and

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.769 
studio because the way the layers and
keyframes<00:00:28.539> work<00:00:28.899> are<00:00:29.110> different<00:00:29.710> in<00:00:29.919> each<00:00:30.779> now

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
keyframes work are different in each now

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.319 
keyframes work are different in each now
it's<00:00:32.169> important<00:00:32.559> to<00:00:32.590> point<00:00:32.829> out<00:00:33.010> that<00:00:33.329> layers

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
it's important to point out that layers

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.780 
it's important to point out that layers
and<00:00:34.660> keyframes<00:00:35.110> are<00:00:35.320> very<00:00:35.620> important<00:00:36.219> in<00:00:36.430> each

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
and keyframes are very important in each

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.910 
and keyframes are very important in each
of<00:00:37.059> these<00:00:37.270> softwares<00:00:38.110> it's<00:00:38.410> just<00:00:38.590> that<00:00:38.770> they

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
of these softwares it's just that they

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.369 
of these softwares it's just that they
work<00:00:39.129> a<00:00:39.340> little<00:00:39.520> bit<00:00:39.730> differently<00:00:40.090> so<00:00:40.379> for

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
work a little bit differently so for

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.910 
work a little bit differently so for
instance<00:00:41.800> in<00:00:42.100> flash<00:00:42.690> when<00:00:43.690> I<00:00:43.719> make<00:00:44.410> my<00:00:44.590> layers

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
instance in flash when I make my layers

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.780 
instance in flash when I make my layers
I<00:00:45.280> can<00:00:45.940> see<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:47.230> timeline<00:00:47.560> of<00:00:48.070> each<00:00:48.430> of<00:00:48.670> those

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
I can see the timeline of each of those

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.130 
I can see the timeline of each of those
layers<00:00:49.090> all<00:00:49.780> at<00:00:50.260> once<00:00:50.500> on<00:00:50.980> my<00:00:51.370> timeline<00:00:52.140> with

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
layers all at once on my timeline with

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.069 
layers all at once on my timeline with
anime<00:00:53.560> studio<00:00:53.860> you<00:00:54.579> can<00:00:54.730> only<00:00:55.030> focus<00:00:55.690> in<00:00:55.930> on

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
anime studio you can only focus in on

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.010 
anime studio you can only focus in on
one<00:00:56.500> timeline<00:00:56.920> at<00:00:57.430> a<00:00:57.460> time<00:00:57.850> for<00:00:58.450> any<00:00:58.630> given

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
one timeline at a time for any given

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.380 
one timeline at a time for any given
layer<00:00:59.230> you<00:00:59.860> have<00:00:59.920> to<00:01:00.010> click<00:01:00.280> on<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:00.520> to<00:01:00.820> see<00:01:01.270> it

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
layer you have to click on it to see it

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.490 
layer you have to click on it to see it
so<00:01:02.320> those<00:01:02.620> are<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.100> main<00:01:03.280> differences<00:01:04.500> so

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
so those are the main differences so

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.499 
so those are the main differences so
let's<00:01:05.680> play<00:01:05.860> around<00:01:05.979> with<00:01:06.220> this<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.759> animate

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
let's play around with this and animate

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.130 
let's play around with this and animate
these<00:01:07.659> two<00:01:07.899> objects<00:01:08.439> I<00:01:08.590> have<00:01:08.619> on<00:01:09.009> my<00:01:09.130> screen<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
these two objects I have on my screen to

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.050 
these two objects I have on my screen to
start<00:01:11.439> off<00:01:11.590> you<00:01:11.920> can<00:01:12.100> see<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:12.490> have<00:01:12.790> two

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
start off you can see that I have two

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.010 
start off you can see that I have two
layers<00:01:13.390> each<00:01:14.110> holding<00:01:14.619> a<00:01:14.799> different<00:01:15.250> object

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
layers each holding a different object

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.789 
layers each holding a different object
let's<00:01:17.020> first<00:01:17.380> click<00:01:17.710> on<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.100> Oval<00:01:18.490> layer<00:01:19.799> now

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
let's first click on the Oval layer now

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.360 
let's first click on the Oval layer now
in<00:01:21.190> order<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.640> animate<00:01:22.299> this<00:01:22.720> object<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:24.340> need

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
in order to animate this object we need

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.149 
in order to animate this object we need
to<00:01:24.729> be<00:01:24.880> on<00:01:25.090> frame<00:01:25.510> 1<00:01:25.950> currently<00:01:26.950> we're<00:01:27.130> on

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
to be on frame 1 currently we're on

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.969 
to be on frame 1 currently we're on
frame<00:01:27.580> 0<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:28.180> frame<00:01:28.900> 0<00:01:29.229> acts<00:01:29.530> like<00:01:29.830> the

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
frame 0 and frame 0 acts like the

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.969 
frame 0 and frame 0 acts like the
workspace<00:01:30.610> for<00:01:31.270> anime<00:01:31.630> studio<00:01:31.900> we<00:01:32.530> can<00:01:32.560> move

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
workspace for anime studio we can move

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.100 
workspace for anime studio we can move
stuff<00:01:33.280> around<00:01:33.490> but<00:01:34.210> it<00:01:34.330> doesn't<00:01:34.360> affect<00:01:34.750> the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
stuff around but it doesn't affect the

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.520 
stuff around but it doesn't affect the
animation<00:01:35.740> in<00:01:35.920> any<00:01:36.130> way<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.360> let's<00:01:37.960> just<00:01:38.260> page

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
animation in any way so let's just page

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.760 
animation in any way so let's just page
over<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:39.070> frame<00:01:39.549> 1<00:01:39.760> and<00:01:41.250> let's<00:01:42.250> select<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
over to frame 1 and let's select the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.170 
over to frame 1 and let's select the
translate<00:01:45.400> points<00:01:45.820> tool<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:47.939> click<00:01:48.939> down

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.640 
translate points tool and click down
once<00:01:49.570> on<00:01:50.040> your<00:01:51.040> oval<00:01:52.140> when<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.260> do<00:01:53.439> this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
once on your oval when you do this

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.420 
once on your oval when you do this
you'll<00:01:54.340> notice<00:01:54.580> now<00:01:54.970> that<00:01:55.000> we<00:01:55.420> have<00:01:56.430> two

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
you'll notice now that we have two

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.969 
you'll notice now that we have two
keyframes<00:01:58.090> up<00:01:58.450> here<00:01:58.750> we<00:01:59.020> have<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.170> point<00:01:59.530> motion

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
keyframes up here we have a point motion

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.880 
keyframes up here we have a point motion
and<00:02:00.189> we<00:02:00.430> have<00:02:00.610> a<00:02:00.640> selected<00:02:01.210> point<00:02:01.240> motion<00:02:02.049> all

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
and we have a selected point motion all

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.990 
and we have a selected point motion all
from<00:02:03.430> just<00:02:03.460> clicking<00:02:03.939> on<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.330> oval<00:02:05.369> now<00:02:06.369> if<00:02:06.759> we

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
from just clicking on the oval now if we

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.539 
from just clicking on the oval now if we
page<00:02:07.240> over<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:07.689> let's<00:02:08.349> say<00:02:08.530> about<00:02:08.739> frame<00:02:09.129> 36

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
page over to let's say about frame 36

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.470 
page over to let's say about frame 36
with<00:02:10.030> our<00:02:10.179> arrow<00:02:10.390> keys<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:11.879> we<00:02:12.879> just<00:02:13.090> click

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
with our arrow keys and we just click

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.160 
with our arrow keys and we just click
and<00:02:13.599> drag<00:02:13.659> this<00:02:14.140> oval<00:02:15.659> you'll<00:02:16.659> notice<00:02:16.959> now

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
and drag this oval you'll notice now

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.440 
and drag this oval you'll notice now
that<00:02:17.439> two<00:02:17.709> more<00:02:17.920> points<00:02:18.370> appear<00:02:18.790> on<00:02:18.970> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
that two more points appear on the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.250 
that two more points appear on the
timeline<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:21.310> if<00:02:21.459> we<00:02:21.580> page<00:02:21.849> back<00:02:22.090> through<00:02:22.510> we

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
timeline and if we page back through we

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.100 
timeline and if we page back through we
can<00:02:23.410> see<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.890> those<00:02:24.190> two<00:02:24.220> points<00:02:24.840> now<00:02:25.840> have

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
can see that those two points now have

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.640 
can see that those two points now have
anime

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
anime

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.970 
anime
in<00:02:26.890> between<00:02:27.129> them<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.750> putting<00:02:29.260> down<00:02:29.530> those

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
in between them so putting down those

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.750 
in between them so putting down those
keyframes<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:32.019> simple<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:33.159> simply<00:02:33.489> move

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
keyframes is that simple you simply move

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.319 
keyframes is that simple you simply move
this<00:02:34.000> object<00:02:34.180> where<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.900> wanted<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.230> go<00:02:35.349> and

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
this object where you wanted to go and

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.819 
this object where you wanted to go and
anime<00:02:37.329> studio<00:02:37.569> does<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.260> rest<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.680> work

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
anime studio does the rest of the work

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.960 
anime studio does the rest of the work
for<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:40.530> let's<00:02:41.530> say<00:02:41.769> now<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.400> want

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
for you so let's say now that you want

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.309 
for you so let's say now that you want
to<00:02:43.299> resize<00:02:44.170> this<00:02:44.769> object<00:02:45.129> as<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:46.030> moves<00:02:46.329> to<00:02:47.290> the

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
to resize this object as it moves to the

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.849 
to resize this object as it moves to the
right<00:02:48.180> well<00:02:49.180> let's<00:02:50.079> go<00:02:50.200> back<00:02:50.230> here<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.650> frame

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
right well let's go back here to frame

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:58.800 
right well let's go back here to frame
36<00:02:52.530> go<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:54.159> scale<00:02:54.519> tool<00:02:55.379> and<00:02:57.720> just<00:02:58.720> click

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
36 go to the scale tool and just click

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.080 
36 go to the scale tool and just click
and<00:02:59.170> drag<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.739> enlarge<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:02.760> now<00:03:03.760> we<00:03:03.819> come<00:03:04.060> back

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
and drag to enlarge it now we come back

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.750 
and drag to enlarge it now we come back
here<00:03:04.599> and<00:03:05.440> again<00:03:05.680> we<00:03:05.859> can<00:03:06.010> see<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:07.799> it<00:03:08.799> it's

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
here and again we can see that it it's

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.979 
here and again we can see that it it's
bigger<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.269> smaller<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:13.090> one<00:03:13.689> thing

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
bigger and smaller so that is one thing

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.599 
bigger and smaller so that is one thing
we<00:03:14.170> can<00:03:14.349> do<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.680> there's<00:03:14.859> of<00:03:15.010> course<00:03:15.040> many

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
we can do and there's of course many

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.289 
we can do and there's of course many
different<00:03:15.700> ways<00:03:16.090> we<00:03:16.540> can<00:03:16.750> tween<00:03:18.000> objects<00:03:19.000> and

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
different ways we can tween objects and

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.199 
different ways we can tween objects and
we<00:03:19.480> can<00:03:19.629> animate<00:03:20.049> them<00:03:20.290> but<00:03:21.040> that's<00:03:21.220> just<00:03:21.519> one

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
we can animate them but that's just one

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.860 
we can animate them but that's just one
example<00:03:22.799> now<00:03:23.799> let's<00:03:24.549> say<00:03:24.730> we<00:03:24.879> want<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.239> animate

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
example now let's say we want to animate

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.449 
example now let's say we want to animate
the<00:03:26.409> rectangle<00:03:27.540> well<00:03:28.540> if<00:03:28.840> we<00:03:29.019> take<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.889> select

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
the rectangle well if we take the select

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.460 
the rectangle well if we take the select
layer<00:03:30.730> tool<00:03:31.000> or<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.449> translate<00:03:31.959> layer<00:03:32.169> tool

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
layer tool or the translate layer tool

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.150 
layer tool or the translate layer tool
and<00:03:32.829> we<00:03:32.919> try<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.220> click<00:03:33.790> on<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.150> we<00:03:34.989> can't<00:03:35.290> we

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
and we try to click on it we can't we

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.680 
and we try to click on it we can't we
can<00:03:36.340> only<00:03:36.549> click<00:03:37.030> on<00:03:37.239> this<00:03:37.930> oval<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.940> we<00:03:40.510> need

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
can only click on this oval so we need

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.770 
can only click on this oval so we need
to<00:03:41.010> redirect<00:03:42.010> our<00:03:42.370> focus<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.239> rectangle

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
to redirect our focus to the rectangle

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.379 
to redirect our focus to the rectangle
so<00:03:44.230> let's<00:03:44.650> click<00:03:44.919> on<00:03:45.099> that<00:03:45.340> in<00:03:45.609> the<00:03:46.060> layers<00:03:46.269> box

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
so let's click on that in the layers box

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.059 
so let's click on that in the layers box
when<00:03:49.389> we<00:03:49.540> do<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:49.870> now<00:03:50.169> you'll<00:03:50.590> notice<00:03:50.889> that

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
when we do this now you'll notice that

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.530 
when we do this now you'll notice that
there<00:03:51.879> are<00:03:52.180> no<00:03:52.629> keyframes<00:03:53.260> on<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.949> timeline

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
there are no keyframes on the timeline

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.849 
there are no keyframes on the timeline
that's<00:03:55.540> because<00:03:55.930> we<00:03:56.109> are<00:03:56.229> looking<00:03:56.560> at<00:03:56.709> the

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
that's because we are looking at the

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.670 
that's because we are looking at the
timeline<00:03:57.159> of<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.790> rectangle<00:03:58.419> the<00:03:59.260> oval

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
timeline of the rectangle the oval

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.300 
timeline of the rectangle the oval
timeline<00:04:00.519> has<00:04:00.760> no<00:04:01.299> play<00:04:02.109> in<00:04:02.680> what<00:04:03.159> we're

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
timeline has no play in what we're

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.159 
timeline has no play in what we're
looking<00:04:03.549> at<00:04:03.669> right<00:04:03.849> now<00:04:03.909> I<00:04:04.239> mean<00:04:04.930> when<00:04:05.079> you

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
looking at right now I mean when you

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.439 
looking at right now I mean when you
page<00:04:05.440> through<00:04:05.470> you'll<00:04:06.040> still<00:04:06.310> see<00:04:06.549> it<00:04:06.699> animate

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
page through you'll still see it animate

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.599 
page through you'll still see it animate
on<00:04:08.049> its<00:04:08.229> own<00:04:08.319> timeline<00:04:08.620> so<00:04:09.159> you<00:04:09.220> can<00:04:09.400> still

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
on its own timeline so you can still

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.699 
on its own timeline so you can still
preview<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.120> but<00:04:10.659> you<00:04:10.750> just<00:04:10.989> won't<00:04:11.229> be<00:04:11.379> able<00:04:11.409> to

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
preview it but you just won't be able to

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.589 
preview it but you just won't be able to
manipulate<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.489> until<00:04:12.639> you<00:04:13.000> go<00:04:13.120> back<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.479> the

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
manipulate it until you go back to the

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.520 
manipulate it until you go back to the
oval<00:04:13.989> layer<00:04:14.909> so<00:04:15.909> now<00:04:16.060> let's<00:04:16.840> make<00:04:17.019> sure<00:04:17.289> that

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
oval layer so now let's make sure that

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.200 
oval layer so now let's make sure that
we<00:04:17.709> are<00:04:17.859> on<00:04:17.889> frame<00:04:18.430> 1<00:04:19.409> and<00:04:20.789> we<00:04:21.789> can<00:04:21.940> go<00:04:22.060> up<00:04:22.180> here

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
we are on frame 1 and we can go up here

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.230 
we are on frame 1 and we can go up here
to<00:04:22.630> our<00:04:22.659> tools<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.440> select<00:04:24.099> the<00:04:24.520> translate

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
to our tools and select the translate

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.260 
to our tools and select the translate
points<00:04:25.630> tool<00:04:25.870> again<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:27.060> click<00:04:28.060> on<00:04:28.180> the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
points tool again and click on the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.000 
points tool again and click on the
rectangle<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:30.659> then<00:04:31.659> we'll<00:04:31.810> just<00:04:31.990> move<00:04:32.349> our

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
rectangle and then we'll just move our

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.230 
rectangle and then we'll just move our
timeline<00:04:33.669> to<00:04:34.599> about<00:04:34.810> frame<00:04:35.050> 42<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:36.120> then<00:04:37.120> we

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
timeline to about frame 42 and then we

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.080 
timeline to about frame 42 and then we
can<00:04:37.419> click<00:04:37.659> and<00:04:37.840> drag<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.289> rectangle

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
can click and drag the rectangle

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.980 
can click and drag the rectangle
you<00:04:40.150> create<00:04:40.480> that<00:04:40.690> key<00:04:41.680> point<00:04:42.480> so<00:04:43.480> then<00:04:43.720> if<00:04:43.840> we

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
you create that key point so then if we

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.800 
you create that key point so then if we
come<00:04:44.230> back<00:04:44.350> here<00:04:44.850> we<00:04:45.850> can<00:04:46.030> see<00:04:46.240> now<00:04:46.389> that<00:04:46.419> it

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
come back here we can see now that it

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.110 
come back here we can see now that it
animates<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:49.000> now<00:04:49.210> we<00:04:49.270> can<00:04:49.690> add<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.919> rotate<00:04:51.910> to

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
animates and now we can add a rotate to

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.030 
animates and now we can add a rotate to
this<00:04:52.240> as<00:04:52.419> well<00:04:52.540> so<00:04:52.930> we'll<00:04:53.080> just<00:04:53.260> click<00:04:53.500> on<00:04:53.680> the

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
this as well so we'll just click on the

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.520 
this as well so we'll just click on the
rotate<00:04:54.639> points<00:04:55.090> tool<00:04:55.330> and<00:04:56.280> rotate<00:04:57.280> so<00:04:58.210> now<00:04:58.530> we

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
rotate points tool and rotate so now we

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.670 
rotate points tool and rotate so now we
can<00:04:59.710> see<00:05:00.810> that<00:05:01.810> we<00:05:01.930> have<00:05:02.139> a<00:05:02.169> different<00:05:02.620> effect

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
can see that we have a different effect

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.939 
can see that we have a different effect
come<00:05:03.190> into<00:05:03.400> play<00:05:03.610> here<00:05:04.440> so<00:05:05.440> that's<00:05:05.620> how<00:05:05.860> you

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
come into play here so that's how you

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.450 
come into play here so that's how you
can<00:05:06.340> do<00:05:06.460> some<00:05:06.699> very<00:05:06.910> simple<00:05:07.830> animation<00:05:08.830> with

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
can do some very simple animation with

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.600 
can do some very simple animation with
anime<00:05:09.850> studio<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.770> again<00:05:11.770> this<00:05:12.130> is<00:05:12.310> just

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
anime studio and again this is just

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.230 
anime studio and again this is just
barely<00:05:13.330> barely<00:05:13.660> scratching<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.290> surface<00:05:15.240> so

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
barely barely scratching the surface so

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.730 
barely barely scratching the surface so
I<00:05:16.330> believe<00:05:16.660> this<00:05:16.840> is<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:17.020> good<00:05:17.260> stepping<00:05:17.590> stone

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
I believe this is a good stepping stone

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.980 
I believe this is a good stepping stone

you're going from flash to anime studio

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.450 
you're going from flash to anime studio
it<00:05:22.840> can<00:05:23.020> be<00:05:23.139> kind<00:05:23.320> of<00:05:23.380> confusing<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:24.010> wrap<00:05:24.280> your

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460

head around the fact that you see the

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.980 
head around the fact that you see the
timelines<00:05:26.760> differently<00:05:27.760> depending<00:05:28.419> on<00:05:28.780> what
