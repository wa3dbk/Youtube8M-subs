00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.200
 how are you in friends again I am 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.990
 rosario may and here in its segment of 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.610
 chema in your program your home will 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.160
 They know that we always bring them news 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.070
 Today we are going to talk about the use of 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.590
 glass blogs glass blogs are 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.740
 these glazed elements that you 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.590
 are watching here behind me and they meet 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.929
 many important functions in the 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.990
 construction and in the decoration of a 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:37.540
 housing one of the important things 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.050
 that has the glass blog is that the 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.110
 thickness that has an insulation 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.829
 very good acoustic means that if 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.420
 we have two environments 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.909
 a virtually united let's call it that way not 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.769
 baby record sound because the blog 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:01.190
 of glass has air spaces inside 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.659
 then as sound isolates very well 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.390
 you are seeing here we are in a 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.340
 place where there is a lot of noise outside 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.310
 But inwardly nothing is heard 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.200
 the other the important element that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.140
 has a glass block is that it allows 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.549
 pass the light then we can have 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.950
 successive environments when light comes 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.049
 from a single source we can take advantage of 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.799
 several environments that are illuminated 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.830
 because if we make an opaque wall it's not going to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.399
 pass the light then the glass blog 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.920
 help in that too and also has the 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.450
 decorative function as you see this 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.840
 is a glass blog that has a design 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.569
 very cute and we have used it here in 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.090
 this ladder to give it a touch 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:50.090
 important decoration 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.700
 chema has products especially 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.190
 designed for glass blogs 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.520
 because blogs and video are also used 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.830
 many times in the showers then what 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.850
 is what you should meet let's say this 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.820
 glue 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.030
 mayol and bloc de vido must be from a 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:18.150
 good finish a fine finish a finish 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.980
 smooth and the other thing is that it has to be from 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.990
 very good resistance because as 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.840
 you see here 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.580
 it is not a structural wall but it has 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.830
 to be able to sustain so much of 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.320
 let's say from rows then what 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.670
 we do is every certain row they go 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.860
 placing the construction iron for 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.890
 secure the let's say the anchor 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.240
 horizontal the procedure for 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.760
 use the chemistry yolis glass block 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.550
 and place blogs and glasses is is left 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.660
 rest a few minutes and then already 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.710
 we can proceed to place in the first 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.370
 row let's say 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.770
 about one and a half centimeters of 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.860
 this paste on the wall and let's go 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.860
 laying the bricks of the 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.010
 glass blocks 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.220
 we are going to go forward all row by 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.760
 row and when you have completed the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.190
 three rows we are going to place an iron 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.530
 of building a room so that the 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:30.250
 horizontal anchor be firm and be 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.220
 perfect this is going to give 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.390
 let's say stability to the wall and above all 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.580
 If you work a wall much higher you 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.060
 will always give security to this 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.120
 glass block element 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.670
 once we have finished everything we are going to 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.950
 go filling the spaces by way of 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.110
 forge completing with the same paste 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.380
 that is another advantage that you do not 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.140
 They need to have a different forge to 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.800
 glue because this glue is very 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.550
 soft and very good finish and it does not go 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:13.980
 to crack therefore this one already with this 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:15.989
 we can give you the calabria do not forget 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.579
 that chema always has news for 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.250

 and we will continue to address these issues in
