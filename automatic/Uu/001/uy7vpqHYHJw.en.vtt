00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:07.270
 show this new bluetooth device 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.340
 bluetooth headset 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.080
 which was designed to work with 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.879
 the symbian system of some cell phones 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.879
 such as the nokia n8 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.930
 like the other bluetooth headphones too 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.950
 have a control 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.950
 with this button we can lower the volume 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.750
 turn up the volume and the center button 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.700
 is to make and receive calls 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.270
 since it also has the technology 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.980
 to function as hands- free 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.660
 in this area he has a microphone 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.270
 Incorporated 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.270
 It has a charge indicator 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.829
 the connection for the charging cable 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.000
 which is included in the purchase 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.979
 of a normal usb cable which can be 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.600
 connected to a new bus to a computer 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:07.580
 or a cell phone charger that counts 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.580
 with this usb technology 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.130
 in addition to some of the qualities that 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.829
 they have this device 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.560
 is that it is quite flexible since its 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.850
 construction is completely rubber and 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.870
 silicone 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.970
 how can you see 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:30.190
 it's flexible we can double those and have 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.530
 it is again in its original form 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.840
 what it does is extremely resistant to 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.890
 the impacts the blows of this 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.750
 device 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.330
 It is fundamentally designed for more 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.560
 outdoor things how to perform 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.560
 sport in jogging 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:56.050
 just like the other device 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.050
 bluetooth has a range of 10 meters 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.880
 The charging time is 2 hours the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.950
 about battery life 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.460
 of 6 hours listening to your music or 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.679
 making calls for which he has 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.570
 the same benefits and qualities that 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.470
 the other bluetooth devices but of 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.280
 a more compact and modern way 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.280
 apart 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.830
 those qualities we also have to 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.390
 It comes in different colors we have 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.970
 four colors at this time I would 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.120
 I'm going to present two that is red and 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.310
 green as you can see and all with the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.500
 same function in qualities 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.190
 apart it also has these protectors 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.870
 of rubber that go in your ears so you do not 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:48.780
 suffer damage this area is silicone what 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.870
 that produces a fixation to your head 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.250
 and that is would be the presentation of 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.940
 bluetooth headset for symbian good 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.430
 I hope you liked it 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.439
