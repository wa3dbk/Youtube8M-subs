borders like the brandy melville signs

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.330 
borders like the brandy melville signs
or<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.050> could<00:02:27.170> totally<00:02:27.350> freehand<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.070> but<00:02:28.280> I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
or you could totally freehand this but I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.250 
or you could totally freehand this but I
just<00:02:28.610> drew<00:02:28.760> some<00:02:28.970> borders<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.900> started

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
just drew some borders and started

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.200 
just drew some borders and started
painting<00:02:30.470> them<00:02:30.710> block<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.400> protip<00:02:31.940> to

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
painting them block and a protip to

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.270 
painting them block and a protip to
paint<00:02:32.540> straight<00:02:32.990> lines<00:02:33.230> is<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.650> use<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.860> ruler

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
paint straight lines is to use a ruler

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.950 
paint straight lines is to use a ruler
so<00:02:34.460> that<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.730> paint<00:02:35.000> doesn't<00:02:35.360> seep<00:02:35.540> through<00:02:35.810> I

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
so that the paint doesn't seep through I

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.990 
so that the paint doesn't seep through I
know<00:02:36.050> some<00:02:36.410> people<00:02:36.590> use<00:02:36.980> tape<00:02:37.340> but<00:02:37.610> sometimes

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
know some people use tape but sometimes

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.150 
know some people use tape but sometimes
a<00:02:38.150> paint<00:02:38.420> can<00:02:39.050> get<00:02:39.260> chipped<00:02:39.560> away<00:02:39.710> when<00:02:40.070> you

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
a paint can get chipped away when you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.740 
a paint can get chipped away when you
peel<00:02:40.370> off<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.670> tape<00:02:40.850> so<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.210> is<00:02:41.330> really<00:02:41.630> a

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
peel off the tape so this is really a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.140 
peel off the tape so this is really a
great<00:02:42.080> alternative<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:43.070> then<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:43.580> simply<00:02:43.970> just

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
great alternative and then I simply just

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.080 
great alternative and then I simply just
freehand<00:02:44.570> it<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:45.020> 2<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.380> 1<00:02:45.410> B<00:02:45.770> sign<00:02:46.040> which<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.550> the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
freehand it a 2 to 1 B sign which is the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.030 
freehand it a 2 to 1 B sign which is the
address<00:02:47.660> where<00:02:47.900> Sherlock<00:02:48.230> Holmes<00:02:48.590> resides

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
address where Sherlock Holmes resides

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.010 
address where Sherlock Holmes resides
and<00:02:49.310> then<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.760> simply<00:02:50.060> just<00:02:50.420> painted<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.780> in

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
and then I simply just painted that in

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.900 
and then I simply just painted that in
you<00:02:51.230> can<00:02:51.260> always<00:02:51.560> use<00:02:51.800> a<00:02:51.830> stencil<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.550> create<00:02:52.880> a

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
you can always use a stencil to create a

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.750 
you can always use a stencil to create a
2<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.330> 1<00:02:53.360> V<00:02:53.690> sign<00:02:53.960> but<00:02:54.530> free-handing<00:02:55.460> does

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
2 to 1 V sign but free-handing does

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.630 
2 to 1 V sign but free-handing does
create<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.090> really<00:02:56.450> great<00:02:56.630> personal<00:02:57.140> effect

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
create a really great personal effect

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.040
