accomplished everything that I set out
to<00:00:39.300> accomplish<00:00:39.559> far<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:40.680> knowing<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.280> need

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
to accomplish far as knowing what I need

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.000 
to accomplish far as knowing what I need
to<00:00:41.670> improve<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.230> kind<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.649> continue

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
to improve and so I can kind of continue

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.389 
to improve and so I can kind of continue
to<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:48.500> my<00:00:49.500> friends<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.039> told<00:00:50.250> me

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
to do that my friends kind of told me

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.080 
to do that my friends kind of told me
that<00:00:52.010> it<00:00:53.010> would<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.219> maybe<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.730> little<00:00:53.789> bit

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that it would be maybe a little bit

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.760 
that it would be maybe a little bit
easier<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.510> had<00:00:54.780> some<00:00:55.020> friends<00:00:55.199> who<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.440> taken

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.910 
working on my stuff like this weekend I
came<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.659> both<00:01:12.869> days<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> spent<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.740> least

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
came here both days and spent at least

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.310

three<00:01:14.430> hours<00:01:14.720> sitting<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.840> computer<00:01:16.170> lab

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
three hours sitting in the computer lab

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.990 
three hours sitting in the computer lab
making<00:01:16.860> sure<00:01:17.009> my<00:01:17.130> lesson<00:01:17.430> fans<00:01:17.640> were<00:01:17.820> good

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
making sure my lesson fans were good

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.670 
making sure my lesson fans were good
because<00:01:18.210> there's<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.869> level<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.200> competition

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
because there's a level of competition

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.140 
because there's a level of competition
that<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:22.159> with<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.520> your<00:01:23.759> with

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the people and then there's a level that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.870 
the people and then there's a level that
you<00:01:25.590> set<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:25.799> yourself<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> want<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you set for yourself that you want to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.640 
you set for yourself that you want to
achieve<00:01:26.970> I've<00:01:27.420> enjoyed<00:01:27.780> getting<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.560> know

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
achieve I've enjoyed getting to know

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.249 
achieve I've enjoyed getting to know
everyone<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.420> I've<00:01:30.420> learned<00:01:30.689> something<00:01:30.960> from

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
everyone and I've learned something from

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.819 
everyone and I've learned something from
every<00:01:31.470> every<00:01:31.860> person<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:33.439> even<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> person

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
every every person here even the person

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.560 
every every person here even the person
who<00:01:34.920> runs<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.220> copy<00:01:35.430> machine<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.240> probably

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
who runs a copy machine this is probably

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.800 
who runs a copy machine this is probably
the<00:01:36.659> most<00:01:36.689> intense<00:01:37.110> learning<00:01:37.409> focused

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
the most intense learning focused

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.179 
the most intense learning focused
activity<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.930> I've<00:01:40.020> done<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.439> probably<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
activity that I've done and probably the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.830 
activity that I've done and probably the
hardest<00:01:42.049> personally<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.290> don't<00:01:43.710> know

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
hardest personally I don't know

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.730 
hardest personally I don't know
professionally<00:01:45.840> maybe<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.290> much<00:01:46.500> but

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
professionally maybe not much but

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.429 
professionally maybe not much but
definitely<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.909> my<00:01:47.970> personal<00:01:48.180> gains<00:01:49.020> is

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
definitely one of my personal gains is

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.109 
definitely one of my personal gains is
it's<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.189> hard<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.549> me<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.729> stand<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.060> front

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
it's it's hard for me to stand in front

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.270 
it's it's hard for me to stand in front
of<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> group<00:01:51.479> sometimes<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:53.040> kind<00:01:53.220> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
of a group sometimes I get kind of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.859 
of a group sometimes I get kind of
nervous

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.200 

there<00:01:58.869> are<00:01:59.189> some<00:02:00.189> people<00:02:00.430> that<00:02:00.460> are<00:02:00.610> really

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
there are some people that are really

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.810 
there are some people that are really
really<00:02:01.360> smart<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.799> they<00:02:03.250> can't<00:02:03.490> speak<00:02:03.789> very

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
really smart and they can't speak very

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.450 
really smart and they can't speak very
much<00:02:04.119> English<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.649> then<00:02:05.829> there<00:02:06.130> are<00:02:06.280> some
