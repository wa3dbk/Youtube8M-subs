00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
coming from the beta which means that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
coming from the beta which means that
nothing<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.880> final<00:01:24.150> everything<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.810> subject

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
to change so these may not be the exact

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.359

amounts for each team and their order

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.380 
amounts for each team and their order
might<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> little<00:01:29.820> bit<00:01:29.970> different<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.270> well

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
might be a little bit different as well

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.810

but<00:01:30.659> last<00:01:31.229> year's<00:01:31.530> beta<00:01:31.770> was<00:01:32.310> very<00:01:32.610> very

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
