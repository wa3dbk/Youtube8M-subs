 [Music] 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.990
 yes 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.420
 now let's proceed to open the box 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:23.050
 the poplars of these outward and as 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.770
 in this what brings us the drone cable 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.830
 usb 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.279
 it helps us connect to the computer and 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.490
 take pictures 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.330
 and also serves to load 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.100
 and here we have the battery and here we have 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.920
 this kind of wheels that serve us 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.170
 to protect it from bumps good 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.170
 now let's proceed with the assembly 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.710
 first let's take out the drone 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.610
 the usb cable 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:04.910
 and the battery that is 550 media 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.910
 and let's put the lyrics 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:20.260
 is where the wheels are placed 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.600
 assemble the saltron wheel what 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.180
 we have to do is 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.900
 place them in this way with the view 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.360
 upwards 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.140
 and then we lower it and make a law of 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.770
 friction to the right 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.990
 and we hope the good hype this would be the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.420
 assembly now let's proceed to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.960
 download an application in our 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.560
 smartphone to be able to use it as 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.560
 control 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.090
