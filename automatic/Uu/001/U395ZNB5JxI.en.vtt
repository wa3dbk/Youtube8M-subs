00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
list so number 5 we have the sg553 has a

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.420 
list so number 5 we have the sg553 has a
quick<00:00:22.550> rate<00:00:22.850> of<00:00:23.000> fire<00:00:23.240> of<00:00:23.510> 830<00:00:24.500> its<00:00:24.980> reload

quick rate of fire of 830 its reload
times<00:00:25.730> I'm<00:00:26.030> not<00:00:26.210> too<00:00:26.450> bad<00:00:26.690> in<00:00:26.900> its<00:00:27.080> recoil<00:00:27.620> is

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
times I'm not too bad in its recoil is

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.220 
times I'm not too bad in its recoil is
manageable<00:00:28.460> however<00:00:29.150> some<00:00:29.450> people<00:00:29.600> that<00:00:30.110> are

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
manageable however some people that are

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.170 
manageable however some people that are
less<00:00:30.470> skilled<00:00:30.830> might<00:00:31.070> find<00:00:31.430> this<00:00:31.580> weapon<00:00:31.820> hard

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
less skilled might find this weapon hard

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.569 
less skilled might find this weapon hard
to<00:00:32.450> control<00:00:32.780> well<00:00:33.290> liked<00:00:33.590> about<00:00:33.800> this<00:00:33.980> carbine

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
to control well liked about this carbine

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.180 
to control well liked about this carbine
is<00:00:34.820> your<00:00:35.059> time<00:00:35.360> to<00:00:35.570> kill<00:00:35.810> is<00:00:35.990> pretty<00:00:36.380> low<00:00:36.710> it's

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
is your time to kill is pretty low it's

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.400 
is your time to kill is pretty low it's
definitely<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:37.880> weapon<00:00:38.270> more<00:00:38.420> optimized<00:00:39.080> for

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
definitely a weapon more optimized for

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.740 
definitely a weapon more optimized for
close<00:00:39.800> range<00:00:40.160> but<00:00:40.670> I<00:00:40.700> did<00:00:40.940> get<00:00:41.090> some<00:00:41.300> kills<00:00:41.570> at

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
close range but I did get some kills at

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.990 
close range but I did get some kills at
medium<00:00:42.260> distances<00:00:42.860> pretty<00:00:43.340> easily

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
medium distances pretty easily

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.970 
medium distances pretty easily
it's<00:00:44.210> reload<00:00:44.630> times<00:00:44.930> aren't<00:00:45.350> that<00:00:45.470> long<00:00:45.680> but<00:00:45.920> I

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
it's reload times aren't that long but I

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.979 
it's reload times aren't that long but I
still<00:00:46.280> would<00:00:46.460> recommend<00:00:46.970> to<00:00:47.120> do<00:00:47.240> a<00:00:47.270> tactical

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
still would recommend to do a tactical

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.380 
still would recommend to do a tactical
reload<00:00:48.230> speaking<00:00:49.220> of<00:00:49.310> reloading<00:00:49.730> it's<00:00:50.000> empty

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
reload speaking of reloading it's empty

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.360 
reload speaking of reloading it's empty
reload<00:00:50.690> animation<00:00:51.350> is<00:00:51.440> actually<00:00:51.980> really

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
reload animation is actually really

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.550 
reload animation is actually really
really<00:00:52.700> cool<00:00:52.880> what<00:00:53.360> I<00:00:53.390> hated<00:00:53.810> about<00:00:54.020> this<00:00:54.320> gun

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
really cool what I hated about this gun

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.010 
really cool what I hated about this gun
is<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:55.070> muzzle<00:00:55.399> velocity<00:00:56.060> is<00:00:56.090> really<00:00:56.810> low

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
is the muzzle velocity is really low

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.590 
is the muzzle velocity is really low
it's<00:00:57.350> really<00:00:57.980> called<00:00:58.250> does<00:00:58.550> pulsar<00:00:59.090> right<00:00:59.360> and

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
it's really called does pulsar right and

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.049 
it's really called does pulsar right and
with<00:00:59.750> the<00:00:59.780> 830<00:01:00.739> ratify<00:01:01.460> you're<00:01:01.700> going<00:01:01.910> to

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
with the 830 ratify you're going to

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.880 
with the 830 ratify you're going to
really<00:01:02.329> notice<00:01:02.660> that<00:01:02.930> but<00:01:03.200> if<00:01:03.290> you<00:01:03.350> counter<00:01:03.829> it

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
really notice that but if you counter it

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.259 
really notice that but if you counter it
then<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:04.159> shouldn't<00:01:04.489> have<00:01:04.699> too<00:01:04.970> many<00:01:05.149> issues

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
then you shouldn't have too many issues

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.779 
then you shouldn't have too many issues
also<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.439> lower<00:01:06.680> damage<00:01:07.009> model<00:01:07.520> of<00:01:07.639> the

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
also the lower damage model of the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.179 
also the lower damage model of the
carbines<00:01:08.389> with<00:01:08.689> its<00:01:08.869> quick<00:01:09.170> rate<00:01:09.619> of<00:01:09.770> fire<00:01:09.979> I

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
carbines with its quick rate of fire I

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.370 
carbines with its quick rate of fire I
felt<00:01:10.520> like<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:10.880> was<00:01:10.969> always<00:01:11.179> out<00:01:11.719> of<00:01:11.869> ammo<00:01:12.109> and

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
felt like I was always out of ammo and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.499 
felt like I was always out of ammo and
resulted<00:01:13.159> in<00:01:13.280> my<00:01:13.399> death<00:01:13.639> a<00:01:13.819> couple<00:01:14.179> of<00:01:14.240> times

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
resulted in my death a couple of times

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:15.999 
resulted in my death a couple of times
this<00:01:14.899> is<00:01:15.020> one<00:01:15.200> of<00:01:15.229> those<00:01:15.319> weapons<00:01:15.590> where

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
this is one of those weapons where

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.980 
this is one of those weapons where

18<00:01:51.259> minimum<00:01:51.740> what<00:01:52.159> I<00:01:52.189> like<00:01:52.429> about<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:52.819> ACE<00:01:52.969> 52

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
18 minimum what I like about the ACE 52

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.989 
18 minimum what I like about the ACE 52
is<00:01:53.929> the<00:01:53.959> high<00:01:54.529> damage<00:01:54.889> model<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.609> when

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
is the high damage model and when

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:57.940 
is the high damage model and when
configured<00:01:56.630> with<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.840> right<00:01:57.229> attachments

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
configured with the right attachments

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.309 
configured with the right attachments
it's<00:01:58.340> pretty<00:01:58.729> much<00:01:58.969> a<00:01:59.240> laser<00:01:59.599> beam<00:01:59.929> you<00:02:00.169> can

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
it's pretty much a laser beam you can

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.349 
it's pretty much a laser beam you can
take<00:02:00.649> our<00:02:00.859> targets<00:02:01.279> at<00:02:01.429> medium<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.090> long

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
take our targets at medium and long

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.389 
take our targets at medium and long
range<00:02:02.630> without<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.200> problem<00:02:03.679> I<00:02:03.829> really<00:02:04.159> like

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
range without a problem I really like

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.639 
range without a problem I really like
using<00:02:04.609> the<00:02:04.789> angled<00:02:05.299> 4<00:02:05.539> group<00:02:05.810> muzzle<00:02:06.409> brake

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.759 
sight for this gun without these
attachments<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.180> recall<00:02:11.840> might<00:02:12.200> be<00:02:12.409> a<00:02:12.439> little

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
attachments the recall might be a little

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.640 
attachments the recall might be a little
tough<00:02:13.129> for<00:02:13.159> you<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.569> counter<00:02:14.569> only<00:02:15.049> downside

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
tough for you to counter only downside

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.780 
tough for you to counter only downside
to<00:02:15.799> this<00:02:15.890> setup<00:02:16.189> is<00:02:16.459> your

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
to this setup is your

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.339 
to this setup is your
shots<00:02:16.939> will<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.269> a<00:02:17.299> little<00:02:17.659> more<00:02:17.870> inaccurate

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
shots will be a little more inaccurate

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.679 
shots will be a little more inaccurate
what<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:18.950> hate<00:02:19.250> about<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.790> carbine<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.540> it's

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
what I hate about this carbine is it's

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.170 
what I hate about this carbine is it's
empty<00:02:21.019> reload<00:02:21.349> time<00:02:21.739> is<00:02:21.769> a<00:02:21.950> bit<00:02:22.400> long<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.879> it

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
empty reload time is a bit long and it

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.630 
empty reload time is a bit long and it
only<00:02:23.359> holds<00:02:23.659> 26<00:02:24.439> rounds<00:02:24.680> which<00:02:25.099> isn't<00:02:25.310> too<00:02:25.609> bad

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
only holds 26 rounds which isn't too bad

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.390 
only holds 26 rounds which isn't too bad
but<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.629> need<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.989> be<00:02:27.109> cautious<00:02:27.409> of<00:02:27.739> your<00:02:28.159> ammo

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
but you need to be cautious of your ammo

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.369 
but you need to be cautious of your ammo
consumption<00:02:28.969> just<00:02:29.299> make<00:02:29.689> sure<00:02:29.930> all<00:02:30.170> your

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
consumption just make sure all your

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.679 
consumption just make sure all your
shots<00:02:30.650> are<00:02:30.859> on<00:02:31.010> target<00:02:31.609> so<00:02:31.879> number<00:02:32.239> three<00:02:32.510> we

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
shots are on target so number three we

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.039 
shots are on target so number three we
have<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.900> ace<00:02:33.290> 21<00:02:34.159> CB<00:02:34.760> q<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.239> lot<00:02:35.569> of<00:02:35.689> you<00:02:35.840> may

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
have the ace 21 CB q a lot of you may

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.349 
have the ace 21 CB q a lot of you may
not<00:02:36.200> like<00:02:36.409> this<00:02:36.650> gun<00:02:36.859> but<00:02:37.159> I<00:02:37.189> love<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.879> it<00:02:38.150> has<00:02:38.329> a

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
not like this gun but I love it it has a

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.800 
not like this gun but I love it it has a
pretty<00:02:38.720> quick<00:02:39.109> rate<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.680> fire<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:40.329> 770<00:02:41.329> rpm

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
pretty quick rate of fire of 770 rpm

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.589 
pretty quick rate of fire of 770 rpm
it's<00:02:42.019> recall<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.129> easy<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.579> manage<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.090> reload

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
it's recall is easy to manage and reload

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.050 
it's recall is easy to manage and reload
times<00:02:44.900> are<00:02:45.139> fairly<00:02:45.500> low<00:02:45.829> this<00:02:46.219> weapon<00:02:46.639> reminds

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
times are fairly low this weapon reminds

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.539 
times are fairly low this weapon reminds
me<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.239> love<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.629> ace23<00:02:48.230> assault<00:02:48.980> rifle<00:02:49.400> it's

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
me of love the ace23 assault rifle it's

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.699 
me of love the ace23 assault rifle it's
very<00:02:49.909> similar<00:02:50.329> in<00:02:50.659> a<00:02:50.750> lot<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.989> ways<00:02:51.290> it's

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
very similar in a lot of ways it's

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.530 
very similar in a lot of ways it's
basically<00:02:52.189> one<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.459> those<00:02:52.609> weapons<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.239> can

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
basically one of those weapons that can

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.039 
basically one of those weapons that can
get<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.959> job<00:02:54.230> done<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.620> any<00:02:54.799> situation<00:02:55.609> the

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
get the job done in any situation the

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.899 
get the job done in any situation the
717<00:02:57.049> rate<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.409> fire<00:02:57.620> still<00:02:58.159> allows<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.790> be

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
717 rate of fire still allows you to be

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.449 
717 rate of fire still allows you to be
competitive<00:02:59.359> in<00:02:59.900> close<00:03:00.230> range<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.799> while

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
competitive in close range and while

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.280 
competitive in close range and while
still<00:03:01.790> being<00:03:01.970> able<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.269> take<00:03:02.480> out<00:03:02.659> targets<00:03:03.139> at

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
still being able to take out targets at

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.319 
still being able to take out targets at
long<00:03:03.530> range<00:03:03.859> if<00:03:04.129> needed<00:03:04.400> what<00:03:04.879> I<00:03:04.909> like<00:03:05.150> about

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
long range if needed what I like about

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.629 
long range if needed what I like about
the<00:03:05.510> ACE<00:03:05.659> 21<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.680> has<00:03:06.829> a<00:03:06.859> fire<00:03:07.220> rate<00:03:07.400> where

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
the ACE 21 is it has a fire rate where

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.670 
the ACE 21 is it has a fire rate where
you<00:03:07.730> can<00:03:07.879> still<00:03:08.150> easily<00:03:08.450> control<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.260> gun<00:03:09.470> and

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
you can still easily control the gun and

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.710 
you can still easily control the gun and
take<00:03:10.099> out<00:03:10.310> targets<00:03:10.549> at<00:03:10.939> pretty<00:03:11.209> much<00:03:11.299> any

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
take out targets at pretty much any

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.140 
take out targets at pretty much any
range<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.530> also<00:03:12.799> really<00:03:13.189> like<00:03:13.400> how<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.879> can<00:03:14.000> hold

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
range I also really like how it can hold

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.809 
range I also really like how it can hold
36<00:03:14.900> rounds<00:03:15.349> including<00:03:15.470> one<00:03:16.040> chamber<00:03:16.579> that

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
36 rounds including one chamber that

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.000 
36 rounds including one chamber that
extra<00:03:17.239> ammo<00:03:17.629> really<00:03:17.989> comes<00:03:18.230> in<00:03:18.409> handy<00:03:18.439> it

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
extra ammo really comes in handy it

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.979 
extra ammo really comes in handy it
allows<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.609> possibly<00:03:20.060> take<00:03:20.510> out<00:03:20.780> an

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
allows you to possibly take out an

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.869 
allows you to possibly take out an
additional<00:03:21.530> target<00:03:22.010> before<00:03:22.400> needing<00:03:22.729> to

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
additional target before needing to

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.599 
additional target before needing to
reload<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:23.959> also<00:03:24.319> it's<00:03:24.500> bullet<00:03:24.859> increase<00:03:25.310> per

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
reload and also it's bullet increase per

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.089 
reload and also it's bullet increase per
shot<00:03:25.879> is<00:03:26.030> fairly<00:03:26.510> low<00:03:26.810> for<00:03:27.109> attachments<00:03:28.010> I

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
shot is fairly low for attachments I

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.759 
shot is fairly low for attachments I
really<00:03:28.400> like<00:03:28.609> using<00:03:28.909> the<00:03:29.120> ergo<00:03:29.510> grip<00:03:29.810> silencer

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
really like using the ergo grip silencer

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.099 
really like using the ergo grip silencer
laser<00:03:31.159> sight<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.940> coyote<00:03:32.299> red<00:03:32.599> dot<00:03:32.810> sight

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
laser sight and the coyote red dot sight

carbine<00:05:19.130> what<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.490> love<00:05:19.760> about<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:20.169> ak5c<00:05:21.169> is

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
carbine what I love about the ak5c is

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.740 
carbine what I love about the ak5c is
you<00:05:21.470> can<00:05:21.620> take<00:05:21.830> it<00:05:21.979> in<00:05:22.100> any<00:05:22.310> situation<00:05:23.180> whether

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
you can take it in any situation whether

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.200 
you can take it in any situation whether
it's<00:05:24.020> closed<00:05:24.380> medium<00:05:24.919> or<00:05:25.130> long<00:05:25.400> distances<00:05:26.000> it

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
it's closed medium or long distances it

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.050 
it's closed medium or long distances it
will<00:05:26.330> perform<00:05:26.660> well<00:05:26.990> it's<00:05:27.310> 700<00:05:28.310> ratify<00:05:28.790> and

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
will perform well it's 700 ratify and

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.050 
will perform well it's 700 ratify and
very<00:05:29.510> very<00:05:29.960> low<00:05:30.260> recall<00:05:30.919> pretty<00:05:31.550> much<00:05:31.760> makes

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
very very low recall pretty much makes

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.719 
very very low recall pretty much makes
this<00:05:32.330> a<00:05:32.570> laser<00:05:32.930> beam<00:05:33.260> it's<00:05:33.590> even<00:05:33.889> got<00:05:34.070> a<00:05:34.100> super

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
this a laser beam it's even got a super

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.020 
this a laser beam it's even got a super
quick<00:05:34.970> muzzle<00:05:35.479> velocity<00:05:36.020> of<00:05:36.400> 620<00:05:37.400> meters<00:05:37.610> per

will<00:05:47.870> be<00:05:48.020> a<00:05:48.050> lot<00:05:48.410> easier

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
will be a lot easier

expect to be killing everyone quickly in
close<00:06:28.580> range<00:06:28.910> especially<00:06:29.870> if<00:06:29.930> you're<00:06:30.080> vers<00:06:30.320> in

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
close range especially if you're vers in

though if it's rate of fire was any

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.330 
though if it's rate of fire was any
higher<00:06:35.389> it<00:06:35.690> may<00:06:36.050> cause<00:06:36.410> some<00:06:36.740> balancing

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
higher it may cause some balancing

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.430 
higher it may cause some balancing
issues<00:06:37.669> that's<00:06:38.270> pretty<00:06:38.599> much<00:06:38.750> the<00:06:39.080> only

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
issues that's pretty much the only

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.649 
issues that's pretty much the only
downside<00:06:40.070> to<00:06:40.310> this<00:06:40.400> gun<00:06:40.700> if<00:06:40.970> you<00:06:41.180> haven't<00:06:41.539> done

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:41.659 
downside to this gun if you haven't done

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:43.280 
downside to this gun if you haven't done
so<00:06:41.960> already<00:06:41.990> give<00:06:42.620> the<00:06:42.770> a<00:06:42.800> cape

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
so already give the a cape

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.590 
so already give the a cape
I've<00:06:43.350> seen<00:06:43.650> a<00:06:43.680> try<00:06:44.010> you<00:06:44.430> can<00:06:44.610> use<00:06:44.820> it<00:06:45.030> with<00:06:45.300> any

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
I've seen a try you can use it with any

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.230 
I've seen a try you can use it with any
class<00:06:45.990> it's<00:06:46.380> a<00:06:46.680> very<00:06:47.100> effective<00:06:47.430> weapon<00:06:47.880> for

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
class it's a very effective weapon for

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.750 
class it's a very effective weapon for
any<00:06:48.420> map<00:06:48.720> or<00:06:48.960> game-mode<00:06:49.560> I<00:06:49.740> love<00:06:50.160> guns<00:06:50.400> where

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
any map or game-mode I love guns where

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.880 
any map or game-mode I love guns where
they<00:06:50.940> can<00:06:51.150> perform<00:06:51.300> well<00:06:51.690> in<00:06:51.930> any<00:06:52.140> situation

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
they can perform well in any situation

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.300 
they can perform well in any situation
so<00:06:53.280> my<00:06:53.550> opinion<00:06:54.000> the<00:06:54.230> ak5c<00:06:55.230> clearly<00:06:55.830> deserves

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
so my opinion the ak5c clearly deserves

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.940 
so my opinion the ak5c clearly deserves
first<00:06:56.790> place<00:06:57.150> so<00:06:57.630> that's<00:06:57.810> it<00:06:58.020> for<00:06:58.170> my<00:06:58.320> top<00:06:58.650> 5

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950

first place so that's it for my top 5
carbines<00:06:59.640> I'll<00:06:59.970> be<00:07:00.330> doing<00:07:00.540> a<00:07:00.630> top<00:07:00.900> 5<00:07:01.170> series
