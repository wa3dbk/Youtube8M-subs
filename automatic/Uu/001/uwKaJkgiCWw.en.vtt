striking rod and then a carbide bit
that's<00:00:42.020> inside<00:00:42.410> that<00:00:42.739> some<00:00:43.399> kind<00:00:43.700> of<00:00:43.730> a<00:00:43.850> spring

thing comes in tan and orange the rod

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.459 
thing comes in tan and orange the rod
actually<00:00:52.969> goes<00:00:53.120> in<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.629> stores<00:00:53.989> in<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.379> then

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
actually goes in and stores in and then

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.779 
actually goes in and stores in and then
you<00:00:54.530> push<00:00:54.739> down<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.910> expose<00:00:56.420> it<00:00:56.660> now<00:00:57.640> when<00:00:58.640> it's

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
you push down to expose it now when it's

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.670 
you push down to expose it now when it's
closed<00:00:58.969> like<00:00:59.149> this<00:00:59.180> is<00:00:59.449> 2.3<00:00:59.989> inches<00:01:00.020> long<00:01:00.440> and

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
closed like this is 2.3 inches long and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.369 
closed like this is 2.3 inches long and
one<00:01:01.219> point<00:01:01.670> two<00:01:01.820> inches<00:01:02.120> wide<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.600> overall

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
one point two inches wide and overall

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.229 
one point two inches wide and overall
this<00:01:03.770> weighs<00:01:04.100> less<00:01:04.460> than<00:01:04.519> an<00:01:04.759> ounce<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.059> it

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
this weighs less than an ounce so it

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.209 
this weighs less than an ounce so it
actually<00:01:05.389> weighs<00:01:05.630> point<00:01:06.200> eight<00:01:06.439> five<00:01:06.679> ounces

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:07.219 
actually weighs point eight five ounces

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:08.949 
actually weighs point eight five ounces
it<00:01:07.969> does<00:01:08.090> have<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.299> hole<00:01:08.509> in<00:01:08.630> here<00:01:08.749> for<00:01:08.929> a

00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:08.959 
it does have a hole in here for a

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:10.449 
it does have a hole in here for a
lanyard<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:09.469> you<00:01:09.560> can<00:01:09.679> put<00:01:09.770> it<00:01:09.859> under<00:01:09.950> lanyard

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:10.459 
lanyard so you can put it under lanyard

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:11.800 
lanyard so you can put it under lanyard
or<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:11.029> know<00:01:11.119> depending<00:01:11.420> on<00:01:11.539> what<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:11.689> want

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
or you know depending on what you want

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.559 
or you know depending on what you want
to<00:01:11.899> do<00:01:11.990> there<00:01:12.670> so<00:01:13.670> some<00:01:14.149> of<00:01:14.179> the<00:01:14.299> things<00:01:14.420> about

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:14.569 
to do there so some of the things about

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:16.899 
to do there so some of the things about
Sparky<00:01:15.259> that<00:01:15.770> I've<00:01:15.859> read<00:01:16.100> or<00:01:16.310> heard<00:01:16.399> about<00:01:16.520> is

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
Sparky that I've read or heard about is

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.199 
Sparky that I've read or heard about is
that<00:01:17.509> this<00:01:17.659> rod<00:01:17.990> unlike<00:01:18.499> the<00:01:18.649> blast<00:01:18.889> match

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:19.209 
that this rod unlike the blast match

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:22.300 
that this rod unlike the blast match
doesn't<00:01:20.209> rotate<00:01:20.359> with<00:01:20.779> each<00:01:20.929> strike<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:21.770> the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
doesn't rotate with each strike so the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.219 
doesn't rotate with each strike so the
one<00:01:22.639> thing<00:01:22.849> though<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.299> point<00:01:23.689> out<00:01:23.810> is<00:01:23.959> it<00:01:24.079> can

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
one thing though to point out is it can

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.050 
one thing though to point out is it can
be<00:01:24.380> manually<00:01:24.709> rotated<00:01:25.219> within<00:01:25.459> here<00:01:25.609> quite

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
be manually rotated within here quite

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.160 
be manually rotated within here quite
simply<00:01:26.389> I<00:01:26.420> think<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:26.719> could<00:01:26.840> probably<00:01:26.990> see

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
simply I think you could probably see

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.669 
simply I think you could probably see
that<00:01:27.319> spinning<00:01:27.709> so<00:01:28.369> not<00:01:29.090> hard<00:01:29.389> to<00:01:29.630> rotate<00:01:30.590> it

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
that spinning so not hard to rotate it

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.230 
that spinning so not hard to rotate it
around<00:01:30.859> and<00:01:31.159> use<00:01:31.249> it<00:01:31.279> and<00:01:31.789> one<00:01:31.939> of<00:01:31.969> the<00:01:32.090> other

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
around and use it and one of the other

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.419 
around and use it and one of the other
the<00:01:33.079> cons<00:01:33.349> that<00:01:33.560> I've<00:01:33.649> read<00:01:33.859> about<00:01:33.889> or<00:01:34.310> that

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
the cons that I've read about or that

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.309 
the cons that I've read about or that
people<00:01:34.609> have<00:01:34.819> concerns<00:01:35.149> about<00:01:35.359> this<00:01:35.659> is<00:01:35.869> that

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
people have concerns about this is that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.349 
people have concerns about this is that
what<00:01:36.679> if<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.889> spring<00:01:37.189> mechanism<00:01:37.369> break<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.149> it

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
what if the spring mechanism break so it

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.599 
what if the spring mechanism break so it
doesn't<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:38.959> know<00:01:39.169> come<00:01:39.469> out<00:01:39.619> or<00:01:40.069> when<00:01:40.490> you

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
doesn't you know come out or when you

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:42.219 
doesn't you know come out or when you
know<00:01:40.880> you're<00:01:41.119> pushing<00:01:41.329> it<00:01:41.569> it<00:01:41.779> continually

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
know you're pushing it it continually

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.589 
know you're pushing it it continually
comes<00:01:42.469> out<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:43.399> just<00:01:43.999> kind<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.299> kind<00:01:44.450> of

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:44.599 
comes out and so just kind of kind of

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.330 
comes out and so just kind of kind of
answer<00:01:44.989> that<00:01:45.020> or<00:01:45.349> my<00:01:45.469> thought<00:01:45.709> about<00:01:45.919> that<00:01:46.130> is

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
answer that or my thought about that is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.219 
answer that or my thought about that is
is<00:01:46.549> that<00:01:46.999> if<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.270> spring<00:01:47.539> mechanism<00:01:47.689> or

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
is that if the spring mechanism or

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.539 
is that if the spring mechanism or
didn't<00:01:48.560> come<00:01:48.679> out<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:49.069> know<00:01:49.159> it<00:01:49.249> could<00:01:49.369> easily

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
didn't come out you know it could easily

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.569 
didn't come out you know it could easily
still<00:01:50.450> be<00:01:50.599> pulled<00:01:50.869> out<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.259> then<00:01:51.859> you<00:01:52.489> could

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
still be pulled out and then you could

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.120 
still be pulled out and then you could
still<00:01:52.849> manually<00:01:53.270> still<00:01:53.630> strike<00:01:53.899> it<00:01:54.109> all<00:01:54.859> so

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
still manually still strike it all so

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.389 
still manually still strike it all so
it's<00:01:55.999> just<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.239> regular<00:01:56.569> rod<00:01:56.749> so<00:01:57.279> you<00:01:58.279> could

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
it's just a regular rod so you could

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.010 
it's just a regular rod so you could
always<00:01:58.549> use<00:01:58.669> your<00:01:59.119> knife<00:01:59.299> or<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.929> know

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
always use your knife or you know

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.399 
always use your knife or you know
another<00:02:00.499> striker<00:02:00.889> that<00:02:01.689> to<00:02:02.689> get<00:02:02.809> a<00:02:03.020> strike<00:02:03.289> out

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
another striker that to get a strike out

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.940 
another striker that to get a strike out
of<00:02:03.469> it<00:02:03.649> so<00:02:03.999> as<00:02:04.999> far<00:02:05.149> as<00:02:05.209> comparison<00:02:05.749> size<00:02:06.649> wise

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
of it so as far as comparison size wise

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.979 
of it so as far as comparison size wise
you<00:02:07.459> just<00:02:07.639> saw<00:02:07.759> this<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.330> light<00:02:08.599> my<00:02:08.750> fire

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
you just saw this is the light my fire

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.440 
you just saw this is the light my fire
striker<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.789> know<00:02:10.879> that's<00:02:11.030> kind<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.360> a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
striker so you know that's kind of a

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.940 
striker so you know that's kind of a
size<00:02:11.719> comparison<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.439> what<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.620> looks<00:02:12.769> like

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
size comparison and what it looks like

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.930 
size comparison and what it looks like
and<00:02:13.189> then<00:02:13.670> also<00:02:14.090> compared<00:02:14.689> to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and then also compared to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.330 
and then also compared to
the<00:02:15.180> ultimate<00:02:16.140> survival<00:02:16.530> technologies<00:02:17.040> blast

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
the ultimate survival technologies blast

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.780 
the ultimate survival technologies blast
match<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.480> blast<00:02:18.690> match<00:02:19.340> much<00:02:20.340> bigger<00:02:20.580> rod

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
match so the blast match much bigger rod

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.210 
match so the blast match much bigger rod
much<00:02:21.630> bigger<00:02:21.840> fire<00:02:22.050> structure<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:22.890> love<00:02:23.040> this

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
much bigger fire structure we love this

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.650 
much bigger fire structure we love this
fire<00:02:23.490> strike<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.820> fruit<00:02:24.000> around<00:02:24.150> camp<00:02:24.510> and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
fire strike to fruit around camp and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.090 
fire strike to fruit around camp and
things<00:02:24.780> like<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:24.960> likewise<00:02:25.800> it's<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
things like that likewise it's a

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.860 
things like that likewise it's a

out so anyways that's Sparky some

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.100 
out so anyways that's Sparky some
highlights<00:02:32.370> about<00:02:32.550> Sparky<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.780> we'll<00:02:34.020> go

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
highlights about Sparky so we'll go

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.870 
highlights about Sparky so we'll go
ahead<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.260> show<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.560> kind<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.800> how<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.640> works

ahead and show you kind of how it works

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.980 
ahead and show you kind of how it works
it<00:02:36.690> works<00:02:36.810> one-handed<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:39.840> can

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
it works one-handed so you can you can

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.110 
it works one-handed so you can you can
use<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.310> push<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.610> little<00:02:41.850> bit<00:02:42.030> of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
use it and you push a little bit of

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.810 
use it and you push a little bit of
pressure<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.660> hold<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.770> at<00:02:43.860> an<00:02:43.950> angle<00:02:44.100> and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
pressure and you hold it at an angle and

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.030 
pressure and you hold it at an angle and
push<00:02:45.090> down<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:45.930> that's<00:02:46.080> one<00:02:46.290> way<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.500> use<00:02:46.590> it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
push down so that's one way to use it

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.060 
push down so that's one way to use it
the<00:02:47.640> second<00:02:47.970> way<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.510> use<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.830> pinch

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
the second way to use it is you pinch

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.200 
the second way to use it is you pinch
with<00:02:50.280> your<00:02:50.310> thumb<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.850> actually<00:02:51.120> use

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
with your thumb and you actually use

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.720 
with your thumb and you actually use
your<00:02:51.360> finger<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:52.740> strike<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.190> way<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.400> it

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
your finger and strike that way so it

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.670 
your finger and strike that way so it
can<00:02:53.850> be<00:02:53.940> used<00:02:54.120> two<00:02:54.330> ways<00:02:54.540> one-handed<00:02:55.530> fire

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
can be used two ways one-handed fire

this cube of wet fire show you kind of

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.960 
this cube of wet fire show you kind of
how<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.560> works<00:03:01.740> out<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.430> I'll<00:03:02.520> just<00:03:02.700> pill<00:03:02.940> a
