 yes everyone knows her the problem if you have different lenses in use and 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.429
 want to make sure that the Chinese are really always really clean 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.869
 then it is sometimes quite difficult because just at the 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.349
 SLR cameras the minimum rules it changes then you come 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.529
 Fingerprint on it Dust percent always accumulates on the samples 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.859
 the glasses even with the current video cameras must pay attention to normal pressure 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.460
 that the lens is clean even when the front closes clean collects 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.050
 then a while some dust on the lens and around Dan 

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:46.269
 Wilson wanted a way to make it easy and clean 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.239
 Daum was worried by hammer here so'n cleaning pen and brush 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.680
 that they are with us 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.710
 and around here you can get the brush out with their saying Lens of 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.860
 our tv camera 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.370
 once brought and then you can with the brush for the first time ROG the dust particles 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.710
 "Remove it completely clean 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.030
 and then if you have fingerprints or other percent material left on the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.760
 There is then a brake every visitor dies that you can use around then 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 work a bit more and then this possible 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.690
 to clean properly 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.020
 There are also such pins now with battery then with the bandage 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.590
 rotating it but I think that is a bit Oberkirch 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.570
 Porta that it definitely absolutely sufficient to clean the lens of 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.750
 To clear dust 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.150
 and they would get what fingerprints are on the lens too 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.590
 remove that should be so far to clean Stefan Hammer under 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.250
