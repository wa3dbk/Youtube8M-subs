behind<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.700> km<00:00:36.090> spiders<00:00:36.540> will<00:00:36.719> just<00:00:36.870> make<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
behind the km spiders will just make a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.500 
behind the km spiders will just make a
trike<00:00:37.590> that's<00:00:37.890> actually<00:00:38.309> stable<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.360> what

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
trike that's actually stable so what

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.760 
trike that's actually stable so what
they<00:00:39.629> did<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.809> they<00:00:39.960> designed<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> off<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
they did is they designed it off a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.860 
they did is they designed it off a
snowmobile<00:00:41.730> chassis<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.329> having<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> wheels

snowmobile chassis and having the wheels
up<00:00:43.079> front<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.649> allowing<00:00:44.190> them<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> camber

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
up front and allowing them to camber

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.510 
up front and allowing them to camber
around<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> corners<00:00:45.980> makes<00:00:46.980> them<00:00:47.160> much<00:00:47.309> more

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
around the corners makes them much more

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.490 
around the corners makes them much more
stable<00:00:47.760> than<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> typical<00:00:48.329> trike<00:00:48.780> they<00:00:49.320> also

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
stable than the typical trike they also

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
stable than the typical trike they also
teamed<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.190> Bosch<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> German<00:00:51.030> computer
