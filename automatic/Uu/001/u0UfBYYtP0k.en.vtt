I'll go a goal more middle and I'll go

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.790 
I'll go a goal more middle and I'll go
high<00:02:23.960> high<00:02:24.319> coming<00:02:24.980> down<00:02:25.130> or<00:02:25.550> something

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
high high coming down or something

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.890 
high high coming down or something
so<00:02:27.700> that's<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.000> strength<00:02:28.240> training<00:02:28.420> exercise

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
so that's a strength training exercise

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.010 
so that's a strength training exercise
that<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.170> gonna<00:02:29.260> do<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:30.070> make<00:02:30.190> your<00:02:30.340> shot<00:02:30.580> work

that you gonna do to make your shot work

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.300 
that you gonna do to make your shot work
the<00:02:32.020> basic<00:02:32.230> problem<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.530> happens<00:02:32.950> when<00:02:33.190> you

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
the basic problem that happens when you

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.100 
the basic problem that happens when you
see<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.520> shot<00:02:33.820> if<00:02:34.060> your<00:02:34.150> shot<00:02:34.360> goes<00:02:34.570> into<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
see a shot if your shot goes into the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.110 
see a shot if your shot goes into the
net<00:02:35.260> you're<00:02:35.410> coming<00:02:35.680> down<00:02:35.860> on<00:02:35.890> too<00:02:36.190> much<00:02:36.370> that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
net you're coming down on too much that

to do this you flip the hand down you

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.960 
to do this you flip the hand down you
have<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:41.920> make<00:02:42.010> sure<00:02:42.190> your<00:02:42.310> hand<00:02:42.520> goes<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.700> read

sandy<00:03:12.880> four<00:03:13.270> steps<00:03:13.510> back<00:03:14.080> I<00:03:14.110> opened<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.830> hole<00:03:14.980> in

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
sandy four steps back I opened a hole in

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.560 
sandy four steps back I opened a hole in
front<00:03:15.340> of<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.489> court<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:15.910> opened<00:03:16.209> up<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.330> shirt

I'll<00:03:17.500> do<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.860> drop<00:03:18.070> shot<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:18.820> well<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.000> think<00:03:19.120> is

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
I'll do the drop shot so well I think is

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.940 
I'll do the drop shot so well I think is
that's<00:03:19.450> like<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.630> stand<00:03:19.930> my<00:03:20.020> ground<00:03:20.080> make

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
that's like I stand my ground make

impact that is crystal ball back deep

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.070 
impact that is crystal ball back deep
with<00:03:23.530> spin<00:03:24.270> that's<00:03:25.270> why<00:03:25.450> a<00:03:25.480> lot<00:03:25.570> of<00:03:25.720> people<00:03:25.810> and

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
with spin that's why a lot of people and

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.290 
with spin that's why a lot of people and
I<00:03:26.170> play<00:03:26.410> you'll<00:03:27.070> see<00:03:27.190> me<00:03:27.250> up<00:03:27.489> they<00:03:27.730> had<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.000> deep

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
I play you'll see me up they had a deep

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.490 
I play you'll see me up they had a deep
loop<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.660> someone<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:28.989> I'm<00:03:29.110> coming<00:03:29.290> behind

loop to someone that I'm coming behind

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.920 
loop to someone that I'm coming behind
it<00:03:29.860> is<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.340> deep<00:03:30.670> loop<00:03:31.180> approach<00:03:31.510> shot<00:03:31.750> it's<00:03:31.870> a

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
it is the deep loop approach shot it's a

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.470 
it is the deep loop approach shot it's a
very<00:03:32.230> difficult<00:03:32.440> shot<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.799> hit<00:03:33.160> low<00:03:33.580> I<00:03:33.940> suppose

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
very difficult shot to hit low I suppose

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.840 
very difficult shot to hit low I suppose
at<00:03:34.600> net<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.530> it's<00:03:35.680> even<00:03:35.890> hard<00:03:36.160> I<00:03:36.280> push<00:03:36.430> it<00:03:36.610> back

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
at net and it's even hard I push it back

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.479 
at net and it's even hard I push it back
if<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.870> end<00:03:37.989> up<00:03:38.080> beyond<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.530> baseline<00:03:39.040> then

if you end up beyond the baseline then

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.370 
if you end up beyond the baseline then
you<00:03:39.580> have<00:03:39.730> no<00:03:39.820> angle<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.690> push<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:40.989> back<00:03:41.170> you

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
you have no angle and I push it back you

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.479 
you have no angle and I push it back you
can<00:03:41.410> be<00:03:41.590> very<00:03:41.830> difficult<00:03:42.010> for<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.310> hit<00:03:42.459> a

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
can be very difficult for you hit a

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.370 
can be very difficult for you hit a

great passing shot and that's what we're

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.199 
great passing shot and that's what we're
