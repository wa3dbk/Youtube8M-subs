00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.250
 ah 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:19.010
 ol spartans this time we will talk about a 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.680
 ong ship that was very important 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.520
 during the conflict with the covenant me 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:29.360
 I mean the heart of my klodian which 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.150
 ship structure form of the nfc that 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.280
 participated in several clashes 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.500
 during the war with the covenant the 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.290
 last of which was a trip 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.000
 dismal to the remote colony of something list 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:47.390
 with approximately 485 meters of 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.720
 end to end and with a weight of 7 thousand 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.420
 900 metric tons 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.780
 lamy could transport a couple of 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.690
 magnetic acceleration cannons charges 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.120
 nuclear explosives chivas and a 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.269
 training for missile firing 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.159
 archer were undoubtedly a ship for 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.670
 keep in mind though the new 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.680
 destroyers of the nfc 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.409
 historically they were used in missions of 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.070
 escort or in fighter engagements to 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.010
 big scale 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.229
 my glory had been sent only to the 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.659
 tree plant where a small 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.710
 covenant contingent had touched down 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.869
 Upon his arrival Lamy Klodian was to accelerate 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.540
 the gravitational well of a giant 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.630
 gaseous close following the path 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.450
 from an asteroid that was heading towards the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.050
 planet after deploying a 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.350
 detachment that includes several ssd or 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.350
 the destroyer ship should meet with 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.020
 a frigate in orbit to help with the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.330
 evacuation after evacuating to the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.160
 population and destroy a series of 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.460
 prototype weapon systems 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.619
 classified with what was avoided that 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 the settlers captured the last 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.490
 technology 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.440
 these hands had to leave the orbit and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.310
 flee before the arrival of forces 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.620
 biggest enemies however the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.959
 heart of my colony never reached the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.930
 bolis the ship was attacked by a group 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.390
 of beaten ships charge after being 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.740
 violently approached the ship was 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.400
 destroyed 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.590
 the protocol require an act 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.810
 would prevent information about the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.960
 location of the earth fell hands of the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.420
 enemy this is all for now spartans 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.790
 I hope he has liked to leave his 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.200
 like if you want to continue receiving 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.150
 information about 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.670
 events that have to do with 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.590
 remember halo that follow me in my 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.270
 facebook page which is in the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.940
 description of the video that follow me in 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.210
 twitter that subscribe to the channel if not yet 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.210
 they have done it and until the next video 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.210
 spartans 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.310
 what is
