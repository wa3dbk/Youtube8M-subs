00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:36.510

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
18 I Donald's it's a little bit ugly I

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.270 
18 I Donald's it's a little bit ugly I
mean<00:00:56.680> little<00:00:56.950> bit<00:00:57.130> expensive<00:00:57.580> I<00:00:57.910> application

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
mean little bit expensive I application

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.240 
mean little bit expensive I application
that

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.360 

as<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.840> now<00:01:07.440> there<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.160> no

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
as you can see right now there is no

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.410 
as you can see right now there is no
signal<00:01:09.140> he's<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.290> G<00:01:10.700> gps<00:01:11.700> reception<00:01:12.090> is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
signal he's a G gps reception is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.720 
signal he's a G gps reception is
currently<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.740> sufficient

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
currently not sufficient

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.750 
currently not sufficient
so<00:01:17.100> once<00:01:18.100> I<00:01:18.430> get<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:18.850> signal<00:01:19.740> but

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
so once I get the signal but

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.050 
so once I get the signal but
on<00:01:22.240> my<00:01:22.420> phone<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:24.070> gonna<00:01:24.250> be<00:01:24.340> able<00:01:24.550> to<00:01:24.820> use<00:01:25.030> it

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
on my phone I'm gonna be able to use it

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.360 
on my phone I'm gonna be able to use it
otherwise

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
otherwise

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.800 
otherwise
and<00:01:27.940> that<00:01:28.210> so

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and that so

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.630 
and that so
the<00:01:31.409> design<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.380> application

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the design of the application

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.890 
the design of the application
it's<00:01:36.240> pretty<00:01:36.450> good<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:37.740> got<00:01:38.130> more<00:01:38.310> signal

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
it's pretty good but you got more signal

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.530 
it's pretty good but you got more signal
can<00:01:39.900> use<00:01:40.110> it

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
can use it

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.710 
can use it
so<00:01:42.200> I<00:01:42.620> don't<00:01:42.860> know<00:01:43.040> if<00:01:43.070> II<00:01:43.280> anybody<00:01:44.180> else<00:01:44.360> has

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
so I don't know if II anybody else has

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.000 
so I don't know if II anybody else has
the<00:01:44.900> same<00:01:44.930> problem<00:01:45.220> or<00:01:46.780> lose<00:01:47.780> signal<00:01:48.470> with<00:01:48.890> the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
the same problem or lose signal with the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.310 
the same problem or lose signal with the
GPS

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.880 

unit

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
unit

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.450 
unit
so<00:01:55.580> that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
so that

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.540 
so that
oh<00:01:57.549> my

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.700 

for<00:02:01.120> my<00:02:01.300> deal

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
for my deal

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.850 
for my deal
it's<00:02:03.340> not<00:02:03.580> very<00:02:03.640> helpful<00:02:04.570> using<00:02:05.560> this

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
it's not very helpful using this

00:02:05.860 --> 00:03:40.830 
it's not very helpful using this
application

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.000 

finally<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:42.050> was<00:03:42.470> able<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:42.830> get<00:03:43.099> sick<00:03:43.580> now

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.620 

but<00:03:46.610> I

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
but I

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.630 
but I
the<00:03:48.200> most<00:03:48.410> important<00:03:48.770> thing<00:03:48.800> is<00:03:49.010> when<00:03:49.490> you

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
the most important thing is when you

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.420 
the most important thing is when you
need<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:50.000> you<00:03:50.600> got<00:03:50.750> no<00:03:50.930> signal<00:03:51.230> so<00:03:51.680> on

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.970 

see<00:03:55.090> right<00:03:55.750> now<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:56.170> just<00:03:56.459> lost<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.609> signal

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
see right now I just lost the signal

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:31.239 
see right now I just lost the signal
so

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:31.249 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:34.419 

your<00:04:31.639> point<00:04:31.939> miles<00:04:32.449> turn<00:04:32.959> right<00:04:33.109> onto<00:04:33.739> West

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:34.429 
your point miles turn right onto West

00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:39.170 
your point miles turn right onto West
Elm<00:04:34.759> Street

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.800
