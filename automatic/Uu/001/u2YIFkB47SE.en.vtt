00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
tree coming up i said to myself that

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.730 
tree coming up i said to myself that
trees<00:02:46.600> probably<00:02:46.960> all<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.260> way<00:02:47.350> back<00:02:47.500> up<00:02:47.680> into

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
trees probably all the way back up into

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.890 
trees probably all the way back up into
that<00:02:47.920> Cove<00:02:48.190> so<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:48.940> threw<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.270> up<00:02:49.420> probably

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
that Cove so I threw it up probably
