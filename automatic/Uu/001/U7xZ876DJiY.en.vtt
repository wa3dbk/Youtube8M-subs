00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.200
 I am Jorge the garden 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.320
 the collaborating architect of the area 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.550
 club planning and good today 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.530
 we come to show you what we are 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.830
 doing in the visitor's locker room 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.650
 well basically it 's the duplication of 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.029
 the area intended for players who 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.010
 we come to visit us team 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.720
 they come to visit we passed 100 meters 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.730
 squares that we had until the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.160
 Championship passed to 200 square meters 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.840
 that was the first big acquisition 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.329
 let's say we doubled the area of 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.129
 service and internally in addition to that 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.170
 good duplication like out there you can 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.570
 watch 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.980
 we have made a great hall of 100 meters 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.620
 50 percent squares of that 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.649
 surface that will be allocated to 23 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.390
 lockers for each player with which 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.210
 is also designed to receive 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.329
 international delegations where good 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.760
 each one has his fixed position in everything 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.260
 what is the perimeter of this room and in 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.030
 the center will be shirts for 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.760
 that sports physiologists and physiotherapists act 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.409
 other that in terms of what the room is 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.530
 and now what is the income is accessed 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.179
 from the preheating part and it 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.190
 arrives at a kind of platform to a 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:15.220
 intermediate level where there will be a led 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.649
 here in front of me where they are going to be able 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.060
 move the television transmissions or 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.390
 project the own video for 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.780
 strategy and others and planning what 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.640
 which is the game and is received with a 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.250
 lucky showcase where they are going to 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.049
 be able to put all the prop part 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.450
 bags and other input requirements 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.060
 need the campus in turn to 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.830
 let's go down let's say this platform and it's 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.280
 before the room will be the part 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.480
 where the drinks are going to be 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.020
 hydration 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.500
 that is, players access the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:54.040
 life in your premises is a little bit 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.860
 good performance layout this in 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.940
 principle arises on the part of groups of 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.240
 a work that the truth that we had 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.770
 postponed for our opponents and 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.260
 good is working the area of 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.760
 planning of the club that runs the 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.640
 engineer gustavo gutierrez 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.170
 member of the board of directors and good 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.180
 we train with other colleagues like the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.560
 architect carlos curti the architect 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.050
 marcelo perino the architect eduardo 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.660
 bressán 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.420
 sebastián olivier who is a stable member 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.530
 of the club and bacon and germán is such and 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.270
 us what is the project and what is 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.570
 executing the people owned by 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.100
 club 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.290
 with intendancy let's say we 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.390
 we monitor and do what is the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.850
 construction management and we're good 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.310
 arriving well for the start of the next 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.780
 championship on the first date good 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.760
 we play from visitors that we have 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.710
 still a small margin from a 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.800
 week more so he'll be comfortable 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.690
 to look for that term look at the area 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.880
 of preheating that is here 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.610
 Our booth of luck of hall of 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.440
 input this and the idea is to unite what 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.900
 also of all the benefits that 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.090
 the player needs to justly 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.880
 preheat and to make the break 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.760
 the idea is I do not know if we'll get to this 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.210
 stage but will be in the next recess is 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.310
 when the synthetic turf 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.540
 and good that I have a scope just 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.160
 so you can preheat with the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.100
 we have the dimensions the scope is 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.300
 the idea is to assemble the base and the ground 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.360
 sports like so they can 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.860
 perform those activities and that's 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.170
 Well that's also how you say it is the 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.540
 entrance hall to what is the locker room 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.330
 that for us we have talked with 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.970
 a planning let's say internally already 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.920
 we do not take it as simply an area 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.230
 to change the sports attire to 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.480
 competitive but we take it as a 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.070
 kind of athletic base so that 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.140
 really our adversaries do not 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.290
 it is convenient but they feel comfortable and 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.500
 can and can perform to the maximum 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.640
 your chances in preparation 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.250
 Well, let's say the idea is also 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.770
 all take it in tune as we gave it 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.750
 priority to the teams that come to us 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.240
 visit because a debt we had 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.010
 does the idea with them a lot 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.990
 this we say take it in tune and 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.940
 going up as it started a while ago 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.650
 with the first victory in our 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.440
 first division team take it to 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.930
 this level in the logical proportion and by 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.460
 there on other surfaces and with other 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.810
 dimensions because they are also other 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.900
 scopes but it's having 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.000
 a level of excellence towards the person 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.620
 which is actually the focus from the 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.740
 sporting show that he had in 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.000
 our stand dreamed of the future let's say the 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.400
 existence that the surface is 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.410
 prepared tomorrow, this is 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.710
 compartmentalized in four humid boxes 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.360
 watertight nominator urinals and bachas and 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.060
 in the amount of showers that is 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.580
 abundant with which one sector prayed 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.370
 day tomorrow we plan to make a sort of 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.650
 jacuzzi, always thinking and dreaming 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.050
 let alone future spouse in the world 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.790
 so that when it ever comes some 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.729
 national team or a team of him and 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.460
 for some tribute party or some 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.889
 special cup really well that's the 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.720
 european wardrobe that the club dream 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.850
 in what we take from 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.770
 planning and we develop and what 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.660
 Intendance with the boys here is what 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.729
 which is carrying out of which he lives 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.860
 in a small proportion and when 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.570
 we show you are going to see that everything 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.669
 this dream really luckily we're going 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.770
 to be able to carry out the practice 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.090
 danger that the games that come will 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.230
 want to stay to live 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.230
 it only fits very well
