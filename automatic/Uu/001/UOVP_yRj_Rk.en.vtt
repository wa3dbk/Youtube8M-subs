00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.200
 the entire group of phillip cocu 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.899
 coach on the field this morning 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.750
 three players who trained separately from this 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.070
 entire group go there the karim mower 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.780
 stretch the burden of a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.280
 hamstring injury 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.960
 they trained together with cees van der 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.240
 the physiotherapist and linden 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.560
 A little further away is Santiago Arias with a 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.449
 bruised foot 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.519
 train together with physical therapist rob 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.789
 old country that is trio against go ahead 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.380
 cannot be used on Saturday 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.519
 phillip cocu expects in deventer one 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.050
 awkward match 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.020
 refers to the previous one 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.550
 season well we did last year 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.390
 be able to experience how things are going 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.820
 and came out at step 2 the backlog 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.280
 still with a lot of physical in your audience 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.039
 what deficits are there so it must be fine 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.140
 be prepared for that match we 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.719
 will just be very focused and 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.890
 to play constructed because you see 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.989
 the other teams also find it difficult 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.660
 so there we have to go on everything 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.180
 be prepared and just cold cold 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.949
 and then laying plane which will be of, and 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.320
 what do you expect for your opponent 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.240
 will be a counter will who will try 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.700
 until the hard to go 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.920
 and yes you know they have me go 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.500
 always extra with extreme see then 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.270
 must be prepared and it is one 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.130
 team that sometimes just can do well 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.020
 football and if you have too much of 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.490
 football and maybe then yes gives the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.990
 too confident such a match one 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.790
 bit how it goes and should go there 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.040
 just sit short and immediately 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.080
 that give that feeling that a sample of 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.150
 it also but may drive are no 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.520
 easy way there are no small ones 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.270
 opponents you must be whole 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.549
 concentrated 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.159
 siebe sharpness go money to redeem 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.409
 certainly after the defeat one 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.930
 undeserved defeat to Ajax that we 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.790
 had to show good response 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.290
 that disappointment a bit quick 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.509
 washed away from the week 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.030
 the hair you always take it anyway 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.610
 a two-day pleasure in us too 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.869
 large within the group but then and we 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.640
 our visor focused on the competition of 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.130
 Saturday that 's next with that 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.320
 again the most important thing and then six 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.210
 the ego the real outside world think that 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.560
 PSV the national championship no longer 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.170
 can miss and is already working hard on it 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.069
 count when psv could be champion 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.869
 to become 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.970
 is that at the beginning of April at home against pec 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.370
 zwolle or maybe a week later at home 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.209
 against heerenveen for phillip cocu de 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.890
 task to that 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.569
 and for three outside reflections 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.180
 to keep the group 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.890
 yes it goes in both cases if 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.930
 it gave very good condition number 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.709
 points for you can do it in a jury 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.630
 to break 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.700
 it goes it's times less than 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.100
 goes through very quickly 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.860
 crisis is going to end up there must 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.800
 you like sinks players 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.390
 good for closing because only what what 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.250
 we have to do is with the match 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.450
 base about focusing on training 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.190
 training week we now who do you think 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.940
 fully have a next one 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.830
 competition is not always easy 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.530
 think we have another one right now 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.049
 handle it much better than the last 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.489
 I have no problem noticing 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.410
 I'm roon your best with next 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.280
 competition and I just want that again 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.480
 inside and that is my goal now and then 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.970
 I just did so well that we now 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.069
 or point ahead and that yes that is 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.940
 Lemmer comes my team and I think that 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.720
 we 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.400
 we are not at all concerned with that 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.209
 we are also just busy with it for a week 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.530
 next game 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.400
 so no room at all for that 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.019
 foil so I don't want that in anyway 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.340
 the groups we have and can have 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.350
 play football very well or so very much 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.940
 focus too sharp and if we have one 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.590
 bit of laziness in our yarn then 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.200
 it quickly 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.190
 so there will be a dyke not to get in there 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.410
 to be sent 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.180
 almost not counting no I am 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.310
 is not a count at all for me 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.099
 really the most important thing now 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.120
 we have played well there we ayers not 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.440
 had the result 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.540
 now you know the next one is there 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.950
 more important both the results well the 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.140
 next match against go ahead 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.670
 eagles in the eagle's chest in the middle of one 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.440
 residential area there 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.599
 phillip cocu expects a fanatic 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.090
 blueness 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.750
 yes in ryan role will be stormy 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.430
 to start 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.590
 expectations mission this is part 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.239
 but they have too 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.480
 many matches show them 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.280
 compact make small so then 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.680
 you have to play very meticulously because is through 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.459
 it to come and not in the counter 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.690
 be surprised 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.519
 so a competition where they might be fast 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.930
 and they will start aggressively 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.669
 with a lot of physical strength in the house so we 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.049
 must also be smart with it 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.049
 use our own qualities
