now we're going to make one so first go

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.530 
now we're going to make one so first go
to<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.340> flat<00:01:14.670> area<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.360> put<00:01:16.170> your<00:01:16.350> water<00:01:16.530> down

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.300 

you<00:01:21.540> should<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:22.320> able<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.560> see<00:01:22.740> where's<00:01:22.950> was

you should be able to see where's was
coming<00:01:23.790> from<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:25.880> now<00:01:27.890> make<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:30.560> free<00:01:31.560> wide

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
coming from so here now make a free wide

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.530 
coming from so here now make a free wide
block<00:01:33.049> that<00:01:34.049> spans<00:01:35.210> until<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:37.110> water<00:01:37.430> ends

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
block that spans until the water ends

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.030 
block that spans until the water ends
right<00:01:39.540> there

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.810 

and<00:01:44.490> fill<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.330> up<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.890> wall<00:01:47.160> is<00:01:47.370> very

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
and fill that up the wall is very

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.200 
and fill that up the wall is very
important<00:01:48.510> as<00:01:48.660> it<00:01:48.720> stops<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.700> TNT<00:01:50.700> from

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
important as it stops the TNT from

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.100 
important as it stops the TNT from
causing<00:01:51.540> damage<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.140> its<00:01:52.440> surroundings<00:01:54.110> now

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
click on them free time so they are far

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.550 
click on them free time so they are far
apart<00:03:27.080> from<00:03:27.290> each<00:03:27.560> other<00:03:28.990> so<00:03:29.990> this<00:03:30.200> will<00:03:30.350> cause

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
apart from each other so this will cause

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.320 
apart from each other so this will cause
more<00:03:30.830> delay<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:33.490> continue<00:03:34.490> to<00:03:34.520> redstone<00:03:34.940> and

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
more delay and continue to redstone and

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.910 
more delay and continue to redstone and
to<00:03:35.660> come<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.380> about<00:03:36.590> here<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:37.760> here<00:03:38.860> now<00:03:39.860> the

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
to come to about here to here now the

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.780 
to come to about here to here now the
fill<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.400> up<00:03:40.550> it<00:03:41.240> is<00:03:42.140> very<00:03:42.530> important<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.490> you

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
fill it up it is very important that you

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.760 
fill it up it is very important that you
don't<00:03:43.970> cover<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:44.900> water<00:03:45.200> source<00:03:47.770> because

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
don't cover this water source because

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.970 
don't cover this water source because
then<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:50.270> war<00:03:50.450> would<00:03:50.600> disappear<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.470> it

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
then the war would disappear and it

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.430 
then the war would disappear and it
won't<00:03:52.220> work<00:03:52.370> properly<00:03:53.560> so<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:54.620> can<00:03:55.270> see<00:03:56.440> make

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
won't work properly so you can see make

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.180 
won't work properly so you can see make
sure<00:03:57.710> the<00:03:57.890> war<00:03:58.070> so<00:03:58.280> it's<00:03:58.430> not<00:03:58.550> covered<00:04:00.190> and

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
sure the war so it's not covered and

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:09.820 
sure the war so it's not covered and
fill<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.120> up<00:04:04.960> put<00:04:05.960> the<00:04:06.110> TNT<00:04:06.620> here<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:07.400> float<00:04:08.830> so

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
fill it up put the TNT here and float so

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.410 
fill it up put the TNT here and float so
and<00:04:10.570> to<00:04:11.570> activate<00:04:12.080> it<00:04:12.200> just<00:04:12.410> pull<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.680> lever

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
and to activate it just pull the lever

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.479 
and to activate it just pull the lever
so<00:04:14.420> then<00:04:14.630> fly<00:04:14.960> down<00:04:15.200> so<00:04:16.010> I'm<00:04:16.070> good<00:04:16.280> in<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:17.299> shoot

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
so then fly down so I'm good in a shoot

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.230 
so then fly down so I'm good in a shoot
now<00:04:19.489> we'll<00:04:19.700> try<00:04:19.850> again<00:04:20.239> because<00:04:22.030> there<00:04:23.030> may<00:04:23.210> be

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
now we'll try again because there may be

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.210 
now we'll try again because there may be
a<00:04:23.390> chance<00:04:23.690> that<00:04:23.900> we'll<00:04:24.260> fly<00:04:24.500> too<00:04:24.560> high<00:04:24.800> into

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
a chance that we'll fly too high into

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.540 
a chance that we'll fly too high into
the<00:04:25.250> air<00:04:25.430> it's<00:04:26.090> time<00:04:26.330> I'll<00:04:26.540> use<00:04:26.570> less<00:04:26.960> CT<00:04:28.660> maybe

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
the air it's time I'll use less CT maybe

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:40.390 
the air it's time I'll use less CT maybe
22

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.899 

there<00:04:41.400> we<00:04:41.460> go<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:43.650> obviously<00:04:44.129> with<00:04:44.430> more<00:04:44.669> T&amp;T

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
there we go so obviously with more T&amp;T

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.680 
there we go so obviously with more T&amp;T
it<00:04:45.720> will<00:04:45.870> shoot<00:04:46.139> further<00:04:47.060> now<00:04:48.060> this<00:04:48.300> could<00:04:48.629> be

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
it will shoot further now this could be

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.010 
it will shoot further now this could be
used<00:04:49.470> for<00:04:49.770> like<00:04:50.069> playing<00:04:50.430> on<00:04:51.020> survival
