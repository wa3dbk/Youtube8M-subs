are<00:01:00.249> all<00:01:00.309> kinds<00:01:00.670> of<00:01:00.760> situations<00:01:01.269> where<00:01:01.749> you

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
are all kinds of situations where you

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.760 
are all kinds of situations where you
need<00:01:01.929> to<00:01:02.019> provide<00:01:02.230> a<00:01:02.499> client<00:01:03.070> monitor<00:01:03.429> or<00:01:03.609> a

need to provide a client monitor or a
director's<00:01:05.770> monitor<00:01:06.190> so<00:01:06.370> that<00:01:06.400> people<00:01:06.760> can

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
director's monitor so that people can

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.250 
director's monitor so that people can
see<00:01:07.060> what<00:01:07.300> what<00:01:07.570> you're<00:01:07.720> doing<00:01:08.020> while<00:01:08.140> you're

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.859 
if you are gonna be monitoring you've
got<00:01:56.859> to<00:01:56.950> think<00:01:57.100> in<00:01:57.280> twos<00:01:57.880> at<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.479> very<00:01:58.719> minimum

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
got to think in twos at the very minimum

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.599 
got to think in twos at the very minimum
you've<00:01:59.530> got<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.740> take<00:01:59.890> your<00:01:59.920> signal<00:02:00.310> out<00:02:00.399> from

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
you've got to take your signal out from

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.310 
you've got to take your signal out from
here<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.030> put<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.479> up<00:02:01.570> on<00:02:01.659> a<00:02:01.719> monitor<00:02:02.079> for<00:02:02.229> you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
here and put it up on a monitor for you

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.620 
here and put it up on a monitor for you
to<00:02:02.439> see<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:02.799> then<00:02:03.310> send<00:02:03.939> that<00:02:04.030> signal<00:02:04.270> out<00:02:04.450> to

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
to see and then send that signal out to

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.380 
to see and then send that signal out to
somebody<00:02:04.930> else<00:02:05.109> so<00:02:05.820> now<00:02:06.820> that<00:02:06.880> we're<00:02:07.179> in<00:02:07.270> the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
somebody else so now that we're in the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.510 
somebody else so now that we're in the
how<00:02:07.600> of<00:02:07.929> monitoring<00:02:08.320> and<00:02:08.530> you're<00:02:09.009> thinking<00:02:09.220> in

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
how of monitoring and you're thinking in

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.550 
how of monitoring and you're thinking in
twos<00:02:09.789> when<00:02:10.420> you're<00:02:10.539> deciding<00:02:11.050> which<00:02:11.170> monitor

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
twos when you're deciding which monitor

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.650 
twos when you're deciding which monitor
to<00:02:11.650> pick<00:02:11.860> up<00:02:12.010> keep<00:02:12.760> in<00:02:12.880> mind<00:02:13.090> it's<00:02:13.360> going<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.570> be

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
to pick up keep in mind it's going to be

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.870 
to pick up keep in mind it's going to be
very<00:02:13.900> beneficial<00:02:14.080> if<00:02:14.650> you've<00:02:15.070> got<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.490> looping

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
very beneficial if you've got a looping

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.270 
very beneficial if you've got a looping
monitor<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.660> if<00:02:16.810> you're<00:02:16.930> going<00:02:17.140> composite<00:02:17.740> you

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
monitor so if you're going composite you

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.830 
monitor so if you're going composite you
want<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.520> have<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> loop<00:02:18.970> out<00:02:19.210> of<00:02:19.660> your

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
want to have a loop out of your

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.840 
want to have a loop out of your
composite<00:02:20.140> monitor<00:02:20.560> if<00:02:20.710> you're<00:02:21.070> going<00:02:21.250> HDMI

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
composite monitor if you're going HDMI

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.650 
composite monitor if you're going HDMI
you'd<00:02:22.330> better

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
you'd better

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.620 
you'd better
an<00:02:22.690> HDMI<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.650> an<00:02:24.040> HDMI<00:02:24.370> out<00:02:24.730> otherwise

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
an HDMI in and an HDMI out otherwise

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.910 
an HDMI in and an HDMI out otherwise
you're<00:02:26.170> not<00:02:26.260> going<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.470> be<00:02:26.530> able<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.680> send<00:02:26.860> that

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
you're not going to be able to send that

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.040 
you're not going to be able to send that
signal<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.490> your<00:02:27.820> director<00:02:28.180> monitor<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.900> your

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
be looking at your signal when you're

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.990 
be looking at your signal when you're
monitoring<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.650> composite<00:02:36.190> you've<00:02:36.820> got<00:02:36.970> a

monitoring and composite you've got a

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.110

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.730 
signal I recommend if you're gonna be
doing<00:02:46.450> high-definition<00:02:46.960> production<00:02:47.350> you

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
doing high-definition production you

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.080 
doing high-definition production you
might<00:02:47.920> as<00:02:48.040> well<00:02:48.070> have<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.610> high-definition

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
might as well have a high-definition

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.240 
might as well have a high-definition
monitor<00:02:49.690> now<00:02:50.140> before<00:02:50.470> we<00:02:50.560> go<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.860> little<00:02:51.130> bit

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
monitor now before we go a little bit

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.190 
monitor now before we go a little bit
further<00:02:51.550> into<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.000> monitoring<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.630> twos<00:02:52.870> I

further into the monitoring and twos I

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.720 
further into the monitoring and twos I
