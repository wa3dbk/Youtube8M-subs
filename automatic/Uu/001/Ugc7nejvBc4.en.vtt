00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.240 
armor which is inside the garment here
pull<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:51.990> out<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.409> show<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.950> yeah

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
pull one out I can show it to you yeah

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.330 
pull one out I can show it to you yeah
let's<00:01:53.399> take<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.610> look<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.930> d3o<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.829> our

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
let's take a look the d3o is our

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.969 
let's take a look the d3o is our
advanced<00:01:57.090> armor<00:01:57.390> system<00:01:57.780> what<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:58.740> call

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
advanced armor system what we call

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.670 
advanced armor system what we call
intelligent<00:01:59.610> armor<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.170> does<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
intelligent armor and what it does it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.610 
intelligent armor and what it does it
allows<00:02:01.950> us<00:02:02.219> to

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
allows us to

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.950 
allows us to
use<00:02:05.620> an<00:02:05.800> armor<00:02:06.100> piece<00:02:06.730> that<00:02:07.120> five<00:02:07.390> provides

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
use an armor piece that five provides

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.950 
use an armor piece that five provides
full<00:02:08.350> siiii<00:02:08.729> protection<00:02:09.729> but<00:02:10.240> it's<00:02:10.360> soft<00:02:10.630> it's

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
full siiii protection but it's soft it's

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.090 
full siiii protection but it's soft it's
flexible<00:02:11.470> it's<00:02:11.620> about<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.800> third<00:02:12.070> the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
flexible it's about a third the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.860 
flexible it's about a third the
thickness<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.760> standard<00:02:13.120> pu<00:02:13.540> polyurethane

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
thickness of a standard pu polyurethane

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.220 
thickness of a standard pu polyurethane
armor<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.860> what<00:02:15.820> happens<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.330> when<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.630> you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
armor and what happens is when you you

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.600 
armor and what happens is when you you
can<00:02:17.380> see<00:02:17.500> how<00:02:17.560> flexible<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.310> when<00:02:18.490> you

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
can see how flexible this is when you

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.150 
can see how flexible this is when you
hit<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.940> with<00:02:18.970> energy<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:20.620> molecule<00:02:21.040> is

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
hit it with energy the molecule is

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.950 
hit it with energy the molecule is
tighten<00:02:21.520> up<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.820> provides<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.390> same<00:02:22.630> level

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
tighten up and provides that same level

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.540 
tighten up and provides that same level
of<00:02:23.050> CER<00:02:23.590> more<00:02:23.710> protection<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.280> we've<00:02:24.400> all

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
of CER more protection that we've all

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.700 
of CER more protection that we've all
come<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:24.880> know<00:02:25.000> but<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.570> softer<00:02:26.080> flexible

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
come to know but in a softer flexible

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.680 
come to know but in a softer flexible
more<00:02:27.070> dynamic<00:02:27.610> piece<00:02:27.820> so<00:02:28.300> it's<00:02:28.420> going<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.600> be

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
more dynamic piece so it's going to be

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.240 
more dynamic piece so it's going to be
more<00:02:28.870> comfortable<00:02:29.260> for<00:02:29.440> somebody<00:02:29.800> where<00:02:30.040> but

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
more comfortable for somebody where but

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.410 
more comfortable for somebody where but
it<00:02:30.340> offered<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.700> same<00:02:30.850> protection<00:02:31.330> is

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
it offered the same protection is

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.850 
it offered the same protection is
something<00:02:31.690> that's<00:02:31.750> more<00:02:31.930> harder<00:02:32.380> or<00:02:32.560> just

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
something that's more harder or just

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.470 
something that's more harder or just
more<00:02:33.310> commonly<00:02:33.760> found<00:02:33.940> at<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.180> point

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
more commonly found at that point

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.840 
more commonly found at that point
exactly<00:02:34.930> we<00:02:35.620> do<00:02:35.800> this<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.190> shoulders<00:02:36.670> and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
for the pant we also do that in the

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.100 
for the pant we also do that in the
knees<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.400> hips<00:02:42.580> perfect<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.810> somebody's
