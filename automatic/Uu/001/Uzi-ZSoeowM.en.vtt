00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
handle in the 90 degree position you can

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.630 
handle in the 90 degree position you can
offer<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.410> hand<00:01:00.560> handle<00:01:00.920> back<00:01:01.160> in<00:01:01.370> again

offer the hand handle back in again

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.060 
offer the hand handle back in again
because<00:01:02.180> now<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:02.630> can<00:01:02.960> see<00:01:03.170> both<00:01:03.200> screws<00:01:03.890> so

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
because now you can see both screws so

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:12.610 
because now you can see both screws so
with<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.460> driver<00:01:05.170> we<00:01:06.170> remove<00:01:08.859> the<00:01:09.859> screws

these screws actually anchor into the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.450 
these screws actually anchor into the
part<00:01:15.410> that<00:01:16.160> we're<00:01:16.340> about<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.640> replay<00:01:21.460> removing

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
part that we're about to replay removing

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.640 
part that we're about to replay removing
the<00:01:22.640> handle<00:01:23.060> leaving<00:01:23.870> the<00:01:23.990> handle<00:01:24.350> in<00:01:24.530> the

the handle leaving the handle in the
same<00:01:24.860> position<00:01:25.370> we'll<00:01:25.580> put<00:01:25.760> that<00:01:25.850> on<00:01:25.910> one<00:01:26.150> side

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
same position we'll put that on one side

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.050 
same position we'll put that on one side
for<00:01:26.660> later<00:01:26.840> because<00:01:27.620> we've<00:01:28.010> left<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.400> handle

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
for later because we've left the handle

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.910 
for later because we've left the handle
in<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.300> open<00:01:29.630> position<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:30.200> allows<00:01:30.500> us<00:01:30.740> to

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
in the open position it allows us to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.130 
in the open position it allows us to

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.250 
the center ones of the center two are
actually<00:02:34.070> retaining<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.910> cover<00:02:35.150> plate<00:02:35.480> so

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
actually retaining the cover plate so

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:46.910 
actually retaining the cover plate so
we'll<00:02:36.530> need<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.709> keep<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.070> safe

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.750 

final<00:02:47.920> screw<00:02:48.159> there<00:02:50.010> now<00:02:51.010> we<00:02:51.069> can<00:02:51.310> take<00:02:51.549> out

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
final screw there now we can take out

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.649 
final screw there now we can take out
the<00:02:51.909> mechanism<00:02:52.480> from<00:02:52.659> the<00:02:52.750> window<00:02:54.480> that's<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
the mechanism from the window that's the

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:06.930 
the mechanism from the window that's the
bottom<00:02:55.989> section<00:03:00.989> top<00:03:01.989> section<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:06.580> this<00:03:06.700> is

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
bottom section top section and this is

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.339 
bottom section top section and this is
the<00:03:07.410> faulty<00:03:08.410> mechanisms<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:10.180> replay<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.019> new

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
the faulty mechanisms to replay the new

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.890 
the faulty mechanisms to replay the new
mechanism<00:03:12.010> needs<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.610> be<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.329> open

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
mechanism needs to be in the open

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.460 
mechanism needs to be in the open
position<00:03:14.280> once<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.670> installed<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.379> it

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
position once you installed so that it

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.259 
position once you installed so that it
will<00:03:17.620> marry<00:03:17.950> up<00:03:18.160> with<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.579> handle<00:03:18.940> that<00:03:19.090> you

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
will marry up with the handle that you

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.809 
will marry up with the handle that you
previously<00:03:19.900> removed<00:03:20.310> keeping<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.400> handle<00:03:21.730> in

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
previously removed keeping the handle in

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.650 
previously removed keeping the handle in
the<00:03:21.940> open<00:03:22.269> position<00:03:22.560> this<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.769> how<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.129> works

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
the open position this is how it works

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.319 
the open position this is how it works
when<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:25.720> drive<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.650> gear<00:03:26.859> work<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:28.030> gear

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
when you drive the gear work the gear

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.110 
when you drive the gear work the gear
work<00:03:28.540> pushes<00:03:29.200> up<00:03:29.410> which<00:03:29.920> locks<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.609> window

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
work pushes up which locks the window

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.330 
work pushes up which locks the window
just<00:03:31.870> remember<00:03:32.349> there's<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.590> shoot<00:03:32.859> bolt<00:03:33.099> goes

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
just remember there's a shoot bolt goes

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.849 
just remember there's a shoot bolt goes
out<00:03:33.519> at<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.730> top<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.150> window<00:03:34.450> frame<00:03:34.859> so

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
out at the top of the window frame so

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.339 
out at the top of the window frame so
the<00:03:35.980> open<00:03:36.459> position<00:03:36.940> is<00:03:37.420> always<00:03:37.930> when<00:03:38.140> the

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
the open position is always when the

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.460 
the open position is always when the
teeth<00:03:38.650> are<00:03:38.829> as<00:03:38.980> close<00:03:39.609> together<00:03:39.910> as<00:03:40.120> possible

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
teeth are as close together as possible

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.550 
teeth are as close together as possible
that<00:03:41.470> is<00:03:41.680> how<00:03:41.829> we<00:03:41.890> offer<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.370> into<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.760> window

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
that is how we offer it into the window

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.160 
that is how we offer it into the window
put<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:44.890> first<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.690> then<00:03:46.690> offer<00:03:46.870> the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
put it in first and then offer the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.039 
put it in first and then offer the
handle<00:03:47.680> through<00:03:47.859> as<00:03:48.099> well<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:49.540> we've<00:03:49.690> managed

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
handle through as well so we've managed

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.110 
handle through as well so we've managed
to<00:03:50.139> get<00:03:50.319> the<00:03:50.609> mechanism<00:03:51.609> in<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.819> correct

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
to get the mechanism in the correct

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.789 
to get the mechanism in the correct
position<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:52.919> offering<00:03:53.919> the<00:03:54.370> handle<00:03:55.739> now<00:03:56.739> we

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
position and offering the handle now we

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.860 
position and offering the handle now we
could<00:03:57.099> just<00:03:57.280> temporarily<00:03:57.940> put<00:03:58.359> one<00:03:58.630> of<00:03:58.780> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
could just temporarily put one of the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.190 
could just temporarily put one of the
screws<00:03:59.139> in<00:03:59.349> just<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.069> hold<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.459> as<00:04:01.049> we<00:04:02.049> offer

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
screws in just to hold it as we offer

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.580 
screws in just to hold it as we offer
the<00:04:02.470> gearing<00:04:03.099> system<00:04:03.669> back<00:04:03.849> on<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.269> window

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
the gearing system back on to the window

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.710 
the gearing system back on to the window
we've<00:04:05.590> got<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:05.919> match<00:04:06.099> up<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.459> teeth<00:04:06.720> both

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
we've got to match up the teeth both

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.699 
we've got to match up the teeth both
with<00:04:08.230> here<00:04:08.889> to<00:04:09.400> there<00:04:09.639> and<00:04:10.260> one<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.500> things

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
with here to there and one of the things

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.729 
with here to there and one of the things
to<00:04:11.859> remember<00:04:12.099> is<00:04:12.370> we've<00:04:12.579> left<00:04:12.880> this<00:04:13.410> now<00:04:14.410> in

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
to remember is we've left this now in

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.779 
to remember is we've left this now in
the<00:04:14.980> open<00:04:15.160> position<00:04:15.639> at<00:04:16.150> 90<00:04:16.630> degrees<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:18.220> we

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
the open position at 90 degrees so we

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.539 
the open position at 90 degrees so we
don't<00:04:19.030> want<00:04:19.359> this<00:04:20.260> pin<00:04:20.620> sticking<00:04:21.070> out<00:04:21.310> at<00:04:21.519> the

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
don't want this pin sticking out at the

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.980 
don't want this pin sticking out at the
top<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:22.660> must<00:04:23.050> be<00:04:23.320> down<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:25.150> these<00:04:25.479> two<00:04:25.750> must

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
top it must be down and these two must

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.129 
top it must be down and these two must
sit<00:04:26.229> level<00:04:27.120> so<00:04:28.120> we'll<00:04:28.300> offer<00:04:28.479> the<00:04:28.720> first<00:04:28.870> one

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
sit level so we'll offer the first one

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.029 
sit level so we'll offer the first one
at<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.440> top<00:04:29.740> in<00:04:29.979> first<00:04:31.500> making<00:04:32.500> sure<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.919> goes

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
at the top in first making sure it goes

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.089 
at the top in first making sure it goes
properly<00:04:33.550> down<00:04:33.760> in<00:04:34.479> position<00:04:34.960> you<00:04:35.710> may<00:04:35.860> have

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
properly down in position you may have

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.740 
properly down in position you may have
to<00:04:36.220> just<00:04:36.430> move<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:36.910> handle<00:04:37.210> ever<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:37.479> slightly

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
to just move the handle ever so slightly

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.310 
to just move the handle ever so slightly
put<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.139> to<00:04:38.320> lashing<00:04:39.099> that's<00:04:40.000> gone<00:04:40.240> in<00:04:40.389> nicely

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.040 

till<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.470> same<00:04:44.680> with<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:44.979> bottom<00:04:45.130> one<00:04:46.050> this

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
till the same with the bottom one this

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.719 
till the same with the bottom one this
is<00:04:47.229> obviously<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.680> lot<00:04:47.889> easier<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.400> do<00:04:48.520> when

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
is obviously a lot easier to do when

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.860 
is obviously a lot easier to do when
you're<00:04:48.910> assembling<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.539> window<00:04:49.900> on<00:04:50.199> a<00:04:50.680> bench

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
you're assembling a window on a bench

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.540 
you're assembling a window on a bench
then<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:52.990> would<00:04:53.169> be

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
then it would be

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:02.360 
then it would be
here<00:04:59.240> second<00:05:00.240> one<00:05:00.390> latched<00:05:00.660> in<00:05:01.070> now<00:05:02.070> we<00:05:02.130> need

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
here second one latched in now we need

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.740 
here second one latched in now we need
to<00:05:02.460> put<00:05:02.610> a<00:05:02.640> couple<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.090> screws<00:05:03.330> back<00:05:03.540> in

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
to put a couple of the screws back in

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.560 
to put a couple of the screws back in
just<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:04.080> secure<00:05:04.440> them<00:05:04.680> and<00:05:08.150> then<00:05:09.150> we<00:05:09.240> fit<00:05:09.450> the

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
just to secure them and then we fit the

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.160 
just to secure them and then we fit the
cover<00:05:09.810> plate<00:05:10.080> on<00:05:10.290> the<00:05:10.410> outside<00:05:12.170> always

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
cover plate on the outside always

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.430 
cover plate on the outside always
remember<00:05:13.710> that<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:13.980> cover<00:05:14.190> plate<00:05:14.870> is<00:05:15.870> usually
