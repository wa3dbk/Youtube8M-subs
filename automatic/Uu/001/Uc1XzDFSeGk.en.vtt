hey guys this lives with Big Tex worms

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.160 
hey guys this lives with Big Tex worms
and<00:00:02.639> tonight<00:00:03.120> I'm<00:00:03.300> gonna<00:00:03.510> make<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.780> short

tutorial<00:00:04.350> on<00:00:05.240> maintaining<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.390> worm<00:00:06.660> bin<00:00:07.160> I've

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
tutorial on maintaining a worm bin I've

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.620 
tutorial on maintaining a worm bin I've
had<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.340> few<00:00:08.610> emails<00:00:09.510> in<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.139> last<00:00:10.380> few<00:00:10.559> weeks

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
had a few emails in the last few weeks

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.049 
had a few emails in the last few weeks
with<00:00:12.630> people<00:00:12.990> who've<00:00:13.230> had<00:00:13.670> what<00:00:14.670> they<00:00:14.820> thought

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
with people who've had what they thought

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.880 
with people who've had what they thought
was<00:00:15.480> something<00:00:15.719> go<00:00:15.990> really<00:00:16.289> wrong<00:00:16.500> with<00:00:16.710> their

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
was something go really wrong with their

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.189 
was something go really wrong with their
worm<00:00:17.100> bins<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.820> because<00:00:18.570> they're<00:00:18.810> they've

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
worm bins and because they're they've

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.929 
worm bins and because they're they've
lost<00:00:19.439> some<00:00:19.740> worms<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.279> well<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.430> guess<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.789> is

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
lost some worms and well I guess that is

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.130 
lost some worms and well I guess that is
something<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.270> really<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.990> wrong

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
something that really is going wrong

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.670 
something that really is going wrong
with<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> worm<00:00:22.650> bed<00:00:22.859> but<00:00:23.180> a<00:00:24.180> very<00:00:25.050> simple<00:00:25.439> step

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
with the worm bed but a very simple step

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.710 
with the worm bed but a very simple step
has<00:00:25.920> been<00:00:25.949> missed<00:00:26.430> with<00:00:27.029> both<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> people

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
has been missed with both of the people

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.589 
has been missed with both of the people
that<00:00:28.080> emailed<00:00:28.470> me<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.090> I<00:00:30.090> wanted<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.390> just

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
that emailed me and I wanted to just

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.950 
that emailed me and I wanted to just
make<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> quick<00:00:30.990> reminder<00:00:31.679> tutorial<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:33.570> how<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
make a quick reminder tutorial on how to

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.690 
make a quick reminder tutorial on how to
avoid<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:35.130> mistakes<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.730> they're<00:00:35.910> seeing

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
avoid the mistakes that they're seeing

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.850 
avoid the mistakes that they're seeing
okay<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> course<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.410> startup

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
okay in the course and in the startup

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.410 
okay in the course and in the startup
guide<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.430> get<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:42.059> talked<00:00:42.300> about

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
guide that you get we talked about

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.229 
guide that you get we talked about
feeding<00:00:42.840> watering<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.100> applying<00:00:45.000> your

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
feeding watering and applying your

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.900 
feeding watering and applying your
bedding<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.039> I<00:00:47.039> guess<00:00:47.219> what<00:00:47.430> happens<00:00:47.760> is

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
bedding and I guess what happens is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.660 
bedding and I guess what happens is
people<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.270> forget<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.559> go<00:00:50.070> back<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
people just forget to go back to the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.290 
people just forget to go back to the
step<00:00:50.969> by<00:00:51.120> step<00:00:51.420> startup<00:00:52.140> guide<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.090> they<00:00:54.090> just

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
step by step startup guide and they just

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.910 
step by step startup guide and they just
get<00:00:54.449> caught<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:55.079> feeding<00:00:55.320> watering

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
get caught up in feeding watering

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.319 
get caught up in feeding watering
embedding<00:00:56.460> feeding<00:00:56.760> water<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.090> bedding

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
embedding feeding water and bedding

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.029 
embedding feeding water and bedding
feeding<00:00:57.629> watering<00:00:57.960> bedding<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.500> they<00:00:58.620> forget

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
feeding watering bedding and they forget

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.639 
feeding watering bedding and they forget
the<00:00:59.670> very<00:00:59.910> important<00:01:00.600> step<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.050> harvesting

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the very important step of harvesting

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.830 
the very important step of harvesting
it's<00:01:02.489> mentioned<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> class<00:01:03.359> it's

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
it's mentioned in the class it's

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.929 
it's mentioned in the class it's
mentioned<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> step<00:01:04.799> by<00:01:04.949> step<00:01:05.189> startup

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
mentioned in the step by step startup

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.810 
mentioned in the step by step startup
but<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.570> guess<00:01:06.720> sometimes<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.820> stuck

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
but I guess sometimes we just get stuck

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.429 
but I guess sometimes we just get stuck
doing<00:01:09.090> what<00:01:09.390> we're<00:01:09.540> doing<00:01:09.570> when<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:09.960> forget<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
doing what we're doing when we forget to

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410 
doing what we're doing when we forget to
do<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.220> very<00:01:11.280> important<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.299> you

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
do it it's very important that you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.410 
do it it's very important that you
harvest<00:01:12.720> your<00:01:13.140> been<00:01:13.350> every<00:01:14.070> two<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.180> four

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
harvest your been every two to four

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.350 
harvest your been every two to four
months<00:01:15.770> every<00:01:16.770> 60<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.250> 90<00:01:17.610> days<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.060> must

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
months every 60 to 90 days you must

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.420 
months every 60 to 90 days you must
harvest<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:19.290> bed<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.770> don't<00:01:20.040> harvest

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
harvest your bed if you don't harvest

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.300 
harvest your bed if you don't harvest
your<00:01:20.640> bin<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.450> worms<00:01:21.720> will<00:01:22.310> self-regulate

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
your bin the worms will self-regulate

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.820 
your bin the worms will self-regulate
they'll<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.270> too<00:01:24.540> compacted<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.560> space

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
they'll get too compacted in that space

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.649 
they'll get too compacted in that space
and<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.189> will<00:01:26.340> start<00:01:26.580> dying<00:01:26.850> off<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.450> it

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
and they will start dying off if it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.560 
and they will start dying off if it
becomes<00:01:27.930> too<00:01:28.080> cramped<00:01:28.590> also<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.299> don't

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
becomes too cramped also if you don't

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.990 
becomes too cramped also if you don't
make<00:01:31.110> if<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.530> don't<00:01:31.740> harvest<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.759> you're<00:01:32.850> not

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
make if you don't harvest and you're not

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.330 
make if you don't harvest and you're not
using<00:01:33.570> getting<00:01:34.079> your<00:01:34.200> castings<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.189> use

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
using getting your castings out to use

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.359 
using getting your castings out to use
in<00:01:35.490> your<00:01:35.610> garden<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.360> kind<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.720> futile<00:01:37.369> so

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
in your garden so it's kind of futile so

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.210 
in your garden so it's kind of futile so
every<00:01:39.000> two<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:40.530> four<00:01:40.799> months

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
every two to four months

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.050 
every two to four months
you<00:01:41.369> must<00:01:41.820> harvest<00:01:42.210> your<00:01:42.720> bin<00:01:43.430> ok<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.850> how<00:01:45.000> do

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
you must harvest your bin ok so how do

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
you must harvest your bin ok so how do
you<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.270> when<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:45.570> time<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.780> harvest<00:01:46.049> since

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
you know when it's time to harvest since

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.060 
you know when it's time to harvest since
I<00:01:47.009> say<00:01:47.159> 2<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.430> 4<00:01:47.610> months<00:01:48.409> when<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> bin<00:01:49.680> becomes

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
I say 2 to 4 months when the bin becomes

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.510 
I say 2 to 4 months when the bin becomes
3/4<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.820> way<00:01:50.970> full<00:01:51.299> or<00:01:52.250> when<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.369> worms

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
3/4 of the way full or when the worms

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.910 
3/4 of the way full or when the worms
start<00:01:53.820> eating<00:01:54.060> less<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.649> want<00:01:55.860> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
start eating less or you just want to
