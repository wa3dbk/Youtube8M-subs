the boxing game at this point but well
the<00:01:34.740> internet<00:01:35.070> media<00:01:35.369> has<00:01:35.579> focused<00:01:35.970> more<00:01:36.180> on

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the internet media has focused more on

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.120 
the internet media has focused more on
the<00:01:36.390> negativity<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.320> sweet<00:01:37.500> science<00:01:37.710> or

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the negativity of the sweet science or

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.890 
the negativity of the sweet science or
rather<00:01:38.310> than<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> positive<00:01:39.180> aspects<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.780> out

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
rather than the positive aspects and out

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.770 
rather than the positive aspects and out
consequently<00:01:40.470> mainstream<00:01:41.430> media<00:01:41.729> has<00:01:42.210> not

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
consequently mainstream media has not

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.170 
consequently mainstream media has not
followed<00:01:43.049> suit<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.399> attempt<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.939> book

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
followed suit so the attempt of the book

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.060 
followed suit so the attempt of the book
was<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.720> focus<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.229> positive<00:01:46.680> aspects<00:01:47.009> of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
was to focus on the positive aspects of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.460 
was to focus on the positive aspects of
all<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> boxing<00:01:48.180> rather<00:01:48.450> than<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:49.049> know<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
all the boxing rather than you know the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.170 
all the boxing rather than you know the
negativity<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.130> corruption<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.729> think

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
negativity in the corruption I think

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.370 
negativity in the corruption I think
that's<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> name<00:01:51.450> problem<00:01:51.930> with<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.110> sport
