00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
because on both sides there's possibly

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.300

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
or something and this guy actually came

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.640 
or something and this guy actually came
up<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.450> something<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.170> I'm<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.409> happy

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
up with something so I'm really happy

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.810 
up with something so I'm really happy
about<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.640> will<00:01:41.759> be

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
about that I think this will be

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.700 
about that I think this will be
absolutely<00:01:42.420> awesome<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:43.140> way<00:01:43.290> think<00:01:43.560> about

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
absolutely awesome but way think about

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.380 
absolutely awesome but way think about
this<00:01:43.829> with<00:01:44.009> me<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> second<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.149> end

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
this with me for a second if they do end

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.760 
this with me for a second if they do end
up<00:01:45.479> putting<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:45.990> Minecraft<00:01:46.500> they're

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
up putting this in Minecraft they're

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.260 
up putting this in Minecraft they're
gonna<00:01:46.890> try<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.189> make<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.670> balanced<00:01:48.149> as

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
gonna try to make it as balanced as

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.730 
gonna try to make it as balanced as
possible<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.930> actually<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> few<00:01:49.619> ideas

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
possible and actually have a few ideas

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740 
possible and actually have a few ideas
on<00:01:50.070> how<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.220> make<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.610> balanced<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.450> starting

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
on how to make this balanced so starting

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.179 
on how to make this balanced so starting
off<00:01:51.840> you'll<00:01:52.079> need<00:01:52.320> different<00:01:52.590> types<00:01:53.009> of

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
off you'll need different types of

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.399 
off you'll need different types of
bottles<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.640> store<00:01:53.909> X<00:01:54.180> amount<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.720> XP<00:01:55.049> levels

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
bottles to store X amount of XP levels

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.139 
bottles to store X amount of XP levels
so<00:01:55.770> maybe<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> base<00:01:56.280> bottle<00:01:56.670> will<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.030> be

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
so maybe the base bottle will just be

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.940 
so maybe the base bottle will just be
made<00:01:57.329> out<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.509> glass<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.560> store<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:58.829> to

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
made out of glass and it can store up to

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.889 
made out of glass and it can store up to
five<00:01:59.100> XP<00:01:59.729> levels<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.450> maybe<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.780> add

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
five XP levels and then maybe you add

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.569 
five XP levels and then maybe you add
some<00:02:01.140> iron<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.890> then<00:02:02.130> maybe<00:02:02.250> it'll

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
some iron to it and then maybe it'll

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.399 
some iron to it and then maybe it'll
hold<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.909> 15<00:02:03.329> levels<00:02:03.540> or<00:02:03.780> something<00:02:04.140> then

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
hold like 15 levels or something then

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.109 
hold like 15 levels or something then
gold<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.890> will<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.250> level<00:02:05.549> 20<00:02:05.880> then

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
gold it will be like level 20 then

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.210 
gold it will be like level 20 then
emerald<00:02:06.570> will<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:06.960> level<00:02:07.259> 25<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.950> then

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
emerald will be like level 25 and then

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.279 
emerald will be like level 25 and then
finally<00:02:08.489> diamonds<00:02:09.239> will<00:02:09.450> be<00:02:09.569> level<00:02:09.780> 30<00:02:10.050> I

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
finally diamonds will be level 30 I

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.770 
finally diamonds will be level 30 I
think<00:02:10.530> that

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
think that

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.449 
think that
be<00:02:10.840> an<00:02:10.929> excellent<00:02:11.380> way<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.680> balance<00:02:11.950> this<00:02:12.280> out

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
be an excellent way to balance this out

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.500 
be an excellent way to balance this out
if<00:02:12.730> they're<00:02:12.940> really<00:02:13.209> worried<00:02:13.450> about

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
if they're really worried about

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.449 
if they're really worried about
balancing<00:02:14.080> this<00:02:14.290> because<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:14.920> kind<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.310> odd

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
balancing this because it is kind of odd

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.309 
balancing this because it is kind of odd

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.970 
guy's coming up with these ideas but
again<00:02:34.270> it's<00:02:34.540> an<00:02:34.690> amazing<00:02:35.170> idea<00:02:35.319> because

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
again it's an amazing idea because

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.410 
again it's an amazing idea because
sometimes<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.880> from<00:02:37.030> personal

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
sometimes and this is from personal

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.120 
sometimes and this is from personal
experience<00:02:37.930> because<00:02:38.440> when<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:38.830> bored

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
experience because when you just bored

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.860 
experience because when you just bored
in<00:02:39.280> Minecraft<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:39.940> just<00:02:40.120> doing<00:02:40.360> stuff<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.720> do

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
in Minecraft and just doing stuff to do

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.020 
in Minecraft and just doing stuff to do
stuff<00:02:41.170> sometimes<00:02:41.770> you<00:02:41.980> end<00:02:42.160> up<00:02:42.400> making<00:02:42.820> more

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
stuff sometimes you end up making more

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.699 
stuff sometimes you end up making more
than<00:02:43.090> what<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.510> need<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.230> what<00:02:44.380> if<00:02:44.470> there<00:02:44.590> was

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
than what you need so what if there was

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.740 
than what you need so what if there was
a<00:02:44.769> nun<00:02:44.950> crafting<00:02:45.400> table<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:45.910> can<00:02:46.180> use<00:02:46.450> to

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
a nun crafting table that you can use to

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.479 
a nun crafting table that you can use to
on<00:02:46.989> craft<00:02:47.290> these<00:02:47.500> materials<00:02:48.100> but<00:02:48.400> again

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
on craft these materials but again

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.460 
on craft these materials but again
anything<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.120> we<00:02:49.300> talked<00:02:49.540> about<00:02:49.810> today<00:02:49.959> must

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
anything that we talked about today must

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.440 
anything that we talked about today must
be<00:02:50.650> balanced<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.489> not<00:02:51.580> super<00:02:51.940> opie<00:02:52.239> and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
be balanced so it's not super opie and

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.240 
be balanced so it's not super opie and
again<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:52.989> have<00:02:53.170> some<00:02:53.350> ideas<00:02:53.440> about<00:02:53.800> that<00:02:54.070> as

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
again I have some ideas about that as

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.710 
again I have some ideas about that as
well<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:54.760> what<00:02:54.880> have<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.060> actually<00:02:55.209> I'm<00:02:55.480> craft

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
well so what have to actually I'm craft

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.600 
well so what have to actually I'm craft
a<00:02:55.900> crafting<00:02:56.019> table<00:02:56.350> maybe<00:02:57.010> you'll<00:02:57.190> need<00:02:57.400> like

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
a crafting table maybe you'll need like

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.340 
a crafting table maybe you'll need like
the<00:02:57.760> Dragon's<00:02:58.209> egg<00:02:58.360> or<00:02:58.569> something<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:59.080> think

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
the Dragon's egg or something I think

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.750 
the Dragon's egg or something I think
that<00:02:59.470> would<00:02:59.530> be<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.709> really<00:02:59.920> cool<00:03:00.220> way<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.430> do<00:03:00.670> it

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
that would be a really cool way to do it

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.009 
that would be a really cool way to do it
because<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.180> will<00:03:01.300> put<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.540> use<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.930> the

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
because that will put a use to the

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.870 
because that will put a use to the
dragon<00:03:02.380> egg<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.769> also<00:03:03.130> people<00:03:03.340> wouldn't<00:03:03.700> have

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
dragon egg and also people wouldn't have

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.610 
dragon egg and also people wouldn't have
like<00:03:04.090> 50<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.420> these<00:03:04.660> lying<00:03:05.019> around<00:03:05.140> in<00:03:05.500> their

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
like 50 of these lying around in their

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.590 
like 50 of these lying around in their
world<00:03:05.860> once<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.519> make<00:03:06.670> one<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.239> better<00:03:07.420> care

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
world once you make one you better care

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.240 
world once you make one you better care
of<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.900> bad<00:03:08.110> boy<00:03:08.319> because<00:03:08.709> once<00:03:08.890> it's<00:03:09.100> gone

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
of that bad boy because once it's gone

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.040 
of that bad boy because once it's gone
it's<00:03:09.580> gone<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.239> also<00:03:10.420> when<00:03:10.720> you're<00:03:10.810> trying<00:03:10.959> to

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
it's gone and also when you're trying to

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.660 
it's gone and also when you're trying to
uncraft<00:03:11.500> something<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.370> will<00:03:12.489> need<00:03:12.640> a

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
uncraft something you will need a

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.729 
uncraft something you will need a
certain<00:03:12.970> amount<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.330> XP<00:03:13.750> as<00:03:13.959> well<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.530> if<00:03:14.680> you

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
certain amount of XP as well and if you

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.350 
certain amount of XP as well and if you
don't<00:03:14.950> want<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.130> use<00:03:15.250> XP<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.790> uncraft<00:03:16.180> that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
don't want to use XP to uncraft that

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.729 
don't want to use XP to uncraft that
item<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:16.900> will<00:03:17.049> lose<00:03:17.230> some<00:03:17.380> of<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.560> items

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
item you will lose some of the items

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.170 
item you will lose some of the items
that<00:03:17.980> were<00:03:18.100> used<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.459> make<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.790> thing<00:03:18.970> in<00:03:19.090> the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
that were used to make the thing in the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.400 
that were used to make the thing in the
first<00:03:19.329> place<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.930> think<00:03:20.170> that<00:03:20.230> will<00:03:20.380> be

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
first place I think that will be

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.930 
first place I think that will be
possibly<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:20.920> best<00:03:21.070> way<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:21.790> don't

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
possibly the best way to do it I don't

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.949 
possibly the best way to do it I don't
know<00:03:22.030> let<00:03:22.239> me<00:03:22.299> know<00:03:22.420> what<00:03:22.510> you<00:03:22.630> guys<00:03:22.750> think
