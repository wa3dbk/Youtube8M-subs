00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
you installed a media link USB Bluetooth

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.210 
you installed a media link USB Bluetooth
adapter<00:04:26.360> make<00:04:27.080> sure<00:04:27.380> you<00:04:27.710> install<00:04:27.980> the

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
adapter make sure you install the

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.680 
adapter make sure you install the
drivers<00:04:28.610> so<00:04:28.790> it<00:04:28.940> didn't<00:04:29.180> work<00:04:29.210> for<00:04:29.330> me

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
drivers so it didn't work for me

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.870 
drivers so it didn't work for me
until<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:30.500> did<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:31.010> drivers<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.430> was<00:04:31.610> thinking

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
until I did the drivers I was thinking

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.760 
until I did the drivers I was thinking
the<00:04:31.970> native<00:04:32.330> should<00:04:32.960> have<00:04:33.080> worked<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:33.620> was

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
the native should have worked and I was

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.740 
the native should have worked and I was
frustrated<00:04:34.070> wasn't<00:04:34.580> pairing<00:04:35.120> up<00:04:35.270> or<00:04:35.480> like

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
frustrated wasn't pairing up or like

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.340 
frustrated wasn't pairing up or like
wasn't<00:04:36.500> working<00:04:36.860> out<00:04:36.950> then<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:38.260> installed<00:04:39.260> the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
wasn't working out then I installed the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.510 
wasn't working out then I installed the
drivers<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.800> everything<00:04:40.190> worked<00:04:40.340> perfectly

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
drivers and everything worked perfectly

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.490 
drivers and everything worked perfectly
so<00:04:41.120> if<00:04:41.510> you're<00:04:41.630> running<00:04:41.720> that<00:04:41.960> trouble<00:04:42.350> make

so if you're running that trouble make

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.810 
so if you're running that trouble make
sure<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:42.740> do<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:42.980> drivers<00:04:43.250> ok<00:04:43.490> here<00:04:43.640> I<00:04:43.670> go

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
sure you do the drivers ok here I go
