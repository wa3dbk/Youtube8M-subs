there's one of everything and you can

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.960 
there's one of everything and you can
see<00:01:40.540> that<00:01:41.140> it's<00:01:41.380> not<00:01:41.619> just<00:01:41.920> Mexican<00:01:42.430> influence

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
see that it's not just Mexican influence

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.990 
see that it's not just Mexican influence
because<00:01:43.409> Merida<00:01:44.409> had<00:01:44.560> an<00:01:44.680> influence<00:01:45.040> almost

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
because Merida had an influence almost

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.510 
because Merida had an influence almost
as<00:01:46.270> strong<00:01:46.630> from<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.020> Caribbean<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:47.860> from

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
as strong from the Caribbean and from

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.480 
as strong from the Caribbean and from
Europe<00:01:48.939> as<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.630> did<00:01:49.899> from<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.530> rest<00:01:50.770> of<00:01:50.950> Mexico

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
Europe as it did from the rest of Mexico

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.630
