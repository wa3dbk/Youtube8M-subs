 you should have problems that that 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.810
 Game does not start then still works 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.270
 once in games directory and starts 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.470
 First of all, the original city 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:15.100
 file to play and if thats me 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.840
 then hang on then you can do that 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.270
 task-manager start with the 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.410
 key combination control old and 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:27.470

 Even then the game does not work 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.550
 then it can be because of that 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.960
 your 64 bit system to your operating system 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.890
