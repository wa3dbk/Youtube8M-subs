all day like on your car batter you go
ahead<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.320> run<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.650> fan<00:04:25.950> but<00:04:26.669> if<00:04:26.760> you're

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
ahead and run that fan but if you're

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.490 
ahead and run that fan but if you're
just<00:04:27.030> using<00:04:27.240> like<00:04:27.540> a<00:04:27.600> little<00:04:27.870> 9-volt<00:04:28.020> mother

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
just using like a little 9-volt mother

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.040 
just using like a little 9-volt mother
what<00:04:28.740> I've<00:04:28.889> got<00:04:29.100> go<00:04:29.760> ahead<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.660> fan<00:04:30.870> off

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
what I've got go ahead and the fan off

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.090 
what I've got go ahead and the fan off
then<00:04:31.320> you've<00:04:31.470> got<00:04:31.650> here<00:04:31.889> well<00:04:32.220> hold<00:04:33.210> down

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
then you've got here well hold down

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.750 
then you've got here well hold down
almost<00:04:35.100> like<00:04:35.220> an<00:04:35.340> old<00:04:35.490> Walkman<00:04:36.180> CD<00:04:36.210> player<00:04:37.760> but

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
almost like an old Walkman CD player but

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.990 
almost like an old Walkman CD player but
that's<00:04:39.290> essentially<00:04:40.310> that's<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.520> set<00:04:41.880> of

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
that's essentially that's the set of

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.719 
that's essentially that's the set of
speakers<00:04:47.390> go<00:04:48.560> got<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.590> gramophone<00:04:49.950> so<00:04:50.520> they<00:04:50.640> end

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
speakers go got a gramophone so they end

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:57.200 
speakers go got a gramophone so they end
up<00:04:50.880> there<00:04:51.210> um<00:04:52.910> but<00:04:54.080> Sansui<00:04:55.080> uh<00:04:55.260> I'm<00:04:56.220> not<00:04:56.910> sure<00:04:56.970> I
