00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
store and I specifically went in there

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.430

to<00:00:08.400> buy<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.700> number<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.120> items<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.840> perhaps

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
to buy a number of items and perhaps

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.610 
to buy a number of items and perhaps
I've<00:00:10.620> got<00:00:10.759> too<00:00:11.759> many<00:00:11.880> items<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:12.630> nevertheless

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
I've got too many items but nevertheless

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.499 
I've got too many items but nevertheless
you<00:00:13.889> can't<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.759> too<00:00:14.910> much<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.299> good<00:00:15.480> thing

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
you can't have too much of a good thing

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.750 
you can't have too much of a good thing
so<00:00:16.940> here<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.470> not<00:00:19.470> an<00:00:19.650> enormous<00:00:20.039> bag<00:00:20.250> but<00:00:20.550> I

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
so here it is not an enormous bag but I

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.240 
so here it is not an enormous bag but I
think<00:00:21.240> there<00:00:21.390> are<00:00:21.420> four<00:00:22.289> items<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.859> here<00:00:23.100> which

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
think there are four items in here which

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.880 
think there are four items in here which
I'd<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.730> show<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:23.939> quite<00:00:24.269> quickly<00:00:24.539> now<00:00:25.529> I

a wall in the monogram patent I just

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.889 
a wall in the monogram patent I just
find<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.039> bit<00:00:56.190> over<00:00:56.910> kill<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
find that it's a bit over kill with the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.400 
find that it's a bit over kill with the
monogram<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.530> nice<00:00:59.210> but<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.359> think<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
monogram it's nice but I think it's it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.720 
monogram it's nice but I think it's it
can't<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.829> too<00:01:01.980> much<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.430> wanted<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
can't be too much so I just wanted to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.889 
can't be too much so I just wanted to
break<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.180> occasionally

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
break it up occasionally

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.580 
break it up occasionally
so<00:01:04.549> my<00:01:05.549> louisa<00:01:05.850> time<00:01:06.210> items<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:06.960> far<00:01:07.229> have

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
so my louisa time items so far have

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.690 
so my louisa time items so far have
either<00:01:07.799> been<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> monogram<00:01:09.299> canvas<00:01:10.010> or<00:01:11.010> in

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
either been in the monogram canvas or in

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.620 
either been in the monogram canvas or in
the<00:01:12.000> tiger<00:01:12.619> grizzly<00:01:13.619> leather<00:01:14.450> which<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the tiger grizzly leather which is a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.450 
the tiger grizzly leather which is a
very<00:01:15.869> nice<00:01:16.020> finish<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.500> well<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
very nice finish as well so this was the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.420 
very nice finish as well so this was the
first<00:01:17.640> time<00:01:17.909> i<00:01:17.939> actually<00:01:18.210> been<00:01:18.780> into<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
first time i actually been into the

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.080 
first time i actually been into the
demi<00:01:20.430> ER<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.880> being<00:01:22.100> canvas<00:01:23.100> which<00:01:23.820> i<00:01:24.030> think

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
demi ER you being canvas which i think

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.899 
demi ER you being canvas which i think
is<00:01:24.650> something<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.890> will<00:01:26.040> complement<00:01:26.490> both

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
is something that will complement both

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.969 
is something that will complement both
of<00:01:27.180> those<00:01:27.530> other<00:01:28.530> finishes<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:31.710> number<00:01:31.920> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
of those other finishes so the number of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.249 
of those other finishes so the number of
small<00:01:32.189> items<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.299> start<00:01:33.540> off<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.869> so

just<00:02:48.800> something<00:02:49.250> that's<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.580> little<00:02:49.670> bit

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
just something that's a little bit

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.290 
just something that's a little bit
simple<00:02:50.960> and<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.740> really<00:02:52.460> just<00:02:52.490> wanted<00:02:53.150> to

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
simple and I really just wanted to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.440 
simple and I really just wanted to
venture<00:02:53.480> into<00:02:53.780> this<00:02:54.260> particular<00:02:54.620> demo<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:56.420> I

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
venture into this particular demo so I

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.350 
venture into this particular demo so I
think<00:02:56.780> that's<00:02:56.960> quite<00:02:57.140> nice<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:58.180> all<00:02:59.180> these

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
think that's quite nice so all these

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.730 
think that's quite nice so all these
items<00:02:59.480> are<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.680> same<00:03:00.890> finish<00:03:04.090> here<00:03:05.740> is

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
items are of the same finish here is

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.040 
items are of the same finish here is
actually<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.190> passport<00:03:07.460> cover<00:03:08.030> I've<00:03:08.900> been

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
actually a passport cover I've been

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.570 
actually a passport cover I've been
wondering<00:03:09.290> one<00:03:09.410> of<00:03:09.530> these<00:03:09.650> for<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:09.920> while<00:03:10.100> again

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
wondering one of these for a while again

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.070 
wondering one of these for a while again
I<00:03:10.700> didn't<00:03:11.000> want<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.210> go<00:03:11.330> from<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.630> monogram

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
I didn't want to go from the monogram

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.020 
I didn't want to go from the monogram
although<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.560> monogram<00:03:12.890> is<00:03:13.100> nice<00:03:13.310> this<00:03:13.820> is

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
although the monogram is nice this is

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.810 
although the monogram is nice this is
very<00:03:14.270> similar<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:16.040> James<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.490> wallet<00:03:16.700> I've

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
very similar to the James of wallet I've

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.610 
very similar to the James of wallet I've
just<00:03:16.970> shown<00:03:17.210> you<00:03:17.240> but<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.630> course<00:03:17.930> it's<00:03:18.380> a

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
just shown you but of course it's a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.810 
just shown you but of course it's a
little<00:03:18.740> bit<00:03:18.950> bigger<00:03:19.370> how's<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:21.580> passport<00:03:22.580> and

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
little bit bigger how's the passport and

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.120 
little bit bigger how's the passport and
again<00:03:23.030> I've<00:03:23.180> had<00:03:23.330> it<00:03:23.480> hot<00:03:24.440> stamped<00:03:24.860> as<00:03:24.950> well

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
again I've had it hot stamped as well

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.660 
again I've had it hot stamped as well
with<00:03:25.250> my<00:03:25.430> initials<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.690> does<00:03:26.870> take<00:03:27.670> three

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
with my initials and it does take three

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.980 
with my initials and it does take three
credit<00:03:29.000> cards<00:03:29.240> should<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:29.510> want<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.750> do<00:03:29.870> that

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
credit cards should you want to do that

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.590 
credit cards should you want to do that
and<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.260> course<00:03:30.440> passport<00:03:31.250> itself<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:32.360> could

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
and of course passport itself you could

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.230 
and of course passport itself you could
I<00:03:32.870> suppose<00:03:32.900> use<00:03:33.650> this<00:03:33.830> as<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.070> wad<00:03:34.310> in<00:03:34.910> itself

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
I suppose use this as a wad in itself

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.350 
I suppose use this as a wad in itself
and<00:03:35.510> not<00:03:35.600> bother<00:03:35.840> with<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:37.430> passport<00:03:37.940> but

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
and not bother with a passport but

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.360 
and not bother with a passport but
that's<00:03:38.540> not<00:03:38.720> what<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:38.870> bought<00:03:39.080> it<00:03:39.230> for<00:03:39.350> I<00:03:39.620> did

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
that's not what I bought it for I did

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.700 
that's not what I bought it for I did
wonder<00:03:40.550> for<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.760> passport<00:03:40.970> coming<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.660> I<00:03:42.650> do

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
wonder for a passport coming and I do

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.600 
wonder for a passport coming and I do
think<00:03:43.070> that<00:03:43.220> will<00:03:43.340> go<00:03:43.460> quite<00:03:43.790> nicely<00:03:44.000> together

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
think that will go quite nicely together

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.070 
think that will go quite nicely together
again<00:03:46.610> nothing<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:46.940> rave<00:03:47.180> about<00:03:47.210> here<00:03:47.660> it's<00:03:47.900> a

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
again nothing to rave about here it's a

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.400 
again nothing to rave about here it's a
simple<00:03:48.560> item<00:03:49.010> in<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.940> demo<00:03:50.150> being<00:03:50.660> finished

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
simple item in the demo being finished

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.710 
simple item in the demo being finished
but<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:52.160> think<00:03:52.520> was<00:03:52.850> something<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.330> wanted

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
but I think was something that I wanted

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.100 
but I think was something that I wanted
I<00:03:53.990> wanted<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.890> passport<00:03:55.670> cover<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.480> I<00:03:56.780> really

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
I wanted a passport cover and I really

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.650 
I wanted a passport cover and I really
decided<00:03:57.530> not<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:57.980> go<00:03:58.190> with<00:03:58.370> monogram<00:03:58.850> or

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
decided not to go with monogram or

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.720 
decided not to go with monogram or
toggle<00:03:59.900> over<00:04:00.200> this<00:04:00.440> time<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:00.830> decided<00:04:01.460> to<00:04:01.610> go

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
toggle over this time I decided to go

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.370 
toggle over this time I decided to go
with<00:04:01.880> this<00:04:01.970> finish<00:04:02.330> just<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.870> break<00:04:03.110> it<00:04:03.140> up<00:04:03.320> a

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
with this finish just to break it up a

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.200 
with this finish just to break it up a
bit<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.070> think<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.610> is<00:04:04.760> particularly

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
bit and I think that is particularly

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.920

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
logo at the front and instead of fixing

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.200 
logo at the front and instead of fixing
like<00:04:51.320> this<00:04:51.860> where<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.550> end<00:04:52.790> of<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.030> actually

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
like this where the end of it actually

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.470 
like this where the end of it actually
is<00:04:53.510> exposed<00:04:54.260> on<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.560> outside<00:04:54.590> of<00:04:55.100> the<00:04:55.190> belt

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
it's actually hidden on the inside you

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.830 
it's actually hidden on the inside you

actually have the monogram and you put

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.360 
actually have the monogram and you put
it<00:05:02.930> inside<00:05:03.140> things<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:03.860> can't<00:05:04.100> see<00:05:04.250> the

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
it inside things and you can't see the

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.450 
it inside things and you can't see the
finish<00:05:04.640> and<00:05:05.090> that<00:05:05.150> and<00:05:05.480> it<00:05:05.630> was<00:05:05.720> a<00:05:05.780> little<00:05:05.930> bit

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
finish and that and it was a little bit

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.700 
finish and that and it was a little bit
thicker<00:05:07.460> in<00:05:07.670> width<00:05:08.020> and<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.140> considered<00:05:09.590> that

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
thicker in width and I considered that

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.070 
thicker in width and I considered that
but<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:09.920> found<00:05:10.700> that<00:05:10.970> one<00:05:11.180> was<00:05:11.390> probably<00:05:11.660> more

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
but I found that one was probably more

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.230 
but I found that one was probably more
suitable<00:05:12.650> for<00:05:12.710> wearing<00:05:13.400> with<00:05:13.580> jeans
