00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:10.969
 so we took the controller in the juba and 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:15.599
 simple ribbon for red arrows 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:19.949
 a small remote control and what have u 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.510
 we got the sensor is displayed on the left 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.900
 sides in order to be able to through 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:32.510
 open the door to change color possible 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:38.820
 Primary colors are such colors 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:51.710
 so let's say mixed options are huge 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:55.730
 A lot of brightness is removed from the console 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.730
 by pressing keys 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:10.780
 sufficiently large range of brightness 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:12.860
 can make a quiet perevechivaet 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.979
 monitors have not yet become 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.350
 I want to look at the duration of life 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:25.520
 this tape turns on everything 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:31.759
 by turning on the light for your own. 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.800
 the switch remembers the last 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.140
 the position in which stood that is if 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:41.619
 we enable install for example 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:46.100
 passion and backlight when off and 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:52.840
 long stay without current circuit 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.840
 remembers the property is obtained like this 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.640
 installation took about 6 hours
