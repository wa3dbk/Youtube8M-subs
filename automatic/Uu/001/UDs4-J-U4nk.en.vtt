 very bright and like a fast and silent engine they are the main ones 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.999
 features of the new wide-angle lens 24 soup bowls s1e4 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.230
 is a well-made target with an investment for the size of 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.960
 unwanted reflections in ghost images 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.010
 mounted on a reflex and atsc it becomes about a 36 millimeter 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.920
 us as usual we have tried on the field here is service 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 much 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.670
 but 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.400
 but 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.270
 but 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.270
 but 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.910
 but 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.850
 but 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.270
 but 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.720
 but 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.260
 but 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
 me 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.670
 but 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.680
 but 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.470
 but 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.860
 but 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.270
 but 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.670
 but 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.600
 but 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.450
 but 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.410
 but 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.810
 but 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.860
 but 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.810
 go 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.440
 but 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.610
 but 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.480
 but 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.110

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.050
 but 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.660
 but 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.400
 but 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.400
 but 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:19.339
 having a very sturdy, sturdy camera can be very useful 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.899
 because we can use it in all risk situations without fear of a 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.339
 pastor damage it 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:29.680
 we have tried the new 80 10 the top of the range of the olympus battleships it has 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:34.049
 high level technical specifications and battleship then it really is we have it 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.189
 mistreated without saving and here it is 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.949
 service without any damage and here is service 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.409
 holy 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.409
 but 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:04.809
 but 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.869
 but 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.869
 but 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:16.069
 but 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.279
 but 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:21.279
 but 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:24.919
 but 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.069
 but 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.719
 but 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.859
 but 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.269
 but 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.269
 but 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.019
 but 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.419
 but 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.419
 but 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.049
 but 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.659
 but 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.869
 but 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.269
 but 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.199
 but 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.059
 but 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:06.449
 but 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.449
 but 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.259
 but 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.400
 but 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.800
 but 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800
 but 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.620
 these days we talk a lot about photo i'm spray big 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.240
 the technique was born practically together with photography and 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.240
 periodically returns to the limelight 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.550
 to get photos with the third dimension 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.529
 it doesn't take much 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:56.179
 let's see what the photographer antonia plinio invented 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.469
 follow with us antonio arminio 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:05.839
 so I would do so a little bit particular it is true is indeed the courses 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.469
 are are three i 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:08.939
 abcd 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.210
 if I was saying 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.090
 that is, in fact it is not a course 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.090
 because the courses are 3 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.629
 DVD 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.019
 I know if you understood why here. appeals 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.580
 are 3 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.749
 cheap levitra garrison 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:32.159
 as long as I don't have what it is 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.650
 here are these 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.259
 are two cameras 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.999
 compact that have been short-circuited is to laugh here 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:43.150
 to make them snap together 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.670
 in practice with this guide I am for drawers where I have them arranged 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.749
 the objectives 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:54.359
 they are at a distance so called interpupillary ie they are at the same 

00:05:54.359 --> 00:05:55.780
 distance of our eyes 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.330
 so I can take a picture at the right at the same time 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.050
 it's a left picture 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.309
 revelation I turn on 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:05.270
 and practically 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.360
 the machines shooting together give me the diction and that we have 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.919
 at binocular level 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.460
 then or then the two images transform a single image with the glasses 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.020
 we can see 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.250
 with the right eye on the right image with the left side only images left 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.930
 the brain does the rest 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.119
 since used to seeing 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.999
 it is in this way elaborates the three-dimensionality and therefore we see 3d 

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:35.710
 but 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.800
 but 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.780
 and finally we would like to point out that in our portal and pm studio news 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.930
 we have added new contributions 1 to the Frisian page 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:57.219
 ebay 1 contribution concerning beautiful playful use the beautiful tim phone 

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:58.369
 microsoft 

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:02.990
 the other contributor is the beautiful encyclopedia page of photography 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.990
 and this ed. arezzo sub for portrait 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:11.509
 all that remains is to wish the gallery good week and a good photograph
