the<00:00:10.769> trees<00:00:11.160> are<00:00:11.280> kind<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.460> obscuring<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.059> from

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
the trees are kind of obscuring it from

right here is the high sierra wild onion
it's<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.850> kind<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.030> looks<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.270> grass

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
it's it just kind of looks like grass

it's it just kind of looks like grass
you<00:00:37.079> know<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.290> doesn't<00:00:37.410> really<00:00:37.590> look<00:00:37.770> all<00:00:37.920> that

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
you know it doesn't really look all that

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.410 
you know it doesn't really look all that
special<00:00:38.629> but<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.910> grab<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:41.940> down<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:42.360> the

special but if you grab it down at the
base<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.640> sometimes<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.730> works<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
base and sometimes this works and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.430 
base and sometimes this works and
sometimes<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.840> end<00:00:46.020> up<00:00:46.140> tearing<00:00:46.289> off
