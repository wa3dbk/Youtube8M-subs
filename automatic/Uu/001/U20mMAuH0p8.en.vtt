the<00:02:06.620> child<00:02:06.980> has<00:02:07.160> no<00:02:07.460> way<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.850> getting<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.600> to

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
the child has no way of getting to it to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.620 
the child has no way of getting to it to
loosen<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:10.250> know<00:02:10.759> so<00:02:10.940> they<00:02:11.060> can<00:02:11.120> get<00:02:11.570> out

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
loosen it you know so they can get out

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.020 
loosen it you know so they can get out
of<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:12.050> so<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.700> she's<00:02:14.330> going<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.600> show<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.900> as

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
of it so and she's going to show you as

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.170 
of it so and she's going to show you as
an<00:02:17.030> adult<00:02:17.300> even<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:19.160> she<00:02:19.400> can't<00:02:19.640> get<00:02:19.820> out<00:02:19.880> of

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
an adult even that she can't get out of

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.390 
an adult even that she can't get out of
it<00:02:20.270> once<00:02:20.480> it's<00:02:20.690> adjusted<00:02:20.810> properly

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
it once it's adjusted properly

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.140 
it once it's adjusted properly
you<00:02:23.150> see<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.330> think<00:02:26.440> she<00:02:27.440> can't<00:02:27.709> yeah<00:02:28.250> she<00:02:28.880> can't

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
you see I think she can't yeah she can't

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.210 
you see I think she can't yeah she can't
there's<00:02:29.570> nothing<00:02:29.930> she<00:02:30.110> can<00:02:30.230> get<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.440> there's

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
there's nothing she can get to there's

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.180 
there's nothing she can get to there's
no<00:02:31.459> connective<00:02:32.090> points<00:02:32.630> or<00:02:33.170> adjusted<00:02:33.739> points

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
no connective points or adjusted points

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.840 
no connective points or adjusted points
that<00:02:34.700> she<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:36.590> know<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.190> little<00:02:37.610> hands

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
that she can you know and little hands

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.760 
that she can you know and little hands
can<00:02:38.180> get<00:02:38.330> double<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.170> know<00:02:39.200> they<00:02:39.500> can<00:02:39.650> do<00:02:39.739> a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
can get double you know they can do a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.850 
can get double you know they can do a
lot<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.010> things<00:02:40.310> they<00:02:40.880> cannot<00:02:41.510> get<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.500> those

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
lot of things they cannot get to those

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.170 
lot of things they cannot get to those
points<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.370> adjustment<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:44.090> loosen<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:45.170> and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
points of adjustment to loosen this and

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.310 
points of adjustment to loosen this and
so<00:02:47.180> we<00:02:47.330> think<00:02:47.510> that's<00:02:47.660> going<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.930> solve<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.290> lot

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
so we think that's going to solve a lot

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.110 
so we think that's going to solve a lot
of<00:02:48.470> people's<00:02:48.830> problems<00:02:49.340> if<00:02:49.610> this<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.000> the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
of people's problems if this is the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.120 
of people's problems if this is the
tether<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.720> top<00:02:50.930> tether<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.380> thrown<00:02:51.620> directly

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
tether the top tether is thrown directly

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.900 
tether the top tether is thrown directly
to<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.430> vest

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
to the vest

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.729 
to the vest
and<00:02:53.030> as<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.840> notice<00:02:54.140> where<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.380> have<00:02:54.560> some

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
and as you notice where you have some

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.740 
and as you notice where you have some
extra<00:02:55.010> webbing<00:02:55.310> going<00:02:56.180> down<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.600> this

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
extra webbing going down to this

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.560 
extra webbing going down to this
adjustment<00:02:57.350> point<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.860> that's<00:02:58.430> because<00:02:58.850> some

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
adjustment point and that's because some

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.720 
adjustment point and that's because some

there's<00:03:42.019> an<00:03:42.140> emergency<00:03:42.769> evacuation<00:03:43.390> if

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
there's an emergency evacuation if

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.160 
there's an emergency evacuation if
there's<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.750> smoke-filled<00:03:45.320> bus<00:03:46.660> every<00:03:47.660> bus<00:03:47.840> has

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
there's a smoke-filled bus every bus has

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.920 
there's a smoke-filled bus every bus has
a<00:03:48.200> belt<00:03:48.500> cutter<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:49.100> so<00:03:50.090> they<00:03:50.480> would<00:03:50.690> simply

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
a belt cutter and so they would simply

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.280 
a belt cutter and so they would simply
come<00:03:51.650> along<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.100> cut<00:03:52.459> these<00:03:52.730> three<00:03:53.030> pieces

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
come along and cut these three pieces

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.479 
come along and cut these three pieces
they<00:03:54.290> would<00:03:54.320> have<00:03:54.680> this<00:03:54.950> tether

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
they would have this tether

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.390 
they would have this tether
to<00:03:56.450> help<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.840> child<00:03:57.140> get<00:03:57.410> out<00:03:57.620> of<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:57.890> bus<00:03:58.100> and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
to help the child get out of the bus and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.250 
to help the child get out of the bus and
if<00:03:58.640> it's<00:03:58.850> a<00:03:59.090> lot<00:03:59.510> of<00:04:00.400> emergency<00:04:02.260> teaching

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
if it's a lot of emergency teaching

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.590 
if it's a lot of emergency teaching
that's<00:04:03.440> done<00:04:03.709> for<00:04:03.980> school<00:04:04.250> buses<00:04:04.489> they'll<00:04:05.209> use

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
that's done for school buses they'll use

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.590 
that's done for school buses they'll use
this<00:04:06.110> so<00:04:06.829> that<00:04:07.040> one<00:04:07.519> child<00:04:07.820> can<00:04:08.060> hang<00:04:08.269> on<00:04:08.450> to

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
this so that one child can hang on to

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.360 
this so that one child can hang on to
the<00:04:08.690> one<00:04:08.840> in<00:04:08.989> front

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
the one in front

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.270 
the one in front
you<00:04:09.909> know<00:04:10.030> like<00:04:10.299> a<00:04:10.330> new<00:04:10.510> train<00:04:10.900> going<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:12.129> know

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
you know like a new train going you know
