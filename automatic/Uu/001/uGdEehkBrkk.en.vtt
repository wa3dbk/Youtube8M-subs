00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.659
 because you are in 8 pers more than one 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.659
 experience about grains 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.070
 and we talk friends and we meet here 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.590
 o2 festival this edition of the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.379
 first of December 2013 and now we 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.420
 we found to talk about this one of 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.670
 the smallest of the generation with the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.710
 that the cutlery starts making itself 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.210
 skilled pilots behind what is the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.860
 ATV concept with a specialist 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.200
 to talk about it that we do not find 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.060
 with the sowing of watermelon 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.489
 another of the most important followers 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.320
 behind what is this the brp brand and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.390
 Channel lines and practiced a 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.699
 little bit of the version of that one version 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.220
 which is expressly planned for 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.050
 all these little ones who want them one 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.880
 and introduce to the wave of motorcycling 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.310
 but always one is afraid to say 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.530
 is that when you have eight years of poverty 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.000
 and to teach not really this kind of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.070
 vehicles are planned to be able 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.649
 make a small from what age 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.180
 we can recommend this fishing and it's the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.219
 intermediate there is a version that is more 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.920
 small the smaller version is like 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.540
 from about 5 to about 18 years old it's for the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.339
 teenagers let's say that's the one that 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.290
 follow is really already a motorcycle that 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.729
 it's like for a child of 9 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.979
 15-16 years this is already from this follows the 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.860
 of the competition then 450 prisoners already 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.259
 the intermediate is between the smallest and the 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.659
 the most powerful then of the zero line of 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.549
 the ideal help for teenagers 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.289
 leave me a little bit of what is the 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.390
 technology that is applied enough 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.929
 simpler than in others but the concept 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.580
 of rear axle if the concept of quarter 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.200
 cuatrimoto quite unlike the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.789
 concept of babies that are the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.770
 generation the big talk to me about this 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.780
 middle of this version how it is handled 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.310
 this version is similar to the 450 that the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.959
 of competition more and more succession 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.209
 tilting back equal and it's 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:45.220
 independent forward is not adjustable 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:47.020
 but it's a bit harder just like 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.360
 that the other difference with this 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.369
 Written automatic is not change 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.080
 in fact it brings reverse which is one of the 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.880
 changing among the other brands that 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.130
 nobody has more reverse than this version 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.780
 is already through the lights but this one 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.399
 what you have is that you can govern the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.630
 accelerator is someone who is starting 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.890
 which is very small still does not have 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.140
 a lot of skill you can go 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.340
 reducing the power so that it does not run 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.210
 so much danger in what is grabbing 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.850
 exists 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.040
 walk the bike what makes it a 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.930
 excellent alternative to be able 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.550
 introduce motorcycling to a small 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.410
 or a teenager of these first steps 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.420
 in the rating field , what are the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.890
 quad bikes a version created with a 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.240
 very good height we can already the answer 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.209
 that the size of the little machine 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.770
 you can perfectly start doing it 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.300
 first jump we are talking about that 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.270
 with this type of machine we could 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.920
 talk about that a track let's say semi 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.720
 Professional can perfectly 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.970
 start to treat yourself where you can 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.040
 start to teach yourself to fly let's say to 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.250
 jump with a little more power 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.100
 every two indicate exactly the handling 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.410
 adequate to be able to make it a good 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.630
 pilot and know exactly skills 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.250
 to know if you are ready to be able to 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.050
 enter the categories 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.850
 we talk about professionals behind what 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.160
 which is the segment of the four bikes 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.989
 the range is called that this range 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.260
 has three versions then we said 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.630
 that first and 90 90 you acquire looks 90 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.300
 of 0.50 and already this receives the one of crest 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.100
 which is the 450 that is standard is then 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.860
 what is different with that 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.540
 I have the suspension that is not standard 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.730
 and that has reverse is the only 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.170
 difference really against the other and 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.390
 that 's how it is very similar the expression is 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.340
 very similar this width is 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.380
 slightly a little more to the larger the 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.150
 wider the other but it is almost the same 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.010
 we have in the split lathes that 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.410
 it really is very similar to the 450 nothing 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.240
 without being so powerful yet all these 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.340
 subscribed types suitable any engine 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.810
 ideal for people who are 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.880
 starting say in what is the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.830
 second step behind what is the 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.170
 concept of the four bikes so the 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.060
 version that presents the channel people and 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.500
 about what is the seal of brp already 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.540
 motorcycles assembled here in mexico 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.660
 proudly from the city plant 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.800
 juárez chihuahua and practically in a 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.770
 very accessible short 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.510
 we talk about prices set 65 500 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.100
 we are talking about there are realities 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.870
 as to what is systems of 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.790
 credit talks a little inside 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.680
 we have credit with man region 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.070
 we also work with the financial 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.100

 another 56 months without interest there are friends 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.160
 they have another alternative they have 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.840
 facilities to be able to acquire it 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.090
 necessarily in cash, so there's 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.650
 facilities so that they do not have to 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.860
 disburse and good and the little ones 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.389

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.020
 of what type of categories you go 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.690
