00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.470
 for this project we are going to use 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.060
 leaves of a book or if you wish 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:37.000
 cardboard 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.000
 egg papier mâché scissors 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.980
 the silicone gun and a candle holder 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.200
 for this project I am using 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.920
 leaves of a book but you can 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.050
 use the paper that you like 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.280
 I'm going to cut the leaves of the book in 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.280
 shape of a square 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.020
 only for illustrative reasons I will use 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.070
 a marker to show them how I'm going to 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.070
 cut the paper 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.690
 as you will see I already have the paper spiral 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.790
 now to form the rose I'm going to roll up 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.770
 the paper beginning the outside 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.770
 into the spiral 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.110
 roll in the paper as tight as possible 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.110
 I can 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.730
 ah 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.450
 when they reach the end of the spiral 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.310
 unroll the paper a little until the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.310
 Rose have the shape that you like 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.630
 add a drop of silicone to the base 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.630
 and ready 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.079
 do not get frustrated if the first one in pink does not 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.110
 it comes out sometimes it will take a couple of 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:01.810
 attempts until you get the desired shape 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.810
 in the papier-mâché egg to the base 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.680
 I'm going to leave the link to the tutorial 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.819
 how to make paper mache eggs 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.819
 end of this video 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.360
 it was time to paste the roses 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.710
 starting at the top up 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.710
 cover all the egg 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.530
 for this paper mache egg that has 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.610
 a height of approximately 14 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.060
 centimeters use about 120 roses 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.060
 of paper 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.159
 as you will see and cover all the egg with 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.200
 the roses change the base to a base of 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.370
 white color because I like more how to 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.560
 I saw 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.709
 I also added a small ribbon 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.709
 blue 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.669
 this is completely optional but if 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:32.290
 you wish you can add a pot for 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.290
 that the topaz looks taller 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.240
 I'm going to leave it this way because I 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.570
 like more but as they say in likes and 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.620
 colors authors have not written 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.540
