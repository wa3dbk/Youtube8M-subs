00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
reach the two foot section the line that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.959 
reach the two foot section the line that
you've<00:01:00.960> drawn<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.980> engine<00:01:02.489> should<00:01:02.699> quit

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
you've drawn your engine should quit

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.050 
you've drawn your engine should quit
revving<00:01:03.449> out<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.260> fully<00:01:04.589> engaged<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
revving out and be fully engaged if the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.230 
revving out and be fully engaged if the
motors<00:01:06.830> still<00:01:07.830> revving<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.490> then<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.090> need

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
motors still revving out then you need

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.780 
motors still revving out then you need
to<00:01:09.360> tighten<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.900> clutch<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.530> more<00:01:10.790> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
to tighten up the clutch the more the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.240 
to tighten up the clutch the more the
point<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.869> once<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.740> reach<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
point of this is that once you reach the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340 
point of this is that once you reach the
two<00:01:14.400> foot<00:01:14.670> mark<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.390> engine<00:01:15.750> should<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:15.960> fully

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
two foot mark the engine should be fully

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.429 
two foot mark the engine should be fully
engaged<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:18.570> should<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.869> motivating

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
engaged and you should be motivating

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.690 
engaged and you should be motivating
forward<00:01:21.049> so<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:22.350> still<00:01:22.619> too<00:01:22.799> tight<00:01:23.100> and

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
forward so if you're still too tight and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.190 
forward so if you're still too tight and
you<00:01:23.820> don't<00:01:23.970> hear<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> engine<00:01:24.720> revving<00:01:25.049> out

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
you don't hear the engine revving out

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.469 
you don't hear the engine revving out
you'll<00:01:25.409> would<00:01:25.590> loosen<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.130> more<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
you'll would loosen it more and if it

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.819 
you'll would loosen it more and if it
was<00:01:29.030> too<00:01:30.030> loose<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.930> ever<00:01:31.409> engine<00:01:31.710> was

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
was too loose the ever engine was

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.249 
was too loose the ever engine was
Angela's<00:01:32.520> still<00:01:32.670> revving<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.210> would<00:01:33.360> loosen

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
Angela's still revving you would loosen

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.230 
Angela's still revving you would loosen
it<00:01:34.530> more<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.880> repeat<00:01:36.210> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it more I don't know if I just repeat it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840 
it more I don't know if I just repeat it
myself<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.890> know<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> point<00:01:38.400> if

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
myself but you know you get the point if

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.359 
myself but you know you get the point if
it's<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.600> Liz<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.350> tighten<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.829> if<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.280> too

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it's to Liz you tighten it if it's too

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.749 
it's to Liz you tighten it if it's too
tight<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.090> loosen<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.540> anyway<00:01:43.320> now<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.369> did

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
tight you loosen it anyway now I did

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910 
tight you loosen it anyway now I did
some<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.030> my<00:01:45.060> own<00:01:45.240> experimenting<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
some of my own experimenting I have the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.310 
some of my own experimenting I have the
stock<00:01:47.340> xl5<00:01:48.409> with<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.700> Titan<00:01:50.780> 12<00:01:51.780> turn<00:01:52.049> motor

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
stock xl5 with the Titan 12 turn motor

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.569 
stock xl5 with the Titan 12 turn motor
so<00:01:53.270> my<00:01:54.270> understanding<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.159> turn<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
so my understanding is if you turn the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.819 
so my understanding is if you turn the
screw<00:01:56.850> all<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.119> way<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.899> turn<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
screw all the way in and turn it out a

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.550 
screw all the way in and turn it out a
quarter<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.790> turn<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> stock

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
quarter of a turn that is the stock

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.310 
quarter of a turn that is the stock
setting<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:03.000> recommend<00:02:03.570> from<00:02:03.750> Traxxas

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
setting that they recommend from Traxxas

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.130 
setting that they recommend from Traxxas
ok<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.490> did<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.240> my<00:02:06.420> little<00:02:06.899> bit<00:02:07.020> of

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
ok so I did all my little bit of

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.249 
ok so I did all my little bit of
experimenting

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
experimenting

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.410 
experimenting
and<00:02:08.349> basically<00:02:08.800> Traxxas<00:02:09.519> sets<00:02:09.789> this<00:02:09.970> truck<00:02:10.239> up

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
and basically Traxxas sets this truck up

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.710 
and basically Traxxas sets this truck up
for<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.170> hardcore<00:02:11.790> wheeling<00:02:12.790> jumping<00:02:13.569> and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
for a hardcore wheeling jumping and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.210 
for a hardcore wheeling jumping and
everything<00:02:14.110> else<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.620> they<00:02:14.769> don't<00:02:14.950> really

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
everything else so they don't really

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.250 
everything else so they don't really
care<00:02:15.489> there's<00:02:15.940> something<00:02:16.299> breaks<00:02:16.599> of<00:02:17.200> course

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
care there's something breaks of course

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.890 
care there's something breaks of course
they<00:02:17.709> built<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.190> durable<00:02:18.879> so<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.420> guess<00:02:19.690> they<00:02:19.840> do

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
they built it durable so I guess they do

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.100 
they built it durable so I guess they do
care<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:21.069> know<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.700> get<00:02:21.849> my<00:02:22.000> point

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
care you know you but you get my point

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.570 
care you know you but you get my point
it's<00:02:23.110> not<00:02:23.290> set<00:02:23.530> up<00:02:23.560> for<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.890> racetrack<00:02:24.370> it's

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
it's not set up for the racetrack it's

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.750 
it's not set up for the racetrack it's
set<00:02:24.790> up<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.870> know<00:02:25.989> pound<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.280> dirt<00:02:27.489> and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
set up to you know pound the dirt and

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.550 
set up to you know pound the dirt and
ride<00:02:28.120> wheelies<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.540> stuff<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.140> if<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.319> strip

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
ride wheelies and stuff so if you strip

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.770 
ride wheelies and stuff so if you strip
the<00:02:29.680> gear<00:02:29.890> out<00:02:29.920> they<00:02:30.670> set<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.150> up<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:31.629> you<00:02:31.660> can

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
the gear out they set this up so you can

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.259 
the gear out they set this up so you can
replace<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.410> gear<00:02:32.680> pretty<00:02:33.069> easily<00:02:33.400> by

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
replace this gear pretty easily by

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.910 
replace this gear pretty easily by
removing<00:02:34.750> these<00:02:34.870> three<00:02:34.930> shoes<00:02:35.470> right<00:02:35.680> here

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
removing these three shoes right here

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.530 
removing these three shoes right here
the<00:02:36.099> spur<00:02:36.340> gear<00:02:36.519> just<00:02:36.670> pops<00:02:36.910> off<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.420> can

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
the spur gear just pops off and you can

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.650 
the spur gear just pops off and you can
pop<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.750> new<00:02:37.989> one<00:02:38.019> on<00:02:38.170> but<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.159> any<00:02:39.310> case<00:02:39.660> if

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
pop a new one on but in any case if

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.380 
pop a new one on but in any case if
you're<00:02:40.989> gonna<00:02:42.510> be<00:02:43.510> racing<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.379> car<00:02:44.739> I<00:02:45.700> found

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
you're gonna be racing the car I found

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.319 
you're gonna be racing the car I found
about<00:02:47.019> three-quarters<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.129> turn<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.879> good

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
about three-quarters of a turn is a good

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.110 
about three-quarters of a turn is a good
setting<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.099> twelfth<00:02:51.400> turn<00:02:51.579> motor<00:02:51.849> now

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
setting for the twelfth turn motor now

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.580 
setting for the twelfth turn motor now
you<00:02:52.180> got<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.390> remember<00:02:52.660> if<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:52.959> had<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.230> bigger

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
you got to remember if you had a bigger

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.309 
you got to remember if you had a bigger
motor<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:54.609> the<00:02:54.640> car<00:02:54.970> like<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.420> brushless<00:02:55.840> motor

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
motor to the car like a brushless motor

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.589 
motor to the car like a brushless motor
it's<00:02:56.769> gonna<00:02:56.890> have<00:02:57.099> more<00:02:57.129> torque<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.329> you<00:02:58.390> may

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
it's gonna have more torque so you may

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.869 
it's gonna have more torque so you may
need<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.900> tighten<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.290> clutch<00:02:59.530> more<00:02:59.859> so<00:03:00.549> but

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
need to tighten the clutch more so but

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.210 
need to tighten the clutch more so but
basically<00:03:01.390> for<00:03:01.569> this<00:03:01.780> setup<00:03:02.140> if<00:03:02.530> I'm<00:03:02.920> at<00:03:03.040> the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
basically for this setup if I'm at the

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.640 
basically for this setup if I'm at the
track<00:03:03.430> racing<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.150> can<00:03:04.359> basically<00:03:04.959> be<00:03:05.440> about

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
track racing I can basically be about

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.030 
track racing I can basically be about
3/4<00:03:06.549> somewhere<00:03:07.329> between<00:03:07.510> 1/2<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.200> 3/4<00:03:08.829> so<00:03:08.980> I

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
3/4 somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 so I

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.780 
3/4 somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 so I
started<00:03:09.459> 3/4<00:03:10.260> if<00:03:11.260> you're<00:03:11.560> gonna<00:03:12.190> take<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.579> car

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
started 3/4 if you're gonna take the car

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.069 
started 3/4 if you're gonna take the car
out<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.090> want<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.359> bash<00:03:13.510> on<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.989> and

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
out and you want to bash on it and

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.069 
out and you want to bash on it and
whatever<00:03:14.459> I'm<00:03:15.459> finding<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.299> half<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.840> turn

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
whatever I'm finding that a half a turn

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.140 
whatever I'm finding that a half a turn
is<00:03:17.380> working<00:03:17.769> fine<00:03:18.010> for<00:03:18.040> me<00:03:18.400> with<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.700> 12<00:03:18.940> turn

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
is working fine for me with the 12 turn

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.780 
is working fine for me with the 12 turn
motor<00:03:19.419> with<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.169> 7<00:03:20.560> cell<00:03:20.799> battery<00:03:21.190> now<00:03:21.519> if<00:03:21.669> I

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
motor with the 7 cell battery now if I

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.460 
motor with the 7 cell battery now if I
were<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.000> go<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.239> an<00:03:22.389> 8<00:03:22.569> cell<00:03:22.810> battery<00:03:23.169> I<00:03:23.260> would

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
were to go to an 8 cell battery I would

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.339 
were to go to an 8 cell battery I would
be<00:03:23.590> adding<00:03:23.980> more<00:03:24.669> torque<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:26.019> would<00:03:26.230> be

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
be adding more torque and I would be

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.879 
be adding more torque and I would be
adding<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.810> know<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.019> extra<00:03:29.349> so<00:03:29.560> I'd<00:03:29.769> be

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
adding you know the extra so I'd be

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.589 
adding you know the extra so I'd be
adding<00:03:30.130> more<00:03:30.250> torque<00:03:30.549> so<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.030> may<00:03:31.329> need<00:03:31.510> to

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
adding more torque so I may need to

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.449 
adding more torque so I may need to
tighten<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.019> clutch<00:03:32.260> back<00:03:32.530> up<00:03:32.799> that<00:03:33.310> other

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
tighten that clutch back up that other

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.370 
tighten that clutch back up that other
quarter<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.030> turn<00:03:34.209> but<00:03:34.780> right<00:03:34.959> now<00:03:35.109> with<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
quarter of a turn but right now with the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.559 
quarter of a turn but right now with the
7<00:03:35.739> cell<00:03:35.919> battery<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.430> way<00:03:36.549> I'm<00:03:36.730> set<00:03:37.000> up<00:03:37.030> I'm<00:03:37.359> at

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
7 cell battery the way I'm set up I'm at

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.809 
7 cell battery the way I'm set up I'm at
a<00:03:37.599> half<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.959> turn<00:03:38.200> if<00:03:38.889> you<00:03:38.950> want<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.370> set<00:03:39.549> it<00:03:39.669> up

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
a half a turn if you want to set it up

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.150 
a half a turn if you want to set it up
the<00:03:40.569> way<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.840> factory<00:03:41.230> sets<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.680> up<00:03:41.769> right<00:03:42.010> out

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
the way the factory sets it up right out

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.680 
the way the factory sets it up right out
of<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.310> box<00:03:42.519> it's<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:43.060> quarter<00:03:43.359> of<00:03:43.419> a<00:03:43.480> turn

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
of the box it's a quarter of a turn

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.089 
of the box it's a quarter of a turn
that's<00:03:44.139> where<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:44.470> should<00:03:44.530> be<00:03:44.680> if<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:46.720> want<00:03:46.900> to

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
that's where it should be if you want to

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.680 
that's where it should be if you want to
take<00:03:48.099> a<00:03:48.130> little<00:03:48.400> bit<00:03:48.549> less<00:03:48.849> of<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.120> chance<00:03:49.359> on

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
take a little bit less of a chance on

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.890 
take a little bit less of a chance on
breaking<00:03:50.319> gears<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:51.609> would<00:03:52.090> loosen<00:03:52.329> it<00:03:52.569> up<00:03:52.660> that

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
breaking gears I would loosen it up that

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.449 
breaking gears I would loosen it up that
extra<00:03:53.169> quarter<00:03:53.530> of<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.620> turn<00:03:53.799> and<00:03:54.040> run<00:03:54.129> it<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.370> a

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
extra quarter of a turn and run it and a

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.909 
extra quarter of a turn and run it and a
half<00:03:54.669> again<00:03:55.419> I'm<00:03:55.750> riding<00:03:56.200> wheelies<00:03:56.799> and

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
half again I'm riding wheelies and

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.400 
half again I'm riding wheelies and
everything<00:03:57.430> else<00:03:57.549> with<00:03:57.819> no<00:03:57.970> problem<00:03:58.569> running

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
everything else with no problem running

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.190 
everything else with no problem running
it<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.560> half<00:03:59.799> a<00:03:59.980> turn<00:04:00.220> by<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:00.879> 7<00:04:01.299> cell<00:04:01.569> if<00:04:01.989> you're

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
it a half a turn by the 7 cell if you're

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.509 
it a half a turn by the 7 cell if you're
running<00:04:02.349> a<00:04:02.530> brushless<00:04:02.769> you're<00:04:03.280> definitely

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
running a brushless you're definitely

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.770 
running a brushless you're definitely
gonna<00:04:03.730> probably<00:04:03.970> have<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.269> tighten<00:04:04.569> it<00:04:04.690> up

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
gonna probably have to tighten it up

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.610 
gonna probably have to tighten it up
more<00:04:04.989> because<00:04:05.169> you're<00:04:05.260> gonna<00:04:05.349> have<00:04:05.440> more

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
more because you're gonna have more

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.509 
more because you're gonna have more
torque<00:04:05.919> but<00:04:07.590> anyway<00:04:08.590> that's<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:09.069> setting<00:04:09.400> I

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
torque but anyway that's the setting I

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.740 
torque but anyway that's the setting I
found<00:04:10.169> again<00:04:11.609> if<00:04:12.609> you<00:04:12.819> want<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.090> set<00:04:13.239> it<00:04:13.359> to<00:04:13.389> the

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
found again if you want to set it to the

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.080 
found again if you want to set it to the
factory<00:04:14.139> setting<00:04:14.530> his<00:04:14.680> quarter<00:04:15.129> turn

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
factory setting his quarter turn

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.039 
factory setting his quarter turn
I<00:04:16.150> would<00:04:16.539> loosen<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:16.989> up<00:04:17.079> at<00:04:17.320> least<00:04:17.469> a<00:04:17.650> half

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
I would loosen it up at least a half

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.080 
I would loosen it up at least a half
other<00:04:19.199> quarter<00:04:19.590> returned<00:04:19.889> basically<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:21.060> a

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
other quarter returned basically to a

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.089 
other quarter returned basically to a
half<00:04:21.389> especially<00:04:22.109> if<00:04:22.199> it's<00:04:22.379> for<00:04:22.650> one<00:04:22.889> of<00:04:22.979> your

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
half especially if it's for one of your

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.490 
half especially if it's for one of your
young<00:04:23.310> kids<00:04:23.699> and<00:04:24.060> they're<00:04:24.659> gonna<00:04:24.750> be<00:04:24.930> smashing

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
young kids and they're gonna be smashing

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.839 
young kids and they're gonna be smashing
it<00:04:25.590> in<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.770> walls<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.159> lot<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.520> things<00:04:26.699> like

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
it in the walls a lot and things like

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.089 
it in the walls a lot and things like
that<00:04:27.050> when<00:04:28.050> they're<00:04:28.169> gassing<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:28.949> running

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
that when they're gassing it and running

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.619 
that when they're gassing it and running
it<00:04:29.250> into<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.460> wall<00:04:29.699> that's<00:04:30.000> when<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.330> tend<00:04:30.599> to

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629 
it into the wall that's when you tend to

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:33.020 
it into the wall that's when you tend to
break<00:04:30.810> gears<00:04:31.199> and<00:04:31.379> things<00:04:31.440> like<00:04:31.710> that<00:04:31.770> so<00:04:32.250> if

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
break gears and things like that so if

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.050 
break gears and things like that so if
you<00:04:33.180> loosen<00:04:33.539> this<00:04:33.569> up<00:04:34.400> if<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.520> want<00:04:35.879> them

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
you loosen this up if you want them

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.240 
you loosen this up if you want them
riding<00:04:36.270> wheelies<00:04:36.780> you<00:04:36.990> listen<00:04:37.379> it<00:04:37.500> up<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:38.220> a

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
riding wheelies you listen it up to a

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.939 
riding wheelies you listen it up to a
half<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.580> turn<00:04:39.259> you<00:04:40.259> know<00:04:40.409> but<00:04:40.650> it's<00:04:40.770> still

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
half a turn you know but it's still

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.469 
half a turn you know but it's still
going<00:04:41.099> to<00:04:41.159> help<00:04:41.340> with<00:04:41.699> a<00:04:41.759> little<00:04:42.030> bit<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.180> slip

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
going to help with a little bit of slip

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.360 
going to help with a little bit of slip
if<00:04:42.720> you<00:04:43.199> don't<00:04:43.440> want<00:04:43.620> to<00:04:43.680> write<00:04:43.889> in<00:04:44.039> wheelies

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
if you don't want to write in wheelies

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.559 
if you don't want to write in wheelies
and<00:04:44.580> you<00:04:44.639> want<00:04:44.789> to<00:04:44.849> make<00:04:44.970> sure<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.270> car<00:04:45.479> is

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
and you want to make sure the car is

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.140 
and you want to make sure the car is
just<00:04:45.629> not<00:04:45.930> gonna<00:04:46.169> break<00:04:46.759> basically<00:04:47.759> you're

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
just not gonna break basically you're

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.700 
just not gonna break basically you're
not<00:04:48.210> gonna<00:04:48.389> be<00:04:48.539> ripping<00:04:48.750> up<00:04:48.900> spear<00:04:49.199> gears<00:04:49.440> I

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
not gonna be ripping up spear gears I

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.110 
not gonna be ripping up spear gears I
would<00:04:49.860> set<00:04:50.039> this<00:04:50.159> to<00:04:50.340> three<00:04:50.580> quarters<00:04:50.940> of<00:04:50.970> a

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
would set this to three quarters of a

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.180 
would set this to three quarters of a
turn<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:52.199> then<00:04:52.349> you<00:04:52.440> won't<00:04:52.620> be<00:04:52.919> worrying

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
turn and then you won't be worrying

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.040 
turn and then you won't be worrying
about<00:04:53.280> stripping<00:04:53.759> gears<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:54.270> anything<00:04:54.870> else

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
about stripping gears and anything else

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.570 
about stripping gears and anything else
but<00:04:55.319> you<00:04:55.500> won't<00:04:55.710> be<00:04:55.830> able<00:04:55.949> to<00:04:56.009> write<00:04:56.219> wheelies

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
but you won't be able to write wheelies

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.850 
but you won't be able to write wheelies
which<00:04:57.509> is<00:04:57.659> good<00:04:57.870> for<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.169> track<00:04:58.440> you<00:04:58.680> really

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
which is good for the track you really

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.369 
which is good for the track you really
don't<00:04:59.009> want<00:04:59.159> to<00:04:59.219> ride<00:04:59.370> wheelies<00:04:59.759> so<00:05:00.539> anyway<00:05:01.349> I

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
don't want to ride wheelies so anyway I

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.250 
don't want to ride wheelies so anyway I
hope<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:01.650> helps<00:05:01.800> you<00:05:02.069> guys
