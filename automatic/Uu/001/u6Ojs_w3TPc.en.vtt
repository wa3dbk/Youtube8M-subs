00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.779
 Hello everyone 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.919
 kairos how are you? 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.630
 today for the discovery of the 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.880
 first dlc havok just out 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.949
 on advanced warfare today on the 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.170
 xbox live and here we are on the map 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.989
 body here are four multiplayer maps on 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.760
 this dlc 4 multiplayer a weapon and mode 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.190
 sure zombie especially that I think that 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.600
 a lot was waiting for a long time so 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.980
 let's see what gives this map 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.930
 I do not know at all what I have 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.559
 not seen how it was a map 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.350
 which looks a little and circular so 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.610
 so here is just bye a 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.500
 little bit so it makes think a little 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.010
 little to rust in the desert like that full 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.850
 dust 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.260
 and yes here is a little bit of how 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.059
 how is it because sometimes you 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.010
 look at the minimap it looks small but 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.220
 andres is great and that's what it 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.740
 just look that okay okay the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.759
 small colati of triplete markers 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.040
 marker now this is a small 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.110
 little discomfort 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.440
 so good I'm not necessarily super fat 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.760
 shoots that where people come again I 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.020
 I'm sure I will not move well 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.380
 I'm going to be there we'll discover a 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.340
 little that morning there is a kind of thing 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.409
 electromagnetic 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.520
 I do not know if I go inside if I 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.510
 do not you, you 're a little platform 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 by the way see where I am 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.010
 am in the map 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.980
 Okay 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.660
 a small displacement so it's senna 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.850
 which seems still we'll say 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.100
 average size have compared to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.020
 advanced warfare but whose fights 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.480
 hang up I think are going to be rather 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.710
 friendly so who could build 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.480
 match what is a little bit of 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.250
 distance that could correspond to little 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.500
 close to all the weapon styles that this 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.110
 either bah shotgun 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.280
 it's true that on this I find that 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.610
 pump guns are not really put to 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.140
 honor 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.880
 I'm not a fan of pump guns 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.560
 general but I feel like more 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.750
 the call of duty advance plus they are a 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.870
 little neglected and I imagine that fans 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.080
 of the kind can be disappointed any case 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.120
 I tested the tac 19 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.500
 it was not top unlike that 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.450
 did not do that to compete not much 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.920
 with the rest that's the problem it's 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.170
 not necessarily how the army c6 and 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.760
 compete or not so yeah that's right 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.980
 that she still looks mean 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.420
 big still a circus it takes 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.070
 must fetch the enemies we 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.080
 pretty close fight so it's not 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.180
 badly especially the types of weapons even though 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.590
 for the hit snipe for the side trick 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.300
 aggressive it's going to be pretty bad but for the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.800
 fidh it might be a little bit 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.870
 delicate but good to make small 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.250
 little clips a little lucky on a 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.420
 girl or something like that that risk 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.830
 to be pretty shit here by cons I 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.380
 should take the exo skills 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.080
 exhaust I imagine to go a little bit more 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.330
 quickly from one side to the other because that 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.070
 looks to me choppy sorry to bag it's 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.140
 annoying when you're at the magic snack 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.730
 marker is behind the snipe eight goals 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.910
 in a ball it is always annoying but 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.910
 good what do you want and it's not my fault 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.830
 a lot of nooks on this map a 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.480
 take the small submachine gun 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.750
 I thought if an enemy judge exaggerated not 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.750
 no more 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.810
 but it's true that it makes one think 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.790
 little bit to rust atmosphere is not 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.080
 at all the same size but it's not 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.340
 wrong precisely this side 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.950
 I have the impression that the four maps 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.630
 who really in the dlc have all 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.459
 a really different atmosphere 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.459
 and finally it's pretty positive 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:55.030
 first two dishes pity I got 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:57.420
 we will have done by starting up there that has 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.550
 often seem to be beating on that side 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.959
 often of the world but here they are 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:11.340
 tough continues to shoot imagine the bug 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:13.569
 did not eat anything ah shit in the evening 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.959
 good actually it's on that side 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.959
 that it happens 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.979
 this little koala could have gone to these 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.979
 sad 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.879
 and yet abba will certainly need it 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.949
 is behind me and here I am or fucking 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.419
 I'm lost do you mean if I'm 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.110
 found on the map so that's two 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:45.650
 minutes I played 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:46.879
 it would be a little magic go we go 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.680
 play a little bit more aggressively at 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:51.080
 tanger month but who jumped the mayor 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.780
 to play well in the freight aria 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.770
 we will have to be ready on this map 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.819
 for precisely the little affront kind 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.460
 since we saw on the drift map or 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.259
 it was still relatively open 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.849
 as much on this one saadÃ© of fights 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.229
 are will be getting closer even though the 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.270
 map maps are pretty 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.050
 medium-sized mediums I will go more 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.030
 because it's true that it should 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.840
 still gone there is consistency there 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.840
 must fetch the enemies 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.850
 we are going to go with the gold that is 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.860
 happens there is someone up there that 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.960
 I can not access them like that it's 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.990
 not serious it fell for me I am 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.849
 fell for him I will not sing of 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.740
 almost lobbies bola it's 4 o'clock 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.979
 morning a brothel has a small side a little 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.210
 jungle there it's pretty like the sets and 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:42.759
 the maps are well done that makes it 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:44.830
 pleasure to the gogos a little wish 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:49.419
 boost there it would be good on this map 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.699
 there we are going to take the little one 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.340
 asem we have it we do not see it 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.599
 a lot on the multi effect it's a little 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.620
 ironic 1 for those who would say 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:57.780
 waiting for me but I do not understand this case and 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.770
 pink we see a lot 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.289
 sometimes I say stuff like that but the 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.580
 people really believe that I am 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.900
 seriously I know we see it 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.660
 a lot there this weapon has 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.009
 unfortunately a dish finally fucking 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.449
 if they are a little shriveled 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.520
 so here I was it was the discovery at 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.720
 the body map a low map rather 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.759
 nice I want to say in everything 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.569
 case to have for the continuation on the others 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:19.090
 game modes etc. 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:21.430
 if finally she is pretty cool or 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.509
 satisfactory or not having that in all 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.370
 case do not hesitate to give your opinion 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:25.389
 suggestions in relation to her small 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.979
 sister also it's nice it's the 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.970
 reward is for me I wanted 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:29.050
 it's excellent it's just 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.590
 calm happiness the public thing the 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.590
 next to dubai
