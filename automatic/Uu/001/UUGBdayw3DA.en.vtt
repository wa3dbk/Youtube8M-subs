and then you get this bit with the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.240 
and then you get this bit with the
actual<00:02:01.159> rollerball<00:02:02.159> tip<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.680> unscrew

makes this pop out I'm completely out of

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.470 
makes this pop out I'm completely out of
my<00:02:15.310> element<00:02:15.340> here<00:02:15.670> because<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.060> never<00:02:16.240> really

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
my element here because I never really

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.790 
my element here because I never really
used<00:02:16.660> these<00:02:16.810> types<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.200> pens<00:02:17.410> but<00:02:17.590> here<00:02:17.740> you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
used these types of pens but here you

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.840 
used these types of pens but here you
have<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.240> refill<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.290> says<00:02:20.530> 3h<00:02:21.280> and

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
have the refill and it says 3h and

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.440 
have the refill and it says 3h and
that's<00:02:22.090> all<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:24.250> fits<00:02:24.490> nicely<00:02:25.030> and

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
that's all this to it it fits nicely and

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.110 
that's all this to it it fits nicely and
snugly<00:02:26.020> as<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:27.040> can<00:02:27.220> see<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.760> goes<00:02:27.910> all<00:02:28.090> the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
snugly as you can see it goes all the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.340 
snugly as you can see it goes all the
way<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.450> end<00:02:28.570> of<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.690> barrel<00:02:28.960> so<00:02:29.110> why<00:02:29.230> not

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
way to the end of the barrel so why not

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.820 
way to the end of the barrel so why not
get<00:02:29.560> dislodged<00:02:30.810> it's<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.440> not<00:02:32.590> really<00:02:32.800> a

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
get dislodged it's this is not really a

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.170 
get dislodged it's this is not really a
click<00:02:33.100> mechanism<00:02:33.670> or<00:02:33.730> anything<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.120> just

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
click mechanism or anything you just

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.630 
click mechanism or anything you just
uncap<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.810> pinch<00:02:35.050> right<00:02:35.350> now<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.340> that's<00:02:36.430> it

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
uncap the pinch right now and that's it

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.040 
uncap the pinch right now and that's it
you<00:02:36.790> can<00:02:36.970> see<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.360> section<00:02:37.630> actually

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
you can see that the section actually

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:47.180 
you can see that the section actually
has<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.410> same<00:02:38.680> pink<00:02:39.670> color<00:02:40.180> as<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:41.610> cap<00:02:44.040> and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.170 

that's<00:02:48.190> pretty<00:02:48.370> much<00:02:48.490> all<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:48.820> can<00:02:49.000> say<00:02:49.150> about

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
that's pretty much all I can say about

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.030 
that's pretty much all I can say about

he wasn't a whole lot more now I have
written<00:02:53.260> with<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.770> writes<00:02:53.980> nicely<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.610> am

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
written with it it writes nicely I am

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.790 
written with it it writes nicely I am
going<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.030> do<00:02:55.120> writing<00:02:55.510> sample<00:02:55.900> clearly<00:02:56.620> line

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
going to do writing sample clearly line

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.500 
going to do writing sample clearly line
variation<00:02:57.100> etc<00:02:57.670> it's<00:02:57.760> not<00:02:57.790> really<00:02:58.240> going<00:02:58.360> to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
variation etc it's not really going to

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.170 
variation etc it's not really going to
come<00:02:58.720> into<00:02:58.840> play<00:02:58.900> it's<00:02:59.320> not<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.470> fountain<00:02:59.830> pen

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
come into play it's not a fountain pen

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.120 
come into play it's not a fountain pen
and<00:03:01.180> that's<00:03:01.360> it<00:03:01.540> what<00:03:02.410> I<00:03:02.440> like<00:03:02.680> about<00:03:02.800> it<00:03:03.040> what

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
and that's it what I like about it what

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.490 
and that's it what I like about it what
am<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.280> not<00:03:03.460> like<00:03:03.670> about<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.150> well<00:03:04.630> it's<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:05.050> small

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
am I not like about it well it's a small

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.190 
am I not like about it well it's a small
pen<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:06.070> like<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.150> it's<00:03:07.360> very<00:03:07.510> portable

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
pen I like that it's very portable

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.500 
pen I like that it's very portable
the<00:03:08.530> downside<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.490> is<00:03:09.640> a<00:03:09.670> small<00:03:09.970> pen<00:03:10.240> if<00:03:10.480> you

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
the downside is it is a small pen if you

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.980 
the downside is it is a small pen if you
have<00:03:10.810> relatively<00:03:11.650> large<00:03:11.860> hands<00:03:12.390> then<00:03:13.390> that

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
have relatively large hands then that

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.590 
have relatively large hands then that
may<00:03:14.140> be<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.620> small<00:03:15.070> pen<00:03:15.460> to<00:03:15.670> do<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.090> wield<00:03:16.300> and

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
may be a small pen to do to wield and

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.690 
may be a small pen to do to wield and
but<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.560> know<00:03:17.590> once<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.040> post<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.610> it

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
but you know once you post it it

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.730 
but you know once you post it it
actually<00:03:18.970> turns<00:03:19.210> into<00:03:19.300> a<00:03:19.480> comfortable<00:03:20.380> pen

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
actually turns into a comfortable pen

surfaces<00:03:57.100> so<00:03:57.730> yes<00:03:58.240> it<00:03:58.510> is<00:03:58.630> more<00:03:58.780> practical

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
surfaces so yes it is more practical

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.990 
surfaces so yes it is more practical
than<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.290> fountain<00:03:59.650> pen<00:03:59.680> there<00:04:00.250> I've<00:04:00.550> said<00:04:00.790> it

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
than a fountain pen there I've said it

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.510 
than a fountain pen there I've said it
Sooni<00:04:01.660> whatever<00:04:02.170> yeah<00:04:03.480> yeah<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:05.350> a<00:04:05.560> couple<00:04:06.400> of

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
Sooni whatever yeah yeah so a couple of

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.080 
Sooni whatever yeah yeah so a couple of
measurements

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
measurements

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.260 
measurements
10<00:04:07.480> grams<00:04:07.980> size<00:04:09.010> I've<00:04:09.430> measured<00:04:09.730> these<00:04:09.970> things

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
10 grams size I've measured these things

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.270 
10 grams size I've measured these things
a<00:04:10.540> bunch<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:11.020> times<00:04:11.260> now<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.530> classic<00:04:12.040> so

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
a bunch of times now the classic so

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.800 
a bunch of times now the classic so
again<00:04:13.890> 106<00:04:14.890> millimetres<00:04:15.550> uncapped<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.450> saw<00:04:16.690> it

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
again 106 millimetres uncapped I saw it

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.900 
again 106 millimetres uncapped I saw it
capped<00:04:17.049> now<00:04:17.799> I'm<00:04:17.950> captive<00:04:18.400> cause<00:04:18.609> this<00:04:18.760> one

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
capped now I'm captive cause this one

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.520 
capped now I'm captive cause this one
doesn't<00:04:19.090> have<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.299> nib<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:19.930> that's<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.200> little

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
doesn't have a nib so that's a little

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.490 
doesn't have a nib so that's a little
bit<00:04:20.770> different<00:04:21.840> they<00:04:22.840> come<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.140> 100

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
bit different they come to 100

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.080 
bit different they come to 100
millimeters<00:04:24.010> same<00:04:24.490> size<00:04:24.760> as<00:04:24.970> a<00:04:25.000> classic

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
millimeters same size as a classic

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.580 
millimeters same size as a classic
diameter<00:04:28.090> of<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.420> section<00:04:28.810> ten<00:04:29.080> millimeters

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
diameter of the section ten millimeters

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.380 
diameter of the section ten millimeters
at<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.800> top<00:04:30.010> end<00:04:30.280> then<00:04:30.850> somewhere<00:04:31.150> down<00:04:31.210> the

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
at the top end then somewhere down the

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.790 
at the top end then somewhere down the
middle<00:04:31.570> it's<00:04:31.750> about<00:04:31.900> nine<00:04:32.260> nine<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.770> half

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
middle it's about nine nine and a half

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.920 
middle it's about nine nine and a half
then<00:04:33.580> near<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.790> bottom<00:04:34.030> end<00:04:34.360> what<00:04:34.630> means<00:04:34.840> the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
then near the bottom end what means the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.770 
then near the bottom end what means the
barrel<00:04:35.230> it's<00:04:35.680> ten<00:04:35.920> millimeters<00:04:36.460> yes<00:04:36.700> again<00:04:36.970> so

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
barrel it's ten millimeters yes again so

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.960 
barrel it's ten millimeters yes again so
they<00:04:37.900> have<00:04:38.170> it<00:04:38.320> I<00:04:38.580> hope<00:04:39.580> this<00:04:39.760> was<00:04:39.940> useful

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
they have it I hope this was useful

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.410 
they have it I hope this was useful

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
okay so here we go with this calico ice

00:04:51.610 --> 00:05:14.810 
okay so here we go with this calico ice
sport<00:05:00.120> gel<00:05:01.120> roller<00:05:04.650> writing<00:05:05.650> is<00:05:05.920> very<00:05:05.980> smooth

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:23.100 

the<00:05:15.820> pen<00:05:16.090> glides<00:05:16.750> across<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.410> paper<00:05:21.780> in<00:05:22.780> flow

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
the pen glides across the paper in flow

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.110 
the pen glides across the paper in flow
is<00:05:23.290> good<00:05:23.500> there<00:05:24.250> was<00:05:24.340> a<00:05:24.370> bit<00:05:24.550> of<00:05:24.580> a<00:05:24.700> skip<00:05:24.940> there

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
is good there was a bit of a skip there

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:38.170 
is good there was a bit of a skip there
but<00:05:25.240> that<00:05:25.330> was<00:05:25.360> me<00:05:25.660> miss<00:05:26.140> whining<00:05:26.530> a<00:05:26.590> pen

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.640 

it's<00:05:39.180> almost<00:05:39.540> like<00:05:40.610> rubbing<00:05:41.610> across<00:05:41.880> ice<00:05:42.650> very

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
it's almost like rubbing across ice very

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.980 
it's almost like rubbing across ice very
smooth<00:05:44.100> very<00:05:44.400> smooth<00:05:45.120> writing<00:05:45.510> experience

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
smooth very smooth writing experience

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.460 
smooth very smooth writing experience
when<00:05:46.170> I<00:05:46.200> had<00:05:46.380> which<00:05:46.590> I<00:05:46.710> absolutely<00:05:46.830> love<00:05:48.470> it's

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
when I had which I absolutely love it's

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.710 
when I had which I absolutely love it's
also<00:05:49.620> fairly<00:05:49.980> wet<00:05:50.280> I<00:05:50.520> would<00:05:50.550> say<00:05:50.910> gives<00:05:51.420> a<00:05:51.540> nice

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
also fairly wet I would say gives a nice

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.210 
also fairly wet I would say gives a nice
good<00:05:52.200> inflow<00:05:53.330> this<00:05:54.330> is<00:05:54.480> a<00:05:54.510> roller<00:05:54.840> so<00:05:55.350> when<00:05:56.130> it

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
good inflow this is a roller so when it

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.670 
good inflow this is a roller so when it
comes<00:05:56.430> to<00:05:56.640> line<00:05:56.880> variation<00:05:57.600> there<00:05:58.410> isn't

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
comes to line variation there isn't

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.560 
comes to line variation there isn't
really<00:05:58.830> a<00:05:58.980> whole<00:05:59.400> lot<00:05:59.460> you<00:05:59.910> can<00:05:59.970> push<00:06:00.300> it<00:06:00.420> down

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
really a whole lot you can push it down

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.990 
really a whole lot you can push it down
a<00:06:00.600> bit<00:06:01.140> to<00:06:01.680> push<00:06:01.890> the<00:06:02.070> ball<00:06:02.220> in<00:06:02.400> there<00:06:02.580> and<00:06:02.820> get

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
a bit to push the ball in there and get

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.750 
a bit to push the ball in there and get
some<00:06:03.150> extra<00:06:03.360> inflow<00:06:03.780> going<00:06:04.190> but<00:06:05.190> overall<00:06:05.640> I

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
some extra inflow going but overall I

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.000 
some extra inflow going but overall I
would<00:06:06.000> say<00:06:06.300> it's<00:06:06.930> it's<00:06:07.170> not<00:06:07.320> really<00:06:07.590> meant<00:06:07.770> for

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
would say it's it's not really meant for

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.410 
would say it's it's not really meant for
that<00:06:08.100> sort<00:06:08.340> of<00:06:08.400> stuff<00:06:09.650> I<00:06:11.150> find<00:06:12.150> this<00:06:12.360> very
