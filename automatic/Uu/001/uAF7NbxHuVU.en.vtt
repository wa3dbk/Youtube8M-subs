 here I propose a laptop with a 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.030
 13.3-inch screen that is nothing 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.450
 thin and its weight is not exactly 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.449
 reduced then what is special 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.070
 what it is to be a real cucumber 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.560
 with a huge power and a 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.390
 screen and sound quality 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.830
 spectacular so if you are looking for a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.869
 portable with which you can play the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.880
 more demanding video games or bring

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.980
 a very interesting detail monte is a 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.530
 100% Spanish company with central and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.879
 technical service in madrid maybe not 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.100
 you've seen their teams in the centers 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.129
 most important commercials because great 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.899
 part of their sales is made online 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.610
 assemble equipment in series but if not 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.199
 convinces in any of those components or 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.269
 you need a computer a little bit 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.949
 Special because they do not have more than 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.979
 contact with the boys of mount and that 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.439

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.260
 the interesting details of this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.600
 laptop called cover 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.910
 first the design as you see it seems that 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.520
 is floating because it is a peculiar form of 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.760
 the base the lid has a rubber finish 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.440
 matt and soft almost anti-fingerprints and all the 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.210
 Hard plastic shell with a 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.210
 high quality assembly 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.620
 on the keyboard besides being 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.660
 backlit presents some keys 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.240
 very good size with the separation between 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.030
 them just and with depth of click 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.580
 balanced the touch pad we think 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.580
 fast accurate and quite rigorous 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.490
 let's look at their ports well 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.369
 here you have the access to put a 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.240
 padlock power ethernet port 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.659
 output for output monitor hdmi and three 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.880
 USB 3.0 ports 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.549
 let's look a little bit and here's the slot 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.010
 for sd cards with all variants 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.970
 that you already know 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.970
 and on this side 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.950
 input and output of microphone output 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.370
 headphones and another other usb port in 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.790
 this case 2.0 the speakers are from 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.769
 origin 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.989
 Onkyo here is the signature of that company 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.000
 in case you do not know it even though it's a brand 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.650
 specialized in very high sound 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.930
 quality so they are from a seasoning 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.910
 great for when you use the computer 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.560
 as a music player or but when 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.870
 you want the neighborhood to know you're 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.120
 one with video games because it sounds 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.069
 they sound a lot 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.780
 the battery is removable what is a 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.000
 very interesting data for topics of 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.150
 mobility for what to carry then a 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.790
 second look in the backpack 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.680

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.420
 fast for example we can do the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.400
 test turn it on from the mode 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.400
 turned off completely to see when it takes 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.360

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.700
