00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hi girls new video this time 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.170
 to give you a review that many of you have 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.000
 required for double wear foundation by 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.090
 estÃ©e lauder that what is 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.420
 using this last period more 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.730
 then I know it right now makes one 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.080
 skin in my opinion beautiful and 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.439
 impeccable because it has a high coverage 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.869
 and let's see for a moment start a little 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.670
 from the beginning otherwise I lose myself because 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.399
 you know how you don't try the usual 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.610
 speeches we do the things ordered for 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.739
 once then it's a little bottle of 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.010
 glass there are 30 ml of product 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:48.629
 inside this here that I use 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:50.969
 number 3 w1 and is called trauma what to say 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.610
 then solid things about the bottle 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.239
 very uncomfortable glass bottle without 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.239
 the used king 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.309
 ok the price of this foundation on 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.159
 lot has always been is 38 euros e 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.409
 50 so let's say it's part of that 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.820
 medium-high range 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.140
 according to me it is worth all is really the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.840
 my favorite foundation 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:19.520
 I recommend it if you have time we say 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.650
 you need a very high coverage 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.049
 that a foundation that really lasts 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.229
 all day 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.590
 I really find myself no better than that 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.140
 or much need to cover imperfections 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.670
 and especially in winter and mail or if 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.450
 just the current effect to me not 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.070
 like effect more became or whatever 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.970
 for this product I find it 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.360
 first of all it is very fluid 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.540
 fluid but not a slightly creamy thing 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.119
 when you apply it here in the meantime 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.729
 I show in case it is then I do 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.939
 see the face a part with the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.130
 foundation and a no and the application is 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.810
 I am comfortable with my fingers 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.790
 apply it that way because it is 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.179
 a foundation that web you wear it 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.009
 being immediately fixed then with the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.640
 brush you should be very much 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.170
 fast then because otherwise yes 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.030
 they create squares so I will 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.370
 I really recommend using it with 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.459
 fingers so you can go warm 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.830
 well the product is getting to the point of 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.750
 all the corners of the face 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.910
 in this way will have an effect that 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.890
 naturally homogeneous beak site 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.269
 also to use the brush I will 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.790
 I say for my experience 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.430
 in short, really with levity and excellent 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.660
 the exam really very little you don't put 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.239
 a little bit and you go right away just to 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.730
 putting on the month really isn't needed 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.200
 much product how long this lasts 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.090
 foundation then from now very much to 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.970
 I recently made the difference 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.349
 review of the email plus pupa 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.090
 here is a difference everywhere 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.730
 foundation and that really is it 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.290
 put it you paste to the face from 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.410
 however a very feeling 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.510
 comfortable because it is fixed but not 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.060
 from that effect then maybe they leave 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.230
 some sticky foundation no leaves 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.510
 the skin brawls 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.579
 no need to buffer it at least in 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.730
 In my case, I remind you that I have skin 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.590
 fat ministra in the acts area and I have not 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.390
 I don't even need to focus 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.760
 really use that are in use 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.810
 but it is the powder with this foundation e 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.760
 up to 88 hours 8 and a half hours especially 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.260
 now that it really gets cool 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.359
 intact long it has been polished for quite a while 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.130
 I'm starting to see something here 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.489
 light of one in the area acts but really 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.680
 something minimal and going into that 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.380
 moment to start really lasts others 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.750
 eight hours is really fantastic 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.790
 the price is a little high but I repeat it 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.299
 snow is worth all of them 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.639
 and we see what else to say lake prince is 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.810
 high even this is more flexible 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.880
 in the put it can therefore be overwhelmed 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.900
 layered to get more 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:16.470
 covering and nothing really then 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:19.919
 recommended to spf 10 and nothing really 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.500
 my favorite foundation then if 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.030
 you are interested I recommend you go 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.060
 to see at least the colors 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.099
 because there really are so many 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.289
 the particular thing happened to me because 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.880
 this point tempts me bought it 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.260
 mom for the birthday when i am 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.080
 gone up in Milan it entered the SEC hour 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.560
 I see a moment I was direct because 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.620
 we will be there to want this was there 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.479
 a saleswoman that naturally if then 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.030
 by charity alone, that is, always with me 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.430
 Express beautiful charity is their job 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.590
 But I happen to me this order chain 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.560
 we follow offspring this we see the color 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.310
 in the sauna spread the colors on the 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.169
 arm 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:11.570
 and we come together to the conclusion that 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:11.570
 my color was well laitenberger 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.900
 conclusion after about ten minutes 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.780
 we come to the conclusion that this is 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.030
 my veil color takes place among all 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.450
 these endless little bottles this is the 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.280
 so from here we read the 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.950
 code 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.530
 and oh well I take it from the cash box hello 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.570
 when he comes home I go to see 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.140
 I couldn't wait to try it, I go to 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.050
 see and not read anywhere though 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.370
 instead of holding the wrong color 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:47.340
 I can no longer go back to Milan too 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.219
 mandate they were fortunately having it 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.760
 tried it wasn't so dark 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:57.210
 in fact I think that now more or less perhaps 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.100
 it starts to be but just slightly 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.780
 why up to some 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.910
 hard note in short I was still had 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.860
 still slightly the remnants of 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.200
 tan and then they did a 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.810
 moment the test with all the signs that 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.970
 I had some of the foundation I had 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.960
 watched that anyway and always in this 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.630
 will put a little more light for me 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.880
 so this was perfect here then 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.260
 luckily in bad luck it went well 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.610
 so check the colors well because 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:31.210
 year let's say you recognize both from 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.730
 code that precisely from a real name 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.740
 but I have seen why the order 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:39.850
 be wrong because this quiz years e 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:42.790
 three w1 and hi night 3 n 1 so maybe 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:45.670
 she confused herself with the writing but va beh 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.560
 in short, no girls I hope there is 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:51.480
 useful state that has kept you 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.480
 company a kiss to the next video
