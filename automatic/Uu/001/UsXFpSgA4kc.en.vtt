00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hi, ingrid personal some today and you 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.030
 like my pliers and no nail scissors 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.550
 at home so if you want to get out more 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.040
 soon someone with me then the people who 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.049
 you will need is a plate or a 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.289
 panel that you want to is not there to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.720
 your bed the mattress and the next thing you 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.840
 you will need is the main one that is the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.769
 aluminum foil and it is super cheap and in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.219
 any place to always paper 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.940
 common and you will need is clear that the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:41.910
 pliers and nail scissors 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:47.640
 so come on then this I have one 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:50.160
 a thousand in retreat a part of it does not 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.670
 Girl needs you to do nothing up from 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.649
 any way you mass does it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.629
 it as if it were a way doing 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:06.560
 Do not even make people nail with you. 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:09.079
 her side the brighter side 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.509
 lake ness post if you do this with the 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.149
 The more exposed side is not our only 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.840
 you will make a brighter side of the 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.770
 foil even with if you want 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.180
 but it 's close 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.979
 if you thought I was little 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.500
 ball without growing the mark 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.039
 And then I passed the ball to you. 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.320
 You see that afternoon and now I 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.520
 I separate everything I wanted from close to 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.520
 Nothing disrupts me 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.490
 And now you get the chain and I'm 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.549
 if I had inspired a cuticle 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.070
 even she just a little bit more 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.110
 Strength, now I've changed places. 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.240
 because the other side is a little more 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.909
 dark and perform lighter with certainty 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.780
 better no more do you work as 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.780
 it works now 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.120
 So it's time to do it. 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.630
 how much it exonerates and with the scissors 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.090
 difference the difference is that with 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.250
 application you make the ball and with the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:53.540
 scissors you only do one day as I go 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:56.420
 do it now and will do the same thing 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.910
 with the pliers placing the most 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.770
 glowing up to be able to undo and 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.770
 stay there and stay all right 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.900
 what you will do and now our op 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:18.080
 for you who imprison you cut the line 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:22.910
 which is very fashionable even with it 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:29.120
 interpret what you will do to yourself 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:31.190
 take the wet paper and go and make one of 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.200
 low to sign with the resources of 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.090
 down up 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.970
 you can do two ways to show 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:45.040
 this is the first and bottom up or 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.040
 then one will have to show next 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.880
 and soon the girl accused her and she stayed 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.270
 very good I loved the result very much 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.270
 thanks
