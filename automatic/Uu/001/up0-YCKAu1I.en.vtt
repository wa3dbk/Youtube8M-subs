top place of that table but it's still
on<00:01:04.049> top<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.880> think<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.810> same<00:01:07.049> cards

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
on top I think I have for the same cards

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:16.190 
on top I think I have for the same cards
but<00:01:09.119> look<00:01:10.610> top<00:01:11.610> card<00:01:12.260> it's<00:01:13.260> Duke<00:01:13.619> States<00:01:15.200> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
but look top card it's Duke States the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.090 
but look top card it's Duke States the
second<00:01:16.619> card<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.159> still<00:01:17.520> space<00:01:18.770> dirt<00:01:19.770> dart

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
second card is still space dirt dart

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.660 
second card is still space dirt dart
Stoops<00:01:20.939> Bates<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:22.290> fourth<00:01:22.680> card<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.159> also<00:01:23.610> two

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
Stoops Bates the fourth card is also two

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.830 
Stoops Bates the fourth card is also two
states<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:26.189> basically<00:01:26.610> all<00:01:26.850> four<00:01:27.240> cards<00:01:27.630> are

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
states so basically all four cards are

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.740 
states so basically all four cards are
all<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> same<00:01:28.290> cards<00:01:30.500> but<00:01:31.500> that's<00:01:31.770> impossible

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750

and place those at the bottom while you

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.080 
and place those at the bottom while you
do<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.860> take<00:02:31.860> away<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.360> two<00:02:33.410> spades<00:02:34.410> and

place<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.269> on<00:02:36.390> top<00:02:36.769> so<00:02:37.769> now<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:37.980> should<00:02:38.280> have

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
place it on top so now you should have

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:47.479 
place it on top so now you should have
this<00:02:43.790> now<00:02:44.790> double<00:02:45.750> if<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.200> first<00:02:46.590> top<00:02:46.980> cards

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
this now double if the first top cards

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.140 
this now double if the first top cards
and<00:02:49.610> show<00:02:50.610> them<00:02:51.319> that<00:02:52.319> top<00:02:52.830> card<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.400> still

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
and show them that top card is still

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.910 
and show them that top card is still
space<00:02:54.739> actually<00:02:55.739> it's<00:02:55.920> not<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.840> double<00:02:57.840> lift

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.190 

then<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.100> take<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.519> top<00:03:02.730> card<00:03:02.760> which<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.450> the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
then you take the top card which is the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.680 
then you take the top card which is the
two<00:03:04.410> spades<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:07.370> show<00:03:08.370> them<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:08.970> top<00:03:09.390> card

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
two spades and show them that top card

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
is the two forts and place the two parts

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:20.810 
is the two forts and place the two parts
in<00:03:14.329> third<00:03:15.329> position<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:16.769> triple<00:03:17.370> lift<00:03:19.820> so

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
in third position and triple lift so

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.930 
in third position and triple lift so
which<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.299> are<00:03:21.660> these<00:03:22.620> true<00:03:22.950> three<00:03:23.489> cards<00:03:23.880> and

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
which is are these true three cards and

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.750 
which is are these true three cards and
do<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.180> one<00:03:27.420> so<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.870> looks<00:03:28.049> like<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:29.430> just
