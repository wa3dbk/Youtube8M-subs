00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
finally here this car has to be good so

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
finally here this car has to be good so
what<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> new<00:00:32.430> about<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.390> seventh<00:00:33.750> generation

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
what is new about the seventh generation

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.560 
what is new about the seventh generation
golf<00:00:34.620> well<00:00:35.580> pretty<00:00:36.089> much<00:00:36.239> everything

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
golf well pretty much everything

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.930 
golf well pretty much everything
actually<00:00:37.010> crucially<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.190> now<00:00:38.400> rides<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
actually crucially it now rides on the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.329 
actually crucially it now rides on the
MQB<00:00:39.480> platform<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> Audi<00:00:40.739> a3<00:00:40.949> which

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
MQB platform just like the Audi a3 which

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.740 
MQB platform just like the Audi a3 which
we<00:00:41.489> drove<00:00:41.640> recently<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.210> foot<00:00:42.420> was<00:00:42.540> really

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
we drove recently in foot was really

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.020 
we drove recently in foot was really
good<00:00:42.930> it's<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.739> bit<00:00:43.890> longer<00:00:44.100> 56<00:00:44.850> millimeters

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
good it's a bit longer 56 millimeters

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.790 
good it's a bit longer 56 millimeters
longer<00:00:45.570> than<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> previous<00:00:46.170> generation<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
longer than the previous generation and

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.290 
longer than the previous generation and
of<00:00:47.070> course<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.370> gets<00:00:47.430> completely<00:00:47.879> new<00:00:48.030> range

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
of course it gets completely new range

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.750 
of course it gets completely new range
of<00:00:48.420> engines<00:00:48.809> which<00:00:49.190> Volkswagen<00:00:50.190> claims<00:00:50.460> has

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
of engines which Volkswagen claims has

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.319 
of engines which Volkswagen claims has
made<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.469> 14%<00:00:52.469> average<00:00:53.219> improvement<00:00:53.610> over<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
made a 14% average improvement over the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.990 
made a 14% average improvement over the
entire<00:00:54.629> range<00:00:54.870> no<00:00:55.530> doubt<00:00:55.739> helped<00:00:56.070> quite<00:00:56.609> a<00:00:56.730> lot

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
entire range no doubt helped quite a lot

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.639 
entire range no doubt helped quite a lot
by<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> fact<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.840> also<00:00:58.109> 100

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
by the fact that this is also 100

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.680 
by the fact that this is also 100
kilograms<00:00:59.039> lighter<00:00:59.250> than<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.239> last<00:01:00.390> car

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
kilograms lighter than the last car

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.579 
kilograms lighter than the last car
despite<00:01:01.050> being<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.350> bit<00:01:01.500> bigger<00:01:03.199> here<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.440> are

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
despite being a bit bigger here we are

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.210 
despite being a bit bigger here we are
testing<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> 1.4<00:01:05.820> TSI<00:01:05.850> which<00:01:06.780> has<00:01:06.899> now<00:01:07.020> got

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
testing the 1.4 TSI which has now got

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.310 
testing the 1.4 TSI which has now got
138<00:01:08.220> brake<00:01:08.580> horsepower<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.990> actually

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
138 brake horsepower and it's actually

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.499 
138 brake horsepower and it's actually
completely<00:01:10.590> unrelated<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> previous<00:01:12.030> 1.4

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
completely unrelated to the previous 1.4

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.419 
completely unrelated to the previous 1.4
TSI<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.050> a<00:01:13.110> new<00:01:13.259> engine<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.590> together<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
TSI it's a new engine all together and

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.640 
TSI it's a new engine all together and
what<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.030> engine<00:01:15.390> does<00:01:15.600> get<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.409> something

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
what this engine does get is something

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.710 
what this engine does get is something
called<00:01:16.920> cylinder<00:01:17.310> deactivation<00:01:17.570> which<00:01:18.570> is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
called cylinder deactivation which is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.260 
called cylinder deactivation which is
really<00:01:19.170> clever<00:01:19.400> it<00:01:20.400> means<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.150> engine

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
really clever it means that the engine

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.880 
really clever it means that the engine
senses<00:01:21.869> when<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.080> don't<00:01:22.229> actually<00:01:22.380> need<00:01:22.710> all

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
senses when you don't actually need all

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.710 
senses when you don't actually need all
the<00:01:23.100> performance<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:23.729> give<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.600> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the performance it can give and if it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.569 
the performance it can give and if it
can<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.110> will<00:01:25.229> actually<00:01:25.380> shut<00:01:25.799> off<00:01:25.979> two<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
can it will actually shut off two of the

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.370 
can it will actually shut off two of the
cylinders<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.689> really<00:01:27.990> improves

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
cylinders and this really improves

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440 
cylinders and this really improves
economy<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.040> actually<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.490> get<00:01:29.640> combined

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
economy so actually you can get combined

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.899 
economy so actually you can get combined
mpg<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.619> engine<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.340> Volkswagen

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
mpg out of this engine so Volkswagen

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.660 
mpg out of this engine so Volkswagen
claims<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.390> over<00:01:33.689> 60<00:01:34.049> mpg<00:01:34.590> which<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.430> really

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
claims of over 60 mpg which is really

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.480 
claims of over 60 mpg which is really
impressive<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.020> also<00:01:37.200> amazing<00:01:37.920> about

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
impressive what is also amazing about

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.730 
impressive what is also amazing about
this<00:01:38.700> engine<00:01:38.880> I've<00:01:39.270> discovered<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:40.049> how

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
this engine I've discovered just how

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.670 
this engine I've discovered just how
refined<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.210> car<00:01:42.479> I'd<00:01:43.350> say<00:01:43.560> if

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
refined it is this car I'd say if

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.620 
refined it is this car I'd say if
there's<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.130> thing<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.729> has<00:01:45.270> improved

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
there's one thing that has improved

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.569 
there's one thing that has improved
dramatically<00:01:46.320> over<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.220> last<00:01:47.399> generation

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
dramatically over the last generation

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.780 
dramatically over the last generation
Golf<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.140> model<00:01:49.439> at<00:01:49.530> least<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
Golf in this model at least it is the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.910 
Golf in this model at least it is the
refinement<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.689> listen<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.590> that

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.360 

so<00:01:55.670> quiet<00:01:55.940> it's<00:01:56.540> amazing<00:01:56.930> really<00:01:57.350> good<00:01:57.650> the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
so quiet it's amazing really good the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.100 
so quiet it's amazing really good the
car<00:01:58.520> we've<00:01:58.729> got<00:01:58.909> has<00:01:59.000> also<00:01:59.150> got<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.540> 7-speed

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
car we've got has also got that 7-speed

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.550 
car we've got has also got that 7-speed
DSG<00:02:00.380> gearbox<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.370> very<00:02:01.820> good<00:02:01.970> at<00:02:02.060> ease<00:02:02.180> too

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
DSG gearbox and very good at ease too

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.780 
DSG gearbox and very good at ease too
occasionally<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.650> feels<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.979> little<00:02:04.159> bit<00:02:04.460> slow

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
occasionally it feels a little bit slow

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.210 
occasionally it feels a little bit slow
but<00:02:05.540> I<00:02:05.570> have<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.869> say<00:02:05.990> between<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:07.130> the

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
but I have to say between that and the

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.980 
but I have to say between that and the
cylinder<00:02:07.550> deactivation<00:02:07.700> which<00:02:08.360> you<00:02:08.509> really

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
cylinder deactivation which you really

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.900 
cylinder deactivation which you really
cannot<00:02:09.530> sense<00:02:09.979> at<00:02:10.280> all

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
cannot sense at all

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.570 
cannot sense at all
it's<00:02:11.360> quite<00:02:11.690> incredible<00:02:11.860> technology<00:02:12.860> this

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
it's quite incredible technology this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.030 
it's quite incredible technology this
really<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.120> very<00:02:14.420> very<00:02:14.630> smooth<00:02:15.230> powertrain

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.740 

driving<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.130> new<00:02:19.280> golf<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:20.180> does<00:02:20.450> feel<00:02:20.720> very

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
driving a new golf it does feel very

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.810 
driving a new golf it does feel very
evolutionary<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:22.010> feels<00:02:22.190> exactly<00:02:22.430> how<00:02:22.730> you

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
evolutionary it feels exactly how you

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.750 
evolutionary it feels exactly how you
would<00:02:23.030> imagine<00:02:23.270> a<00:02:23.630> new<00:02:24.080> golf<00:02:24.319> would<00:02:24.500> feel<00:02:24.800> it

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
would imagine a new golf would feel it

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.220 
would imagine a new golf would feel it
does<00:02:26.000> feel<00:02:26.239> like<00:02:26.270> it's<00:02:26.540> matured<00:02:26.870> further

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
does feel like it's matured further

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.750 
does feel like it's matured further
almost<00:02:27.950> as<00:02:28.070> if<00:02:28.190> it's<00:02:28.340> sort<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.520> edged

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
almost as if it's sort of edged

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.150 
almost as if it's sort of edged
upper-class<00:02:29.330> slightly<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.620> steering's<00:02:31.070> a

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
upper-class slightly the steering's a

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.470 
upper-class slightly the steering's a
little<00:02:31.430> bit<00:02:31.580> quicker<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.120> really<00:02:32.360> nice

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
little bit quicker but really nice

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.509 
little bit quicker but really nice
actually<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:32.989> quite<00:02:33.260> like<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.739> it's<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.280> slightly

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
actually I quite like it it's a slightly

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.860 
actually I quite like it it's a slightly
more<00:02:34.730> neutral<00:02:35.209> Drive<00:02:35.420> actually<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.810> think

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
more neutral Drive actually I think

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.020 
more neutral Drive actually I think
there's<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.110> bit<00:02:36.260> less<00:02:36.440> understood<00:02:37.070> it's<00:02:37.730> just

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
there's a bit less understood it's just

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.949 
there's a bit less understood it's just
kind<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.650> really<00:02:39.650> grippy<00:02:40.150> really<00:02:41.150> accessible

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
kind of really grippy really accessible

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.250 
kind of really grippy really accessible
really<00:02:42.860> nice<00:02:43.040> actually<00:02:43.850> this<00:02:43.970> 1.4<00:02:44.510> TSI<00:02:44.780> proper

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
really nice actually this 1.4 TSI proper

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.309 
really nice actually this 1.4 TSI proper
moves<00:02:45.560> when<00:02:45.769> you<00:02:45.890> want<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.340> it's<00:02:46.820> good

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.720 

right<00:02:50.319> quality<00:02:50.739> on<00:02:50.860> this<00:02:50.950> car<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.370> actually

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
right quality on this car is actually

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.280 
right quality on this car is actually
really<00:02:51.970> good<00:02:52.239> I<00:02:52.450> have<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:52.629> say<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:52.870> think<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.200> is

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
really good I have to say I think it is

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.020 
really good I have to say I think it is
an<00:02:53.410> improvement<00:02:53.800> it's<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.550> bit<00:02:54.700> hard<00:02:54.879> to<00:02:54.970> tell

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
an improvement it's a bit hard to tell

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.330 
an improvement it's a bit hard to tell
on<00:02:55.390> these<00:02:55.629> roads<00:02:55.870> but<00:02:56.170> it's<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.980> little<00:02:57.190> bit

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
on these roads but it's a little bit

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.280 
on these roads but it's a little bit
firm<00:02:57.670> over<00:02:58.030> things<00:02:58.239> like<00:02:58.300> expansion<00:02:58.989> joints

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
firm over things like expansion joints

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.100 
firm over things like expansion joints
and<00:02:59.410> potholes<00:03:00.239> 99%<00:03:01.239> of<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.420> time<00:03:01.629> it's<00:03:01.989> a

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
and potholes 99% of the time it's a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.780 
and potholes 99% of the time it's a
really<00:03:02.319> great<00:03:02.530> compromise<00:03:03.160> between<00:03:03.400> just

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
really great compromise between just

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.940 
really great compromise between just
being<00:03:03.959> really<00:03:04.959> comfortable<00:03:05.470> smooth<00:03:05.920> and

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
being really comfortable smooth and

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.460 
being really comfortable smooth and
settled<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.940> yet<00:03:07.569> without<00:03:07.840> too<00:03:08.049> much<00:03:08.200> body

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
settled and yet without too much body

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.380 
settled and yet without too much body
roll<00:03:08.560> it's<00:03:09.099> a<00:03:09.129> nice<00:03:09.310> car<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:09.580> drive<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:09.970> really

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
roll it's a nice car to drive it really

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.229 
roll it's a nice car to drive it really
is<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.349> scintillating<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.069> exciting<00:03:12.610> well

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
is is it scintillating and exciting well

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.979 
is is it scintillating and exciting well
no<00:03:13.360> not<00:03:13.599> really<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:16.090> new<00:03:16.239> golf<00:03:16.480> also<00:03:16.720> gets

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
no not really the new golf also gets

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.600 
no not really the new golf also gets
various<00:03:17.319> adaptive<00:03:17.739> driver<00:03:18.010> Lamont's<00:03:18.459> for<00:03:18.549> the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
various adaptive driver Lamont's for the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.729 
various adaptive driver Lamont's for the
first<00:03:18.849> time<00:03:19.060> just<00:03:19.269> like<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.599> Audi<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.470> get

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
first time just like the Audi so you get

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.890 
first time just like the Audi so you get
variable<00:03:21.130> steering<00:03:21.910> throttle<00:03:22.150> engine

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
variable steering throttle engine

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.960 
variable steering throttle engine
mapping<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.500> also<00:03:23.650> damping<00:03:24.250> as<00:03:24.370> an<00:03:24.459> option<00:03:24.849> I

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
mapping and also damping as an option I

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.910 
mapping and also damping as an option I
think<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.019> works<00:03:26.200> really<00:03:26.290> well<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.650> think

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
think it works really well I think

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.740 
think it works really well I think
basically<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.579> just<00:03:27.760> makes<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.060> golf<00:03:28.269> work

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
basically it just makes the golf work

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.839 
basically it just makes the golf work
that<00:03:29.019> little<00:03:29.319> bit<00:03:29.440> better<00:03:29.650> for<00:03:30.040> an<00:03:30.489> even

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
that little bit better for an even

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.550 
that little bit better for an even
broader<00:03:31.060> range<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.450> people<00:03:31.840> which<00:03:31.989> let's<00:03:32.500> face

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
broader range of people which let's face

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.990 
broader range of people which let's face
it<00:03:32.680> it's<00:03:32.920> exactly<00:03:33.220> what<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.459> golf<00:03:33.640> needs<00:03:33.849> to

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
it it's exactly what the golf needs to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.150 
it it's exactly what the golf needs to
do<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:36.790> new<00:03:37.030> goal<00:03:37.269> is<00:03:37.629> such<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.709> complete

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
do this new goal is such a complete

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.520 
do this new goal is such a complete
package<00:03:39.640> it's<00:03:39.910> amazing<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:40.569> really<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.319> I

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
package it's amazing it really is and I

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.259 
package it's amazing it really is and I

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
this with the Gulf the interior feels

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.970 
this with the Gulf the interior feels
classier<00:03:49.780> in<00:03:49.900> general<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.410> switch<00:03:50.620> gears<00:03:50.920> a

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
classier in general the switch gears a

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.309 
classier in general the switch gears a
bit<00:03:51.129> nicer<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.760> in<00:03:52.180> particular<00:03:52.319> this

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
bit nicer and in particular this

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.220 
bit nicer and in particular this
infotainment<00:03:53.920> system<00:03:54.489> is<00:03:54.639> amazing<00:03:55.230> pricing

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
infotainment system is amazing pricing

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.080 
infotainment system is amazing pricing
actually<00:03:56.799> doesn't<00:03:57.100> really<00:03:57.190> go<00:03:57.459> up<00:03:57.489> very<00:03:57.910> much
