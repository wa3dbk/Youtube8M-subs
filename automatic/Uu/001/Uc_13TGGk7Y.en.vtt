anyway<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.739> moving<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.640> why<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.000> need<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> fence

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
anyway so moving on why you need a fence

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.570 
anyway so moving on why you need a fence
is<00:01:03.719> because<00:01:04.110> pigs<00:01:04.710> cannot<00:01:04.979> jump<00:01:05.220> over<00:01:05.460> them

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
is because pigs cannot jump over them

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.460 
is because pigs cannot jump over them
now<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> heard<00:01:06.150> many<00:01:06.780> different<00:01:06.869> achievement

the<00:01:41.040> pig<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.340> standing<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.850> you'll<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.150> why

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the pig is standing and you'll see why

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.760 
the pig is standing and you'll see why
in<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.540> second<00:01:42.899> but<00:01:43.079> see<00:01:43.229> how<00:01:43.380> I'm<00:01:43.470> doing<00:01:43.680> this

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
in a second but see how I'm doing this

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.460 
in a second but see how I'm doing this
guys<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.220> make<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> huge<00:01:45.180> room<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.170> pig<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
guys I make a huge room for the pig to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.429 
guys I make a huge room for the pig to
fallen<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.420> watch<00:01:48.420> me<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.990> mine<00:01:49.229> this

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
fallen so watch me just like mine this

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.200 
fallen so watch me just like mine this
area<00:01:50.040> out<00:01:50.250> was<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.490> cool<00:01:50.729> machine<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.119> get

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
area out was really cool machine you get

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.450 
area out was really cool machine you get
some<00:01:51.420> steps<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.140> go<00:01:52.229> back<00:01:52.439> up<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.159> so

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
some steps so you can go back up and so

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.770 
some steps so you can go back up and so
basically<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.060> gotta<00:01:54.210> make<00:01:54.329> sure<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
basically you gotta make sure that the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.230 
basically you gotta make sure that the
pig<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.200> right<00:01:55.470> over<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.070> uh<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.640> got<00:01:57.149> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
pig is right over it and uh you got to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.289 
pig is right over it and uh you got to
leave<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:57.719> grass<00:01:58.469> block<00:01:59.159> grass<00:01:59.939> block

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
leave that one grass block grass block

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.120 
leave that one grass block grass block
here<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.600> make<00:02:00.719> sense<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.710> want<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.040> I'm

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
here that make sense like you want a I'm

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.330 
here that make sense like you want a I'm
saying<00:02:02.460> glass<00:02:02.790> grass<00:02:03.630> block<00:02:04.049> because<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.219> is

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
saying glass grass block because that is

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580 
saying glass grass block because that is
what's<00:02:05.549> keeping<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.939> peg<00:02:06.180> from<00:02:06.420> falling<00:02:06.930> such

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
what's keeping the peg from falling such

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.290 
what's keeping the peg from falling such
height<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.310> therefore<00:02:08.910> getting<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
height and therefore getting the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.510 
height and therefore getting the
achievement<00:02:09.720> because<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.080> will<00:02:10.200> cause<00:02:10.520> fall

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
achievement because it will cause fall

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.130 
achievement because it will cause fall
damage<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> pig<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.599> as<00:02:12.810> what<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
damage to the pig and as what the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.940 
damage to the pig and as what the
achievement<00:02:13.530> says<00:02:13.709> is

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
achievement says is

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.619 
achievement says is
that<00:02:14.099> so<00:02:14.520> I'm<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:14.879> another<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:15.390> little

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
from falling the set distance is that

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.050 
from falling the set distance is that
one<00:02:42.780> little<00:02:43.019> grass<00:02:43.230> layer<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.760> jump

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
one little grass layer so that you jump

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.600 
one little grass layer so that you jump
inside<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.599> corral<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.200> little<00:02:46.380> pit<00:02:46.590> give<00:02:47.549> me

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
inside the corral the little pit give me

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.360 
inside the corral the little pit give me
a<00:02:47.640> second<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.500> then<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.620> quit<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.010> saddle

dig<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.920> holes<00:02:56.220> again<00:02:57.060> start<00:02:57.269> digging<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.599> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
dig the holes again start digging in the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.270 
dig the holes again start digging in the
hole<00:02:57.900> like<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.200> floor<00:02:58.440> out<00:02:58.590> before<00:02:59.069> you<00:02:59.160> hop

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280

have to hop on it and if he doesn't go
on<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:05.940> first<00:03:06.150> try<00:03:06.420> just<00:03:06.900> spank<00:03:07.290> him<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.560> couple

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
on the first try just spank him a couple

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.470 
on the first try just spank him a couple
times<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.250> he'll<00:03:08.430> fly<00:03:08.940> down<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.360> little
