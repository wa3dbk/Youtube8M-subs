00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
talk about the types of fire

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.630 
talk about the types of fire
extinguishers<00:00:16.619> though<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:17.160> important<00:00:17.609> that

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
extinguishers though it's important that

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.790 
extinguishers though it's important that
you<00:00:17.789> understand<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.510> fire<00:00:18.869> actually<00:00:19.230> works

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
you understand how fire actually works

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.710 
you understand how fire actually works
essentially<00:00:20.670> there<00:00:21.090> are<00:00:21.119> three<00:00:21.270> elements

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
essentially there are three elements

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.200 
essentially there are three elements
that<00:00:22.140> must<00:00:22.439> be<00:00:22.590> present<00:00:22.680> for<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> fire<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.789> exist

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
that must be present for a fire to exist

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.929 
that must be present for a fire to exist
these<00:00:24.930> elements<00:00:25.439> include<00:00:25.710> oxygen<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.730> sustain

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
these elements include oxygen to sustain

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.660 
these elements include oxygen to sustain
combustion<00:00:27.660> heat<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.680> raise<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.039> material<00:00:29.519> to

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
combustion heat to raise the material to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.089 
combustion heat to raise the material to
its<00:00:29.820> ignition<00:00:29.970> temperature<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> fuel<00:00:31.740> to

its ignition temperature and fuel to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.830 
its ignition temperature and fuel to
support<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> combustion<00:00:33.149> when<00:00:33.600> these

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
support the combustion when these

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.750 
support the combustion when these
elements<00:00:34.440> combine<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.070> creates<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.489> chemical

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
elements combine it creates a chemical

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.200 
elements combine it creates a chemical
reaction<00:00:36.600> which<00:00:36.870> causes<00:00:37.320> fire<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:38.059> order<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
reaction which causes fire in order to
