00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.389

the<00:01:56.880> motorbike<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.960> about<00:01:58.050> 75

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the motorbike I get to about 75

the motorbike I get to about 75
kilometres<00:01:59.280> an<00:01:59.400> hour<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> track<00:02:00.030> which

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
kilometres an hour on the track which

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.690 
kilometres an hour on the track which
feels<00:02:01.260> pretty<00:02:01.710> amazing<00:02:02.190> I<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.520> say

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
feels pretty amazing I have to say

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:20.470

everything's<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.270> bit<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.570> blur

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.140 

I<00:02:20.769> believe<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:21.980> every<00:02:22.370> journey<00:02:22.610> should<00:02:22.790> end

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
I believe that every journey should end

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.110 
I believe that every journey should end
in<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.420> place<00:02:23.629> like<00:02:23.900> this
