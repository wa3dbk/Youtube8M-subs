00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.770 
and we could see that it's the same
thickness<00:00:58.670> it's<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.330> same<00:00:59.570> size<00:01:01.420> it<00:01:02.420> will<00:01:02.600> no

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
thickness it's the same size it will no

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.510 
thickness it's the same size it will no
longer<00:01:02.990> say<00:01:03.260> Verizon<00:01:03.800> we<00:01:04.100> can<00:01:04.220> get<00:01:04.340> rid<00:01:04.460> of

longer say Verizon we can get rid of
this<00:01:04.699> one<00:01:05.290> now<00:01:06.290> we<00:01:06.350> could<00:01:06.620> put<00:01:06.800> this<00:01:07.070> s<00:01:07.610> view

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
this one now we could put this s view

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.700 
this one now we could put this s view
case<00:01:08.630> right<00:01:08.930> on<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.170> back

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
and it's basically the same thickness

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.900 
and it's basically the same thickness
which<00:01:15.370> is<00:01:15.490> great<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:16.840> now<00:01:17.020> with<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.230> cover<00:01:17.910> one

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
I am connected to hang up I simply slide

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.620 
I am connected to hang up I simply slide
the<00:02:22.930> red<00:02:23.080> back<00:02:23.290> across<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:25.090> could<00:02:25.209> also<00:02:25.330> see

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
the red back across you could also see

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.839 
the red back across you could also see
that<00:02:25.660> it's<00:02:25.959> coming<00:02:26.170> up<00:02:26.380> with<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> message<00:02:27.250> up<00:02:27.580> on

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
like about the galaxy s4 flip cover is

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.120 
like about the galaxy s4 flip cover is
how<00:02:46.270> it<00:02:46.540> automatically<00:02:47.230> knows<00:02:47.320> it's<00:02:47.710> on<00:02:47.860> and

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
how it automatically knows it's on and

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.930 
how it automatically knows it's on and
you<00:02:48.670> don't<00:02:48.790> have<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.150> program<00:02:49.390> it

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
you don't have to program it

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.760 
you don't have to program it
one<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.420> things<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.840> don't<00:02:52.320> like<00:02:52.470> about<00:02:52.620> it

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
one of the things I don't like about it

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.990 
one of the things I don't like about it
I've<00:02:52.950> actually<00:02:53.130> played<00:02:53.400> with<00:02:53.520> this<00:02:53.760> for<00:02:53.940> quite

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
I've actually played with this for quite

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.460 
I've actually played with this for quite
some<00:02:54.270> time<00:02:54.450> already<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.840> another<00:02:55.050> phone<00:02:55.230> on

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
some time already on another phone on

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.620 
some time already on another phone on
the<00:02:55.560> AT&amp;T<00:02:55.860> s4<00:02:56.400> one<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.240> things<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.570> don't

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
the AT&amp;T s4 one of the things I don't

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.480 
the AT&amp;T s4 one of the things I don't
like<00:02:58.020> about<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:58.800> feel<00:02:59.190> like<00:02:59.340> there

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
like about it is I feel like there

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.890 
like about it is I feel like there
should<00:02:59.520> be<00:02:59.670> some<00:02:59.880> sort<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.120> magnetic<00:03:00.360> lock

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
should be some sort of magnetic lock

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.260 
should be some sort of magnetic lock
here<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.160> when<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.340> close<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:03.000> stays

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
here so that when you close it it stays

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.470 
here so that when you close it it stays
closed<00:03:03.660> because<00:03:04.760> every<00:03:05.760> once<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.090> while<00:03:06.270> it

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
closed because every once in a while it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.180 
closed because every once in a while it
pops<00:03:06.690> open<00:03:06.900> without<00:03:07.170> me<00:03:07.320> wanting<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:07.830> or<00:03:08.070> it

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
pops open without me wanting it to or it

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.070 
pops open without me wanting it to or it
just<00:03:08.220> sits<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.700> little<00:03:08.820> bit<00:03:08.940> above<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.300> so<00:03:10.050> I

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
just sits a little bit above it so I

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.770 
just sits a little bit above it so I
think<00:03:10.230> ultimately<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.220> s-view<00:03:12.090> flip<00:03:12.510> cover

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
think ultimately the s-view flip cover

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.650 
think ultimately the s-view flip cover
is<00:03:12.990> an<00:03:13.260> awesome<00:03:13.830> idea<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:15.180> think<00:03:15.240> it's<00:03:15.510> been

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
is an awesome idea and I think it's been

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.510 
is an awesome idea and I think it's been
executed<00:03:16.140> really<00:03:16.380> well<00:03:16.590> but<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.280> would<00:03:17.400> be

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
executed really well but it would be

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.220 
executed really well but it would be
great<00:03:17.790> if<00:03:18.000> there<00:03:18.120> was<00:03:18.240> at<00:03:18.360> least<00:03:18.390> something<00:03:18.870> to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
great if there was at least something to

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.990 
great if there was at least something to
keep<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.530> closed<00:03:19.830> other<00:03:20.280> than<00:03:20.490> just<00:03:20.700> its<00:03:20.880> own

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
keep it closed other than just its own

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.790 
keep it closed other than just its own
