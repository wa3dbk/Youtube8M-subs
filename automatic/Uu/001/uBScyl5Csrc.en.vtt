00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.910
 good how about how everyone is out there 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.920
 is going with a new tutorial that in 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.830
 reality is a very fast thing for 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.630
 show this plugin very good as already 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.430
 You will see that what is here in the 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.099
 screen is not done effectively 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.640
 called controls and good as you know 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.439
 practically now between the after and 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.250
 over or also in total 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.250
 interconnectivity 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.830
 question of getting to learn which 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.960
 also because good everything can be done 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.540
 between one or another program or that 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.190
 center 2 so you need are good or 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.380
 bad news for you but very bad 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.390
 they are going down the 4d cinema that 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.700
 are creating what 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.399
 and good here I can buy it buy by 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.040
 course and good and see each other 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.660
 because the truth that solves many 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.269
 things 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:08.200
 and for example what he has shown and is 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.840
 this plugin that is very easy and what 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.800
 is to take a logo that is made in 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.400
 illustrator in vectors and transform it 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.260
 something in 3d or with this volume things 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.570
 that before there was not a loquillos means 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.250
 with the cherries afterwards it would be a way 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.740
 not only with cinema that also the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.509
 favorite but now with this is 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.259
 just a plugin like all 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.670
 as always includes solution to life 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.290
 so let's quickly show how it 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.710
 use to be clear that they have to have 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.539
 the cinema 4d 13 on everything that is not 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.350
 it's convenient that I start with him 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.830
 a version 13 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.630
 because almost all the plugins that come 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.850
 lately they are degrading for this 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.799
 later version that is the 14th 15th 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.900
 so do not boot with a version 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.530
 previous to 13 because it's going to point you 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.110
 nothing like this could happen with this plugin 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.450
 well I think 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.260
 let's show is better than this logo 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.320
 from the web 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.480
 Amsterdam I do not have the most remote one says a 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.220
 football club that is triple that gives me 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.250
 a certain confidence if methods 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.940
 holland sounds like a festichola but good 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.520
 that what I found that more to catch is the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.190
 what would be better to show 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.900
 locality as you see here we have the logo and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.620
 it is then divided into all 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.110
 layers that the graphic design used 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.240
 to be able to create it good having this 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.860
 then what we have to do if what 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.860
 we have in another format is to record it 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.379
 and now I'm low on a man and have to 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.379
 choose this option which is that of 36 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.540
 this they leave cost we give ok ok we open 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.439
 our 4d cinema 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.689
 and good in here in the info of the video or in 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.370
 the post of the blog where you can 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.950
 download once they were downloaded 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.659
 like all 4d cinema plugins I 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.780
 they have to be in which to copy 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.730
 directly in the plugins folder 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.519
 clarified that it is also free this 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.810
 be over do not charge it with what we 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.000
 there are people at the end of the year will have to do 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.370
 a gift something good once you're 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.590
 installed we have already here to the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.370
 plugins folder we will look at 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.460
 this place and we choose offset 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.890
 yes, no 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.360
 well one that we are close we are going to two 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.020
 of the three little dots like to go to 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.020
 look for the logo 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.260
 and we bring it and as you see, it appears 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.760
 as it appeared before but I presi 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.790
 directly with all layers 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.560
 separated thing that is good barbarian what 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.190
 what we are is to give volume for that 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.310
 we have this option here I destroyed 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.970
 and we see that we can give volume that 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.610
 we want 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.000
 and like everything existing plane we have to 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.000
 finish 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.770
 and here we separate what would be the layers 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.409
 at least so that it is not so rough and 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.409
 we finish with 75 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:21.320
 good and if we wanted we could go here 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.320
 here to choose this option 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.849
 and we can destroy as we know a little 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.619
 more the thing 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:39.309
 good a preview 

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:42.129
 spectacular 3 click and that's it 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:44.800
 I imagine since after this it's going to 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:46.599
 be when the client does not ask you to 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.990
 says please I'll write the year 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.390
 and the guy says I'm sending you in 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.990
 band in him 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.810
 from jpg of 100% and pretend that with that 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.180
 we make a super animation that goes to 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.350
 be only problem but then if one 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.020
 get to have the logo in illustrator 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.700
 as we see we share it to three of 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.650
 they cagamos of laughter three days followed 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.290
 since we can do the animation that 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.440
 we want good that was all very fast 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:16.710
 the thing that they charge me has had another 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.450
 option that is to import that the 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.480
 what difference it makes is that it brings the logo 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.730
 and bring us the layers separately in case 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.560
 say we do not want to destroy a 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.870
 different way or have more control 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.200
 about that would be how you worked before 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.030
 with that there are tutorials on the web of 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.980
 this total I found it seeing also 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.120
 tutorials so he also entered another 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.100
 person who explains that explains that 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.680
 and something that I forgot is that we 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.310
 if we want to work the materials of 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.160
 this logo we would have to go here a 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.310
 object 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.810
 and materials and they are going to appear 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.880
 materials created things that we 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.880
 We will work with materials 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.639
 if we wanted to change him to put the 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.330
 brightness 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.330
 and here 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.360
 with all those wonderful things 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.440
 so good people this was all for today 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.090
 quick brief but pretty good them 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.050
 I send a greeting say in the next 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.050
 tutor rivers
