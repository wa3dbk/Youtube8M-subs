corner down is not going to migrate

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.370 
corner down is not going to migrate
through<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.550> photo<00:00:35.910> corner<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.630> eventually

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
through the photo corner and eventually

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.889 
through the photo corner and eventually
damage<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.920> artwork<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> way<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:39.750> do

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
damage your artwork so the way we do

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.889 
damage your artwork so the way we do
this<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.620> start<00:00:40.950> out<00:00:41.070> by<00:00:41.270> creating<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
this is we start out by creating what is

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.279 
this is we start out by creating what is
normally<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.950> standard<00:00:44.760> paper<00:00:45.329> photo<00:00:45.809> corner

a canvas that goes into the plane you

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.720 
a canvas that goes into the plane you
can<00:03:32.140> see<00:03:32.350> why<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.590> adhesive<00:03:33.250> won't<00:03:33.490> go

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
can see why the adhesive won't go

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.170 
can see why the adhesive won't go
through<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.680> hurt<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.830> canvas<00:03:36.250> but<00:03:36.880> I<00:03:36.940> like

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
through and hurt the canvas but I like
