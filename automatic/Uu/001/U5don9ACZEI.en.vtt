I ended on the same set the end of the

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.210 
I ended on the same set the end of the
journey<00:06:08.490> so<00:06:08.880> it's<00:06:09.030> a<00:06:09.090> complete<00:06:09.330> cycle<00:06:10.220> I've

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
journey so it's a complete cycle I've

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.160 
journey so it's a complete cycle I've
actually<00:06:11.400> got<00:06:11.700> two<00:06:12.060> the<00:06:12.360> first<00:06:12.540> one<00:06:12.750> would<00:06:12.960> be

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
actually got two the first one would be

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.950 
actually got two the first one would be
in<00:06:13.440> the<00:06:14.190> first<00:06:14.430> movie<00:06:14.850> when<00:06:15.120> I<00:06:15.240> sounded<00:06:15.630> like<00:06:15.750> I

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
in the first movie when I sounded like I

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.010 
in the first movie when I sounded like I
just<00:06:16.290> swallowed<00:06:16.590> a<00:06:16.620> load<00:06:16.740> of<00:06:16.860> helium<00:06:17.480> and<00:06:18.480> said

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
just swallowed a load of helium and said

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.510 
just swallowed a load of helium and said
honestly<00:06:19.470> woman<00:06:19.800> you<00:06:19.860> call<00:06:20.010> yourself<00:06:20.340> our

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
honestly woman you call yourself our

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.980 
honestly woman you call yourself our
mother<00:06:20.760> so<00:06:21.450> I<00:06:21.480> remember<00:06:21.660> being<00:06:21.780> really

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
mother so I remember being really

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.630 
mother so I remember being really
excited<00:06:22.230> if<00:06:22.740> I<00:06:22.830> said<00:06:23.130> that's<00:06:23.310> my<00:06:23.430> mom<00:06:23.610> I

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
excited if I said that's my mom I

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.480 
excited if I said that's my mom I
probably<00:06:23.850> be<00:06:24.000> ducking<00:06:24.270> for<00:06:24.450> a<00:06:24.480> smack<00:06:24.810> so<00:06:25.490> my

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
probably be ducking for a smack so my

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.040 
probably be ducking for a smack so my
second<00:06:26.790> one<00:06:26.910> would<00:06:27.030> be<00:06:27.090> mischief<00:06:27.690> managed

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
second one would be mischief managed

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.810 
second one would be mischief managed
which<00:06:28.770> I<00:06:28.890> think<00:06:29.070> sums<00:06:29.280> up<00:06:29.400> the<00:06:29.460> characters

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
which I think sums up the characters

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.810 
which I think sums up the characters
pretty<00:06:30.030> well<00:06:30.470> I<00:06:31.470> think<00:06:31.830> my<00:06:32.190> favorite<00:06:32.790> line

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
pretty well I think my favorite line

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.570 
pretty well I think my favorite line
would<00:06:33.420> be<00:06:33.450> in<00:06:33.930> Deathly<00:06:34.740> Hallows<00:06:34.800> Part<00:06:34.950> 1<00:06:35.220> when

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
would be in Deathly Hallows Part 1 when

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.260 
would be in Deathly Hallows Part 1 when

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.400 
uncomfortable moment I think for Harry T
to<00:06:46.830> go<00:06:46.950> through

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
to go through

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.540

fewer<00:06:50.790> lines<00:06:51.000> than<00:06:51.240> that<00:06:51.420> so<00:06:51.660> I<00:06:51.690> don't<00:06:51.810> know

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
fewer lines than that so I don't know

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.610 
fewer lines than that so I don't know
where<00:06:52.890> die<00:06:52.980> puts<00:06:53.220> me<00:06:53.510> I'd<00:06:54.510> say<00:06:54.780> mad<00:06:55.050> eyes<00:06:55.200> dead
