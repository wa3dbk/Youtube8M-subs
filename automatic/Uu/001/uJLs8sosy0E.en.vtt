in<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> water<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.510> make<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.809> ill<00:00:40.020> or

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
in the water that can make you ill or

is<00:00:43.700> boiling<00:00:44.700> enough<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.809> how<00:00:46.110> long<00:00:46.350> you

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
is boiling enough and if so how long you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
is boiling enough and if so how long you
need<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.770> boil<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.219> well<00:00:47.640> that's<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.210> I'm

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
need to boil for well that's what I'm

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.459 
need to boil for well that's what I'm
going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> share<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.260> video

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
going to share with you in this video

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.319 
going to share with you in this video
and<00:00:49.860> you'll<00:00:50.039> go<00:00:50.250> away<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> very<00:00:50.969> clear

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and you'll go away with a very clear

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.240 
and you'll go away with a very clear
understanding<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.649> need<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.949> do

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.700 

this<00:01:00.180> stream<00:01:00.540> here<00:01:00.810> may<00:01:01.050> seem<00:01:01.380> like<00:01:01.560> an

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
this stream here may seem like an

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.250 
this stream here may seem like an
unlikely<00:01:01.800> source<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.760> drinking<00:01:03.150> water<00:01:03.360> it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
unlikely source of drinking water it

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.590 
unlikely source of drinking water it
actually<00:01:04.620> looks<00:01:04.890> quite<00:01:05.010> clear<00:01:05.610> though<00:01:05.940> but

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
actually looks quite clear though but

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600 
actually looks quite clear though but
it's<00:01:06.750> small<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.560> muddy<00:01:07.860> bottom<00:01:08.310> there's

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
it's small it's muddy bottom there's

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.150 
it's small it's muddy bottom there's
lots<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.970> insects<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.800> lots<00:01:10.800> of<00:01:11.010> little

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
lots of insects in it lots of little

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.010 
lots of insects in it lots of little
shrimp<00:01:11.490> swimming<00:01:12.090> around<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:12.840> there's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
shrimp swimming around in it and there's

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.780 
shrimp swimming around in it and there's
dragonflies<00:01:13.620> and<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:13.950> sorts<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.340> things<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
dragonflies and all sorts of things and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.670 
dragonflies and all sorts of things and
also<00:01:15.150> there<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.360> lots<00:01:15.660> of<00:01:15.780> deer<00:01:16.050> in<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.350> area

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
also there are lots of deer in this area

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.620 
also there are lots of deer in this area
and<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:17.430> over<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.090> deer<00:01:18.300> prints

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and just over here there are deer prints

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.850 
and just over here there are deer prints
where<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> deer<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.260> clearly<00:01:19.560> walked

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
where the deer have clearly walked

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.820 
where the deer have clearly walked
through<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:21.119> stream<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.380> safely

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
through the the stream so we can safely

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.590 
through the the stream so we can safely
assume<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:24.000> safe<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.360> drink

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
assume that this is not safe to drink

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.230 
assume that this is not safe to drink
but<00:01:25.320> how<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.800> make<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.100> safe<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.000> key

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
but how do we make it safe and the key

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450 
but how do we make it safe and the key
question<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.020> boiling<00:01:28.740> enough<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.280> make

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
question is is boiling enough to make

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.820 
question is is boiling enough to make
this<00:01:29.610> safe<00:01:29.940> well<00:01:30.630> provided<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.440> waters

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
this safe well provided the waters

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.590 
this safe well provided the waters
visibly<00:01:32.310> clean<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.940> doesn't<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.270> lots<00:01:33.450> of

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
visibly clean and doesn't have lots of

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.389 
visibly clean and doesn't have lots of
turbidity<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.500> don't<00:01:34.530> need<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.160> filter

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
turbidity in it we don't need to filter

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.190 
turbidity in it we don't need to filter
any<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.850> particulate<00:01:36.420> matter<00:01:36.690> out<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
any of that particulate matter out and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.440 
any of that particulate matter out and
we<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.860> simply<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.729> boil<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.210> water

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
we can simply then just boil the water

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.010 
we can simply then just boil the water
and<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.500> will<00:01:40.680> kill<00:01:40.890> all<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.369> pathogenic

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
and that will kill all the pathogenic

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.570 
and that will kill all the pathogenic
organisms<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:43.470> including<00:01:44.250> things<00:01:44.520> like

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
organisms in there including things like

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.770 
organisms in there including things like
Giardia<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.360> Cryptosporidium<00:01:46.640> any

waterborne viruses such as hepatitis A
as<00:01:51.869> well<00:01:52.080> will<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.259> killed<00:01:52.590> by<00:01:52.800> that<00:01:53.009> hepatitis

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
as well will be killed by that hepatitis

as well will be killed by that hepatitis
A<00:01:53.910> is<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.420> viruses<00:01:54.840> which<00:01:55.229> is

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
you're working at altitude then it can

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.670 
you're working at altitude then it can
be<00:02:50.970> worth<00:02:51.209> boiling<00:02:51.720> your<00:02:51.840> water<00:02:52.079> for<00:02:52.440> longer

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
be worth boiling your water for longer

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.229 
be worth boiling your water for longer
because<00:02:52.980> water<00:02:53.459> boils<00:02:53.910> at<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.120> lower

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
because water boils at a lower

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.630 
because water boils at a lower
temperature<00:02:54.720> as<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.590> air<00:02:55.739> pressure<00:02:55.920> drops<00:02:56.430> as

temperature as the air pressure drops as

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.120 
temperature as the air pressure drops as

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
you go up in altitude that will mean

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.039 
you go up in altitude that will mean
that<00:02:59.160> water<00:02:59.549> will<00:02:59.850> boil<00:03:00.180> at<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.630> temperature

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
that water will boil at the temperature

that water will boil at the temperature
below<00:03:01.230> 100<00:03:01.890> degrees<00:03:02.190> Celsius<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.820> therefore
