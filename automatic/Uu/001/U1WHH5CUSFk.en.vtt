00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
obvious these three are matt irres um

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.620 
obvious these three are matt irres um
and<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:59.189> even<00:01:59.399> then<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.880> know<00:01:59.939> garnet<00:02:00.450> says

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and but even then you know garnet says

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.330 
and but even then you know garnet says
you<00:02:00.780> know<00:02:00.899> alright<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.560> trust<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.040> Steve<00:02:02.250> and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
you know alright I trust you Steve and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.190 
you know alright I trust you Steve and
I'll<00:02:02.490> give<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.939> chance<00:02:03.180> maybe<00:02:03.570> because

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
I'll give you a chance maybe because

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.429 
I'll give you a chance maybe because
Rose<00:02:04.979> did<00:02:05.250> than<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> past<00:02:05.729> two<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.140> mean

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
Rose did than the past two but I mean

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.719 
Rose did than the past two but I mean
chances<00:02:07.649> are<00:02:07.950> they've<00:02:08.129> been<00:02:08.280> trained<00:02:08.580> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
chances are they've been trained to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.400 
chances are they've been trained to
learn<00:02:08.940> how<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.149> stop<00:02:09.509> these<00:02:09.750> things<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.349> they

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
learn how to stop these things and they

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.320 
learn how to stop these things and they
don't<00:02:10.560> technically<00:02:11.280> kill<00:02:11.610> um<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.910> mean<00:02:12.090> they

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
don't technically kill um I mean they

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.700 
don't technically kill um I mean they
they<00:02:12.420> put<00:02:12.600> them<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.260> jewel<00:02:13.560> or

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
they put them in the the jewel or

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.170 
they put them in the the jewel or
whatever<00:02:13.980> but<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.220> could<00:02:14.580> argue<00:02:14.670> that's<00:02:14.940> even

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
whatever but you could argue that's even

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.520 
whatever but you could argue that's even
worse<00:02:15.330> we<00:02:15.510> don't<00:02:15.720> know<00:02:15.810> what<00:02:15.960> it's<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.320> be

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
worse we don't know what it's like to be

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
gonna go on with a chips gonna fact that

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.830 
gonna go on with a chips gonna fact that
they<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:38.040> be<00:02:38.130> trained<00:02:38.400> at<00:02:38.550> all<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:39.120> also<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.630> big
