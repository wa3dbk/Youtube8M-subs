in<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:46.539> US<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:47.170> think<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.280> what<00:01:48.429> separates

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
in the US I think that what separates

in the US I think that what separates
the<00:01:49.119> Oasis<00:01:49.420> of<00:01:49.539> hope<00:01:49.600> from<00:01:49.960> any<00:01:50.350> other

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
the Oasis of hope from any other

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.309 
the Oasis of hope from any other
institution<00:01:51.569> that's<00:01:52.569> treating<00:01:52.959> cancer

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
institution that's treating cancer

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.169 
institution that's treating cancer
around<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.709> world<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:54.369> not<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.880> we<00:01:55.030> use

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
around the world is not that we use

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.510 
around the world is not that we use
alternatives<00:01:55.899> which<00:01:56.649> we<00:01:56.829> do<00:01:57.009> very

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
alternatives which we do very

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.160 
alternatives which we do very
effectively<00:01:57.810> what<00:01:58.810> separates<00:01:59.350> us<00:01:59.530> is<00:01:59.860> that

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
effectively what separates us is that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.160 
effectively what separates us is that
philosophically<00:02:02.170> we<00:02:03.039> are<00:02:03.310> not<00:02:04.170> fighting

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
philosophically we are not fighting

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.669

and at the spiritual level based on two

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.430 
and at the spiritual level based on two
principles<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.459> first<00:02:30.700> principle<00:02:31.440> was

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
principles the first principle was

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.710 
principles the first principle was
stated<00:02:33.250> by<00:02:33.430> Hippocrates<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:34.239> father<00:02:34.420> of

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
stated by Hippocrates the father of

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.490 
stated by Hippocrates the father of
Medicine<00:02:35.160> who<00:02:36.160> said<00:02:36.459> first<00:02:37.000> do<00:02:37.480> no<00:02:37.900> harm

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
Medicine who said first do no harm

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.379 
Medicine who said first do no harm
so<00:02:38.980> our<00:02:39.069> first<00:02:39.340> principle<00:02:39.609> is<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.000> we<00:02:40.180> are

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.389 
so our first principle is that we are

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.090 
so our first principle is that we are
going<00:02:40.630> every<00:02:41.079> therapy<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.620> we're<00:02:41.829> going<00:02:42.010> to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
going every therapy that we're going to

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.370 
going every therapy that we're going to
use<00:02:42.400> we're<00:02:43.120> going<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.450> use<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.780> as<00:02:43.930> long<00:02:44.139> as<00:02:44.170> we

use we're going to use it as long as we
are<00:02:44.739> convinced<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.370> it's<00:02:45.760> going<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.090> help

patients and the second principle was

patients and the second principle was

your presentation today to the patients

your presentation today to the patients
and<00:03:53.949> myself<00:03:54.599> they<00:03:55.599> do<00:03:55.930> shrinks<00:03:56.560> oh<00:03:56.709> yes<00:03:56.949> yes

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
and myself they do shrinks oh yes yes

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.629 
and myself they do shrinks oh yes yes
definitely<00:03:59.349> but<00:03:59.829> that's<00:04:00.069> not<00:04:00.370> what's

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
definitely but that's not what's

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.129 
definitely but that's not what's
important<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.120> us<00:04:01.269> because<00:04:01.419> there<00:04:01.750> are<00:04:01.840> many

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
important to us because there are many

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.360 
important to us because there are many
therapies<00:04:02.590> that<00:04:02.739> shrink<00:04:02.949> the<00:04:03.069> tumors<00:04:03.340> that

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
therapies that shrink the tumors that

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.249 
therapies that shrink the tumors that
that<00:04:03.669> the<00:04:03.790> patient<00:04:04.120> dies<00:04:04.269> from<00:04:04.930> us<00:04:05.079> what's

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:05.259 
that the patient dies from us what's

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.939 
that the patient dies from us what's
important<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.889> patient<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.280> alive<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:08.049> in

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
important is the patient is alive so in

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.860 
important is the patient is alive so in
many<00:04:09.370> cases<00:04:09.489> of<00:04:10.000> course<00:04:10.180> we<00:04:10.419> need<00:04:10.569> to<00:04:10.720> reduce

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
many cases of course we need to reduce

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.949 
many cases of course we need to reduce
tumor<00:04:11.349> mass<00:04:11.609> that's<00:04:12.609> very<00:04:12.879> important<00:04:13.359> for<00:04:13.419> for

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
tumor mass that's very important for for

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.409 
tumor mass that's very important for for
us<00:04:14.079> and<00:04:14.319> obviously<00:04:14.709> for<00:04:15.639> the<00:04:15.819> survivability

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
us and obviously for the survivability

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.520 
us and obviously for the survivability
of<00:04:16.859> our<00:04:17.859> patients<00:04:18.310> but<00:04:19.180> still<00:04:19.509> that<00:04:20.079> is<00:04:20.289> not

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
of our patients but still that is not

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.249 
of our patients but still that is not
our<00:04:20.829> main<00:04:21.130> aim<00:04:21.430> our<00:04:21.940> main<00:04:22.180> goal<00:04:22.570> is<00:04:22.840> that<00:04:23.139> the

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
our main aim our main goal is that the

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.409 
our main aim our main goal is that the
patient<00:04:23.409> survives<00:04:24.159> for<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.520> long<00:04:24.880> time<00:04:25.180> with

patient survives for a long time with

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.689 
patient survives for a long time with
one<00:04:25.449> p<00:04:25.870> of<00:04:25.960> life<00:04:26.139> right<00:04:26.440> and<00:04:27.220> you're<00:04:27.400> doing

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
one p of life right and you're doing

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.040 
one p of life right and you're doing
three<00:04:28.000> really<00:04:28.270> interesting<00:04:28.630> things<00:04:28.870> either

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
three really interesting things either

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.680 
three really interesting things either
to<00:04:29.289> prep<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.530> patient<00:04:30.099> to<00:04:30.789> be<00:04:30.940> really<00:04:31.270> resilient

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
to prep a patient to be really resilient

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.899 
to prep a patient to be really resilient
to<00:04:32.199> the<00:04:32.919> side<00:04:33.099> effects<00:04:33.370> of<00:04:33.520> chemo<00:04:33.820> and

to the side effects of chemo and

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.089 
to the side effects of chemo and
radiation<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:35.050> increase<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.830> efficacy

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099

of chemo and radiation and and those

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.459 
of chemo and radiation and and those
three<00:04:39.639> things<00:04:39.669> also<00:04:40.120> have<00:04:40.659> the<00:04:40.900> power<00:04:41.110> to

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:41.469 
three things also have the power to

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
message is that cancer does not have to

message is that cancer does not have to
be<00:05:59.050> a<00:05:59.080> death<00:05:59.530> sentence<00:06:00.160> you<00:06:00.850> can<00:06:01.000> change<00:06:01.300> them

wasn't<00:06:41.800> a<00:06:41.980> big<00:06:42.130> deal<00:06:42.340> I<00:06:42.550> think

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
wasn't a big deal I think

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.550 
wasn't a big deal I think
probably<00:06:44.450> have<00:06:44.570> tumors<00:06:44.960> and<00:06:45.110> don't<00:06:45.260> yell<00:06:45.380> it

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
probably have tumors and don't yell it

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.890 
probably have tumors and don't yell it
so<00:06:45.860> it's<00:06:46.550> only<00:06:46.700> a<00:06:46.820> problem<00:06:47.060> when<00:06:47.210> we<00:06:47.420> when<00:06:47.780> we

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
so it's only a problem when we when we

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.410 
so it's only a problem when we when we
choose<00:06:48.110> to<00:06:48.170> let<00:06:48.560> it<00:06:48.710> when<00:06:48.950> it<00:06:49.100> let<00:06:49.640> it<00:06:49.730> own<00:06:49.880> us<00:06:50.120> a

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
choose to let it when it let it own us a

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.020 
choose to let it when it let it own us a
lot<00:06:51.110> of<00:06:51.230> times<00:06:51.470> right<00:06:51.770> so<00:06:52.070> except<00:06:52.520> I'm<00:06:52.970> really

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030
