two<00:00:04.200> years<00:00:04.410> ago<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.710> some<00:00:05.160> while<00:00:05.370> blackberry

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
two years ago to some while blackberry

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.310 
two years ago to some while blackberry
and<00:00:07.849> this<00:00:08.849> grows<00:00:09.120> wild<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.540> our<00:00:09.660> backyard<00:00:10.200> and

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
and this grows wild in our backyard and

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.249 
and this grows wild in our backyard and
usually<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.889> have<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.130> keep<00:00:11.280> it<00:00:11.429> down<00:00:11.610> by<00:00:11.910> just

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
usually I have to keep it down by just

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.379 
usually I have to keep it down by just
trimming<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.440> out<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.980> cutting<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.880> when<00:00:15.240> it's

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
trimming it out and cutting it when it's

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.050 
trimming it out and cutting it when it's
early<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.130> that<00:00:17.130> keeps<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.490> out<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.760> garden

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
early and that keeps it out of garden

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.760 
early and that keeps it out of garden
but<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.270> thought<00:00:18.480> three<00:00:18.720> years<00:00:18.900> ago<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.289> might<00:00:19.710> as

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
but I thought three years ago I might as

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.590 
but I thought three years ago I might as
well<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:20.070> see<00:00:20.850> if<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> can<00:00:21.090> let<00:00:21.240> some<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.510> this

steaks and I put them kind of along a
straight<00:00:37.530> line<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.250> make<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.399> little<00:00:38.640> short

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
straight line to make a little short

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.580 
straight line to make a little short
hedge<00:00:40.160> along<00:00:41.160> our<00:00:41.430> garden<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.840> two<00:00:43.320> years<00:00:43.530> ago

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
hedge along our garden and two years ago

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.799 
hedge along our garden and two years ago
I<00:00:43.860> started<00:00:44.059> just<00:00:45.059> letting<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> blackberry

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I started just letting the blackberry

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.220 
I started just letting the blackberry
grow<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.379> then<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.530> would<00:00:46.710> lay<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.610> blackberry

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
grow and then I would lay the blackberry

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.430 
grow and then I would lay the blackberry
along<00:00:49.230> these<00:00:49.980> little<00:00:50.460> posts<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:52.020> put<00:00:52.230> these

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
along these little posts and put these

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.740 
along these little posts and put these
posts<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.399> laid<00:00:53.640> him<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> lengthwise

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
posts in I just laid him in lengthwise

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.099 
posts in I just laid him in lengthwise
and<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:56.129> first<00:00:56.370> year<00:00:56.640> they<00:00:57.570> grew<00:00:57.750> pretty

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
and the first year they grew pretty

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.599 
and the first year they grew pretty
nicely<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:58.739> nothing<00:00:59.190> flowered<00:00:59.670> whatsoever<00:01:00.469> I

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
nicely but nothing flowered whatsoever I

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.920 
nicely but nothing flowered whatsoever I
think<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.760> first<00:01:03.030> year<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.690> were<00:01:03.719> just

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
think that first year they were just

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.450 
think that first year they were just
establishing<00:01:04.500> themselves<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.159> then<00:01:05.280> this

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
establishing themselves and then this

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.090 
establishing themselves and then this
year<00:01:05.840> what<00:01:06.840> happened<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.320> off<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.500> those<00:01:07.770> main

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
year what happened is off of those main

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.300 
year what happened is off of those main
stalks<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.909> ended<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.299> with<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.920> ton<00:01:11.280> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
stalks we ended up with just a ton of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.570 
stalks we ended up with just a ton of
secondary<00:01:12.299> shoots<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> secondary

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
grow wild and just kind of trained it so

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.170 
grow wild and just kind of trained it so
it<00:03:31.650> would<00:03:31.769> go<00:03:31.920> along<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.489> fit<00:03:32.639> in<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.850> garden
