that<00:02:03.170> binds<00:02:03.410> on<00:02:03.650> for<00:02:03.860> many<00:02:03.950> many<00:02:04.190> seconds<00:02:04.700> it's

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
that binds on for many many seconds it's

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:15.760 
that binds on for many many seconds it's
a<00:02:05.570> very<00:02:05.840> very<00:02:05.930> dangerous<00:02:06.290> place<00:02:06.680> today

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.310 

at<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.550> moment<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:17.120> can't<00:02:17.450> see<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.750> HGVs

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
at the moment I can't see the HGVs

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.190 
at the moment I can't see the HGVs
mirrors<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:20.000> there's<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.240> fair<00:02:20.480> chance<00:02:20.510> that

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
mirrors so there's a fair chance that

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:30.020 
mirrors so there's a fair chance that

minute and while you're doing that you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.640 
minute and while you're doing that you
lose<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.790> huge<00:02:48.000> amount<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.360> visibility<00:02:51.590> on<00:02:52.590> a

lose a huge amount of visibility on a
bend<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.160> it's<00:02:53.550> easy<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:54.000> cut<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
bend like this it's easy to cut the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.320 
bend like this it's easy to cut the
corner<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.780> cut<00:02:54.959> off<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.290> cyclone<00:02:55.739> or<00:02:55.860> what

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
corner and cut off the cyclone or what

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.580 
corner and cut off the cyclone or what
ideally<00:02:57.330> vehicles<00:02:58.020> should<00:02:58.080> follow<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
ideally vehicles should follow the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.110 
ideally vehicles should follow the
fender<00:02:58.890> line<00:02:59.040> rather<00:02:59.400> than<00:02:59.550> cotton<00:02:59.940> the

fender line rather than cotton the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.270 
fender line rather than cotton the
corner<00:03:00.450> I'm<00:03:01.260> always<00:03:01.530> trying<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.920> leave<00:03:02.040> those

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
corner I'm always trying to leave those

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.740 
corner I'm always trying to leave those
a<00:03:02.310> meter<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.760> half<00:03:02.790> between<00:03:03.150> me<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
a meter and a half between me and the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.810 
a meter and a half between me and the
characters<00:03:04.290> for<00:03:04.590> many<00:03:04.739> reasons<00:03:05.130> cyclist

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
characters for many reasons cyclist

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.360 
characters for many reasons cyclist
can't<00:03:06.060> always<00:03:06.330> follow<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.900> straight<00:03:07.170> line<00:03:07.370> yeah

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
can't always follow a straight line yeah

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.520 
can't always follow a straight line yeah
and<00:03:08.550> these<00:03:08.760> big<00:03:09.060> vehicles<00:03:09.600> they<00:03:09.959> can<00:03:10.140> not<00:03:10.320> only

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
and these big vehicles they can not only

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.770 
and these big vehicles they can not only
intimidate<00:03:11.130> cycles<00:03:11.640> but<00:03:12.030> they<00:03:12.209> can<00:03:12.390> generate

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
intimidate cycles but they can generate

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.660 
intimidate cycles but they can generate
a<00:03:12.840> all<00:03:13.260> other<00:03:13.320> turbulence<00:03:14.100> as<00:03:14.250> well<00:03:14.459> when

a all other turbulence as well when
they're<00:03:14.700> moving<00:03:15.060> fast<00:03:15.300> if<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.959> lights<00:03:16.170> are

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
they're moving fast if the lights are

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.990 
they're moving fast if the lights are
just<00:03:16.500> turned<00:03:16.739> red<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.190> can<00:03:17.370> feel<00:03:17.489> confident

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
just turned red I can feel confident

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.180 
just turned red I can feel confident

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
and but I just still attacked that he

felt if the lights have been read for

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.259 
felt if the lights have been read for

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
quite some time there's no way I would

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.870 
quite some time there's no way I would
have<00:03:30.360> gone<00:03:30.510> up<00:03:30.690> on<00:03:30.989> his<00:03:31.200> inside<00:03:31.650> because<00:03:32.069> the

lights could have changed to green he

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.680 
lights could have changed to green he

body of the vehicle whereas with an
articulator<00:04:34.120> V<00:04:34.330> because<00:04:34.540> as<00:04:34.630> it<00:04:34.660> turns<00:04:34.810> your

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
articulator V because as it turns your

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.680 
articulator V because as it turns your
mirror<00:04:35.800> turns<00:04:36.100> in<00:04:36.310> on<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.970> vehicle<00:04:37.330> and

correct and that's how quickly it

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.070 
correct and that's how quickly it
happens<00:05:13.819> and<00:05:14.000> how<00:05:14.120> quickly<00:05:14.389> collisions<00:05:14.900> can

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
happens and how quickly collisions can

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.839 
happens and how quickly collisions can
be<00:05:15.169> gold<00:05:15.380> okay<00:05:15.919> he's<00:05:16.069> gone<00:05:16.220> behind<00:05:16.430> the<00:05:16.699> truck

happens<00:05:34.729> and<00:05:35.030> how<00:05:35.120> quickly<00:05:35.360> collisions<00:05:35.870> can

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
happens and how quickly collisions can

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.149 
happens and how quickly collisions can
be<00:05:36.139> caused<00:05:36.349> even<00:05:37.099> in<00:05:37.159> that<00:05:37.280> split<00:05:37.460> second<00:05:37.880> okay

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
be caused even in that split second okay

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.379 
be caused even in that split second okay
that<00:05:40.159> was<00:05:40.250> really<00:05:40.580> interesting<00:05:40.759> I<00:05:41.090> mean<00:05:41.120> there
