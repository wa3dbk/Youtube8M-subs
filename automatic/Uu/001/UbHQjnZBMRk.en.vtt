00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.530
 today I tell you a very nice thing 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.160
 to save money with the machines 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.410
 coffee with capsules can be 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.869
 recharge these capsules practically 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.410
 to infinity in a very simple way 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.330
 then just one capsule is plastic 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.240
 like this it's so easy to say this 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.210
 end the original capsule is this is here 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.860
 a refilled capsule already used then 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:42.930
 we only need the capsules a 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.270
 aluminum disk and the knife for 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.620
 open the coffee and the normal coffee 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.660
 what we also use with the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.750
 any coffee maker mocha 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.730
 ground any capsule it is 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.809
 compatible with yours with yours 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.640
 machine is fine and I have the car of 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.210
 nespresso is this here is ideal 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.070
 the old capsule must be opened 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:11.990
 remove the aluminum and then empty the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.159
 content of the celebrated coffee already used 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.430

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.439

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:27.290
 this which classic that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:31.230
 it is even better to put coffee 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:42.830
 inside as if it were in the coffee pot 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:46.590
 then slowly and then with the 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:53.520
 the aluminum puts it to me we are on and 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.990
 we crush it on the edges so as to 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.180
 close the capsule to how it was 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:05.460
 at the beginning then we turn it and crush it 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:12.440
 well down here with your fingers so 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:14.240
 Fix all the aluminum perfectly 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.280
 under the edge 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.400

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.520
