00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.229 

according<00:01:00.100> to<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.280> book<00:01:00.460> that<00:01:00.489> I<00:01:00.670> have<00:01:00.909> here

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
according to the book that I have here

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.289 
according to the book that I have here
the<00:01:01.390> ideal<00:01:01.930> size<00:01:02.530> for<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.399> nesting<00:01:03.760> platform

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
the ideal size for the nesting platform

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.870 
the ideal size for the nesting platform
is<00:01:04.659> approximately<00:01:05.320> 7<00:01:05.710> inches<00:01:06.039> square

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
is approximately 7 inches square

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.230 
is approximately 7 inches square
so<00:01:07.240> we'll<00:01:07.479> start<00:01:07.930> today<00:01:08.619> by<00:01:08.979> cutting<00:01:09.729> down<00:01:09.759> the

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
so we'll start today by cutting down the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:22.950 
so we'll start today by cutting down the
offcuts<00:01:10.690> to<00:01:10.899> 7<00:01:11.229> inches<00:01:11.440> wide

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.110 

in<00:01:23.830> this<00:01:23.980> case<00:01:24.190> we<00:01:24.400> need<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.700> seven-inch

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
in this case we need the seven-inch

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.630 
in this case we need the seven-inch
board<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.510> be<00:01:25.630> 20<00:01:26.080> inches<00:01:26.110> long<00:01:26.560> which<00:01:27.460> will

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
board to be 20 inches long which will

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.060 
board to be 20 inches long which will
give<00:01:27.820> us<00:01:27.940> two<00:01:28.240> seven<00:01:28.900> inch<00:01:29.050> square<00:01:29.380> platforms

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
give us two seven inch square platforms

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.880 
give us two seven inch square platforms
be<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.550> side<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.780> six<00:01:32.080> inch<00:01:32.290> beam<00:01:32.560> to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
be the side of the six inch beam to

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:41.090 
be the side of the six inch beam to
which<00:01:33.010> the<00:01:33.190> whole<00:01:33.370> board<00:01:33.730> will<00:01:34.150> be<00:01:34.510> screwed

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:52.500 

make<00:01:42.100> your<00:01:42.220> twice<00:01:42.490> cut<00:01:42.880> once<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:52.119> we<00:01:52.240> have<00:01:52.390> our

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
make your twice cut once so we have our

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.600 
make your twice cut once so we have our
first<00:01:52.690> board<00:01:53.050> at<00:01:53.200> 20<00:01:53.530> inches<00:01:53.710> going<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.400> build

going to use my power planer to run a

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.270 
going to use my power planer to run a
bevel<00:02:13.690> edge<00:02:13.810> all<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.260> way<00:02:14.500> around<00:02:14.680> what<00:02:15.100> will

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
bevel edge all the way around what will

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.670 
bevel edge all the way around what will
be<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.580> underside<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.090> these<00:02:16.420> boards

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.619 

next<00:02:24.519> step<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:24.970> drill<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.180> couple<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.569> holes

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
next step is to drill a couple of holes

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.350 
next step is to drill a couple of holes
in<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.170> middle<00:02:26.410> what<00:02:27.310> will<00:02:27.519> be<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.790> underside

the<00:02:52.560> last<00:02:52.740> couple<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.070> summers<00:02:53.490> we've<00:02:53.670> had

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
the last couple of summers we've had

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.630 
the last couple of summers we've had
some<00:02:54.270> barnes-wall<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:54.960> was<00:02:55.230> trying<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.800> nest<00:02:56.130> on

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
some barnes-wall I was trying to nest on

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.470 
some barnes-wall I was trying to nest on
top<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.800> sliding<00:02:58.800> door<00:02:59.040> track<00:02:59.610> but

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
top of the sliding door track but

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.320 
top of the sliding door track but
because<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.290> nests<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.370> built<00:03:02.760> largely<00:03:03.090> out

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
because the nests is built largely out

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.950
