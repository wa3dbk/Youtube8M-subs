00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.099 
did with the first graders was we let
them<00:00:33.070> build<00:00:33.489> a<00:00:33.789> rotating<00:00:34.420> right<00:00:34.569> finally

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:35.109 
them build a rotating right finally

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:36.840 
them build a rotating right finally
Elmo's<00:00:35.469> lying<00:00:35.710> fish<00:00:35.979> where<00:00:36.280> they<00:00:36.399> got<00:00:36.519> to<00:00:36.670> use

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
Elmo's lying fish where they got to use

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.639 
Elmo's lying fish where they got to use
all<00:00:37.420> different<00:00:37.539> types<00:00:37.870> of<00:00:38.019> materials<00:00:38.469> and

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
all different types of materials and

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.649 
all different types of materials and
things<00:00:38.769> to<00:00:39.129> see<00:00:39.159> what<00:00:39.699> they<00:00:40.030> could<00:00:40.089> build<00:00:40.359> and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:40.659 
things to see what they could build and

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:41.939 
things to see what they could build and
what<00:00:40.780> they<00:00:40.870> could<00:00:40.929> mean<00:00:41.079> it<00:00:41.469> and<00:00:41.620> if<00:00:41.710> it's<00:00:41.859> a

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
what they could mean it and if it's a

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.259 
what they could mean it and if it's a
ride<00:00:42.100> that<00:00:42.280> they<00:00:42.339> would<00:00:42.579> ride<00:00:42.760> if<00:00:42.969> they<00:00:43.089> came

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
ride that they would ride if they came

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.910 
ride that they would ride if they came
to<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.510> park<00:00:43.749> so<00:00:44.260> it<00:00:44.319> was<00:00:44.409> really<00:00:44.649> great<00:00:44.859> and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
to the park so it was really great and

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.129 
to the park so it was really great and
it<00:00:45.159> gave<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.460> chin<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.909> the<00:00:46.300> kids<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.600> chance<00:00:46.629> to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:47.139 
it gave the chin of the kids a chance to

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:49.229 
it gave the chin of the kids a chance to
really<00:00:47.319> work<00:00:47.409> together<00:00:47.799> to<00:00:48.579> come<00:00:48.729> up<00:00:48.760> with<00:00:48.999> one

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
really work together to come up with one

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.099 
really work together to come up with one
solution

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
solution

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.200 
solution

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
kids come in and they got to build a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.770 
kids come in and they got to build a
ride<00:01:15.080> they<00:01:15.530> got<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.830> work<00:01:16.010> in<00:01:16.250> Ernie's<00:01:16.790> bathtub

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
ride they got to work in Ernie's bathtub

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.960 
ride they got to work in Ernie's bathtub
learning<00:01:18.290> how<00:01:18.410> things<00:01:18.440> float<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.160> sing<00:01:19.430> and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
learning how things float and sing and

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.880 
learning how things float and sing and
they<00:01:20.090> also<00:01:20.270> got<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:20.660> observe<00:01:20.900> how<00:01:21.590> balls

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
they also got to observe how balls

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.219 
they also got to observe how balls
bounce<00:01:22.250> different<00:01:22.820> shapes<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.240> sizes<00:01:23.450> and

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
bounce different shapes and sizes and

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.890 
bounce different shapes and sizes and
the<00:01:24.380> differences<00:01:24.830> in<00:01:25.040> them<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.390> then<00:01:26.600> what

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
the differences in them so and then what

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.350 
the differences in them so and then what
you<00:01:27.020> see<00:01:27.080> behind<00:01:27.260> me<00:01:27.560> we<00:01:28.250> actually<00:01:28.729> have<00:01:28.940> build

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
you see behind me we actually have build

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.060 
you see behind me we actually have build
a<00:01:29.479> ride<00:01:29.660> so<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.200> kids<00:01:30.380> got<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.560> come<00:01:30.830> in<00:01:30.950> today

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
a ride so the kids got to come in today

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.310 
a ride so the kids got to come in today
and<00:01:31.430> create<00:01:31.580> a<00:01:31.729> roller<00:01:32.000> coaster<00:01:32.119> they<00:01:33.050> got<00:01:33.200> to

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
and create a roller coaster they got to

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.050 
and create a roller coaster they got to
come<00:01:33.500> in<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:33.800> build<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.100> turn<00:01:34.340> ride<00:01:34.610> like

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
come in and build the turn ride like

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.020 
come in and build the turn ride like
Bernie's<00:01:35.780> ride<00:01:36.050> and<00:01:36.369> so<00:01:37.369> we<00:01:37.490> really<00:01:37.759> have<00:01:37.910> to

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
Bernie's ride and so we really have to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.700 
Bernie's ride and so we really have to
have<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:38.270> hands-on<00:01:38.690> approach<00:01:38.960> they<00:01:39.530> can

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
have a hands-on approach they can

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.440 
have a hands-on approach they can
actually<00:01:39.860> see<00:01:40.250> what's<00:01:40.520> going<00:01:40.610> on<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.300> learn

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
actually see what's going on and learn

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.160 
actually see what's going on and learn
and<00:01:41.690> feel<00:01:41.840> for<00:01:42.050> themselves<00:01:42.500> at<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:42.950> one

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
and feel for themselves at this one

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.990 
and feel for themselves at this one
actually<00:01:45.170> might<00:01:45.560> not<00:01:45.740> even<00:01:45.860> like<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:46.280> but

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
actually might not even like this but

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.609 
actually might not even like this but
that<00:01:47.149> one<00:01:47.300> would<00:01:47.420> have<00:01:47.540> or<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:48.350> one's<00:01:48.560> not

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
that one would have or so that one's not

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:58.190 
that one would have or so that one's not
gonna<00:01:48.920> fit

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:11.280
