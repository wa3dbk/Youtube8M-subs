I<00:00:07.660> just<00:00:08.660> got<00:00:08.840> this<00:00:09.019> new<00:00:09.080> blank<00:00:09.590> from<00:00:09.860> mudhole

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
I just got this new blank from mudhole

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.789 
I just got this new blank from mudhole
and<00:00:10.670> I<00:00:10.879> am<00:00:11.000> really<00:00:11.570> excited<00:00:12.410> to<00:00:12.500> put<00:00:12.680> it

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
and I am really excited to put it

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:21.929 
and I am really excited to put it
together<00:00:17.080> it's<00:00:18.080> a<00:00:18.230> heavy<00:00:18.500> action<00:00:19.480> two-piece

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
together it's a heavy action two-piece

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.880 
together it's a heavy action two-piece
rod<00:00:22.939> that<00:00:23.269> I<00:00:23.359> can<00:00:23.570> use<00:00:23.749> for<00:00:23.779> for<00:00:24.410> everything

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
rod that I can use for for everything

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.700 
rod that I can use for for everything
from<00:00:25.070> muskies<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:25.999> stripers<00:00:26.960> to<00:00:27.169> tarpon

from muskies to stripers to tarpon
peacocks<00:00:28.310> and<00:00:28.579> everything<00:00:29.179> in<00:00:29.329> between<00:00:29.359> it's

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
peacocks and everything in between it's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.000 
peacocks and everything in between it's
lightweight<00:00:30.499> and<00:00:32.110> it<00:00:33.110> will<00:00:33.260> really<00:00:33.470> serve<00:00:33.800> my

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
lightweight and it will really serve my

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.069 
lightweight and it will really serve my
purposes<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:34.880> it<00:00:34.970> breaks<00:00:35.210> down<00:00:35.480> to<00:00:35.720> just

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
purposes and it breaks down to just

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.160 
purposes and it breaks down to just
about<00:00:36.350> this<00:00:36.800> big<00:00:36.860> like<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:37.969> said<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:38.449> just<00:00:38.629> got<00:00:38.930> it

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
about this big like I said I just got it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.170 
about this big like I said I just got it
from<00:00:39.289> mudhole<00:00:39.770> and<00:00:40.010> you<00:00:40.460> can<00:00:40.640> get<00:00:40.789> a<00:00:40.820> promote

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
from mudhole and you can get a promote

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.819 
from mudhole and you can get a promote
hole<00:00:41.390> now<00:00:41.539> too<00:00:41.840> because<00:00:42.079> they've<00:00:42.260> just<00:00:42.590> got<00:00:42.800> a

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
hole now too because they've just got a

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.580 
hole now too because they've just got a
bunch<00:00:43.039> of<00:00:43.219> them<00:00:43.309> in<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:44.239> first<00:00:44.539> decision<00:00:45.199> that

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
bunch of them in the first decision that

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.959 
bunch of them in the first decision that
you<00:00:45.710> have<00:00:45.890> to<00:00:46.100> make<00:00:46.280> when<00:00:46.430> you're<00:00:46.579> putting<00:00:46.820> a

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
you have to make when you're putting a

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.490 
you have to make when you're putting a
rod<00:00:47.180> together<00:00:47.570> or<00:00:47.899> one<00:00:48.079> of<00:00:48.199> the<00:00:48.260> first

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
rod together or one of the first

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.979 
rod together or one of the first
decisions<00:00:48.890> is<00:00:49.789> what<00:00:49.850> guide<00:00:50.269> should<00:00:50.600> I<00:00:50.719> put<00:00:50.960> on

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
decisions is what guide should I put on

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.069 
decisions is what guide should I put on
well<00:00:51.859> ask<00:00:52.160> yourself<00:00:52.820> first<00:00:53.000> water<00:00:53.390> guides<00:00:53.719> for

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
well ask yourself first water guides for

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.340 
well ask yourself first water guides for
their<00:00:54.829> primary<00:00:55.399> function<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.629> guide<00:00:56.929> the

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
their primary function is to guide the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.680 
their primary function is to guide the
line<00:00:57.769> down<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.339> shaft<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:58.969> rod<00:00:59.269> when

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
line down the shaft of the rod when

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.259 
line down the shaft of the rod when
you're<00:00:59.899> casting<00:01:00.469> and<00:01:00.620> also<00:01:01.429> to<00:01:01.519> support<00:01:02.089> the

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
you're casting and also to support the

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.290 
you're casting and also to support the
line<00:01:02.480> on<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:03.050> rod<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.859> evenly<00:01:04.519> distribute<00:01:05.269> the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
line on the rod to evenly distribute the

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.590 
line on the rod to evenly distribute the
stress<00:01:05.860> this<00:01:06.860> is<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:07.130> very<00:01:07.400> primitive<00:01:07.730> one<00:01:08.120> made

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
stress this is a very primitive one made

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.899 
stress this is a very primitive one made
out<00:01:08.750> of<00:01:08.900> brass<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.619> its<00:01:10.040> weakness<00:01:10.460> of<00:01:10.640> course

out of brass and its weakness of course

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.940 
out of brass and its weakness of course
is<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.600> fact<00:01:11.869> that<00:01:11.960> it's<00:01:12.170> very<00:01:12.229> stiff<00:01:12.770> and

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
is the fact that it's very stiff and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.490 
is the fact that it's very stiff and
that<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:13.549> creates<00:01:14.360> grooves<00:01:14.780> in<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.140> when<00:01:15.320> the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
that it creates grooves in it when the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.100 
that it creates grooves in it when the
line<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.250> dirt<00:01:16.490> in<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.670> line<00:01:16.939> wears<00:01:17.750> on<00:01:17.990> it

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
line the dirt in the line wears on it

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.100

a myriad of different designs why well

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.499 
a myriad of different designs why well
each<00:01:54.170> design<00:01:54.799> serves<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.579> specific<00:01:55.759> purpose

trade-offs in all the designs which is

trade-offs in all the designs which is
probably<00:02:03.170> why<00:02:03.409> there<00:02:03.649> are<00:02:03.829> so<00:02:04.130> many<00:02:04.369> different

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
probably why there are so many different

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.100 
probably why there are so many different

difference in deflection and it's

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.059

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:12.819

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:26.269 
blank with no guides at all so it

00:07:26.269 --> 00:07:28.899
