00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
sometimes they might come in and they go

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.970 
sometimes they might come in and they go
come<00:02:28.890> like<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.610> they<00:02:30.510> come<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.930> file<00:02:31.200> but

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
come like a they come in a file but

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.250 
come like a they come in a file but
within<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.640> file<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.270> map<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.110> do

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
within the file is the map and if you do

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.400 
within the file is the map and if you do
not<00:02:34.410> put<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:35.090> actual<00:02:36.090> map<00:02:36.390> inside<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.230> won't

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
not put the actual map inside it won't

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.860 
not put the actual map inside it won't
work<00:02:37.620> for<00:02:38.340> example<00:02:38.460> like<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:38.940> one<00:02:39.120> over<00:02:39.660> here

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
work for example like this one over here

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.310 
work for example like this one over here
you<00:02:40.080> see<00:02:41.010> how<00:02:41.100> it's<00:02:41.490> in<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.700> file<00:02:41.910> now<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:43.170> is

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
you see how it's in a file now this is

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.199 
you see how it's in a file now this is
the<00:02:43.440> actual<00:02:43.740> map<00:02:43.980> because<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.490> has<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.730> region

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
the actual map because it has the region

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.380 
the actual map because it has the region
level<00:02:45.390> level<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.990> exact<00:02:46.530> etc<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
level level that exact etc this is the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.680 
level level that exact etc this is the
actual<00:02:48.630> map<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.500> has<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> readme<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:51.480> see

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
actual map and it has a readme you see

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.930 
actual map and it has a readme you see
it<00:02:51.840> says<00:02:52.050> move<00:02:52.260> Airport<00:02:52.950> folder<00:02:53.340> into<00:02:53.730> safe

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
it says move Airport folder into safe

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.850 
it says move Airport folder into safe
folder<00:02:54.360> texture<00:02:54.840> panic<00:02:55.110> included<00:02:55.620> but<00:02:55.739> not

folder texture panic included but not

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.979 
folder texture panic included but not
needed<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.180> texture<00:02:57.480> pack<00:02:57.660> don't<00:02:57.870> worry

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
needed this is texture pack don't worry

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.170 
needed this is texture pack don't worry
about<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.350> this<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.370> actual<00:02:59.580> map<00:03:00.000> you

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
about this this is the actual map you

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.910 
about this this is the actual map you
see<00:03:00.360> follow<00:03:01.080> their<00:03:01.320> instructions<00:03:01.530> first

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
see follow their instructions first

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.280 
see follow their instructions first
because<00:03:02.280> if<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.730> just<00:03:02.940> put<00:03:03.270> this<00:03:03.750> directly

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
because if you just put this directly

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.820 
because if you just put this directly
into<00:03:04.560> here<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.040> will<00:03:05.280> not<00:03:05.489> work<00:03:05.780> now<00:03:06.780> let's

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
into here it will not work now let's

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.640 
into here it will not work now let's
show<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:07.890> how<00:03:08.130> this<00:03:08.310> thing<00:03:09.080> works<00:03:10.080> all<00:03:10.560> right
