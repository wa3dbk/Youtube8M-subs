00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.370
 well you hate the attraction for 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.700
 which you have lent your voice 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.120
 time did you think that's not summed up 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.790
 fortunately 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.440
 no it's beautiful the 5d in all its 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.080
 splendor 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.990
 Image its great share like that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.539
 being in a universe did not do or 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.550
 not 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.960
 it's great period of history 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.000
 revisited by rabbits do you have 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.550
 favorite then is that I preferred 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.790
 it is 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.490
 the wild west period a moment when he 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.350
 in fact they make 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.850
 not you the discovery of false mandates 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.600
 prehistory actually there are some 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.860
 global mammoth questioning and in 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.840
 same time I say that to myself because I have 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.950
 also adored the period noted as greece 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.420
 was like that in fact but this short 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:01:02.560
 after precisely there are the columns that 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:01:03.460
 with the decor that is the end it's 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.059
 remember the size does not speak too much 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.059
 innovative 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.200
 they get to be against 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.820
 humans will necessarily understand 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.530
 but there may be more rabbits 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.070
 specific like the honor rabbit by 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.990
 example it means what you take your 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.970
 business 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.380
 there is also another tax that goes over 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.450
 nice like that who is a little bit 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.180
 simpler is another who is going to be a 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.620
 little more than May 5 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.630
 nice a little more in the treble by 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.740
 example the damian sea is what you 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.300
 dream also rabbids idiots 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.240
 ah yes outright eat them to dreams 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.790
 rabbit I get dressed late I brush 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:55.120
 the teeth 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:57.600
 I know my home dough but cider and 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.600
 because here I
