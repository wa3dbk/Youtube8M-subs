00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.380
 the Basel delivers the reminder that 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:27.720
 replaces the red one 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:30.359
 Automated pharmacist detects 3 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.789
 barcode that are on the reminder in 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.010
 sequence the first short the second that 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.770
 the numbering of the progressive recipe 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.989
 the third the tax code 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.449
 our management after having detected 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.809
 these three boats in automatic yes 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:49.800
 connects with the sogei and goes to search for the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.980
 recipe if everything is ok the recipe comes 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.199
 highlighted with the prescribed products 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.769
 so at that point the pharmacist takes 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.800
 the farm of the prescribed product detects i 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.839
 two barcode of the hostel because it must 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.500
 also note the number in this one 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:10.130
 electronic recipe situation 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.860
 after which it closes the recipe and comes 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.899
 validated by the company system 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.040
 the closed operation is concluded the 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:24.840
 recipe is dated that is it seemed already 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.149
 we say archived as a sent recipe 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.140
 from the pharmacy and the one imposed by 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:34.229
 those products delivered regularly and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.500
 therefore it must already be set aside in an archive 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.450
 where it is then resumed when the will be done 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.850
 pricing for the preparation of 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.829
 distinct with davide summarizes tv then 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.630
 the riina die glued directly 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.329
 the effect of the poster never comes and is 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.390
 materialized the type the red recipe 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.420
 because detecting the license plate in that 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.100
 moment that single pack comes 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.890
 identified as perfectly as 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.009
 a fingerprint and therefore is no longer 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.740
 salable is no longer spendable in this 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.009
 phase is obvious that yes also for analogies 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.289
 for simplicity yes yes yes and works in a way 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.239
 similar to the automatic rossin recipe 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.120
 that is, use the reminder to put the 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.400
 fusello tello 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.190
 and then deliver it to the offices 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.720
 pharmaceuticals and asl also for 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.849
 check to verify on support 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.430
 paper even if the operation we say 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.739
 more because having the system detected 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.200
 everything has everything in the archive 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.099
 ability to control everything in one 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.290
 second phase I hope it also comes 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.420
 eliminated this annoying of hostel 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.390
 which also creates so many problems from 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.220
 media point of view 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:49.569
 It is obvious that the whole is conditioned by the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.030
 dsl Basiliano of this problem if it is 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.319
 takes charge in first person and with a lot 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:01.049
 very strong and determined the region 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:03.700
 and therefore must check with the managers 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:11.170
 of this telephone lines 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:15.159
 possibility we proceed operationally the 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.639
 doctor notes to it then also 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.739
 photograph the mask of ours 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.030
 identical management is not that we have to 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.609
 do transactions 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:36.269
 ok to set up now says a 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:36.269
 By the way, they were good confirmation 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.500
 f10 close electro perfect recipe in 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:56.960
 this time the company acquired the 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:59.300
 operation case then having one 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.020
 ability to work quickly and 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.420
 without wasting the citizen's time to 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.950
 patient to the last thing 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.080
 you find in a man and we have reason 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.360
 declared maximum availability a 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.700
 all of you both physicians to you 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.220
 so pharmacists if you have any 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.880
 European problems we will be grateful if there 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:24.650
 they let me know that I think here 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:27.290
 let's just tell the doctor within a month 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.460
 two months we will be able to ship 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:34.310
 also in 1700 promises because this 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.320
 thanks to the doctor's efforts 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.630
 of course from the doctors because that 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:44.840
 we say it is a prerequisite for all our 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:47.110
 action and therefore that this system serves 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.630
 even for three years 20 today he began 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.780
 euro essay for what is also useful 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.000
 to the pharmacy to the pharmacist ie 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.430
 pharmacist should not be afraid of 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.030
 technology of these here because there is 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.580
 always a positive aspect that turns out 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.190
 can be useful in the profession is 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.010
 obvious that it is always the man who manages 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.190
 the car and therefore all the work 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.620
 change itself changes however 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.810
 says but the competence to the culture is the 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.360
 professional capacity must be 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:26.060
 always committed to have to give a 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:29.289
 optimal service but not at all 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.349
 let's say colleagues now 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:35.710
 all the other doctors and all the others 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.389
 pharmacies align with these things 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.749
 so the important thing is what he has 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.339
 said the doctor just now is what 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.469
 the doctors did 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:47.699
 it seems that there are no difficulties are 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:49.749
 however in any case we as an agency 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.759
 we will check everything and then 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:55.119
 eventually they have some 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:06:01.869
 difficulty in any sense is enough 

00:05:55.119 --> 00:06:03.430
 They have told, but I must say the holy 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:06.339
 who have not been met and big 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.839
 difficulties because in any case sogei and the 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:10.779
 ministry have used 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:12.459
 standard open protocol technologies 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:14.830
 then interfaceable with any 

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:21.849
 work environment so I can't say 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:23.709
 there have been great difficulties 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:25.930
 maneuvers that must be banned in 

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:28.149
 dispatch of the recipe reminder 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.499
 electronics are exactly the same as the 

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:32.979
 shipping of the red recipe 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:34.930
 automates there is only one more option is 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:37.899
 low therefore as times if the ADSL 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:41.229
 it works if everything is ok waste of time 

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:43.659
 there is indeed a whole series 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:46.689
 of advantages such as may be 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:48.789
 the recipe that arrives at the pharmacy on 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:52.029
 reminder has already been validated because 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:54.610
 the doctor when you fill it if there 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:56.159
 compiles perfectly is received 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.719
 from the platform is made available 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:01.749
 so we already have a first filter 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:04.240
 that facilitates the work of the pharmacy 

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:08.199
 so when he arrives at the pharmacy on 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.300
 citizen with the reminder us already if 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.490
 the celada platform available 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.099
 we understand and realize that the 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.869
 recipe has been prepared in a perfect way 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.330
 that is according to the specifications and the 

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:22.889
 regulations in force 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.889
 then the normal shipment is made
