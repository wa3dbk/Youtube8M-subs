00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
hey guys Paul anti-car Darcy attics

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.370 
hey guys Paul anti-car Darcy attics
we're<00:00:12.150> finally<00:00:12.509> back<00:00:12.660> out<00:00:12.900> making<00:00:13.259> some

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
we're finally back out making some

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.919 
we're finally back out making some
videos<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:14.250> dug<00:00:14.790> out<00:00:14.940> an<00:00:15.179> old<00:00:15.330> plane<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.599> had<00:00:15.809> from

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
videos I dug out an old plane I had from

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.779 
videos I dug out an old plane I had from
hobbyking<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.800> L<00:00:16.949> for<00:00:17.130> grasshopper

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
hobbyking this is the L for grasshopper

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.910 
hobbyking this is the L for grasshopper
and<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:18.359> basically<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:19.410> military<00:00:19.770> version

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
and it's basically the military version

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.150 
and it's basically the military version
of<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.189> cub<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:21.800> original<00:00:22.800> landing<00:00:23.070> gear

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
of the cub the original landing gear

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.320 
of the cub the original landing gear
were<00:00:23.220> pretty<00:00:23.430> weak<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.880> ended<00:00:24.090> up<00:00:24.150> bash

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
were pretty weak and I ended up bash

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.210 
were pretty weak and I ended up bash
them<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.750> break<00:00:24.840> them<00:00:24.900> off<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.680> bought<00:00:26.189> some

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
them and break them off so I bought some

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.160 
them and break them off so I bought some
metal<00:00:26.609> landing<00:00:26.970> gear<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.330> put<00:00:27.510> some<00:00:27.720> heavier

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
metal landing gear and put some heavier

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.550 
metal landing gear and put some heavier
rubber<00:00:28.920> tires<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.400> here<00:00:30.260> let's<00:00:31.260> see<00:00:31.380> how<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
rubber tires on here let's see how it

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.020 
rubber tires on here let's see how it
works<00:00:31.710> hopefully<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.399> works<00:00:32.520> out<00:00:32.730> pretty<00:00:32.880> good

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
works hopefully it works out pretty good

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.910 
works hopefully it works out pretty good
it's<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> lot<00:00:33.899> more<00:00:34.050> sturdy<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.500> way<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:34.829> it

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
it's a lot more sturdy that way but it

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.310 
it's a lot more sturdy that way but it
is<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> little<00:00:35.700> bit<00:00:35.820> heavier<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.360> think<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.170> got

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
is a little bit heavier I think I got

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.229 
is a little bit heavier I think I got
the<00:00:37.440> CG<00:00:37.770> back<00:00:37.980> Craig<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.579> let's<00:00:39.030> see<00:00:39.120> how<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the CG back Craig so let's see how it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.580 
the CG back Craig so let's see how it
works<00:00:39.360> I'm<00:00:39.629> gonna<00:00:39.750> take<00:00:39.899> off<00:00:40.020> off<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> grass

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
works I'm gonna take off off the grass

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.680 
works I'm gonna take off off the grass
here<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:41.969> slide<00:00:42.120> around

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.830 

well<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.530> short<00:00:48.770> takeoff<00:00:52.480> no<00:00:53.480> one's<00:00:53.660> running

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
well the short takeoff no one's running

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.890 
well the short takeoff no one's running
for<00:00:54.110> ESPO<00:00:54.500> yeah<00:00:54.739> for<00:00:54.980> us<00:00:58.629> yeah<00:00:59.629> they're

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
for ESPO yeah for us yeah they're

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.500 
for ESPO yeah for us yeah they're
leaning<00:01:00.110> on<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.350> throttle<00:01:00.739> do<00:01:01.239> you<00:01:02.239> see<00:01:02.420> this

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
leaning on the throttle do you see this

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.990 
leaning on the throttle do you see this
one<00:01:02.750> climb<00:01:06.070> it's<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.160> field<00:01:07.400> tail-heavy<00:01:07.850> you

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
one climb it's a field tail-heavy you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.030 
one climb it's a field tail-heavy you
know<00:01:08.119> no<00:01:08.660> it<00:01:08.960> actually<00:01:09.080> feels<00:01:09.410> it's<00:01:09.619> time<00:01:09.680> to

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
know no it actually feels it's time to

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.359 
know no it actually feels it's time to
nose-heavy<00:01:10.490> I<00:01:10.670> think<00:01:11.710> it<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:12.830> heavier<00:01:13.190> with

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
nose-heavy I think it is heavier with

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.820 
nose-heavy I think it is heavier with
the<00:01:13.490> landing<00:01:13.850> gear<00:01:13.910> like<00:01:14.119> I<00:01:14.210> said<00:01:14.420> I<00:01:14.830> haven't

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
the landing gear like I said I haven't

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.140 
the landing gear like I said I haven't
set<00:01:16.009> out<00:01:16.160> right<00:01:16.340> about<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.580> third<00:01:16.790> of<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.000> wing

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
set out right about a third of the wing

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.650 
set out right about a third of the wing
cord

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
cord

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.070 
cord
do<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:18.050> see<00:01:18.259> G<00:01:19.420> maybe<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.450> tiny<00:01:20.690> bit<00:01:20.810> farther

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
do you see G maybe a tiny bit farther

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.330 
do you see G maybe a tiny bit farther
forward<00:01:21.410> so<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:21.619> might<00:01:21.860> need<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.070> speak<00:01:22.280> the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
forward so I might need to speak the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:31.270 
forward so I might need to speak the
battery<00:01:22.640> back<00:01:22.790> a<00:01:22.820> little<00:01:23.119> bit<00:01:23.300> in<00:01:23.390> this<00:01:23.509> one

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.080 

that's<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:34.580> there's<00:01:35.580> no<00:01:35.700> wind<00:01:35.970> today

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
that's all that there's no wind today

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210 
that's all that there's no wind today
yeah<00:01:36.420> don't<00:01:36.930> throw<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> think<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:37.920> it's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
yeah don't throw I think it's just it's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
yeah don't throw I think it's just it's
got<00:01:38.370> some<00:01:38.610> weight<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.170> thing<00:01:40.170> wants

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
got some weight to it so thing wants

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.740 
got some weight to it so thing wants
approves

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.770 

I<00:01:46.780> think<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.560> need<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.740> add<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:47.980> little<00:01:48.750> bit<00:01:49.750> of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
I think I need to add a little bit of

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.600 
I think I need to add a little bit of
Expo<00:01:50.260> to<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.530> ailerons<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.040> stuff<00:01:51.220> I<00:01:51.310> got<00:01:51.490> it

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
Expo to the ailerons and stuff I got it

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.860 
Expo to the ailerons and stuff I got it
seem<00:01:51.940> like<00:01:52.090> pretty<00:01:52.920> jumpy<00:01:54.210> roll<00:01:55.210> happier<00:01:55.660> yeah

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
seem like pretty jumpy roll happier yeah

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.200 
seem like pretty jumpy roll happier yeah
roll<00:01:56.170> happy<00:01:56.580> I'm<00:01:57.580> having<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.910> little<00:01:58.090> bit<00:01:58.180> a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
roll happy I'm having a little bit a

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.070 
roll happy I'm having a little bit a
hard<00:01:58.360> time<00:01:58.510> flying<00:01:58.840> smoothly<00:02:00.750> use<00:02:01.750> a<00:02:01.780> little

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
hard time flying smoothly use a little

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.110 
hard time flying smoothly use a little
more<00:02:02.200> rudder<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:05.770> this<00:02:06.010> plane<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.460> does<00:02:06.700> seem

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
more rudder on this plane it does seem

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.580 
more rudder on this plane it does seem
to<00:02:07.270> want<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.510> kind<00:02:07.720> of<00:02:07.780> tip<00:02:07.990> stall<00:02:08.200> she's<00:02:08.440> like

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
to want to kind of tip stall she's like

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:29.980 
to want to kind of tip stall she's like
too<00:02:08.800> slow<00:02:12.630> nice<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:13.660> fight<00:02:13.930> though

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990

in<00:02:30.990> fact<00:02:31.290> yak<00:02:31.590> I'm<00:02:31.770> pretty<00:02:31.980> aerobatic<00:02:32.640> for<00:02:32.820> a

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
in fact yak I'm pretty aerobatic for a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.960 
in fact yak I'm pretty aerobatic for a
Piper<00:02:34.710> Cub<00:02:34.830> type<00:02:35.220> plane<00:02:37.370> keep<00:02:38.370> your<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.670> Frank

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
Piper Cub type plane keep your a Frank

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.230 
Piper Cub type plane keep your a Frank
yeah

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:59.670 

I'm<00:02:44.810> off<00:02:44.990> power<00:02:45.260> down<00:02:45.820> line<00:02:46.850> pretty<00:02:47.780> much

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.110 

yeah<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.340> definitely<00:03:00.459> want<00:03:00.819> to<00:03:00.849> use<00:03:00.970> more

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
yeah you definitely want to use more

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.490 
yeah you definitely want to use more
rudder<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.629> this<00:03:01.750> plane<00:03:01.989> when<00:03:02.170> turning<00:03:02.439> you

don't<00:03:02.620> want<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.829> bank<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.159> too<00:03:03.310> much<00:03:03.430> when

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
don't want to bank it too much when

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.569 
don't want to bank it too much when
flying<00:03:04.030> slow<00:03:04.439> that<00:03:05.439> I<00:03:05.560> could<00:03:05.739> really<00:03:06.159> feel<00:03:06.400> the

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
flying slow that I could really feel the

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.429 
flying slow that I could really feel the
wing<00:03:06.730> kind<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.060> dropping<00:03:07.239> out<00:03:07.480> tip<00:03:08.049> stalling

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439

wing kind of dropping out tip stalling
I'm<00:03:09.250> going<00:03:09.459> super<00:03:09.700> slow<00:03:16.109> like<00:03:17.109> that<00:03:17.290> see<00:03:17.500> that

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420

Gibbs
that<00:03:21.650> can<00:03:21.800> be<00:03:21.890> scary<00:03:22.190> for<00:03:22.370> them<00:03:22.640> yeah<00:03:22.940> yeah

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.240 
that can be scary for them yeah yeah
well<00:03:24.050> if<00:03:24.200> your<00:03:24.350> maintain<00:03:24.650> speed<00:03:24.890> is<00:03:25.010> not<00:03:25.130> so

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
well if your maintain speed is not so

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.500 
well if your maintain speed is not so
bad<00:03:25.430> but<00:03:25.580> when<00:03:25.730> you're<00:03:25.820> going<00:03:25.910> slow<00:03:26.000> like<00:03:26.300> this

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
bad but when you're going slow like this

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:43.240 
bad but when you're going slow like this
Oh<00:03:38.260> si<00:03:39.260> over<00:03:40.070> tip<00:03:40.340> stalled<00:03:42.070> alright<00:03:43.070> guys

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
Oh si over tip stalled alright guys

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.120 
Oh si over tip stalled alright guys
here's<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.700> carnage<00:03:44.120> of<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.270> plane<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:45.500> don't

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
here's the carnage of the plane I don't

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.080 
here's the carnage of the plane I don't
know<00:03:46.190> if<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.310> saw<00:03:46.460> it<00:03:46.610> really<00:03:46.850> good<00:03:46.940> in<00:03:47.030> the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
know if you saw it really good in the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.350 
know if you saw it really good in the
video<00:03:47.410> but<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.500> deftly<00:03:48.890> tip<00:03:49.880> stalling<00:03:50.270> it

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
video but it deftly tip stalling it

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.450 
video but it deftly tip stalling it
again<00:03:50.600> on<00:03:50.720> that<00:03:50.870> one<00:03:51.080> says<00:03:51.800> I<00:03:51.950> could<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.220> was

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
again on that one says I could I was

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.370 
again on that one says I could I was
going<00:03:52.670> too<00:03:52.760> slow<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.210> I<00:03:53.270> turned<00:03:53.510> too<00:03:53.630> hard<00:03:53.870> and

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
going too slow and I turned too hard and

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.290 
going too slow and I turned too hard and
it<00:03:54.500> just<00:03:54.530> dropped<00:03:55.040> out<00:03:55.280> big<00:03:55.550> time<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:56.210> I

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
it just dropped out big time and I

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.860 
it just dropped out big time and I
couldn't<00:03:56.510> recover<00:03:57.280> basically<00:03:58.280> that's<00:03:58.400> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
couldn't recover basically that's the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.910 
couldn't recover basically that's the
pieces<00:03:59.870> I<00:04:00.050> could<00:04:00.440> probably<00:04:00.590> glue<00:04:00.770> it<00:04:00.890> back

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
pieces I could probably glue it back

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.140 
pieces I could probably glue it back
together<00:04:01.160> but<00:04:01.520> we'll<00:04:01.700> see

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
together but we'll see

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.450 
together but we'll see
I<00:04:02.180> might<00:04:02.720> just<00:04:02.830> salvage<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:03.890> parts<00:04:04.160> out<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:04.400> it

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
I might just salvage the parts out of it

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.890 
I might just salvage the parts out of it
and<00:04:04.580> make<00:04:04.670> something<00:04:04.850> else<00:04:07.600> yeah<00:04:08.600> it<00:04:08.750> looks

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
and make something else yeah it looks

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.620 
and make something else yeah it looks
pretty<00:04:08.960> busted<00:04:09.350> up
