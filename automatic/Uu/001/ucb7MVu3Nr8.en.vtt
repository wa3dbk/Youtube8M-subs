00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
anyways um yeah there's not a lot of

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.880 
anyways um yeah there's not a lot of
possibilities<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.530> can<00:03:28.650> put<00:03:28.800> these

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
possibilities that you can put these

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.350 
possibilities that you can put these
guys<00:03:29.070> in<00:03:29.130> but<00:03:29.430> that's<00:03:29.520> really<00:03:29.730> not<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.000> point

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
guys in but that's really not the point

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.080 
guys in but that's really not the point
the<00:03:30.570> point<00:03:30.600> is<00:03:31.020> to<00:03:31.200> have<00:03:31.470> them<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.310> i'll

the point is to have them and i'll

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.820 
the point is to have them and i'll
probably<00:03:33.390> under<00:03:33.660> putting<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:33.990> guy<00:03:34.200> back<00:03:34.800> in

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
probably under putting this guy back in

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.460 
probably under putting this guy back in
his<00:03:35.160> box<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.870> displaying<00:03:36.870> them<00:03:37.110> up<00:03:37.230> but<00:03:37.410> just

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
his box and displaying them up but just

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.800 
his box and displaying them up but just
have<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.310> have<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.820> amount<00:03:39.150> for<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.570> while<00:03:39.660> I'm

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
have a have that amount for a while I'm

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.470 
have a have that amount for a while I'm
just<00:03:39.959> never<00:03:40.110> felt<00:03:40.380> like<00:03:40.530> putting<00:03:40.800> it<00:03:40.890> back<00:03:41.010> in

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
just never felt like putting it back in
