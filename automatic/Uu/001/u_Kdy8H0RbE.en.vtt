00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.720
It is the second full moon of the month.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.240
A blue moon.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:19.840
Everyone in a clan of Eevees gathered together around their leader. It was time for the Eevees to evolve during a ritual while the blue moon lasted.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.340
The leader, an Umbreon by the name of Dusk, steps around, making eye contact with everyone.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.740
Finally, he stops before an Eevee.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.900
Dusk: Young Eevee, what is your mark?

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.000
The Eevee replies nervously.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.100
Eevee: F-Flareon, Dusk.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.840
Dusk: Then it's a Flareon you shall become!

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.340
One peculiar thing about this clan is that the Eevees do not choose their evolution.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.020
Their parents mark them, which means their evolution is chosen for them.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.440
A terrible fate is said to come to those that become the wrong evolution.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Meanwhile, an Eevee has just been introduced to the world.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.840
Born to an Espeon, Sol, as her mother.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.320
And an Umbreon, Shade, as her father.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.420
Sol: Our first child has been born during the blue moon.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.360
Shade: Yes! We must surely be blessed!

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.140
Several nights later, Shade and Sol's Eevee began walking around the clan for the first time on her own.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.460
Eevee: *sniffing* The air... so fresh! (sorry, YouTube messed up my formatting)

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.380
Shade: Eevee?

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.100
Eevee: Huh?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.200
Shade: Your mother and I have decided a mark for you.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.100
Eevee: Mark?

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.300
Shade: Yes.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.980
I can see it in your eyes...

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.700
You will be marked like me. An Umbreon.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.780
You were born during the blue moon. You have the moon in you.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.240
We have decided on an Umbreon name for you...

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.940
Luna.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.900
Once you are marked, you will sometimes experience flashes. Don't worry though. They are only to remind you what your mark is.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.420
Shade put his paw to Luna's forehead, which marked her as an Umbreon.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.120
Luna: (Th-that must have been a flash!)

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.980
A few days later, Sol brought Luna to a lake at the edge of the clan's territory to watch the sunrise.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.900
Sol: Isn't it beautiful, Luna?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.020
Luna: Yes it is.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.400
It makes me want to reach out and touch it.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.440
Sol: You know, Espeons, like what I am, are associated with the sun.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.680
Luna: Well in that case, I think I'm more like an Espeon. Maybe I should be remarked.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.980
Sol: Remarked? I'm afraid that's not possible, Luna.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.420
Luna: Well during the next blue moon, I'll just evolve into Espeon!

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.920
Sol: What? Luna, don't you know how dangerous it is to evolve outside of your mark?

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.440
Luna: It can't be that bad!

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.380
Luna: (Another flash! This time, the Umbreon looked somewhat angry...)

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.380
Sol: If you plan to evolve into the wrong evolution, your flashes will become more frequent!

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.280
It is said that occasionally you will experience a vision of a hostile Umbreon. This Umbreon appears when the next blue moon comes to finish you off!

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.180
Luna is thinking too much about her flash, and didn't hear any of what her mother has said.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.340
Sol: Well, looks like we got all that cleared up, and just in time for breakfast!

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.900
Sol suddenly seems to be thinking about nothing but food and wanders away to look for Shade.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.320
Luna: Now that I think about it, I'm kind of hungry too.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.625
Luna: Another flash!

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.580
Luna: Yet another!

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.220
Luna: What?

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.660
???: A... terrible future... ahead of you...

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.985
Luna: A terrible future...?

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.200
