the<00:01:18.289> weight<00:01:19.289> of<00:01:19.649> hands<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:21.270> very<00:01:21.329> good<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
the weight of hands is very good for the

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.120 
the weight of hands is very good for the
soil<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.369> piles<00:01:23.639> on<00:01:24.030> too<00:01:24.270> much<00:01:25.130> it'll

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
soil but if it piles on too much it'll

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.929 
soil but if it piles on too much it'll
kill<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.990> every<00:01:28.259> once<00:01:28.469> in<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.679> while<00:01:28.859> every<00:01:29.639> week

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
kill so every once in a while every week

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.080 
kill so every once in a while every week
or<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.149> you<00:01:30.359> move<00:01:31.319> it<00:01:31.499> a<00:01:31.530> bit<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.249> we<00:01:32.789> actually

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
or so you move it a bit and we actually

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.459 
or so you move it a bit and we actually
have<00:01:33.209> to<00:01:33.329> move<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.600> right<00:01:33.630> now<00:01:33.899> so<00:01:34.139> we<00:01:34.259> just

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
have to move it right now so we just

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.239 
have to move it right now so we just
move<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.459> like<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.819> space<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.439> eventually

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
move it like a space so that eventually

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.219 
move it like a space so that eventually
it'll<00:01:38.399> make<00:01:38.549> its<00:01:38.729> coal<00:01:38.969> way<00:01:39.179> around<00:01:39.539> and<00:01:40.049> we

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it'll make its coal way around and we

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.719 
it'll make its coal way around and we
don't<00:01:40.350> move<00:01:40.499> it<00:01:40.619> too<00:01:40.709> far<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.490> enough

undated okay so in other words you are

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.300 
undated okay so in other words you are
you're<00:03:21.170> raising<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.709> protecting<00:03:22.190> endangered

you're raising and protecting endangered

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.920 
you're raising and protecting endangered
animals<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.410> harvest<00:03:24.620> them<00:03:25.690> animals<00:03:26.690> as

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
animals and you harvest them animals as

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.190 
animals and you harvest them animals as
food<00:03:28.959> milk<00:03:30.459> increases<00:03:31.459> their<00:03:31.610> popularity<00:03:32.200> so

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
food milk increases their popularity so

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.000 
food milk increases their popularity so
if<00:03:33.709> we<00:03:34.250> promote<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.700> pigs<00:03:34.970> as<00:03:35.330> as<00:03:35.720> great<00:03:36.530> meat

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
if we promote the pigs as as great meat

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.449 
if we promote the pigs as as great meat
then<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:38.000> will<00:03:38.120> increase<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:39.230> need<00:03:39.920> for<00:03:39.980> this

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
then it will increase the need for this

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.050 
then it will increase the need for this
demand<00:03:41.270> for<00:03:41.660> this<00:03:42.050> kind<00:03:42.470> of<00:03:42.560> if<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.880> farm<00:03:43.880> the

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
demand for this kind of if you farm the

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.600 
demand for this kind of if you farm the
animals<00:03:44.420> properly<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.410> continue<00:03:46.370> and

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
animals properly you continue and

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.860 
animals properly you continue and
preserve<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.120> propagate<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.660> species

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
preserve and propagate the species

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.280 
preserve and propagate the species
exactly<00:03:48.739> right<00:03:49.190> it's<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.730> would<00:03:50.239> seem<00:03:50.870> kind<00:03:51.080> of

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
exactly right it's it would seem kind of

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.979 
exactly right it's it would seem kind of
odd<00:03:51.350> that<00:03:52.100> by<00:03:52.370> promoting<00:03:52.850> them<00:03:53.209> to<00:03:53.450> be<00:03:53.570> eaten

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
odd that by promoting them to be eaten

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.970 
odd that by promoting them to be eaten
would<00:03:54.860> help<00:03:55.580> save<00:03:56.260> yeah<00:03:57.260> but<00:03:57.739> it<00:03:57.890> would

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
would help save yeah but it would

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.100 
would help save yeah but it would
increase<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.310> proper<00:03:58.670> well<00:03:59.030> no<00:03:59.269> farms<00:03:59.840> would

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
increase the proper well no farms would

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.259 
increase the proper well no farms would
realize<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:01.010> they<00:04:01.670> they<00:04:01.940> want<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.180> have

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
realize that they they want to have

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.030 
realize that they they want to have
these<00:04:02.450> pigs<00:04:02.750> which<00:04:03.019> lordy<00:04:03.410> there's<00:04:03.769> no<00:04:03.890> one

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
these pigs which lordy there's no one

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.680 
these pigs which lordy there's no one
ate<00:04:04.220> them<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:04.640> then<00:04:04.790> they'd<00:04:04.940> become<00:04:05.090> extinct

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
ate them and then they'd become extinct

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.720 
ate them and then they'd become extinct
right<00:04:06.050> we<00:04:06.530> let<00:04:06.739> these<00:04:06.830> animals<00:04:07.280> while<00:04:07.430> what

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
right we let these animals while what

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.789 
right we let these animals while what
would<00:04:07.850> happen<00:04:08.180> well<00:04:08.989> being<00:04:09.410> that<00:04:09.530> there<00:04:09.739> are

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
would happen well being that there are

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:10.820 
would happen well being that there are
only<00:04:09.890> 200

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
only 200

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.300 
only 200
of<00:04:10.890> these<00:04:11.100> pigs<00:04:11.570> they<00:04:12.590> they<00:04:13.590> would<00:04:13.800> revert<00:04:14.160> to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
of these pigs they they would revert to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.340 
of these pigs they they would revert to
the<00:04:14.430> normal<00:04:14.760> wild<00:04:15.060> state<00:04:15.270> if<00:04:15.480> let<00:04:15.780> in<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.049> wild

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
the normal wild state if let in the wild

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.509 
the normal wild state if let in the wild
but<00:04:16.560> they<00:04:16.739> would<00:04:17.269> most<00:04:18.269> likely<00:04:19.340> being<00:04:20.340> that

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
but they would most likely being that

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.400 
but they would most likely being that
there's<00:04:20.700> so<00:04:20.910> little<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.600> them<00:04:21.750> not<00:04:21.959> find<00:04:22.260> each

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
there's so little of them not find each

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.430 
there's so little of them not find each
other<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.710> not<00:04:22.920> reproduce<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:24.110> even<00:04:25.110> if<00:04:25.230> some

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
other and not reproduce and even if some

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.940 
other and not reproduce and even if some
of<00:04:25.560> them<00:04:25.710> do<00:04:25.920> they<00:04:26.130> would<00:04:26.280> be<00:04:26.430> killed<00:04:26.700> off<00:04:26.910> and

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
of them do they would be killed off and

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.680 
of them do they would be killed off and
they<00:04:28.950> would<00:04:29.130> just<00:04:29.340> die<00:04:29.640> naturally<00:04:30.240> even<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
they would just die naturally even and

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.900 
they would just die naturally even and
that<00:04:31.590> would<00:04:31.920> that<00:04:32.340> would<00:04:32.400> that<00:04:32.850> would

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
that would that would that would

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.030 
that would that would that would
definitely<00:04:33.390> destroy<00:04:33.750> their<00:04:34.050> their<00:04:34.770> entire

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
definitely destroy their their entire

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:46.100 
definitely destroy their their entire
species<00:04:35.810> but<00:04:36.810> if<00:04:37.560> they're<00:04:37.950> raised<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.810> that

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
species but if they're raised and that

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.150 
species but if they're raised and that
would<00:04:46.200> allow<00:04:46.410> us<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:48.740> so<00:04:49.740> that<00:04:49.920> they<00:04:50.100> could

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
would allow us to so that they could

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.250 
would allow us to so that they could
yeah<00:04:53.160> so<00:04:53.730> one<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.090> things<00:04:54.630> people<00:04:54.810> say<00:04:55.080> is

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
yeah so one of the things people say is

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.820 
yeah so one of the things people say is
that<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.590> know<00:04:55.680> killing<00:04:55.950> animals<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.430> not<00:04:56.580> not

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
that you know killing animals is not not

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.620 
that you know killing animals is not not
compassionate<00:04:58.830> or<00:04:59.300> healthy<00:05:00.300> or<00:05:00.390> whatever

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
compassionate or healthy or whatever

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.410 
compassionate or healthy or whatever
what<00:05:00.870> do<00:05:00.930> you<00:05:00.990> have<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.170> say<00:05:01.320> about<00:05:01.410> that<00:05:02.420> well

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
what do you have to say about that well

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.000 
what do you have to say about that well
first<00:05:03.660> off<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:03.960> think<00:05:06.620> okay<00:05:07.620> so<00:05:07.680> there's<00:05:07.950> a

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
first off I think okay so there's a

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:16.580 
first off I think okay so there's a
difference<00:05:08.400> between<00:05:08.880> factory<00:05:09.870> farming<00:05:15.590> right

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
difference between factory farming right

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.480 
difference between factory farming right
that's<00:05:17.630> there's<00:05:18.630> a<00:05:18.720> difference<00:05:19.140> between

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
that's there's a difference between

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
that's there's a difference between
harvesting<00:05:20.490> your<00:05:20.640> own<00:05:20.700> animals<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.300> killing

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
harvesting your own animals and killing

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.909 
harvesting your own animals and killing
them<00:05:21.720> or<00:05:21.930> slaughtering<00:05:22.320> on<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.590> right<00:05:22.770> way

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
them or slaughtering on the right way

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.370 
them or slaughtering on the right way
and<00:05:23.160> then<00:05:23.370> you<00:05:23.520> do<00:05:23.850> it<00:05:23.880> with<00:05:24.030> respect<00:05:24.180> yeah<00:05:24.960> you

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
and then you do it with respect yeah you

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.230 
and then you do it with respect yeah you
take<00:05:25.919> care<00:05:26.130> of<00:05:26.160> these<00:05:26.280> animals<00:05:26.700> you<00:05:26.790> propagate

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
take care of these animals you propagate

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.970 
take care of these animals you propagate
the<00:05:27.330> species<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:28.820> killing<00:05:29.820> for<00:05:30.830> most<00:05:31.830> of

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
the species and killing for most of

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.980 
the species and killing for most of
popularity<00:05:32.460> because<00:05:33.180> obviously<00:05:33.540> these

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
popularity because obviously these

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.990 
popularity because obviously these
animals<00:05:34.410> are<00:05:34.590> rare<00:05:35.190> so<00:05:35.460> they<00:05:35.580> taste<00:05:35.790> good

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
animals are rare so they taste good

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.600 
animals are rare so they taste good
because<00:05:36.300> they<00:05:36.990> haven't<00:05:37.110> been<00:05:37.610> genetically

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
because they haven't been genetically

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.390 
because they haven't been genetically
over<00:05:39.120> bred<00:05:39.570> and<00:05:39.810> all<00:05:40.320> mixed<00:05:40.770> together<00:05:40.890> within

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
over bred and all mixed together within

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.280 
over bred and all mixed together within
