00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
usually worms are hiding in the compost

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.770 
usually worms are hiding in the compost
and<00:01:21.190> every<00:01:21.880> time<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.150> come<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.420> see<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.690> the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.060 

and<00:01:32.540> they're<00:01:32.690> always<00:01:32.840> on<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.170> move<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.860> this
