00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.120
 to the goal 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.920
 I think we can do that 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.910
 you also finish the video because 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.639
 We've said everything now 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.730
 say you just have to kill everything 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.600
 what moves it is a colorful 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.220
 blatantly action-packed it's a weird one 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.830
 crazy little steps into the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.259
 future visions of the 80s in far cry 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.939
 leaf margin is based on far cry 3 though 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.610
 the independent extension lasts 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.920
 about six hours and looks like this 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.380
 so neon colors and there are things with 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.890
 fire your eyes canister and so on 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.960
 well her son max power comes yes and it 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.859
 are in addition also still ne story with guided 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.539
 Many little bits of 3D sequences 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.550
 told and she is incredibly trashy 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.379
 It is actually an 80s action movie for 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.739
 replay is the definition of 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.449
 madness 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.600
 its little allusions far cry 3 yes 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.890
 I noticed it 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.720
 The story is really knocking 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.490
 There are many onliners from time to time too 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.890
 American flag in the background 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.870
 and our main actor record 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.470
 I also fought for lady liberty for 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.630
 the freedom and so on about 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.310
 dolph lundgren level fletcher the story 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.110
 behind the game is initially right 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.300
 linear in the middle short open and on the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.980
 the end is quite linear again and I have 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.270
 the impression just before you look 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.150
 bored, thank God, too 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.250
 already over because the game is indeed 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.590
 an eighties conversion of the good old 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.120
 facto gameplays but not quite so deep 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.960
 usually not quite as complex and not 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.210
 quite so extensive 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.980
 yes, the mission design is nothing 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.480
 special one is often in 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.120
 any in devils on the go 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.050
 in which all look the same 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.060
 Enemy come on one to the 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.850
 opponents are known from far cry 3 are just 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.950
 differently textured everything very many 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.600
 also took over the weapons that is 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.770
 nothing really new here except one 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.369
 The exception was seen at the beginning 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.500
 have been short for a while 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.399
 and yes that's a pity but that 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.140
 do not play anything 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.750
 make a grand new make it easy 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.680
 just a nice parade and me 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.680
 think that's great 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.329
 that's what it must look like 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.080
 beware of rex this place is one 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:29.560
 Place of death of which kind do 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.270
 the daily practice is also a good example 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.680
 for the dialogue quality in the game also 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.280
 that wants the game to be the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.170
 I'm sorry, but I also go to the US 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.400
 synchro rate personally if you 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.630
 good english understands there sit the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.690
 Wortwitze a little better 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.450
 number sandy here has a short map 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.220
 There are 13 enemy bases that you can see 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.630
 one takes or does not stand that 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.130
 completely open to the player the relation 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.150
 little bit to the enemy camps in far cry 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.070
 3 and that 's a nice little one 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.840
 there is also a change in between 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.340
 side missions are always two types 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.460
 either we save a hostage here 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.790
 or kill a special opponent 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.650
 animal boring but I think so 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.209
 game does the same good thing far 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.830
 cry 3 also did well it leaves that 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.560
 player the choice we have a thing rangeht 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.720
 whether he sneaks up from afar 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.640
 sniper rifle fights whether he is in 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.580
 melee attacks uses or rather mg 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.470
 So you have the possibility that I think 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.910
 actually rather a possibility is 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.470
 also just the kites the 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.000
 work results and the club 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.030
 you can simply opponent the 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.320
 rip out cyber herz and stand on it 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.820
 pay the roof and then run 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.110
 then 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.959
 because you can just the opponent the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.730
 steer kites into the enemy base and 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.019
 which ensures orderly bustle as place 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.070
 but there are also vehicles but the games 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.870
 hardly a role 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.750
 including those are the same again 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.580
 as in case three simply in black 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.320
 therefore a bit more I would have 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.650
 just a cool why is one 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.810
 cool steampunk carlo moment thinks 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.010
 steampunk so if more mad max 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.550
 or terminator 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.550
 is that correct 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.099
 I just watched everything that was 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.400
 incredible 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:16.160
 says no pictures of crying are clear 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.650
 Customers who play poker that is 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.430
 unbelievably awesome dialogues 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.889
 unbelievable is also the upgrade 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.180
 namely were pretty much cut in the 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.979
 Comparative years since there are only 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.250
 six weapons four of them are upgrade bar 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.930
 and the upgrades are pretty simple 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.010
 After all, you can do all sorts of updates 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.960
 I install up to two pieces per 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.430
 also weapon the level up that 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.930
 Spielfigur happens now in one 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.940
 The path that is fixed always gets 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.260
 new skills and abilities but that 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.690
 Now everything is going after the other one 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.370
 you can not choose anything anymore 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.960
 it is a kind reduced to the bare minimum 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.669
 version of far cry that is in there 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.590
 background works but as long as that 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.880
 stupidly painted I'm there 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.280
 social interaction and that 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.389
 self esteem and no study could 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.160
 ever a connection between 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.380
 computer games and violence prove 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.500
 honestly talk about the games as harmful 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.450
 keeps is a stupid cock of the ticket 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.400
 Plattling sky 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.669
 he is having fun in any case i would 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.660
 tell me it was a bit 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.910
 in fact it was oblique but it was 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.250
 not strict enough as I said 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.440
 weapons huge bosses opponents there were none 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.090
 bossgegner would have been much more 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.830
 went 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.720
 i thought it was good i absolutely loved it 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.020
 wonderfully stupid I liked the 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.729
 I like the style I like it 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.380
 fantastic it has the exact dialogues 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.260
 right length before I get bored 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.479
 could something over and short if that 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.330
 showcase and a served 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.090
 then just a little more 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.580
 Do not attack your children's systems 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:50.530
 controls my brain screen and that is 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:53.099
 you are my rider we show the how 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:57.479
 cyber command make 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:57.479
