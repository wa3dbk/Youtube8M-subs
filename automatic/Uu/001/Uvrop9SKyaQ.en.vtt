00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.690
 I am part of the troops of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.969
 battlefield surveillance 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.070
 we use a radar system that 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.240
 detects vehicles helicopters 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.180
 the boats and even the infantrymen 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.100
 for that we do not support about 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.109
 all units 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.990
 because the voice radar will bring a 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.820
 number of meters above 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.140
 ground and everything flying below by 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.360
 example can not be detected so 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.890
 at that moment night we lose against 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 blind zones and detect and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.710
 we had helicopters that fly 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.960
 low altitude 0 per section of five 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.640
 people and alternatively use a 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.870
 mini moke or armored kennel m113 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.309
 section includes a NCO who 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.989
 command four volunteers from 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.300
 career including a driver 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.520
 we are all trained to master the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.140
 radar we perform including all 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.650
 same tasks but working either a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.720
 limited rotation system this is 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.439
 a lot of radar maintenance do not me 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.140
 vehicles and re-train 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.490
 always be level and in the field 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.130
 this moment is much more 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.780
 concrete so really thought about everything 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.790
 that we have learned precisely during 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.790
 phases where it's a little more relaxed 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.880
 when we go on exercise it is 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.940
 usually for a week sometimes 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.040
 two we go everywhere sometimes 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:38.370
 full nature in the ardennes and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:41.070
 other times at sea for example no 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.500
 level of training it lasts eight 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.610
 weeks and there we are informed on all 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.670
 radios 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.970
 radar and the close protection of the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.280
 vehicle training seduce it takes 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.229
 also depends on which poor of whom I 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.600
 fell in winter we were comfortable in 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.550
 out of -20 degrees so it takes 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.930
 know how to know how to hold must be 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.070
 really motivated it's not something 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.070
 we take a legion
