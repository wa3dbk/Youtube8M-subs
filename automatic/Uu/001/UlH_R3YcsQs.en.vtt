00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.710
 donato sem comeidos a new video las 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.330
 3 and 48 in the morning to know if 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.170
 you leave a favorite line you help 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.420
 heap and good basically in news 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.610
 of the month so to speak of what 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.830
 let's make the year is not so exaggerated 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.130
 we have not had very news either 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.900
 important as the play 4 and the xbox 720 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.120
 but I think this news is pretty 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.690
 important and not in losing weight as well 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.460
 say it 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.130
 die has been published an offer 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.739
 work in which they look for an engineer and 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.030
 an engineer 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.660
 senior software to optimize the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.350
 frostbite engine 2.0 for the next 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.960
 generation of consoles 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.180
 which can indicate this basically everything 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.859
 indicates is worth the job offer for 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.269
 start is real worth is not any 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.589
 coordinated are already looking for 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.629
 develop in next generation 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.219
 basically to optimize what would be 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.829
 the graphic engine that already has the fact 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.339
 to optimize the best to improve it 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.329
 maybe for the next generation what 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.860
 first thing that comes to mind 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.720
 all is battlefield 4 which is the most 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.009
 likely it's not 90 percent of 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.259
 possibilities that are already working 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.909
 in the game and I'm looking for someone who 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.890
 you can reach 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.390
 to move it not too long ago 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.409
 we said in a news that they already had 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.450
 enough ideas 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.240
 for battlefield 4 the ideas are already 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.130
 on the table will not only miss what is 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.390
 design and all this that takes so much 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.670
 not work perhaps is what most 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.109
 work they carry in a video game and 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.659
 basically they need to optimize what 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:31.709
 would be for the next generation of 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.709
 consoles the graphic engine 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.970
 Of course I could do other games 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.810
 obviously it could not be 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.000
 it could even be a medal of honor or 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.530
 another need for speed not so to speak 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.340
 but basically nothing funds from 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.910
 drummer this year and the roulette that carries 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.850
 dais is basically 'medal of honor' bad 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.530
 company and battlefield is not like that the rÃºa 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.610
 guava I do not know what it is that basically 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.200
 block everything I did not say it last year 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.540
 that this year there was going to be a new medal 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.610
 of honor and basically next year 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.679
 surely the most likely thing is that this 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.200
 bad company 3 new battlefield bad 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.550
 company 3 and the next will come the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.140
 next generation consoles and 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.300
 we will have part fill 4 in which already 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.000
 is working on the whole would square 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.040
 and basically they are working on it not 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.530
 so to speak and well basically that 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.900
 they have not already started looking for offers of or 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.910
 have been stolen, post offers 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.920
 work with which already people do not 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.140
 worry that you will have a profile 4 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.430
 most likely and nothing else I hope that you 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.840
 have liked to tell us masters in the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.840
 next video until next time
