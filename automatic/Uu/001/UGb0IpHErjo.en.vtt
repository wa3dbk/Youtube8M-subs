00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.540
 how you all today i do one 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.730
 shoplog about primark there i am 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.260
 been to arnhem yesterday 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.059
 He wrote a cup of coffee at my house 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.099
 father and my brother so his thing 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.509
 let me do the shopping for levis right away 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.240
 next buddy 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.670
 well what i got is such an example 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.850
 7 poopers 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.099
 these are short sleeve rompers not good 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.590
 and yes this is for short sleeves 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.180
 cliffy is then approximately 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.100
 but starting considering April-May which 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.630
 Stupid even though world with which you too 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.030
 still cold days 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.780
 so clearly a pair of long sleeves 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.780
 pits for 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.969
 and also size 80, these are three for 4 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.770
 Euros pricey and those others that just something 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.559
 I see a very nice print of it 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.180
 I was fine with seven for laps for 10 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.309
 euros 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.309
 I also met socks for ladies 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.500
 these are five pairs of socks for 3 euros and 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.890
 yes I think this is really stop because they 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.950
 Do not shrink in the wash and there is minimal 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.380
 are all little dot things 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.920
 and you also get pretty hard 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.780
 because you live it in the try that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.259
 well but i did not succeed with this one 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.409
 cookies 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.689
 I still had half that choice 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.790
 achieved with some lighter patterns 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.920
 in it 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.850
 basically the same but these are five 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.880
 couple for two over 50 and the other one 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.979
 for 2 euros per pair 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.399
 then I always get one at Primark 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.280
 of my favorites the pajamas 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.439
 I am now real and it is basically 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.180
 if you go by your easy on 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.200
 the child was very little waxed like that 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.990
 i3 long a dry cloth and i find clasie 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.210
 nice and they also have another very 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.380
 nice print pitch of these are 3 for 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.909
 10 euro 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.500
 because is not too bad and I have too 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:14.040
 I only print this on the oven 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.420
 achieved very nice too 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.110
 I still live this for that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.700

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.860

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.110
 fish relieved from day DC-3 for 4 euros 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.260
 and if you look online then you really see 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.670
 for 4 euros each and are whole 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.849
 easy to measure was with wax one 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.849
