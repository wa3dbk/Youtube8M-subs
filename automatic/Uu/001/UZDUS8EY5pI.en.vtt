because I think it's at least worth ten

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.330 
because I think it's at least worth ten
dollars<00:04:47.440> but<00:04:48.440> it's<00:04:48.590> very<00:04:48.800> similar<00:04:49.099> to<00:04:49.220> the

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
dollars but it's very similar to the

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.480 
dollars but it's very similar to the
benefit<00:04:50.030> one<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:50.570> I<00:04:50.750> like<00:04:51.260> it<00:04:51.440> a<00:04:51.530> lot<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:52.160> time

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
benefit one so I like it a lot the time

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.830 
benefit one so I like it a lot the time
