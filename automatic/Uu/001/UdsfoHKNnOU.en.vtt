good<00:00:00.650> morning<00:00:01.120> today<00:00:02.120> I<00:00:02.389> want<00:00:02.780> to<00:00:02.899> show<00:00:03.139> you

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:03.199 
good morning today I want to show you

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:05.110 
good morning today I want to show you
this<00:00:03.769> project<00:00:04.339> that<00:00:04.460> we're<00:00:04.609> doing<00:00:04.730> here<00:00:05.060> in

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.120 
this project that we're doing here in

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.840 
this project that we're doing here in
the<00:00:05.240> plant<00:00:05.480> I<00:00:05.810> have<00:00:06.500> this<00:00:06.649> oversized<00:00:07.189> canvas

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:07.850 
the plant I have this oversized canvas

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.060 
the plant I have this oversized canvas
that<00:00:08.389> I<00:00:08.420> want<00:00:08.719> to<00:00:08.840> frame<00:00:09.110> in<00:00:09.290> a<00:00:09.380> canvas<00:00:09.620> float

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
that I want to frame in a canvas float

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.959 
that I want to frame in a canvas float
frame<00:00:10.429> but<00:00:11.330> because<00:00:12.259> of<00:00:12.410> its<00:00:12.559> size<00:00:12.769> and

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
frame but because of its size and

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.220 
frame but because of its size and
because<00:00:13.969> I<00:00:14.000> am<00:00:14.210> personally<00:00:14.809> not<00:00:14.960> very

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
because I am personally not very

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.519 
because I am personally not very
proficient<00:00:15.980> with<00:00:16.309> a<00:00:16.340> drill<00:00:16.730> I<00:00:17.109> want<00:00:18.109> to<00:00:18.350> have

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
proficient with a drill I want to have

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.590 
proficient with a drill I want to have
the<00:00:18.710> plant<00:00:18.980> actually<00:00:19.609> do<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:19.850> framing<00:00:20.210> for<00:00:20.240> me

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
the plant actually do the framing for me

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.480 
the plant actually do the framing for me
so<00:00:21.140> we're<00:00:21.439> going<00:00:21.529> to<00:00:21.590> go<00:00:21.740> back<00:00:21.920> there<00:00:22.189> and<00:00:22.310> see

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
so we're going to go back there and see

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.330 
so we're going to go back there and see
how<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.699> professionals<00:00:23.449> do<00:00:23.689> it<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:25.160> first

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
how the professionals do it the first

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.599 
how the professionals do it the first
step<00:00:25.580> is<00:00:25.910> to<00:00:26.029> get<00:00:26.150> this<00:00:26.359> placed<00:00:26.720> properly

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
step is to get this placed properly

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.960 
step is to get this placed properly
within<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:28.760> frame<00:00:32.980> part<00:00:33.980> of<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:34.220> process<00:00:34.730> is

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
within the frame part of the process is

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.400 
within the frame part of the process is
figuring<00:00:35.510> out<00:00:35.920> how<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:38.570> painting<00:00:39.050> needs<00:00:39.230> to

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
figuring out how the painting needs to

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.340 
figuring out how the painting needs to
be<00:00:39.530> placed<00:00:39.890> within<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.820> float<00:00:41.150> frame<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:42.140> keep

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
be placed within the float frame to keep

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.290 
be placed within the float frame to keep
the<00:00:42.470> spacing<00:00:42.770> even<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:45.530> here<00:00:45.890> in<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.280> plant<00:00:46.550> we

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
the spacing even so here in the plant we

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.480 
the spacing even so here in the plant we
are<00:00:47.420> using<00:00:47.630> strips<00:00:48.050> of<00:00:48.260> foam<00:00:48.500> core<00:00:48.770> to<00:00:49.100> help<00:00:49.310> us

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
are using strips of foam core to help us

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.950 
are using strips of foam core to help us
make<00:00:49.790> sure<00:00:49.820> that<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:51.530> canvas<00:00:51.830> is<00:00:52.280> placed

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
make sure that the canvas is placed

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.250 
make sure that the canvas is placed
within<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.140> frame<00:00:54.640> so<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.880> all<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.750> spacing

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
within the frame so that all the spacing

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.680 
within the frame so that all the spacing
around<00:00:57.700> the<00:00:58.700> canvas<00:00:58.970> is<00:00:59.530> even<00:01:01.360> yes<00:01:02.360> what<00:01:02.660> I

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
around the canvas is even yes what I

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.450 
around the canvas is even yes what I
love<00:01:03.020> about<00:01:03.380> this<00:01:03.590> style<00:01:03.830> of<00:01:04.070> framing

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
love about this style of framing

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.640 
love about this style of framing
treatment<00:01:04.910> is<00:01:05.090> it<00:01:05.600> literally<00:01:06.170> makes<00:01:06.440> the

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
treatment is it literally makes the

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.390 
treatment is it literally makes the
piece<00:01:06.890> float<00:01:07.430> within<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.390> frame<00:01:09.100> what<00:01:10.100> I<00:01:10.130> just

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
piece float within the frame what I just

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.720 
piece float within the frame what I just
learned<00:01:10.640> is<00:01:11.150> that<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.890> type<00:01:13.100> of<00:01:13.130> screw<00:01:13.520> that

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
learned is that the type of screw that

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.660 
learned is that the type of screw that
you<00:01:13.790> use<00:01:14.300> for<00:01:14.690> framing<00:01:15.290> with<00:01:16.070> a<00:01:16.100> float<00:01:16.400> frame

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
you use for framing with a float frame

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.570 
you use for framing with a float frame
is<00:01:16.820> really<00:01:17.090> important<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:19.220> type<00:01:19.430> of

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
is really important and the type of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.980 
is really important and the type of
canvas<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:20.150> you're<00:01:20.270> working<00:01:20.420> with<00:01:20.750> may

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
canvas that you're working with may

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.750 
canvas that you're working with may
dictate<00:01:21.260> the<00:01:21.710> type<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:21.950> screw<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:22.550> can

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
dictate the type of screw that you can

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.160 
dictate the type of screw that you can
use<00:01:23.170> for<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:24.320> particular<00:01:24.590> piece<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.490> was

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
use for this particular piece it was

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.260 
use for this particular piece it was
difficult<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.470> use<00:01:27.770> our<00:01:27.950> standard<00:01:28.270> screw

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
difficult to use our standard screw

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.410 
difficult to use our standard screw
because<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:30.650> is<00:01:30.800> an<00:01:30.890> oil<00:01:31.070> on<00:01:31.460> linen<00:01:31.940> it's<00:01:32.120> very

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
because it is an oil on linen it's very

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.370 
because it is an oil on linen it's very
thick<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:34.430> stretcher<00:01:34.940> by<00:01:35.090> itself<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:36.110> about

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
thick the stretcher by itself is about

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.610 
thick the stretcher by itself is about
an<00:01:36.620> inch<00:01:36.860> thick<00:01:36.980> an<00:01:37.520> inch<00:01:37.730> deep<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.620> the

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
an inch thick an inch deep and the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.160 
an inch thick an inch deep and the
original<00:01:40.130> screw<00:01:40.400> we<00:01:40.580> tried<00:01:40.960> wasn't<00:01:41.960> thick

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
original screw we tried wasn't thick

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.770 
original screw we tried wasn't thick
enough<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:42.790> now<00:01:43.790> we're<00:01:44.300> using<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.630> little

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
enough so now we're using a little

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.890 
enough so now we're using a little
thinner<00:01:45.110> screw<00:01:45.590> with<00:01:45.830> a<00:01:45.860> flat<00:01:46.159> head<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:46.900> it

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
thinner screw with a flat head and it

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.630 
thinner screw with a flat head and it
seemed<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.590> be<00:01:48.710> having<00:01:49.010> better<00:01:49.159> luck<00:01:49.280> with

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
seemed to be having better luck with

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.980 
seemed to be having better luck with
that

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
that

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.130 
that
so<00:01:50.990> any<00:01:51.440> time<00:01:51.800> you<00:01:52.760> order<00:01:52.970> a<00:01:53.120> float<00:01:53.479> frame<00:01:53.810> from

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
so any time you order a float frame from

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.330 
so any time you order a float frame from
us<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:54.620> is<00:01:55.430> pre-drilled<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.479> back<00:01:56.659> and

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
us it is pre-drilled in the back and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.789 
us it is pre-drilled in the back and
evenly<00:01:58.340> spaced<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:59.150> it<00:02:00.140> makes<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.530> simpler

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
evenly spaced so it makes it simpler

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.539 
evenly spaced so it makes it simpler
Holly<00:02:01.549> is<00:02:01.909> going<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.570> wire<00:02:03.440> this<00:02:03.920> all<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.400> way

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
Holly is going to wire this all the way

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.480 
Holly is going to wire this all the way
around<00:02:04.700> since<00:02:05.270> it's<00:02:05.450> an<00:02:05.570> oversized<00:02:06.080> piece<00:02:06.530> so

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
around since it's an oversized piece so

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.570 
around since it's an oversized piece so
that<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.729> weight<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:08.270> distributed

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
that the weight is distributed

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.240 
that the weight is distributed
evenly<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.260> bottom<00:02:11.410> corners<00:02:12.010> don't

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
evenly and that the bottom corners don't

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.580 
evenly and that the bottom corners don't
take<00:02:12.490> too<00:02:12.700> much<00:02:13.410> stress<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:16.660> notice<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.560> are

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
take too much stress so notice we are

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.880 
take too much stress so notice we are

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
not putting any kind of paper backing on

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.410 
not putting any kind of paper backing on
the<00:02:21.010> back<00:02:21.330> especially<00:02:22.330> with<00:02:22.750> an<00:02:22.870> original<00:02:23.110> oil

the<00:02:25.420> canvas<00:02:25.840> needs<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.260> breathe<00:02:26.470> otherwise

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
the canvas needs to breathe otherwise

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.300 
the canvas needs to breathe otherwise
it'll<00:02:27.370> get<00:02:27.550> moldy<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:30.010> using<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.670> same<00:02:30.700> screws

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
it'll get moldy so using the same screws

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.510 
it'll get moldy so using the same screws
Holly<00:02:33.310> will<00:02:33.640> be<00:02:33.790> drilling<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.770> hanging

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
Holly will be drilling in the hanging

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.050 
Holly will be drilling in the hanging
mechanism<00:02:37.240> for<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.570> wire<00:02:37.780> hangers<00:02:38.970> kind<00:02:39.970> of

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
mechanism for the wire hangers kind of

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.800 
mechanism for the wire hangers kind of
in<00:02:40.390> from<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.960> edge<00:02:41.110> of<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.440> frame<00:02:41.710> so<00:02:42.550> that<00:02:42.810> it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
in from the edge of the frame so that it

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.370 
in from the edge of the frame so that it
won't<00:02:44.020> show<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.570> screw<00:02:46.840> won't<00:02:47.080> show

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
won't show so the screw won't show

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.440 
won't show so the screw won't show
within<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.920> float<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:51.310> this<00:02:51.610> will<00:02:51.760> be<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.120> here

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
within the float so this will be in here

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.560 
within the float so this will be in here
for<00:02:52.750> good<00:02:52.980> they'll<00:02:53.980> be<00:02:54.100> very<00:02:54.820> difficult<00:02:55.209> to

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
for good they'll be very difficult to

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.060 
for good they'll be very difficult to
remove<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:56.260> from<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.560> frame<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.560> truly<00:03:00.040> the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
remove this from the frame so truly the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.699 
remove this from the frame so truly the
frame<00:03:00.520> becomes<00:03:00.940> part<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.660> art<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.140> cannot

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
frame becomes part of the art it cannot

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.220 
frame becomes part of the art it cannot
be<00:03:02.950> considered<00:03:03.610> really<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.150> separate<00:03:04.660> thing
