straight line going down the middle and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.650 
straight line going down the middle and
that<00:00:20.220> straight<00:00:20.580> line<00:00:20.760> would<00:00:21.000> represent<00:00:21.029> the

that straight line would represent the

when<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:27.960> comes<00:00:28.380> time<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.680> let<00:00:28.949> go

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
when it comes time to let go

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.250

rotates<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> other<00:00:33.300> side<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.660> that

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
rotates just to the other side of that

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.229 
rotates just to the other side of that
equator<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.710> almost<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.489> quarter<00:00:35.969> turn

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239

equator it's almost just a quarter turn
a<00:00:36.570> lot<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.960> times<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.380> say<00:00:37.620> people<00:00:38.040> over

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
a lot of times I say people over

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.760 
a lot of times I say people over
rotating<00:00:39.120> over<00:00:39.450> turning<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.110> all<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> does<00:00:40.710> is

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
rotating over turning and all it does is

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.770 
rotating over turning and all it does is
make<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.250> ball<00:00:41.430> spin<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:42.239> we're<00:00:42.390> trying<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
make the ball spin what we're trying to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.740 
make the ball spin what we're trying to
do<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.989> create<00:00:43.200> roll<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.100> turn<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.450> best

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
do is create roll and turn and the best

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.869 
do is create roll and turn and the best
way<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.379> get<00:00:46.680> start<00:00:47.039> from<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> inside

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
way to do that get start from the inside

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.950 
way to do that get start from the inside

demonstrated the correct set up position

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.550 
demonstrated the correct set up position
stance<00:01:42.700> push<00:01:43.090> away<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:43.570> we<00:01:44.050> even<00:01:44.290> learned<00:01:44.470> how

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
stance push away and we even learned how

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.950 
stance push away and we even learned how
to<00:01:44.619> create<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.009> pendulum<00:01:45.340> swing<00:01:45.759> we<00:01:46.690> talked

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
to create a pendulum swing we talked

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.020 
to create a pendulum swing we talked
about<00:01:47.080> release<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.710> follow-through<00:01:48.040> we

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
about release and follow-through we

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.550 
about release and follow-through we
learn<00:01:49.180> how<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.390> make<00:01:49.540> a<00:01:49.570> ball<00:01:49.840> go<00:01:50.020> straight<00:01:50.380> and

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
learn how to make a ball go straight and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.530 
learn how to make a ball go straight and
make<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.160> ball<00:01:51.340> curve<00:01:51.369> when<00:01:51.880> we<00:01:52.000> wanted<00:01:52.330> to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
make the ball curve when we wanted to

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.320 
make the ball curve when we wanted to
I'm<00:01:53.470> Randy<00:01:53.770> Peterson<00:01:54.430> thanks<00:01:54.759> for<00:01:54.910> tuning<00:01:55.090> in

I'm Randy Peterson thanks for tuning in

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.930 
I'm Randy Peterson thanks for tuning in
and<00:01:55.450> remember<00:01:55.690> pull<00:01:56.619> up<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.890> storm<00:01:57.190> see<00:01:57.880> you
