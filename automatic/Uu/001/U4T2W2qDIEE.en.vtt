00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
see the problem when you go here after

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.060 
see the problem when you go here after
you<00:01:52.360> do<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.690> you<00:01:53.140> come<00:01:53.380> in<00:01:53.500> together<00:01:53.620> take

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
you do the you come in together take

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.250 
you do the you come in together take
your<00:01:54.250> hocus<00:01:54.700> instead<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.720> right<00:01:55.960> underneath

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
your hocus instead of right underneath

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.440 
your hocus instead of right underneath
you<00:01:56.560> take<00:01:57.220> your<00:01:57.370> focus<00:01:57.550> out<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:57.970> little<00:01:58.300> bit

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
you take your focus out a little bit

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.380 
you take your focus out a little bit
farther<00:01:58.950> it'll<00:01:59.950> make<00:02:00.220> that<00:02:00.430> easier<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:01.150> find

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
farther it'll make that easier to find

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.870 
farther it'll make that easier to find
trying<00:02:02.350> good<00:02:03.010> enough<00:02:03.130> focus<00:02:03.370> a<00:02:03.610> little<00:02:03.730> bit

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
trying good enough focus a little bit

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.930 
trying good enough focus a little bit
out<00:02:04.150> oh<00:02:05.160> right<00:02:06.160> there<00:02:06.580> you<00:02:06.640> can<00:02:06.760> see<00:02:06.790> the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
out oh right there you can see the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.880 
out oh right there you can see the
difference<00:02:07.360> then<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.140> can<00:02:08.290> really<00:02:08.500> hold<00:02:08.679> it

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
difference then you can really hold it

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.560 
difference then you can really hold it
I've<00:02:09.850> made<00:02:10.149> three<00:02:10.479> works<00:02:10.780> for<00:02:11.080> them<00:02:12.209> one<00:02:13.209> for

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
I've made three works for them one for

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.250 
I've made three works for them one for
about<00:02:14.530> 25<00:02:15.370> dancers<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.060> one<00:02:16.150> for<00:02:16.390> 40<00:02:16.870> dancers

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
about 25 dancers and one for 40 dancers

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.500 
about 25 dancers and one for 40 dancers
and<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.890> last<00:02:18.100> work<00:02:18.340> I've<00:02:18.459> just<00:02:18.670> made<00:02:18.850> has<00:02:19.180> is

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
and the last work I've just made has is

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.540 
and the last work I've just made has is
480<00:02:20.050> dancers<00:02:20.500> it's<00:02:20.890> called<00:02:21.070> what<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.310> too

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
480 dancers it's called what is too

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.699 
480 dancers it's called what is too
strong<00:02:21.790> for<00:02:22.030> breaking<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.600> I<00:02:22.630> think<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:23.080> you

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
strong for breaking and I think that you

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.620 
strong for breaking and I think that you
know<00:02:23.830> these<00:02:24.100> kids<00:02:24.370> are<00:02:24.640> dealing<00:02:25.390> with<00:02:25.510> that

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
know these kids are dealing with that

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.870 
know these kids are dealing with that
constantly<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.620> we<00:02:27.280> were<00:02:27.400> just<00:02:27.580> talking

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
constantly and and we were just talking

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.949 
constantly and and we were just talking
about<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.180> other<00:02:28.240> day<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.540> rehearsal

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
about it the other day and rehearsal

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.260 
about it the other day and rehearsal
about<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.680> know<00:02:29.770> whatever<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.459> is<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:30.730> they

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
about you know whatever it is that they

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.390 
about you know whatever it is that they
might<00:02:31.450> be<00:02:31.630> getting<00:02:32.050> broken<00:02:32.350> by<00:02:32.740> that<00:02:33.070> they<00:02:33.250> are

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
might be getting broken by that they are

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.160 
might be getting broken by that they are
too<00:02:33.640> strong<00:02:34.000> for<00:02:34.240> that<00:02:34.270> or<00:02:34.570> they<00:02:34.720> can<00:02:34.959> rise

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
too strong for that or they can rise

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.949 
too strong for that or they can rise
above<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.760> think<00:02:36.820> that<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.540> hope<00:02:37.750> that

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
above it and I think that I hope that

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.100 
above it and I think that I hope that
from<00:02:38.320> working<00:02:39.280> with<00:02:39.310> me<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.850> they<00:02:40.630> feel<00:02:40.900> that

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110
