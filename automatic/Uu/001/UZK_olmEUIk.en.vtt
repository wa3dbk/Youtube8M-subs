and then spawn a flight flying vehicle I

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.060 
and then spawn a flight flying vehicle I
like<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.809> use<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> salem<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.829> quite

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
like to use the salem because it's quite

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.400 
like to use the salem because it's quite
small<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.730> use<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> X<00:00:39.300> or<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:39.960> even<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
small you can use the X or or even the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.459 
small you can use the X or or even the
chrome<00:00:40.680> void<00:00:41.040> although<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.870> chrome<00:00:43.110> boy<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.350> a

chrome void although the chrome boy is a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.440 
chrome void although the chrome boy is a
little<00:00:43.680> bit<00:00:43.829> risk<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.370> now<00:00:44.879> once<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.239> do<00:00:45.360> get

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
little bit risk here now once you do get

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.910 
little bit risk here now once you do get
in<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.719> vehicle<00:00:46.110> you're<00:00:46.260> gonna<00:00:46.350> want<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> fly

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
in that vehicle you're gonna want to fly

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.940 
in that vehicle you're gonna want to fly
all<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.430> way<00:00:47.460> across<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.719> map<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.920> that

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
all the way across to the map to that

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.860 
all the way across to the map to that
location<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.850> showed<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.329> you're<00:00:51.780> gonna

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
location I just showed if you're gonna

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.260 
location I just showed if you're gonna
want<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> see<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:53.039> spaceship<00:00:53.730> now

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
want to see this in spaceship now

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.060 
want to see this in spaceship now
there's<00:00:54.989> also<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.289> lot<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.469> other<00:00:55.649> cool<00:00:56.039> stuff

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
there's also a lot of other cool stuff

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.830 
there's also a lot of other cool stuff
you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:56.940> make<00:00:57.180> sure<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.420> fly<00:00:57.660> low

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
you can do here make sure you fly low

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.569 
you can do here make sure you fly low
enough<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:59.039> these<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.399> really

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
enough you can see these like really

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.090 
enough you can see these like really
weird<00:01:00.170> rooms<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.559> are<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.829> pitch-black

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
weird rooms that are like pitch-black

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.660 
weird rooms that are like pitch-black
right<00:01:02.820> under<00:01:03.270> every<00:01:03.719> single<00:01:04.019> gateway<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.640> can

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
right under every single gateway you can

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.730 
right under every single gateway you can
see<00:01:06.060> things<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:07.049> where<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.530> like

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
see things like this where it's like

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.420 
see things like this where it's like
textures<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.729> well<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:09.540> these<00:01:10.350> random<00:01:10.950> words

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
textures as well as these random words

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.020 
textures as well as these random words
I<00:01:11.490> believe<00:01:11.939> these<00:01:12.390> words<00:01:12.840> are<00:01:13.320> from<00:01:13.880> one<00:01:14.880> of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
I believe these words are from one of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.030 
I believe these words are from one of
the<00:01:15.150> earlier<00:01:15.570> missions<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> game<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:16.890> I'm

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the earlier missions in the game but I'm

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.800 
the earlier missions in the game but I'm
not<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.340> hundred<00:01:17.759> percent<00:01:17.880> positive<00:01:18.330> that's

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
not a hundred percent positive that's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.770 
not a hundred percent positive that's
what<00:01:18.930> they<00:01:19.020> were<00:01:19.080> used<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:21.270> might<00:01:21.420> also<00:01:21.570> be

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
what they were used for it might also be

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.660 
what they were used for it might also be
like<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> placeholder<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.220> something

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
like a placeholder for something

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.730 
like a placeholder for something
available<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> future<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:25.170> eventually

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
available in the future but eventually

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.890 
available in the future but eventually
once<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.070> fly<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.670> area<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> mark<00:01:27.780> on

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
once you fly to the area that I mark on

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.420 
once you fly to the area that I mark on
the<00:01:28.020> map<00:01:28.170> earlier<00:01:28.439> which<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.829> near<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.159> bottom

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the map earlier which is near the bottom

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.850 
the map earlier which is near the bottom
you're<00:01:30.210> gonna<00:01:30.329> want<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.689> start<00:01:30.930> decreasing

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
you're gonna want to start decreasing

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.890 
you're gonna want to start decreasing
your<00:01:31.950> elevation<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.090> why<00:01:33.210> you'll<00:01:33.450> need<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
your elevation this is why you'll need a

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.830 
your elevation this is why you'll need a
vehicle<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.740> two<00:01:34.770> flight<00:01:35.280> modes<00:01:35.549> and

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
vehicle with two flight modes and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.550 
vehicle with two flight modes and
eventually<00:01:36.840> once<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.140> decrease<00:01:37.530> your

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
eventually once you decrease your

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.130 
eventually once you decrease your
elevation<00:01:38.070> enough<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.210> trees<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.720> stuff<00:01:39.930> on

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
elevation enough the trees and stuff on

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.960 
elevation enough the trees and stuff on
top<00:01:40.409> will<00:01:40.590> start<00:01:40.920> turning<00:01:41.070> black<00:01:41.460> decrease<00:01:41.939> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
top will start turning black decrease a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.580 
top will start turning black decrease a
little<00:01:42.420> bit<00:01:42.540> more<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.899> you'll<00:01:43.020> end<00:01:43.229> up<00:01:43.409> in

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
little bit more and you'll end up in

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.520 
little bit more and you'll end up in
this<00:01:43.890> kind<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.610> pitch-black<00:01:45.350> hangar<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
this kind of like pitch-black hangar and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.370 
this kind of like pitch-black hangar and
if<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.640> fly<00:01:47.850> around<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.210> bit<00:01:48.360> BAM<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.110> is

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
if you just fly around a bit BAM that is

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.130 
if you just fly around a bit BAM that is
the<00:01:49.799> spaceship<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.820> use<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.780> between

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the spaceship that you use in between

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.130 
the spaceship that you use in between
the<00:01:52.320> simulations<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.479> land<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.810> top

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the simulations now you can land on top

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.780 
the simulations now you can land on top
of<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.439> run<00:01:55.710> around<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.219> there's<00:01:56.369> some<00:01:56.549> cool

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
of it run around and there's some cool

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.569 
of it run around and there's some cool
things<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.210> happen<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:58.049> sure<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.500> did<00:01:59.369> read

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
things that happen for sure I did read

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.310 
things that happen for sure I did read
somewhere<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.810> inside

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
somewhere that you can get inside

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.889 
somewhere that you can get inside
although<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.189> takes<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.729> lot<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.000> effort<00:02:03.659> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
although it takes a lot of effort and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.679 
although it takes a lot of effort and
it's<00:02:04.649> really<00:02:05.100> really<00:02:05.340> tricky<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.939> wasn't<00:02:06.600> able

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
it's really really tricky I wasn't able

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.229 
it's really really tricky I wasn't able
to<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:07.049> anything<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:08.340> get<00:02:08.459> inside<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.090> did

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
to do anything to get inside but I did

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.580 
to do anything to get inside but I did
run<00:02:09.420> around<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.869> show<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.050> guys<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.289> little<00:02:10.470> bit

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
run around to show you guys a little bit

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.650 
run around to show you guys a little bit
of<00:02:10.679> what's<00:02:10.979> available<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
of what's available and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.090 
of what's available and
I<00:02:12.720> want<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.140> note<00:02:13.290> some<00:02:13.590> really<00:02:13.830> cool<00:02:14.040> things

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
I want to note some really cool things

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.810 
I want to note some really cool things
that<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.610> noticed<00:02:15.410> now<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.220> see<00:02:17.520> all<00:02:17.790> of

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
that I noticed now you can see all of

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.210 
that I noticed now you can see all of
your<00:02:18.120> homies<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.810> spaceship<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.860> do

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
your homies in the spaceship I do

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.580 
your homies in the spaceship I do
believe<00:02:20.730> because<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.660> game<00:02:21.900> thinks<00:02:22.410> you're

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
believe because the game thinks you're

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.580 
believe because the game thinks you're
still<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.100> simulation<00:02:23.790> their<00:02:24.360> AI<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.960> very

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
still in the simulation their AI is very

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.620 
still in the simulation their AI is very
different<00:02:26.130> from<00:02:26.430> what<00:02:26.730> would<00:02:27.000> happen<00:02:27.450> if

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
different from what would happen if

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.450 
different from what would happen if
you're<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.410> actual<00:02:28.740> spaceship<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.340> you

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
you're on the actual spaceship if you

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.090 
you're on the actual spaceship if you
were<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.670> use<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.850> gateway<00:02:30.240> as<00:02:30.750> you'll<00:02:31.500> see<00:02:31.710> here

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
were to use a gateway as you'll see here

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.040 
were to use a gateway as you'll see here
they<00:02:32.340> get<00:02:32.520> suspicious<00:02:33.210> of<00:02:33.390> your<00:02:33.570> movement

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
they get suspicious of your movement

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.630 
they get suspicious of your movement
they<00:02:34.170> get<00:02:34.260> suspicious<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.950> noises<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.400> they

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
they get suspicious of noises and they

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.910 
they get suspicious of noises and they
even<00:02:35.940> look<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.930> attack<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.530> stuff<00:02:37.710> here

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
even look to attack and stuff here

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.410 
even look to attack and stuff here
you'll<00:02:38.040> see<00:02:38.190> them<00:02:38.340> walking<00:02:38.580> with<00:02:38.880> their<00:02:39.030> fists

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
you'll see them walking with their fists

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.790 
you'll see them walking with their fists
up<00:02:39.540> ready<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.870> fight

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
up ready to fight

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.990 
up ready to fight
they<00:02:41.100> don't<00:02:41.280> actually<00:02:41.430> stay<00:02:41.730> stationary

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
they don't actually stay stationary

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.730 
they don't actually stay stationary
where<00:02:42.540> they<00:02:42.690> would<00:02:42.930> normally<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.530> this

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
where they would normally on this

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.770 
where they would normally on this
spaceship<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.940> that's<00:02:45.090> pretty<00:02:45.360> cool<00:02:45.540> if<00:02:45.690> you

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
spaceship so that's pretty cool if you

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.780 
spaceship so that's pretty cool if you
ask<00:02:45.870> me<00:02:46.200> from<00:02:46.710> what<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:46.890> heard<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.220> can<00:02:47.400> try<00:02:47.730> to

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
ask me from what I heard you can try to

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.150 
ask me from what I heard you can try to
use<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.240> blackhole<00:02:49.230> gun<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.800> like

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
use the blackhole gun to like

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.100 
use the blackhole gun to like
glitch<00:02:50.430> your<00:02:50.640> way<00:02:50.760> through<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> wall<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:51.810> I

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
glitch your way through a wall but I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.140 
glitch your way through a wall but I
don't<00:02:52.650> know<00:02:52.740> I<00:02:52.770> couldn't<00:02:53.130> get<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.700> happen

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
don't know I couldn't get that to happen

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.530 
don't know I couldn't get that to happen
and<00:02:54.770> another<00:02:55.770> thing<00:02:56.130> right<00:02:56.490> here<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:57.090> if<00:02:57.420> you

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
and another thing right here is if you

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.330 
and another thing right here is if you
run<00:02:57.750> around<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.440> get<00:02:58.740> into<00:02:59.160> like<00:02:59.310> a

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
run around and you get into like a

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.620 
run around and you get into like a
really<00:02:59.730> bad<00:02:59.910> spot

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
really bad spot

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.660 
really bad spot
you'll<00:03:01.020> fall<00:03:01.350> through<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.950> floor<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.520> then

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
you'll fall through the floor and then

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.970 
you'll fall through the floor and then
fall<00:03:02.940> under<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.540> ship<00:03:03.810> if<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.560> fall<00:03:04.770> under

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
fall under the ship if you fall under

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.040 
fall under the ship if you fall under
the<00:03:05.220> ship<00:03:05.460> you're<00:03:05.910> basically<00:03:06.420> out<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.810> luck

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
the ship you're basically out of luck

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.170 
the ship you're basically out of luck
there's<00:03:07.470> really<00:03:07.800> nothing<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.400> can<00:03:08.730> do<00:03:08.880> as

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
there's really nothing you can do as

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.390 
there's really nothing you can do as
you'll<00:03:09.750> see<00:03:09.930> here<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.200> use<00:03:10.410> my<00:03:10.620> phone<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.100> try<00:03:11.340> to

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
you'll see here I use my phone to try to

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.020 
you'll see here I use my phone to try to
spawn<00:03:11.760> Erik<00:03:12.540> Salem<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.530> me<00:03:13.740> to<00:03:14.250> try<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.490> go<00:03:14.820> back

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
spawn Erik Salem on me to try to go back

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.150 
spawn Erik Salem on me to try to go back
up<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:15.450> where<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.600> came<00:03:15.720> from<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.980> wasn't

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
up to where I came from and I wasn't

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.490 
up to where I came from and I wasn't
successful<00:03:17.870> basically<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:18.959> just<00:03:19.020> stayed

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
successful basically you just stayed

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.470 
successful basically you just stayed
there<00:03:19.709> in<00:03:19.770> this<00:03:20.010> glitch<00:03:20.310> spot<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.060> game

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
there in this glitch spot and the game
