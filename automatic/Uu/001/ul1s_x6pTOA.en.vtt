00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
already generator ready so you can add a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.720 
already generator ready so you can add a
generator<00:00:25.590> quite<00:00:25.920> quite<00:00:26.250> easily<00:00:26.400> because

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
generator quite quite easily because
