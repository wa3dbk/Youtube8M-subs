00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.190 
yellow birth I don't think he's going to
return<00:01:19.020> two<00:01:19.950> seasons<00:01:20.400> Iroh<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.750> be<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> main

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
return two seasons Iroh to be the main

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.920 
return two seasons Iroh to be the main
villain<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.680> think<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.850> they're<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.689> do

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
villain I think that they're going to do

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.670 
villain I think that they're going to do
the<00:01:25.290> obvious<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.280> think<00:01:26.610> Eddie<00:01:26.820> Thawne<00:01:27.240> is

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
the obvious and I think Eddie Thawne is

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.179 
the obvious and I think Eddie Thawne is
actually<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:28.950> zoom<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.299> many<00:01:30.659> people

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
actually going to be zoom so many people

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.710 
actually going to be zoom so many people
well<00:01:32.189> i<00:01:32.220> think<00:01:32.340> i<00:01:32.729> would<00:01:32.850> assume<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.270> many

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
well i think i would assume so many

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.249 
well i think i would assume so many
people<00:01:34.049> assume<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.920> new<00:01:35.659> blue<00:01:36.659> streak

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
people assume that this new blue streak

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.929 
people assume that this new blue streak
that<00:01:37.680> they're<00:01:37.860> seeing<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> trailers<00:01:38.759> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
that they're seeing in the trailers is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.789 
that they're seeing in the trailers is
eddie<00:01:39.689> thawne<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.820> where<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:43.229> know<00:01:43.380> when<00:01:43.619> a

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
