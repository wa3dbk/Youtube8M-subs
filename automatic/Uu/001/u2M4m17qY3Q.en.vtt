 I would like to learn how good they can be 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.200
 leave there in the comments part 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.899
 and very surely in the next 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.690
 weeks will be ready left friends 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.719
 without being more welcome to the channel and we 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.969
 we see at the end of the video very well let's 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.200
 to divide the song into two parts that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.780
 it is stanza and chorus 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.860
 it's very simple the stanzas have the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 following family chords 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.939
 If we see down to the third network 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.939
 have 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.620
 mmm 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.250
 and which has 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.410
 I repeat what is 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.009
 yes 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.009
 or 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.390
 i 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.390
 good 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.270
 and repeat exactly three months the 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.350
 stanza before alcohol changes a bit 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.350
 I do not 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.650
 Thank you 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.960
 for the choir they have the same chords 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.060
 of the introduction then if you already know 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.160
 introduction is going to be very easy which is 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.410
 of the garment if you do not know it here 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.240
 I leave the link for them to go and be 40 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.830
 ready then the choir has the 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.830
 following chords m flat 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.380
 two 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.709
 why not 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.220
 and the major flat we see 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.420
 after the chorus well that what has 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.690
 the same harmony the stanzas 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.690
 yes 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.220
 Y 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.550
 but the chorus that makes it soft 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.550
 with the same edges 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.190
 it only changes and the last 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.190
 to 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.200
 that chord change because instead of 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:37.280
 do in A flat major does it in the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.280
 right hand of alba 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.890
 and then we go to jazz tuning the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.709
 song we are always going to take 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.299
