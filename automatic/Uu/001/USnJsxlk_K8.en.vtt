00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.420
 aci vallelunga participates in this 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.780
 project with great interest thinking 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.940
 to be able to contribute by supplying the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.490
 technologies and facilities to reproduce 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.770
 the best test conditions of 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.070
 vehicles our interest is great 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.250
 since the attention that has been placed 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.520
 in the development of the aci implant 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.950
 vallelunga which is not just a track but is 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.820
 a set of equipment and facilities 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.340
 for the automotive sector attention 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.420
 I was saying for safety and the environment 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.400
 the station has been enormous 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.690
 the one-megawatt photovoltaic system 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.070
 which fully supports us for what 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.220
 regards energy production 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.720
 electric even produces a 30 per 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.440
 one hundred more than the entire requirement 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.960
 system or the recovery system 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.520
 of the water that is used in the 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.250
 safe driving center that 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.039
 recovers and purifies all water 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.039
 used putting it back in circulation 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.989
 institute of advanced technologies for 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.150
 the energy together with Renewable.it 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.099
 precisely the result of joint work has 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.750
 developed this protocol for testing 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.329
 of electric cars 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.690
 this protocol basically based 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.610
 on two types of tests 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.640
 the first one to evaluate the dynamics 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.650
 of the car the second one to evaluate the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.650
 actual car consumption 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.549
 among the Italians the 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.530
 awareness that today is possible 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.230
 move without polluting or otherwise 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.760
 tilting very little 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.489
 and as a sector particularly 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.519
 new this and very few exist 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.439
 information still in the network i 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.170
 users and especially ours 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:28.379
 readers those from Renewable.it 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.489
 they asked to give them 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.859
 information of indications for 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.639
 the selection criteria therefore came to us 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:38.739
 in mind this idea of ​​working at a 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:43.810
 project that we then developed with 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:46.870
 two exceptional life partners and cnr as 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.079
 scientific partner and vallelunga spa 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.239
 as a logistics partner to get to 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:55.419
 building a real one 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.750
 test protocol that can have the 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:01.599
 purpose of offering users 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.599
 finally precise information but 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.510
 also easy to access to get to 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.000
 choose their electric car or 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.129
 hybrid and then bring them closer together 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.879
 chosen as much as possible to them 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.879
 needs
