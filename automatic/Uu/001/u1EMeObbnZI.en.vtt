the way down put it right into the gas

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.109 
the way down put it right into the gas
can<00:01:17.860> I<00:01:17.890> can<00:01:18.130> go<00:01:18.250> ahead<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.549> use<00:01:18.640> that<00:01:18.670> another

that way when I go to put the hood prop

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.610 
that way when I go to put the hood prop
back<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.450> put<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.720> right<00:02:18.750> where<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.110> goes

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
back on and put it right where it goes

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.150 
back on and put it right where it goes
I<00:02:19.650> also<00:02:20.580> before<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.540> remove<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.080> hood<00:02:22.290> traced

and that way when I put the hood back on

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.820 
and that way when I put the hood back on
I'll<00:02:27.510> be<00:02:27.630> able<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.870> align<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.230> perfectly<00:02:28.440> and

as<00:03:08.220> it's<00:03:08.370> cheap<00:03:08.700> for<00:03:08.880> example<00:03:09.360> I'm<00:03:09.420> going<00:03:09.450> to

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
as it's cheap for example I'm going to

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.210 
as it's cheap for example I'm going to
put<00:03:09.780> new<00:03:09.930> transmission<00:03:10.590> seals<00:03:10.860> where<00:03:11.130> the

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
put new transmission seals where the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.520 
put new transmission seals where the
shafts<00:03:11.670> went<00:03:11.820> into<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.060> transmission<00:03:12.570> it's<00:03:13.380> a

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
shafts went into the transmission it's a

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.900 
shafts went into the transmission it's a
whole<00:03:13.770> lot<00:03:13.950> easier<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.400> do<00:03:14.550> now<00:03:14.580> when

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
whole lot easier to do now when

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.550 
whole lot easier to do now when
everything's<00:03:15.270> apart<00:03:15.690> than<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.050> is<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.290> have<00:03:16.410> to

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
everything's apart than it is to have to

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.820 
everything's apart than it is to have to
go<00:03:16.680> back<00:03:16.860> later<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.310> replace<00:03:17.640> pieces<00:03:18.830> the

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
go back later and replace pieces the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.280 
go back later and replace pieces the
other<00:03:20.010> thing<00:03:20.250> I'm<00:03:20.400> going<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.670> do<00:03:20.880> is<00:03:21.209> use<00:03:22.020> a

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
other thing I'm going to do is use a

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.830 
other thing I'm going to do is use a
throttle<00:03:22.830> body<00:03:23.010> off<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.610> car<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.600> newer

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
throttle body off of the car the newer

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.020 
throttle body off of the car the newer
cars<00:03:25.170> have<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.560> throttle<00:03:25.920> position<00:03:26.220> sensor

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
cars have a throttle position sensor

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.760 
cars have a throttle position sensor
which<00:03:27.180> tells<00:03:27.209> where<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.810> throttle<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.530> when

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
which tells where the throttle is when

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.890 
which tells where the throttle is when
you<00:03:28.860> put<00:03:29.070> on<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.280> gas<00:03:29.489> that<00:03:30.360> throttle

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
you put on the gas that throttle

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.449 
you put on the gas that throttle
position<00:03:31.020> sensor<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:31.830> all<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.100> ones<00:03:32.280> I've

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
position sensor of all the ones I've

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.120 
position sensor of all the ones I've
checked<00:03:32.730> has<00:03:32.940> been<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.120> 5k<00:03:33.750> pot<00:03:34.170> which<00:03:34.860> is<00:03:35.040> the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
checked has been a 5k pot which is the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.220 
checked has been a 5k pot which is the
same<00:03:35.370> thing<00:03:35.580> most<00:03:35.850> electric<00:03:36.810> car<00:03:36.989> motor

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
same thing most electric car motor

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.960 
same thing most electric car motor
controllers<00:03:37.769> want<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.130> see<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.400> control<00:03:38.760> your
