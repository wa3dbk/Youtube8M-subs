00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
pretty stuck in here except for my

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.660 
pretty stuck in here except for my
AIRAID<00:00:17.580> intake<00:00:17.869> it<00:00:18.869> has<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.260> carb<00:00:20.100> sticker<00:00:20.430> on

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
AIRAID intake it has the carb sticker on

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.189 
AIRAID intake it has the carb sticker on
it<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.910> makes<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.180> 50<00:00:21.449> state<00:00:21.689> legal<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.109> you

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
it that makes it 50 state legal so you

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.830 
it that makes it 50 state legal so you
can<00:00:22.289> get<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.500> smogged<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:24.510> only<00:00:24.689> other

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
can get it smogged the only other

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.839 
can get it smogged the only other
difference<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.949> wiring<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> sound

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
difference is the wiring for the sound

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.250 
difference is the wiring for the sound
system<00:00:27.300> which<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.510> right<00:00:27.689> there<00:00:27.720> which<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.109> all

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
system which is right there which is all

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.470 
system which is right there which is all
done<00:00:28.439> professionally<00:00:30.859> as<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> true<00:00:32.250> fiber<00:00:32.579> ram

air<00:00:33.719> hood<00:00:35.570> it<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> functional<00:00:37.350> hood<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
air hood it is a functional hood so the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.260 
air hood it is a functional hood so the
air<00:00:38.340> does<00:00:38.610> go<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.969> engine<00:00:39.239> compartment

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
okay now it's got this edge evolution

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.520 
okay now it's got this edge evolution
program<00:03:43.160> right<00:03:43.430> there<00:03:43.670> that<00:03:43.910> was<00:03:44.530> custom

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
program right there that was custom

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.350 
program right there that was custom
program<00:03:45.920> by<00:03:46.100> power-hungry<00:03:46.460> performance<00:03:47.150> to

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
program by power-hungry performance to

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.660 
program by power-hungry performance to
be<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.480> griffon<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:49.250> it's<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.400> little<00:03:49.520> bit

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
be a griffon so it's a little bit

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.140 
be a griffon so it's a little bit
different<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:51.650> set<00:03:52.280> up<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.490> truck<00:03:52.790> with<00:03:53.030> the

different I set up the truck with the
push<00:03:53.330> button<00:03:53.660> start<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:54.320> when<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.590> start<00:03:54.920> it

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070

ignition and to start the truck you

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.510 
ignition and to start the truck you
actually<00:03:59.710> you<00:04:00.710> actually<00:04:00.830> have<00:04:01.070> to<00:04:01.160> press<00:04:01.310> the

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520

actually you actually have to press the
cigarette<00:04:02.060> lighter

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
cigarette lighter

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.740 
cigarette lighter
it<00:04:03.320> has<00:04:03.500> a<00:04:03.530> valet<00:04:04.310> switch<00:04:04.850> which<00:04:05.240> is<00:04:05.270> behind

the dash that allows you to turn it off

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.250 
the dash that allows you to turn it off
so<00:04:07.610> you<00:04:07.670> can<00:04:07.790> turn<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.210> car<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.570> regularly<00:04:09.170> if

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.439 

but<00:04:48.129> the<00:04:48.189> video<00:04:48.399> screams<00:04:48.759> really<00:04:48.939> good

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.549 

systems<00:04:52.449> great<00:04:52.809> it<00:04:52.959> actually<00:04:53.259> comes<00:04:53.469> with

00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:53.559 
systems great it actually comes with

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:58.039 
systems great it actually comes with
this<00:04:53.709> remote<00:04:54.069> right<00:04:54.279> here<00:04:54.549> which<00:04:54.669> is<00:04:54.789> nice

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:58.049 

00:04:58.049 --> 00:05:00.389 

sure<00:04:59.049> it's<00:04:59.199> hard<00:04:59.379> to<00:04:59.499> listen<00:04:59.709> this<00:04:59.860> system<00:05:00.279> but

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:00.399 
sure it's hard to listen this system but

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:03.709 
sure it's hard to listen this system but
the<00:05:00.519> Polk<00:05:00.699> Momo<00:05:01.059> speakers<00:05:01.479> are<00:05:01.629> really<00:05:01.869> great

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719
