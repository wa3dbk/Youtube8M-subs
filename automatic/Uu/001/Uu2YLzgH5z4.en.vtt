because<00:00:55.980> third<00:00:56.820> person<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:58.079> personal

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
because third person is a personal

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.470 
because third person is a personal
favorite<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.340> mine<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> guess<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.879> could<00:01:00.000> say<00:01:00.239> I

for<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:19.320> here's<00:01:19.830> my<00:01:20.090> view<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.450> third

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
for this but here's my view of third

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.880 
for this but here's my view of third
person<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.890> see<00:01:23.759> third<00:01:24.000> person<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> game<00:01:25.619> type

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
person I see third person as a game type

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.620 
person I see third person as a game type
that<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.610> either<00:01:26.759> play<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> or<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.450> don't

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that you either play it or you don't

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.600 
that you either play it or you don't
there<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.409> don't<00:01:28.530> really<00:01:28.650> go<00:01:28.979> back<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.220> forth

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
there you don't really go back and forth

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.539 
there you don't really go back and forth
the<00:01:30.180> people<00:01:30.329> who<00:01:30.570> play<00:01:30.780> third<00:01:31.049> person

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
the people who play third person

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.640 
the people who play third person
typically<00:01:32.549> I'd<00:01:32.970> say<00:01:33.240> only<00:01:33.720> play<00:01:33.930> third<00:01:34.229> person

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
typically I'd say only play third person

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.039 
typically I'd say only play third person
it's<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.189> game<00:01:35.369> type<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.600> really<00:01:36.990> don't

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
it's a game type that you really don't

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.539 
it's a game type that you really don't
want<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> switch<00:01:37.439> back<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.650> forth<00:01:38.009> because<00:01:38.189> in

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
want to switch back and forth because in

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.789 
want to switch back and forth because in
many<00:01:38.939> ways<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.540> almost<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.990> playing<00:01:40.140> an

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
many ways it's almost like playing an

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.760 
many ways it's almost like playing an
entirely<00:01:41.280> different<00:01:41.970> game<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.290> sure

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
entirely different game and I know sure

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.319 
entirely different game and I know sure
some<00:01:44.130> people<00:01:44.220> probably<00:01:44.700> disagree<00:01:45.060> with<00:01:45.149> me

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
some people probably disagree with me

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.649 
some people probably disagree with me
but<00:01:45.869> third<00:01:46.259> person<00:01:46.770> call<00:01:47.369> duty<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.970> played<00:01:48.630> a

but third person call duty is played a

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.889 
but third person call duty is played a
lot<00:01:48.990> differently<00:01:49.490> especially<00:01:50.490> because

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
lot differently especially because

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.330 
lot differently especially because

counter<00:03:14.030> this<00:03:14.180> which<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.510> basically<00:03:14.810> just

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
counter this which is basically just

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.140 
counter this which is basically just
like<00:03:15.109> sitting<00:03:15.440> as<00:03:15.620> far<00:03:16.280> back<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.850> map<00:03:17.000> as

like sitting as far back and the map as

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.660 
like sitting as far back and the map as
possible<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.590> leads<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.100> some<00:03:19.190> pretty

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
possible and this leads to some pretty

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.930 
possible and this leads to some pretty
slow<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.480> annoying

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
including the fact that I'm playing

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.290 
including the fact that I'm playing
third<00:04:48.410> person<00:04:48.860> of<00:04:48.920> course<00:04:49.190> just<00:04:49.940> because

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
third person of course just because

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.960 
third person of course just because
there's<00:04:50.600> only<00:04:50.720> 5,000<00:04:51.650> points<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:52.130> get<00:04:52.250> instead

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
there's only 5,000 points to get instead

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.840 
there's only 5,000 points to get instead
of<00:04:53.120> oops<00:04:54.040> alright<00:04:55.040> so<00:04:55.220> I<00:04:55.250> guess<00:04:55.400> yeah<00:04:55.670> then

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
of oops alright so I guess yeah then

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.340 
of oops alright so I guess yeah then
nuke<00:04:56.030> isn't<00:04:56.330> happening<00:04:56.690> because<00:04:57.110> there's

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
nuke isn't happening because there's

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.430 
nuke isn't happening because there's
only<00:04:57.410> 5,000<00:04:58.040> points<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.340> get<00:04:58.460> instead<00:04:58.850> of

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
only 5,000 points to get instead of

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.650 
only 5,000 points to get instead of
7,500<00:05:00.440> so<00:05:00.980> this<00:05:01.550> game<00:05:01.760> will<00:05:01.910> be<00:05:02.000> lower<00:05:02.240> scoring

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
7,500 so this game will be lower scoring

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.420 
7,500 so this game will be lower scoring
than<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.350> lot<00:05:03.740> of<00:05:03.830> my<00:05:03.890> other<00:05:04.040> team<00:05:04.250> deathmatch
