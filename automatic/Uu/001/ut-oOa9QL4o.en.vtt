00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
honest you know whether just killing a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.620 
honest you know whether just killing a
player<00:01:11.070> counts<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:11.670> being<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.909> bad<00:01:12.060> sport<00:01:12.090> or

concept oh i think there's different
environments<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.580> choose<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> play

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
