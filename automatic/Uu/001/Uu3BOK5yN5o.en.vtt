00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
the core of it is still growing and

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.540 
the core of it is still growing and
producing<00:00:28.570> something<00:00:29.109> the<00:00:29.619> way<00:00:29.830> we<00:00:29.949> do<00:00:30.070> it<00:00:30.220> has

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
producing something the way we do it has

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.700 
producing something the way we do it has
changed<00:00:30.939> we've<00:00:31.359> got<00:00:31.599> way<00:00:31.810> more<00:00:31.840> technology

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
changed we've got way more technology

changed we've got way more technology
we've<00:00:32.920> got<00:00:33.129> way<00:00:33.550> better<00:00:33.790> equipment<00:00:34.210> if<00:00:34.540> this

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
we've got way better equipment if this

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.569 
we've got way better equipment if this
is<00:00:34.960> representative<00:00:35.559> you<00:00:35.829> have<00:00:36.010> more<00:00:36.190> melons

that<00:00:57.909> you<00:00:58.239> lose<00:00:58.480> everything<00:00:58.899> and<00:00:59.260> so<00:00:59.800> what<00:01:00.190> are

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
that you lose everything and so what are

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.939 
that you lose everything and so what are
you<00:01:00.309> doing<00:01:00.550> it's<00:01:01.000> all<00:01:01.420> at<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.809> mercy<00:01:02.230> of<00:01:02.260> the

weather a few less inches of rain is the

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.380 
weather a few less inches of rain is the
difference<00:01:05.830> between<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:06.190> good<00:01:06.520> crop<00:01:06.789> and<00:01:07.119> no
