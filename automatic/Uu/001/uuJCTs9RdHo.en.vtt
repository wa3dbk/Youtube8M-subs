for me did not germ I didn't don't know
if<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> bad<00:00:42.090> seeds<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
if it was just the bad seeds or the

technique I used or I don't know what it
is<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.350> got<00:00:46.530> different<00:00:46.860> seeds<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.250> year

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
is but I got different seeds this year

is but I got different seeds this year
and<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.329> want<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.629> see<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.200> salary<00:00:49.590> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and I want to see if I can get salary to

and I want to see if I can get salary to
grow<00:00:49.969> dusty<00:00:50.969> miller<00:00:51.120> requires<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.170> little<00:00:52.440> more

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
grow dusty miller requires a little more

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.250 
grow dusty miller requires a little more
time<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.730> platinum<00:00:53.940> today<00:00:54.449> both<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.170> them

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
time so I'm platinum today both of them

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.400 
time so I'm platinum today both of them
the<00:00:55.440> light<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.129> germination<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.230> I'll<00:00:58.230> bring

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the light for germination and I'll bring

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.110 
the light for germination and I'll bring
me<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.680> close<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:58.949> we'll<00:00:59.430> plant<00:00:59.730> them<00:00:59.879> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
me in close and we'll plant them it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.439 
me in close and we'll plant them it
would<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> pretty<00:01:00.570> quick<00:01:01.079> process<00:01:02.449> all

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
would be a pretty quick process all

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.289 
would be a pretty quick process all
right<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.170> got<00:01:04.470> my<00:01:04.500> soil<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:05.369> peat<00:01:06.150> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
right I got my soil my peat and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.170 
right I got my soil my peat and
vermiculite<00:01:06.720> soil<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.530> sometimes<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.970> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
vermiculite soil I sometimes like to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.120 
vermiculite soil I sometimes like to
just<00:01:09.360> wet<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.869> down<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> little<00:01:10.409> bit<00:01:10.740> before<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
just wet this down a little bit before I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.520 
just wet this down a little bit before I
get<00:01:11.369> started<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:16.710> seeds<00:01:17.250> will<00:01:17.490> germinate

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
get started the seeds will germinate

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.310 
get started the seeds will germinate
real<00:01:19.530> nice<00:01:20.810> its<00:01:21.810> moisture<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.979> there<00:01:24.259> now<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
real nice its moisture on there now the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.770 
real nice its moisture on there now the
dusty<00:01:25.799> miller<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.610> pretty<00:01:26.939> easy<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.330> grow<00:01:27.509> from

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
dusty miller is pretty easy to grow from

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.109 
dusty miller is pretty easy to grow from
seed

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.690 

very<00:01:33.600> tiny<00:01:33.960> seed<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.679> several<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.369> here

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
very tiny seed I have several in here

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.910 
very tiny seed I have several in here
and<00:01:36.299> there's<00:01:36.630> my<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.869> know<00:01:37.170> always<00:01:37.439> mark<00:01:37.740> your

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
and there's my you know always mark your

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.620 
and there's my you know always mark your
trays<00:01:38.539> but<00:01:39.539> with<00:01:39.960> these<00:01:40.200> they're<00:01:40.679> tiny<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.630> I

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
trays but with these they're tiny but I

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.160 
trays but with these they're tiny but I
just<00:01:42.899> taken<00:01:43.259> scatter<00:01:43.649> them<00:01:44.929> with<00:01:45.929> my<00:01:46.109> fingers

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
just taken scatter them with my fingers

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.679 
just taken scatter them with my fingers
I<00:01:46.829> mean<00:01:47.039> you<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.310> also<00:01:47.460> use<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> sand<00:01:48.149> method

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
I mean you can also use the sand method

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.539 
I mean you can also use the sand method
of<00:01:48.899> mixing<00:01:49.289> it<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.500> sand<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.130> I've<00:01:50.280> told

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
of mixing it with sand that I've told

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.029 
of mixing it with sand that I've told
you<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.240> my<00:01:51.450> other<00:01:51.479> videos<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.799> can

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
you about in my other videos but I can

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.330 
you about in my other videos but I can
see<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:53.459> as<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.789> scatter<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.569> they<00:01:55.560> are<00:01:55.799> you

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
see these as I scatter and they are you

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.770 
see these as I scatter and they are you
know<00:01:56.459> it's<00:01:56.579> scattering<00:01:57.000> them<00:01:57.090> pretty<00:01:57.359> nice<00:01:57.569> I

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
know it's scattering them pretty nice I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.300 
know it's scattering them pretty nice I
think<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.289> a<00:02:01.319> little<00:02:01.530> more<00:02:01.740> seed<00:02:02.069> here

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
think I have a little more seed here

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.940 
think I have a little more seed here
than<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.729> need<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.509> tray<00:02:03.959> so<00:02:04.859> I'm

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
than I need for this tray so I'm

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.499 
than I need for this tray so I'm
probably<00:02:05.130> not<00:02:05.399> gonna<00:02:05.549> put<00:02:05.819> quite<00:02:06.030> all<00:02:06.239> of<00:02:06.360> them

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
probably not gonna put quite all of them

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.999 
probably not gonna put quite all of them
in<00:02:06.599> there<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.959> don't<00:02:07.049> want<00:02:07.319> to<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.500> too<00:02:07.739> crowded

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
in there I don't want to be too crowded

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.309 
in there I don't want to be too crowded
because<00:02:08.700> they<00:02:08.910> give<00:02:09.119> they<00:02:09.360> tend<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.899> get<00:02:10.049> root

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
because they give they tend to get root

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.059 
because they give they tend to get root

had<00:02:14.310> some<00:02:14.519> leftover<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.660> am<00:02:15.840> gonna<00:02:16.049> put<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
had some leftover so I am gonna put a

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.890 
had some leftover so I am gonna put a
little<00:02:16.500> extra<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.010> because<00:02:17.900> germination

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
little extra in because germination

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.199 
little extra in because germination
probably<00:02:19.440> won't<00:02:19.590> be<00:02:19.680> quite<00:02:19.890> as<00:02:19.920> good<00:02:20.280> from

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
probably won't be quite as good from

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.289 
probably won't be quite as good from
that<00:02:21.420> last<00:02:21.690> year<00:02:21.930> seeds<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:24.060> how<00:02:24.209> I'm

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
that last year seeds so that is how I'm

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.350 
that last year seeds so that is how I'm
gonna<00:02:24.420> do<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:25.190> once<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.340> get<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.640> done<00:02:26.700> as

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
gonna do it once I get that done as

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.710 
gonna do it once I get that done as
always<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:28.140> just<00:02:28.410> water<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.769> man<00:02:29.099> now<00:02:30.030> these

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
always I just water a man now these

always I just water a man now these
require<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.950> for<00:02:32.220> germination<00:02:32.660> what<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.690> like

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
require like for germination what I like

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.839 
require like for germination what I like
to<00:02:34.170> do<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.709> sometimes<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.220> don't<00:02:35.250> even<00:02:35.549> cover

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
to do and sometimes I don't even cover

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.180 
to do and sometimes I don't even cover
the<00:02:36.090> seed<00:02:36.329> but<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.350> add<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.889> very

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the seed but I like to add just a very

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.199 
the seed but I like to add just a very
light<00:02:38.600> peat<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.680> vermiculite<00:02:41.519> max<00:02:42.060> I

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
light peat and that vermiculite max I

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.729 
light peat and that vermiculite max I
just<00:02:42.239> very<00:02:43.079> lightly<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.720> know<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:46.019> put<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
just very lightly you know that put the

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.629 
just very lightly you know that put the
soil<00:02:46.980> over<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> seed<00:02:48.079> water<00:02:49.079> move<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.799> and

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
soil over the seed water move in and

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.349 
soil over the seed water move in and
they<00:02:51.000> don't<00:02:51.180> put<00:02:51.359> them<00:02:51.480> under<00:02:51.780> lights<00:02:53.359> because

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
they don't put them under lights because

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.259 
they don't put them under lights because
as<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:55.109> says<00:02:55.349> any<00:02:55.650> light<00:02:55.920> for<00:02:56.160> germination<00:02:56.549> so

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
as it says any light for germination so

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.120 
as it says any light for germination so
I'll<00:02:57.420> have<00:02:57.599> my<00:02:57.720> shop<00:02:57.959> lights<00:02:58.230> over<00:02:58.530> these<00:02:58.709> and

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
and celery obviously is a little

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.170 
and celery obviously is a little
trickier<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:16.919> grow

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.610 

I'm<00:04:23.810> gonna<00:04:24.050> give<00:04:24.830> just<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.280> very<00:04:25.610> little<00:04:26.620> light

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
I'm gonna give just a very little light

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.790 
I'm gonna give just a very little light
coating<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.850> soil<00:04:29.270> again<00:04:29.780> like<00:04:30.050> I<00:04:30.199> did<00:04:30.440> on<00:04:30.470> the

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
coating of soil again like I did on the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:46.300 
coating of soil again like I did on the
others<00:04:39.130> after<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.160> get<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.520> done<00:04:40.820> I<00:04:43.930> put<00:04:45.310> the
