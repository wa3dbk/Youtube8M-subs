came<00:00:49.829> across<00:00:50.129> this

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
came across this

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.060 
came across this
I<00:00:51.030> usually<00:00:51.629> give<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> Bobbi<00:00:52.110> Brown<00:00:52.260> creamy

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.060 
I usually give the Bobbi Brown creamy
concealer<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.969> honey<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.410> really<00:00:55.829> didn't

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
concealer and honey but I really didn't

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.709 
concealer and honey but I really didn't
feel<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.190> buying<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.760> new<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.600> let

it's<00:01:02.340> comparable<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.480> actually<00:01:03.870> is

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it's comparable and it actually is

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.560 
it's comparable and it actually is
pretty<00:01:04.260> good<00:01:04.530> um<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.939> consistency<00:01:06.450> is

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
pretty good um the consistency is

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.539 
pretty good um the consistency is
similar<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> Bobbi<00:01:07.770> Brown<00:01:07.890> they're<00:01:08.310> both

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
similar to the Bobbi Brown they're both

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.859 
similar to the Bobbi Brown they're both
very<00:01:08.760> creamy<00:01:10.280> obviously<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.729> know<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.180> Bobbi

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.870 
Brown
um<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:15.439> think<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.650> Bobbi<00:01:16.890> Brown<00:01:17.189> has<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> little

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
um I think that Bobbi Brown has a little

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.340 
um I think that Bobbi Brown has a little
bit<00:01:18.000> better<00:01:18.360> coverage<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.049> don't<00:01:19.229> have

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
bit better coverage that you don't have

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.580 
bit better coverage that you don't have
to<00:01:19.470> use<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:19.799> much<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.970> know<00:01:21.119> um<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:22.439> body

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
to use as much but you know um the body
