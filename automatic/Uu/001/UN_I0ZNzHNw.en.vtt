to go and spot I'm just sitting on there

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.930 
to go and spot I'm just sitting on there
and<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:47.040> did<00:03:47.190> tell<00:03:47.340> people<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.730> was<00:03:47.820> gonna

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.360 
and I did tell people that I was gonna
go<00:03:48.090> into<00:03:48.240> court<00:03:48.480> but<00:03:48.750> anyway<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.070> my

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
go into court but anyway that is my

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.790 
go into court but anyway that is my
monitor<00:03:51.060> here<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:51.810> obviously<00:03:52.290> this<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.500> quite

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
monitor here so obviously this is quite

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.620 
monitor here so obviously this is quite
an<00:03:52.860> old<00:03:52.980> monitor<00:03:53.400> but<00:03:53.550> it's<00:03:53.700> really<00:03:53.970> nice<00:03:54.240> I'm

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
an old monitor but it's really nice I'm

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.900 
an old monitor but it's really nice I'm
not<00:03:54.780> really<00:03:54.930> sure<00:03:55.020> how<00:03:55.410> big<00:03:55.560> is<00:03:55.710> I<00:03:55.980> think<00:03:56.640> it's

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
not really sure how big is I think it's

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.800 
not really sure how big is I think it's
like<00:03:57.030> 24-inch

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
like 24-inch

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.960 
like 24-inch
that<00:03:58.170> one's<00:03:58.320> 21<00:03:58.950> inch<00:03:59.100> I'm<00:03:59.250> pretty<00:03:59.460> sure<00:03:59.610> so

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
that one's 21 inch I'm pretty sure so

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.480 
that one's 21 inch I'm pretty sure so
there<00:04:00.660> be<00:04:00.810> different<00:04:01.200> but<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.950> route<00:04:02.130> roughly

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
there be different but the route roughly

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.030 
there be different but the route roughly
about<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.700> same<00:04:02.790> size<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.770> as<00:04:04.770> you<00:04:04.890> can<00:04:04.980> see

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
about the same size and as you can see

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.070

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
don't use any of them apart from 1 &amp; 2

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.730 
don't use any of them apart from 1 &amp; 2
which<00:04:56.040> is<00:04:56.190> for<00:04:56.430> like<00:04:56.550> sort<00:04:56.820> of<00:04:56.910> odd<00:04:57.170> like<00:04:58.170> if<00:04:58.590> I

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
which is for like sort of odd like if I

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.380 
which is for like sort of odd like if I
want<00:04:58.920> to<00:04:59.010> quickly<00:04:59.400> change<00:04:59.700> to<00:04:59.880> my<00:04:59.970> sword<00:05:00.210> on<00:05:00.300> my

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
want to quickly change to my sword on my

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.940 
want to quickly change to my sword on my
rod<00:05:00.570> I<00:05:00.600> can<00:05:00.870> just<00:05:00.990> press<00:05:01.500> 1<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:01.740> that's

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
rod I can just press 1 and that's

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.530 
rod I can just press 1 and that's
obviously<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.400> same<00:05:02.640> as<00:05:02.790> pressing<00:05:03.180> 1<00:05:03.330> on<00:05:03.420> the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
obviously the same as pressing 1 on the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.830 
obviously the same as pressing 1 on the
key<00:05:03.690> down<00:05:04.380> there

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
key down there

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.830 
key down there
so<00:05:05.470> that's<00:05:06.220> kind<00:05:06.400> of<00:05:06.460> that<00:05:06.660> that's<00:05:07.660> kind<00:05:07.810> of

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
so that's kind of that that's kind of

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.510 
so that's kind of that that's kind of
the<00:05:07.960> main<00:05:08.110> part<00:05:08.290> that<00:05:08.380> setup<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:09.040> obviously

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
the main part that setup and obviously

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.680 
the main part that setup and obviously
down<00:05:09.700> here<00:05:09.910> you<00:05:10.000> guys<00:05:10.150> know<00:05:10.360> I've<00:05:10.450> got<00:05:10.570> my
