be<00:01:57.430> known<00:01:57.549> as<00:01:57.969> a<00:01:58.000> wasted<00:01:58.659> attack<00:01:59.079> in<00:01:59.350> clan<00:01:59.799> wars

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
be known as a wasted attack in clan wars

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.550 
be known as a wasted attack in clan wars
you<00:02:01.060> have<00:02:01.180> all<00:02:01.390> been<00:02:01.570> in<00:02:01.600> situations<00:02:01.869> where<00:02:02.530> a

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
you have all been in situations where a

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.800 
you have all been in situations where a
base<00:02:02.859> has<00:02:03.159> been<00:02:03.189> one<00:02:03.609> start<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.210> another

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
base has been one start and another

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.870 
base has been one start and another
clanmate<00:02:05.259> comes<00:02:05.500> along<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:06.009> also<00:02:06.369> one<00:02:06.549> stars

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
clanmate comes along and also one stars

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.330 
clanmate comes along and also one stars
the<00:02:07.090> same<00:02:07.329> base<00:02:07.719> this<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.710> considered<00:02:09.190> a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
the same base this is considered a

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.700 
the same base this is considered a
redundant<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.090> wasted<00:02:10.509> attack<00:02:10.810> mainly

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
redundant and wasted attack mainly

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.020 
redundant and wasted attack mainly
because<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.160> second<00:02:12.490> attack<00:02:12.670> didn't

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
because the second attack didn't

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.970 
because the second attack didn't
contribute<00:02:13.330> anything<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.140> clan<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:14.740> terms

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
contribute anything to the clan in terms

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.280 
contribute anything to the clan in terms

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
you look at the people that attacked me

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.820 
you look at the people that attacked me
it<00:02:48.820> was<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.120> number<00:02:49.360> 14<00:02:49.780> spot<00:02:50.080> who<00:02:50.320> was<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.530> town

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
it was the number 14 spot who was a town

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.430 
it was the number 14 spot who was a town
hall<00:02:51.010> 10<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.970> number<00:02:52.270> 32<00:02:52.720> spot<00:02:53.020> which<00:02:53.230> was<00:02:53.410> a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
hall 10 the number 32 spot which was a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.310 
hall 10 the number 32 spot which was a
town<00:02:53.860> hall<00:02:54.040> 9<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:55.120> number<00:02:55.540> 50<00:02:55.870> spot<00:02:56.140> which

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
town hall 9 and the number 50 spot which

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.949 
town hall 9 and the number 50 spot which
was<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.590> town<00:02:56.800> hall<00:02:57.010> 8<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:58.330> if<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.600> think<00:02:58.630> about

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
was a town hall 8 so if you think about

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.170 
was a town hall 8 so if you think about
these<00:02:59.290> three<00:02:59.709> attacks<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.250> got<00:03:00.459> one<00:03:00.850> star

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
these three attacks that got one star

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.140 
these three attacks that got one star
total<00:03:01.780> off<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:02.620> me<00:03:02.770> you<00:03:03.459> could<00:03:03.640> imagine<00:03:03.850> that

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
total off of me you could imagine that

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.790 
total off of me you could imagine that
these<00:03:04.300> three<00:03:04.600> attacks<00:03:04.990> could<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.410> instead

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
these three attacks could have instead

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.100 
these three attacks could have instead
been<00:03:05.860> used<00:03:06.370> on<00:03:06.610> three<00:03:07.150> different<00:03:07.540> players

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
been used on three different players

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.770 
been used on three different players
perhaps<00:03:09.040> for<00:03:09.220> an<00:03:09.310> average<00:03:09.610> of<00:03:09.730> two<00:03:10.000> stars<00:03:10.570> each

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
perhaps for an average of two stars each

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.380 
perhaps for an average of two stars each
or<00:03:10.990> even<00:03:11.200> three<00:03:11.590> stars<00:03:11.890> each<00:03:12.100> for<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:12.940> total<00:03:12.970> of

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
or even three stars each for a total of

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.590 
or even three stars each for a total of
six<00:03:13.750> stars<00:03:14.080> or<00:03:14.380> nine<00:03:14.860> stars<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:16.180> essentially

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
six stars or nine stars so essentially

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.480 
six stars or nine stars so essentially
what<00:03:16.780> am<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:17.020> giving<00:03:17.260> up<00:03:17.530> when<00:03:17.860> i<00:03:17.890> leave<00:03:18.130> my<00:03:18.280> town

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
what am I giving up when i leave my town

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.030 
what am I giving up when i leave my town
hall<00:03:18.700> outside<00:03:19.080> well<00:03:20.080> i'm<00:03:20.200> giving<00:03:20.470> up<00:03:20.560> one<00:03:20.770> star

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
hall outside well i'm giving up one star

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.430 
hall outside well i'm giving up one star
there's<00:03:21.520> no<00:03:21.730> disagreement<00:03:22.390> about<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.840> but

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
there's no disagreement about that but

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.680 
there's no disagreement about that but
even<00:03:23.800> if<00:03:23.920> only<00:03:24.160> one<00:03:24.340> person<00:03:24.580> attacks<00:03:25.269> me<00:03:25.510> for

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
even if only one person attacks me for

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.150 
even if only one person attacks me for
one<00:03:25.840> star<00:03:26.140> they<00:03:26.739> could<00:03:26.769> have<00:03:27.010> potentially

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
one star they could have potentially

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.130 
one star they could have potentially
attacked<00:03:27.790> someone<00:03:28.030> else<00:03:28.300> for<00:03:28.690> two<00:03:28.959> or<00:03:29.110> three

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
attacked someone else for two or three

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.560 
attacked someone else for two or three
stars<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:30.400> essentially<00:03:30.820> i'm<00:03:30.940> giving<00:03:31.209> up<00:03:31.300> one

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
stars so essentially i'm giving up one

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.600 
stars so essentially i'm giving up one
star<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.140> they're<00:03:32.650> giving<00:03:32.950> up<00:03:33.070> two<00:03:33.250> or<00:03:33.400> three

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
star and they're giving up two or three

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.340 
star and they're giving up two or three
stars<00:03:33.910> every<00:03:34.300> single<00:03:34.660> time<00:03:34.840> they<00:03:35.019> attack<00:03:35.320> me

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
stars every single time they attack me

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.840 
stars every single time they attack me
because<00:03:36.160> they<00:03:36.400> could<00:03:36.430> have<00:03:36.640> attacked

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
because they could have attacked

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.509 
because they could have attacked
somebody<00:03:37.120> else<00:03:37.769> now<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.830> reason<00:03:39.100> why<00:03:39.459> the

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
somebody else now the reason why the

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.090 
somebody else now the reason why the
strategy<00:03:40.209> works<00:03:40.540> is<00:03:40.840> because<00:03:41.140> i<00:03:41.470> am<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.680> top

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
strategy works is because i am the top

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.520 
strategy works is because i am the top
spot<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.910> clan<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.420> my<00:03:43.780> defenses<00:03:43.989> are

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
spot of the clan and my defenses are

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.830 
spot of the clan and my defenses are
strong<00:03:44.560> enough<00:03:45.100> so<00:03:45.160> usually<00:03:45.880> one<00:03:46.120> star<00:03:46.420> is<00:03:46.630> the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
strong enough so usually one star is the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.900 
strong enough so usually one star is the
max<00:03:47.080> that<00:03:47.350> people<00:03:47.650> are<00:03:47.769> able<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:48.220> get<00:03:48.430> off<00:03:48.670> me

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
max that people are able to get off me

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.000 
max that people are able to get off me
and<00:03:49.090> even<00:03:49.720> if<00:03:49.840> someone<00:03:50.049> were<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.380> come<00:03:50.560> along

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
and even if someone were to come along

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.610 
and even if someone were to come along
and<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.489> start<00:03:51.850> my<00:03:52.060> base<00:03:52.330> chances<00:03:53.290> are<00:03:53.410> other

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
and to start my base chances are other

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.560 
and to start my base chances are other
people<00:03:54.010> will<00:03:54.130> still<00:03:54.459> be<00:03:54.580> greedy<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.060> waste

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
people will still be greedy and waste

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.440 
people will still be greedy and waste
their<00:03:55.840> attack<00:03:56.080> and<00:03:56.290> snipe<00:03:56.799> me<00:03:56.980> as<00:03:57.130> well<00:03:57.670> just

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
their attack and snipe me as well just

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.420 
their attack and snipe me as well just
purely<00:03:58.810> because<00:03:59.019> again<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.799> is<00:03:59.920> really

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
purely because again it is really

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.720 
purely because again it is really
difficult<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:01.660> tell<00:04:01.840> all<00:04:02.080> people<00:04:02.470> in<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:02.739> 45<00:04:03.340> vs

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
difficult to tell all people in a 45 vs

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.110 
difficult to tell all people in a 45 vs
45<00:04:04.209> or<00:04:04.450> 50<00:04:04.840> vs<00:04:05.200> 50<00:04:05.380> clan<00:04:05.769> war<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.610> coordinate

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
45 or 50 vs 50 clan war to coordinate

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.539 
45 or 50 vs 50 clan war to coordinate
and<00:04:07.330> not<00:04:07.690> be<00:04:07.900> greedy<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.380> snipe<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.830> top<00:04:09.070> spot

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
and not be greedy and snipe the top spot

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.570 
and not be greedy and snipe the top spot
in<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.030> enemy<00:04:10.390> clan<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:11.160> could<00:04:12.160> also<00:04:12.310> argue

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
in the enemy clan I could also argue

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.979 
in the enemy clan I could also argue
that<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:13.000> strategy<00:04:13.239> could<00:04:13.600> be<00:04:13.750> more

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
that the strategy could be more

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.770 
that the strategy could be more
effective<00:04:14.410> if<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.680> top<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.370> second<00:04:16.299> spot<00:04:16.540> in

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
effective if the top and second spot in

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.659 
effective if the top and second spot in
your<00:04:17.290> clan<00:04:17.620> would<00:04:17.890> lead<00:04:18.100> their<00:04:18.280> town<00:04:18.459> hall<00:04:18.640> on

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
your clan would lead their town hall on

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.909 
your clan would lead their town hall on
the<00:04:18.910> outside<00:04:19.269> because<00:04:20.109> chances<00:04:20.470> are<00:04:20.709> there

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
the outside because chances are there

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.740 
the outside because chances are there
might<00:04:21.160> be<00:04:21.190> even<00:04:21.430> more<00:04:21.820> people<00:04:22.240> who<00:04:22.390> are<00:04:22.419> greedy

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
might be even more people who are greedy

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.620 
might be even more people who are greedy
and<00:04:22.990> snipe<00:04:23.260> us<00:04:23.500> both<00:04:23.890> but<00:04:24.669> so<00:04:24.820> far<00:04:25.030> as<00:04:25.240> I

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
and snipe us both but so far as I

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.870 
and snipe us both but so far as I
mentioned<00:04:25.960> earlier<00:04:26.110> all<00:04:26.470> i<00:04:26.530> need<00:04:27.039> is<00:04:27.250> at<00:04:27.580> least

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
mentioned earlier all i need is at least

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.850 
mentioned earlier all i need is at least
two<00:04:28.180> people<00:04:28.539> to<00:04:28.630> snipe<00:04:28.870> me<00:04:29.020> for<00:04:29.289> the<00:04:29.410> strategy

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
two people to snipe me for the strategy

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.300 
two people to snipe me for the strategy
to<00:04:30.130> be<00:04:30.370> effective

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
to be effective

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.610 
to be effective
but<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.240> could<00:04:32.360> also<00:04:32.540> argue<00:04:32.810> all<00:04:33.140> you<00:04:33.170> need<00:04:33.470> is

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
but you could also argue all you need is

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.500 
but you could also argue all you need is
one<00:04:33.860> person<00:04:34.220> to<00:04:34.370> snipe<00:04:34.640> you<00:04:34.790> because<00:04:35.090> that<00:04:35.120> one

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
one person to snipe you because that one

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.150 
one person to snipe you because that one
person<00:04:35.900> could<00:04:36.200> have<00:04:36.350> two<00:04:36.530> or<00:04:36.680> three<00:04:36.710> starts

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
person could have two or three starts

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.730 
person could have two or three starts
somebody<00:04:37.640> else<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:38.180> they<00:04:38.600> only<00:04:38.780> scored<00:04:39.230> one

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
somebody else and they only scored one

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.190 
somebody else and they only scored one
star<00:04:40.070> on<00:04:40.310> me<00:04:40.670> so<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:41.300> would<00:04:41.540> take<00:04:41.720> that<00:04:41.750> trade

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
star on me so I would take that trade

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.220 
star on me so I would take that trade
any<00:04:42.410> single<00:04:43.010> day<00:04:43.190> of<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.580> week<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.930> one<00:04:45.080> and

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
any single day of the week the one and

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.380 
any single day of the week the one and
only<00:04:45.320> downside<00:04:45.890> I<00:04:45.920> see<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.490> this<00:04:46.670> strategy<00:04:47.210> is

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
only downside I see to this strategy is

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.870 
only downside I see to this strategy is
if<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.960> enemy<00:04:48.380> clan<00:04:48.620> can<00:04:49.100> coordinate<00:04:49.610> with

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
if the enemy clan can coordinate with

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.000 
if the enemy clan can coordinate with
its<00:04:50.060> members<00:04:50.450> to<00:04:50.660> have<00:04:51.200> only<00:04:51.320> one<00:04:51.650> person

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
its members to have only one person

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.150 
its members to have only one person
attack<00:04:52.310> me<00:04:52.520> and<00:04:52.790> for<00:04:53.480> two<00:04:53.630> stars<00:04:53.960> total<00:04:54.500> which

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
attack me and for two stars total which

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.360 
attack me and for two stars total which
again<00:04:55.340> is<00:04:55.400> tough<00:04:55.730> to<00:04:55.850> do<00:04:56.030> with<00:04:56.390> a<00:04:56.420> 45<00:04:57.140> vs<00:04:57.470> 45<00:04:58.040> or

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
again is tough to do with a 45 vs 45 or

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.420 
again is tough to do with a 45 vs 45 or
50<00:04:58.880> vs<00:04:59.210> 50<00:04:59.390> clan<00:04:59.810> war<00:05:00.110> because<00:05:01.070> there<00:05:01.280> will

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
50 vs 50 clan war because there will

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.060 
50 vs 50 clan war because there will
inevitably<00:05:02.030> be<00:05:02.660> greedy<00:05:03.200> people<00:05:03.620> who<00:05:03.860> will

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
inevitably be greedy people who will

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.220 
inevitably be greedy people who will
snipe<00:05:04.550> my<00:05:04.730> town<00:05:04.970> hall<00:05:05.210> so<00:05:05.660> keep<00:05:05.810> in<00:05:05.930> mind<00:05:06.110> the

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
snipe my town hall so keep in mind the

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.230 
snipe my town hall so keep in mind the
effectiveness<00:05:06.620> of<00:05:06.770> this<00:05:07.100> strategy<00:05:07.550> will<00:05:07.850> vary

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
effectiveness of this strategy will vary

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.420 
effectiveness of this strategy will vary
in<00:05:08.540> terms<00:05:08.780> of<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.170> amount<00:05:09.260> of<00:05:09.620> Snipes<00:05:09.980> on<00:05:10.190> the

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
in terms of the amount of Snipes on the

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.190 
in terms of the amount of Snipes on the
top<00:05:10.610> spot<00:05:10.910> because<00:05:11.720> it<00:05:11.840> depends<00:05:12.110> how

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
top spot because it depends how

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.650 
top spot because it depends how
coordinated<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.920> enemy<00:05:13.220> clan<00:05:13.430> is<00:05:13.730> and<00:05:14.030> how

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
coordinated the enemy clan is and how

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.450 
coordinated the enemy clan is and how
much<00:05:14.810> support<00:05:15.020> your<00:05:15.410> clanmates<00:05:15.890> can<00:05:16.100> provide

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
much support your clanmates can provide

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.180 
much support your clanmates can provide
in<00:05:16.730> terms<00:05:16.760> of<00:05:17.120> attacking<00:05:17.510> effectively<00:05:18.440> but

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
in terms of attacking effectively but

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.010 
in terms of attacking effectively but
like<00:05:19.310> I<00:05:19.400> said<00:05:19.430> all<00:05:19.820> it<00:05:20.090> takes<00:05:20.270> is<00:05:20.510> pretty<00:05:20.900> much

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
like I said all it takes is pretty much

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.900 
like I said all it takes is pretty much
one<00:05:21.260> person<00:05:21.290> to<00:05:21.740> snipe<00:05:21.950> you<00:05:22.130> before<00:05:22.790> the

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
one person to snipe you before the

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.030 
one person to snipe you before the
strategy<00:05:23.360> becomes<00:05:23.660> effective<00:05:24.350> so<00:05:24.800> I<00:05:24.830> would

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
strategy becomes effective so I would
