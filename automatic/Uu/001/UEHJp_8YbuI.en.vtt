00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
example before the EOC jacocks could

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.260 
example before the EOC jacocks could
have<00:04:23.190> implemented<00:04:23.760> something<00:04:24.000> in<00:04:24.210> the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
have implemented something in the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.060

again nan

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.180 
again nan
cares<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.450> in<00:04:27.870> return<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.440> P<00:04:28.590> cares<00:04:28.830> would<00:04:29.040> be

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
cares and in return the P cares would be

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.250 
cares and in return the P cares would be
killing<00:04:29.550> these<00:04:29.640> players<00:04:30.030> but<00:04:30.660> at<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.080> same

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
killing these players but at the same

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.960 
killing these players but at the same
time<00:04:31.530> they'd<00:04:31.800> be<00:04:31.860> making<00:04:32.190> money<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:32.820> it's

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
time they'd be making money so it's

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.940 
time they'd be making money so it's
worth<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.360> for<00:04:33.510> them<00:04:33.660> to<00:04:33.810> enter<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.170> wild<00:04:34.350> it's

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
worth it for them to enter the wild it's

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.220 
worth it for them to enter the wild it's
a<00:04:35.010> dangerous<00:04:35.430> place<00:04:35.670> with<00:04:36.240> high<00:04:36.480> rewards<00:04:37.020> I
