the most five things you can do as a

tank using them properly using your

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.950 
tank using them properly using your
taunts<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:01.580> ideally<00:01:02.120> want<00:01:02.150> to<00:01:02.450> use<00:01:02.630> your<00:01:02.750> talk

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
taunts you ideally want to use your talk

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.190 
taunts you ideally want to use your talk
that<00:01:03.200> your<00:01:03.470> taunts<00:01:03.920> on<00:01:04.129> their<00:01:04.939> top<00:01:05.479> dps<00:01:05.720> errs

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
that your taunts on their top dps errs

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.850 
that your taunts on their top dps errs
you<00:01:06.890> can<00:01:07.009> pretty<00:01:07.159> much<00:01:08.110> dominate<00:01:09.110> one<00:01:09.590> player

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
you can pretty much dominate one player

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.890 
you can pretty much dominate one player
the<00:01:10.070> entire<00:01:10.340> game<00:01:10.670> with<00:01:11.210> that<00:01:11.330> single<00:01:11.570> target

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
the entire game with that single target

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.780 
the entire game with that single target
on<00:01:12.079> because<00:01:12.860> it<00:01:12.950> has<00:01:13.100> such<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.310> low<00:01:13.400> cooldown

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
on because it has such a low cooldown

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.560 
on because it has such a low cooldown
but<00:01:14.860> anyways<00:01:15.860> this<00:01:16.579> is<00:01:16.640> how<00:01:16.880> Paul<00:01:17.090> match<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.420> got

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
but anyways this is how Paul match I got

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.480 
but anyways this is how Paul match I got
stunned<00:01:17.960> in<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.110> fire<00:01:18.380> there<00:01:18.680> from<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.220> route

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
stunned in the fire there from a route

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.090 
stunned in the fire there from a route
from<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.790> sniper<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.050> you<00:01:21.110> since<00:01:21.680> my<00:01:21.890> shrink

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
from the sniper so you since my shrink

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.830 
from the sniper so you since my shrink
it<00:01:22.190> was<00:01:22.280> down<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:22.760> used<00:01:23.000> resilience<00:01:23.510> to<00:01:23.659> break

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
it was down I used resilience to break

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.560 
it was down I used resilience to break
free<00:01:24.050> out<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.260> that<00:01:24.380> it's<00:01:24.980> a<00:01:25.070> good<00:01:25.280> little

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
free out of that it's a good little

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.330 
free out of that it's a good little
trick<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:26.930> can<00:01:26.960> do<00:01:27.200> on<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.440> shadow<00:01:27.680> it's<00:01:28.130> real

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
trick you can do on the shadow it's real

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.380 
trick you can do on the shadow it's real
nice<00:01:28.659> so<00:01:29.659> here's<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:29.960> 1vs1<00:01:30.860> vs.<00:01:31.430> powertech<00:01:32.120> i

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
nice so here's a 1vs1 vs. powertech i

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.930 
nice so here's a 1vs1 vs. powertech i
pop<00:01:32.900> him<00:01:33.229> with<00:01:33.620> force<00:01:33.950> in<00:01:34.159> balance<00:01:34.580> out<00:01:34.790> of

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
pop him with force in balance out of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.600 
pop him with force in balance out of
stealth<00:01:35.270> he<00:01:35.930> throws<00:01:36.229> hissy<00:01:36.409> grenade<00:01:37.040> on<00:01:37.190> me<00:01:37.340> so

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
stealth he throws hissy grenade on me so

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.780 
stealth he throws hissy grenade on me so
i<00:01:37.880> use<00:01:38.630> or<00:01:39.080> he<00:01:39.200> starts<00:01:39.260> burning<00:01:39.710> me<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.190> i<00:01:40.460> use

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
i use or he starts burning me and i use

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.910 
i use or he starts burning me and i use
resilience<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.540> little<00:01:41.750> bit<00:01:41.870> early<00:01:42.200> here<00:01:42.440> you

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
resilience a little bit early here you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.260 
resilience a little bit early here you
ideally<00:01:43.430> want<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.909> use<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:45.820> right<00:01:46.820> when<00:01:47.150> he

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
ideally want to use it right when he

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.520 
ideally want to use it right when he
throws<00:01:47.479> his<00:01:47.659> sticky<00:01:48.049> you<00:01:48.170> want<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.380> negate

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
throws his sticky you want to negate

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.440 
throws his sticky you want to negate
that<00:01:48.710> sticky<00:01:49.250> Bird<00:01:49.460> bomb<00:01:49.790> because<00:01:50.180> that's

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
that sticky Bird bomb because that's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.660 
that sticky Bird bomb because that's
when<00:01:50.630> their<00:01:50.780> burst<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.200> going<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.440> come<00:01:51.620> if<00:01:51.860> you

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
when their burst is going to come if you

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.030 
when their burst is going to come if you
negate<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:53.600> pretty<00:01:54.110> much<00:01:54.290> it's<00:01:54.710> an<00:01:54.890> easy

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
negate that pretty much it's an easy

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.120 
negate that pretty much it's an easy
fight<00:01:55.310> from<00:01:55.490> there<00:01:55.640> on<00:01:55.790> out<00:01:56.710> alright<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:57.890> here

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
fight from there on out alright so here

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.980 
fight from there on out alright so here
I'm<00:01:58.310> holding<00:01:58.640> right<00:01:58.820> base<00:01:59.060> I'm<00:01:59.390> fighting<00:01:59.810> a

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
I'm holding right base I'm fighting a

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.940 
I'm holding right base I'm fighting a
sorc<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.369> marauder<00:02:01.790> both<00:02:02.119> I<00:02:02.360> popped<00:02:02.720> my

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
sorc in a marauder both I popped my

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.050 
sorc in a marauder both I popped my
deflection<00:02:03.950> right<00:02:04.100> away<00:02:04.310> because<00:02:04.520> chromis

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
deflection right away because chromis

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.330 
deflection right away because chromis
gets<00:02:05.299> on<00:02:05.450> me<00:02:05.659> he<00:02:05.930> does<00:02:06.110> lots<00:02:06.260> of<00:02:06.440> damage<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.100> I

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
gets on me he does lots of damage so I

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.520 
gets on me he does lots of damage so I
want<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.850> negate<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.149> I'm<00:02:08.869> getting<00:02:09.440> this

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
want to negate that I'm getting this

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.470 
want to negate that I'm getting this
work<00:02:09.739> a<00:02:09.799> little<00:02:09.920> bit<00:02:10.099> low<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.399> i'm<00:02:10.759> trying<00:02:11.330> to
