00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:10.380
 Then I would like to confirm again with the sample how it was moving 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.380
 I think 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:22.539
 The bullets are coming out in order from the left 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:29.679
 In what to do when you put the first movement It is a So 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:31.390
 At the time of the normal state that does not does not and I that in nothing nothing I went out and this is at once package 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:35.020
 It only comes 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:40.130
 I can see it well 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:47.810
 A little convenience Changan no irrational is it little that shot now 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:49.580
 Since it is difficult to maximize now , switching the salt screen normally will cause all the elements to 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:55.820
 Come out at once 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:59.440
 When it is said that it is one by one , the first thing we need is the animation 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:05.230
 It is difficult to do without putting out the word u 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:07.510
 Move also Kaneko Toka something people say where the animation to put the that movement to in 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:12.460
 I think I feel like 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:18.370
 The word powerpoint uses the word animation when it makes a move 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.280
 There is, however Tteyuu animation window in the animation of the probably there in the mass 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.299
 Here the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.690
 Just like when you click on the clip on 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:32.579
 I said that work window a little while ago 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:39.299
 Since Gode come to the place of Iwaki will continue to play here kettle important role 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:42.570
 Well, there is still an animation window in the state of animation . 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.380
 I am not come and use the buttons 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:54.840
 In there in a first place here 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:02:01.500
 Choose a placeholder for the manager's book and still have the effect of slide-in 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.440
 It is a preview of this time . Click here to get to where there was nothing initially like this 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.700
 It was 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.910
 When you want to see in detail what kind of effect this has 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:16.690
 You see the expansion of the content 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.470
 Back home click di Looking here in the so Surutoe order and say what happens when it is this 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.460
 I guess 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.709
 Every time I click this and this one comes out in order 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.599
 I put an effect now 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:37.340
 In the sample, it came out from the left to the right 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:44.610
 Well, there's a choice of effects with this one in there. 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.459
 You can control the direction that comes out with this by choosing 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.810
 I will 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:55.159
 It is to Bettsugi in made this a little while ago 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:03:01.549
 I want out with this illustration pot Ow 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:04.879
 It's not the first time to say that everyone's construction time is out here but I'll do it later 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.500
 I'm coming out with Boya' who bought the Tteyuu fade 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:13.620
 Painting directly below 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:17.760
 I'm made to look like Te Then if say or come out with this what order 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.320
 In there at the timing issue and a little order 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.590
 I think that I want to control this and it is the current state 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.450
 123 each time you click 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:33.010
 The animation comes in the order 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:39.159
 So first of all there is good with this 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:42.750
 Because I want to show a picture first, and I want to give explanations of words later 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:49.560
 Reverse 2nd and 3rd 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:55.260
 In the animation window , select number 3 and change the order m 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:04:01.260
 Rucio will not disappear and it will be the second to go back to the group or something 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.620
 In is received the order of the so Then, the playback is in Nissan 1 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.090
 In this 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.510
 The order could be changed 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:14.930
 In the after timing first 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:19.609
 I will talk according to 55% of the transactions about the residential land and buildings while talking well when clicking 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:24.990
 After saying that you are qualified to prove that you can 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.250
 Boan and put this out after this action without clicking 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.390
 Want 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:33.510
 Let me show you this 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:40.050
 To further explained in words 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:46.440
 a You can change the fixtures in case of reproduction to change like this 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:50.729
 It looks like this is a form to try this and preview it once 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.800
 I think it's better to do this sort of slide show 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:58.289
 There are a lot of people to replace 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.040
 It's a slide show rather than the fact that it is decided from the beginning, and after all it's here after all 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:05.820
 There were times when there was a point or something 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.820
 let's to be able to change Toka in such Fu attempts to open ing
