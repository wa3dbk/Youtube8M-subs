I'm sorry to say this as a newfound more
main<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:26.939> think<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.269> he<00:00:27.359> does<00:00:27.539> need<00:00:27.689> a

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
main but I do think that he does need a

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.390 
main but I do think that he does need a
little<00:00:28.050> bit<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.320> nurse<00:00:28.529> mostly<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.010> one<00:00:29.189> move

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
little bit of nurse mostly in one move

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.070 
little bit of nurse mostly in one move
to<00:00:29.580> improve<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> balance<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.420> game<00:00:30.449> now<00:00:31.050> I

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
to improve the balance of the game now I

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.540 
to improve the balance of the game now I
don't<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.439> world<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.859> opie<00:00:32.160> by<00:00:32.309> any

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
don't think that world is opie by any

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.130 
don't think that world is opie by any
means<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.360> move<00:00:33.540> kind<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.899> breaks<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
means but this move kind of breaks the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.500 
means but this move kind of breaks the
game<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> little<00:00:34.440> bit<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.860> at<00:00:35.700> some<00:00:35.969> points<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
game a little bit and at some points it

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.670 
game a little bit and at some points it
just<00:00:36.780> really<00:00:36.930> needs<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.290> fixed

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
just really needs to be fixed

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.010 
just really needs to be fixed
now<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.160> move<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:39.000> course<00:00:39.239> roadside<00:00:39.719> smash

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
now the move is of course roadside smash

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.410 
now the move is of course roadside smash
this<00:00:40.379> attack<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.800> super<00:00:41.040> fast<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.520> 20%<00:00:41.790> kills

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
this attack is super fast as 20% kills

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.720 
this attack is super fast as 20% kills
the<00:00:42.510> 70%<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.800> strung<00:00:44.070> out<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> Down

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the 70% and can be strung out of a Down

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.580 
the 70% and can be strung out of a Down
throw<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.239> planet<00:00:45.450> air<00:00:45.629> dodges<00:00:46.079> this

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
throw with a planet air dodges this

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.319 
throw with a planet air dodges this
attack<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.160> too<00:00:47.309> strong<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.789> less<00:00:48.120> bad

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
attack is just too strong and less bad

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.029 
attack is just too strong and less bad
boys<00:00:48.660> throw<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.230> while<00:00:49.500> getting<00:00:49.739> tons<00:00:49.950> of

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
boys throw it out while getting tons of

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.529 
boys throw it out while getting tons of
reward<00:00:50.399> while<00:00:50.850> they<00:00:50.969> should<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.210> doing<00:00:51.390> other

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
reward while they should be doing other

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.209 
reward while they should be doing other
things<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.020> reward<00:00:52.350> instead<00:00:52.500> that's<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
things to get reward instead that's a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.010 
things to get reward instead that's a
little<00:00:53.370> bit<00:00:53.520> harder<00:00:53.789> now<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.390> think<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.780> this

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
little bit harder now I think that this

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.600 
little bit harder now I think that this
should<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.260> nerfed<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.770> maybe<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.579> should

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
should be nerfed but maybe they should

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.639 
should be nerfed but maybe they should
buff<00:00:57.000> something<00:00:57.390> else<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> faster<00:00:58.440> down

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
buff something else like a faster down

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.709 
buff something else like a faster down
air<00:00:58.859> better<00:00:59.309> killing<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.940> throw<00:01:00.149> or<00:01:00.420> just

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
air better killing up throw or just

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.840 
air better killing up throw or just
something<00:01:00.930> small<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> make<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.649> somewhat<00:01:02.280> make

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
something small to make it somewhat make

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.880 
something small to make it somewhat make
up<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.329> because<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.290> worse<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.650> smashed

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
up for it because it's worse I smashed

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.500 
up for it because it's worse I smashed
it<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.339> best<00:01:05.460> parts<00:01:05.729> about<00:01:05.790> him<00:01:06.060> but

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
it one of the best parts about him but

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.060 
it one of the best parts about him but
if<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:07.020> bought<00:01:07.200> something<00:01:07.409> else<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.860> could

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
if they bought something else it could

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.230 
if they bought something else it could
someone<00:01:08.310> make<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.729> when<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> first

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
someone make up for it so when I first

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.450 
someone make up for it so when I first
saw<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.510> Akari<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> new<00:01:13.200> game<00:01:13.350> first<00:01:14.159> I

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
saw all Akari in the new game first I

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.160 
saw all Akari in the new game first I
thought<00:01:14.909> he<00:01:14.970> was<00:01:15.180> quite<00:01:15.479> dreadful

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
thought he was quite dreadful

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.810 
thought he was quite dreadful
I<00:01:16.200> mean<00:01:16.560> he's<00:01:16.740> pretty<00:01:16.890> slow<00:01:17.220> his<00:01:17.460> aerials

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I mean he's pretty slow his aerials

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.370 
I mean he's pretty slow his aerials
don't<00:01:18.030> come<00:01:18.180> away<00:01:18.450> too<00:01:18.509> well<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.930> his<00:01:19.080> tilts

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
don't come away too well and his tilts

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.990 
don't come away too well and his tilts
are<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.680> nothing<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.070> brag<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
are really nothing to brag about now the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090 
are really nothing to brag about now the
thing<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.500> makes<00:01:22.710> him<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
thing is that really makes him and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.270 
thing is that really makes him and
breaks<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.759> choreo<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.780> fact<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.380> rage

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
breaks the choreo is the fact that rage

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.249 
breaks the choreo is the fact that rage
and<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> very<00:01:27.119> strong<00:01:27.360> horror<00:01:27.570> mechanic<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.110> now

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
and a very strong horror mechanic is now

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.020 
and a very strong horror mechanic is now
added<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> game<00:01:28.890> pretty<00:01:29.460> much<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
added to the game pretty much to get a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.520 
added to the game pretty much to get a
kill<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.390> choreo<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.110> be<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> very

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
kill at the choreo you have to be a very

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.840 
kill at the choreo you have to be a very
high<00:01:31.710> percent<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.310> puts<00:01:32.579> him<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.759> a

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
high percent and this puts him in a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.819 
high percent and this puts him in a
really<00:01:33.000> weird<00:01:33.329> spot<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> high<00:01:34.409> percent<00:01:34.740> he

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
really weird spot what a high percent he

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.140 
really weird spot what a high percent he
has<00:01:34.920> really<00:01:35.159> Opie<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:35.610> at<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> same<00:01:35.909> time

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
has really Opie but at the same time

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.149 
has really Opie but at the same time
well<00:01:36.390> at<00:01:36.479> low<00:01:36.600> percent<00:01:36.990> he<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.409> pretty<00:01:37.829> useless

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
well at low percent he is pretty useless

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.030 
well at low percent he is pretty useless
now<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.329> his<00:01:39.689> aura<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.650> would<00:01:40.860> like

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
now I do like his aura but I would like

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.039 
now I do like his aura but I would like
if<00:01:41.220> Nintendo<00:01:41.369> buffed<00:01:41.939> his<00:01:42.150> low<00:01:42.299> percent<00:01:42.689> game

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
if Nintendo buffed his low percent game

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.960 
if Nintendo buffed his low percent game
by<00:01:43.409> giving<00:01:43.740> him<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.950> few<00:01:44.100> more<00:01:44.220> combos<00:01:44.610> or<00:01:44.729> even

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
by giving him a few more combos or even

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.609 
by giving him a few more combos or even
just<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.210> better<00:01:45.390> fare<00:01:45.689> more<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.079> Luigi's<00:01:46.470> or

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
just a better fare more like Luigi's or

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.560 
just a better fare more like Luigi's or
sheiks<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.399> at<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> same<00:01:47.729> time<00:01:47.909> nerf<00:01:48.240> some<00:01:48.450> of

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
sheiks but at the same time nerf some of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.719 
sheiks but at the same time nerf some of
his<00:01:48.689> high<00:01:48.899> percent<00:01:49.619> killing<00:01:50.009> moves<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.430> back

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
his high percent killing moves like back

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.520 
his high percent killing moves like back
arrow<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.180> forward<00:01:51.509> smash<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:52.229> would<00:01:52.409> make

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
arrow or forward smash this would make

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.020 
arrow or forward smash this would make
him<00:01:52.680> better<00:01:52.860> at<00:01:53.040> all<00:01:53.189> times<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.579> games<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
him better at all times of the games and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.149 
him better at all times of the games and
not<00:01:54.360> reward<00:01:54.750> Lucario<00:01:55.290> player<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:55.829> taking<00:01:56.070> as

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
much damage well these last few spots

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.340 
much damage well these last few spots
you<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.210> probably<00:02:00.360> guess<00:02:00.600> them<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.140> let's

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
you can probably guess them but let's

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.959 
you can probably guess them but let's
start<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.649> Luigi<00:02:02.159> now<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.549> problem<00:02:02.880> about

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
start with Luigi now the problem about

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.670 
start with Luigi now the problem about
him<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.329> he<00:02:03.600> has<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> lot<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.049> kill<00:02:04.320> moves<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
him is that he has a lot of kill moves a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.249 
him is that he has a lot of kill moves a
range<00:02:04.979> projectile<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.640> tons<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.360> combos<00:02:06.719> now

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
range projectile and tons of combos now

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.419 
range projectile and tons of combos now
one<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.619> those<00:02:07.770> things<00:02:07.979> alone<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.310> pretty

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
one of those things alone is pretty

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.919 
one of those things alone is pretty
strong<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:08.910> all<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.179> them<00:02:09.270> added<00:02:09.539> up<00:02:09.629> becomes

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
strong but all of them added up becomes

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.540 
strong but all of them added up becomes
a<00:02:10.020> very<00:02:10.229> strong<00:02:10.590> easy<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.009> play<00:02:11.190> character

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
a very strong easy to play character

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.890 
a very strong easy to play character
that<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.819> wreak<00:02:12.030> most<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.569> characters<00:02:12.870> in

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
that can wreak most of the characters in

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.460 
that can wreak most of the characters in
the<00:02:13.020> game<00:02:13.050> makes

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the game makes

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
the game makes
the<00:02:13.680> very<00:02:13.890> top<00:02:14.100> tears<00:02:14.370> now<00:02:14.940> my<00:02:15.180> ideas

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the very top tears now my ideas

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.720 
the very top tears now my ideas
foreigner<00:02:15.690> from<00:02:15.840> Luigi<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.770> be<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.580> make<00:02:17.700> a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
foreigner from Luigi can be to make a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.280 
foreigner from Luigi can be to make a
down<00:02:17.940> throw<00:02:18.150> worse<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.570> not<00:02:18.690> allow<00:02:18.900> him<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.170> get

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
down throw worse to not allow him to get

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.170 
down throw worse to not allow him to get
as<00:02:19.350> many<00:02:19.440> free<00:02:19.680> combos<00:02:20.100> make<00:02:20.640> his<00:02:20.790> kill<00:02:21.000> moves

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
as many free combos make his kill moves

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.820 
as many free combos make his kill moves
a<00:02:21.270> little<00:02:21.450> bit<00:02:21.690> worse<00:02:21.900> like<00:02:22.140> backer<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.530> side

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
a little bit worse like backer and side

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.500 
a little bit worse like backer and side
smash<00:02:23.160> up<00:02:23.430> smash<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.090> something<00:02:24.360> like<00:02:24.390> that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
smash up smash and something like that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.360 
smash up smash and something like that
or<00:02:24.930> they<00:02:25.440> could<00:02:25.560> just<00:02:25.710> make<00:02:25.740> his<00:02:25.950> fireball

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
or they could just make his fireball

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.680 
or they could just make his fireball
give<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> lot<00:02:26.850> less<00:02:27.000> hits<00:02:27.180> done<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.600> you

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
give you a lot less hits done so you

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.050 
give you a lot less hits done so you
can't<00:02:27.900> fire<00:02:28.140> ball<00:02:28.410> into<00:02:28.680> down<00:02:29.160> throw<00:02:29.460> at<00:02:29.880> the

can't fire ball into down throw at the

stay<00:02:30.240> he<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.690> there's<00:02:30.930> little<00:02:31.320> risk<00:02:31.470> by<00:02:31.920> a

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
stay he is in there's little risk by a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.470 
stay he is in there's little risk by a
ton<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.310> reward<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.000> can<00:02:33.150> just<00:02:33.330> mess<00:02:33.450> up

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
ton of reward and you can just mess up

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.910 
ton of reward and you can just mess up
most<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.840> characters<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.260> game<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.650> really

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
most of characters in game on really

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.800 
most of characters in game on really
they<00:02:35.040> can't<00:02:35.280> do<00:02:35.370> anything<00:02:35.580> back<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.450> really

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
they can't do anything back so I really

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.210 
they can't do anything back so I really
do<00:02:36.900> think<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.170> Luigi<00:02:37.560> needs<00:02:37.740> some<00:02:37.890> changes

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
do think that Luigi needs some changes

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.990 
do think that Luigi needs some changes

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
course would have to make away somewhere

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
a list of people that do need nerfing

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.600 
a list of people that do need nerfing
now<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.470> thing<00:02:52.680> about<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:53.010> list<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.490> that

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
now the thing about this list is that

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.800 
now the thing about this list is that
some<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.910> people<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.360> been<00:02:54.390> buffed<00:02:54.720> a

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
some of the people have been buffed a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.030 
some of the people have been buffed a
little<00:02:55.050> bit<00:02:55.170> or<00:02:55.380> nurture<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> little<00:02:55.920> bit

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
little bit or nurture a little bit

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.830 
little bit or nurture a little bit
already<00:02:56.220> but<00:02:56.459> Rosalina<00:02:57.150> has<00:02:57.330> pretty<00:02:57.540> much<00:02:57.600> say

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
already but Rosalina has pretty much say

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.630 
already but Rosalina has pretty much say
it<00:02:57.900> exactly<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.380> same<00:02:58.590> was<00:02:59.130> some<00:02:59.370> terrible

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
it exactly the same was some terrible

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.820 
it exactly the same was some terrible
nurse<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.270> ending<00:03:00.600> up<00:03:00.720> just<00:03:00.780> giving<00:03:01.200> Luna<00:03:01.650> a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
nurse and ending up just giving Luna a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.040 
nurse and ending up just giving Luna a
little<00:03:02.220> bit<00:03:02.370> more<00:03:02.550> HP<00:03:02.760> now<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.600> main<00:03:03.810> thing

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
little bit more HP now the main thing

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.360 
little bit more HP now the main thing
that<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.260> think<00:03:04.350> Rosalina<00:03:04.890> really<00:03:05.130> needs<00:03:05.280> to

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
that I think Rosalina really needs to

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.370 
that I think Rosalina really needs to
make<00:03:05.459> her<00:03:05.610> less<00:03:05.790> powerful<00:03:06.240> is<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.450> much<00:03:07.080> louder

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
make her less powerful is a much louder

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.740 
make her less powerful is a much louder
death<00:03:08.130> timer<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.670> luma<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.570> opponent

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
death timer on luma so that the opponent

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.390 
death timer on luma so that the opponent
can<00:03:10.020> really<00:03:10.260> kill<00:03:10.440> luma<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:10.920> then<00:03:11.040> go<00:03:11.220> for

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
can really kill luma and then go for

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.090 
can really kill luma and then go for
Rosalina<00:03:11.790> now<00:03:12.480> as<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:13.020> is<00:03:13.140> she<00:03:13.380> can<00:03:13.410> just<00:03:13.770> stall

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
Rosalina now as it is she can just stall

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.890 
Rosalina now as it is she can just stall
for<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.340> few<00:03:14.550> seconds<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.060> then<00:03:15.209> luma<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.570> back

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
for a few seconds and then luma is back

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.300 
for a few seconds and then luma is back
and<00:03:16.170> it's<00:03:16.260> just<00:03:16.470> really<00:03:16.650> not<00:03:16.890> enough<00:03:17.130> counter

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
and it's just really not enough counter

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.220 
and it's just really not enough counter
play<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:17.700> my<00:03:17.790> opinion<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.330> feel<00:03:18.510> like<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> twenty

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
play in my opinion I feel like a twenty

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.750 
play in my opinion I feel like a twenty
to<00:03:19.380> thirty<00:03:19.590> second<00:03:19.920> death<00:03:20.010> timer<00:03:20.250> would<00:03:20.580> allow

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
to thirty second death timer would allow

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.430 
to thirty second death timer would allow
the<00:03:20.820> opponent<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.269> lot<00:03:21.450> more<00:03:21.690> time<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.930> lot<00:03:22.290> more

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
the opponent a lot more time a lot more

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.320 
the opponent a lot more time a lot more
options<00:03:22.620> but<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.400> also<00:03:23.640> think<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.060> change

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
options but I also think that the change

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.380 
options but I also think that the change
would<00:03:24.840> have<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.320> occur<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:26.820> think<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.300> we

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
would have to occur so I think that we

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.640 
would have to occur so I think that we
also<00:03:27.570> would<00:03:27.750> need<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:27.989> add<00:03:28.080> something<00:03:28.290> else<00:03:28.500> to

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
also would need to add something else to

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.840 
also would need to add something else to
make<00:03:28.739> Rosaleen<00:03:29.160> out<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> little<00:03:29.370> bit<00:03:29.550> stronger

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
make Rosaleen out a little bit stronger

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.729 
make Rosaleen out a little bit stronger
and<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.570> would<00:03:30.690> be<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:31.110> buff<00:03:31.290> luma<00:03:31.590> with

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
and that would be to buff luma with

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.710 
and that would be to buff luma with
either<00:03:31.890> more<00:03:32.220> HP<00:03:32.400> or<00:03:32.820> quite<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.420> bit<00:03:33.600> more

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
either more HP or quite a bit more

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.540 
either more HP or quite a bit more
damage<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.709> one<00:03:34.830> Rosalina<00:03:35.250> does<00:03:35.400> have

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
damage so that one Rosalina does have

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.430 
damage so that one Rosalina does have
luma<00:03:35.790> on<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.000> field<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.630> can<00:03:36.900> make<00:03:37.050> her<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.200> lot

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
luma on the field it can make her a lot

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.470 
luma on the field it can make her a lot
stronger<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:38.340> while<00:03:38.700> he's<00:03:38.880> away<00:03:39.120> there's<00:03:39.420> a

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
stronger but while he's away there's a

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.820 
stronger but while he's away there's a
lot<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.750> counter<00:03:39.870> play<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.440> opponent<00:03:40.739> can

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
lot of counter play and the opponent can

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.770 
lot of counter play and the opponent can
pretty<00:03:40.980> much<00:03:41.070> beat<00:03:41.370> up<00:03:41.489> on<00:03:41.640> luma<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.450> she<00:03:42.540> has

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
pretty much beat up on luma so she has

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.060 
pretty much beat up on luma so she has
to<00:03:42.900> wait<00:03:43.019> for<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.230> woman<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.560> come<00:03:43.709> back<00:03:43.890> it

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
to wait for a woman to come back it

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.350 
to wait for a woman to come back it
would<00:03:44.160> overall<00:03:44.519> just<00:03:44.880> give<00:03:45.030> him<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.180> lot<00:03:45.330> more

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
would overall just give him a lot more

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.759 
would overall just give him a lot more
counter<00:03:45.780> play<00:03:45.959> but<00:03:46.170> still<00:03:46.350> keep<00:03:46.500> her<00:03:46.620> as<00:03:46.680> a

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
counter play but still keep her as a

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.670 
counter play but still keep her as a
strong<00:03:46.950> character<00:03:47.959> of<00:03:48.959> course<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.470> number

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
strong character of course the number

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.470 
strong character of course the number
one<00:03:49.799> spot<00:03:50.040> had<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.430> go<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.580> Sheik<00:03:50.850> this<00:03:51.180> little

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
one spot had to go to Sheik this little

one spot had to go to Sheik this little

now I bet most of you already know this

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.210 
now I bet most of you already know this
so<00:04:06.299> let<00:04:06.510> me<00:04:06.600> go<00:04:06.750> on<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:07.110> what<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.290> think<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.680> do

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
so let me go on to what I think I do

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.250 
so let me go on to what I think I do
need<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.790> change<00:04:09.000> about<00:04:09.090> her<00:04:09.330> well<00:04:09.690> first<00:04:10.019> as

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
need to change about her well first as

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.750 
need to change about her well first as
many<00:04:10.590> people<00:04:10.890> say<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.310> could<00:04:11.459> just<00:04:11.640> add

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
many people say you could just add

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.699 
many people say you could just add
ending<00:04:12.209> lacked<00:04:12.390> or<00:04:12.570> fair<00:04:12.900> there<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.560> back

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
ending lacked or fair there and back

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.710 
ending lacked or fair there and back
here<00:04:13.980> which<00:04:14.580> would<00:04:14.790> make<00:04:14.970> her<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.120> ton<00:04:15.480> worse

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
here which would make her a ton worse

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.270 
here which would make her a ton worse
but<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.049> feel<00:04:16.290> like<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.859> would<00:04:16.979> just<00:04:17.100> be<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
but I feel like that would just be the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.039 
but I feel like that would just be the
easiest<00:04:17.489> way<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:17.669> nerf<00:04:17.880> ur<00:04:18.030> but<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.570> also<00:04:18.750> make

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
easiest way to nerf ur but it also make

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.349 
easiest way to nerf ur but it also make
her<00:04:19.169> really<00:04:19.410> bad<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:20.040> she<00:04:20.489> wouldn't<00:04:21.120> be<00:04:21.239> as

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
her really bad and she wouldn't be as

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.490 
her really bad and she wouldn't be as
good<00:04:21.510> as<00:04:21.630> what<00:04:21.750> she's<00:04:21.900> good<00:04:22.080> at<00:04:22.109> she'd

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
good as what she's good at she'd

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.020 
good as what she's good at she'd
probably<00:04:22.680> just<00:04:22.830> go<00:04:23.340> really<00:04:23.580> low<00:04:23.729> in<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.880> tier

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
probably just go really low in the tier

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.820 
probably just go really low in the tier
list<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:24.450> some<00:04:24.930> other<00:04:25.110> ways<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.289> could<00:04:25.740> make

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
list so some other ways that could make

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.330 
list so some other ways that could make
it<00:04:25.950> worse

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
it worse

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.500 
it worse
but<00:04:26.789> not<00:04:27.060> as

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
but not as

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.150 
but not as
bad<00:04:27.630> is<00:04:27.870> just<00:04:28.080> make<00:04:28.230> her<00:04:28.320> needles<00:04:28.710> shoot<00:04:28.980> a

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
bad is just make her needles shoot a

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.460 
bad is just make her needles shoot a
little<00:04:29.430> bit<00:04:29.550> less<00:04:29.700> length<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.240> take<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.260> little

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
little bit less length and take a little

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.620 
little bit less length and take a little
bit<00:04:31.620> longer<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.490> charge<00:04:32.730> so<00:04:32.970> she<00:04:33.030> can't<00:04:33.330> camp

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
bit longer to charge so she can't camp

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.360 
bit longer to charge so she can't camp
or<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.350> make<00:04:34.470> her<00:04:34.560> throw<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:34.890> really<00:04:35.250> not

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
or to make her throw is really not

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.860 
or to make her throw is really not
combos<00:04:35.760> well<00:04:35.940> or<00:04:36.120> come<00:04:36.300> when<00:04:36.450> to<00:04:36.540> kill<00:04:36.690> moose

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
combos well or come when to kill moose

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.200 
combos well or come when to kill moose
or<00:04:37.260> just<00:04:37.830> nerf<00:04:38.010> or<00:04:38.160> kill<00:04:38.370> moves<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:38.940> she

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
or just nerf or kill moves so that she

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.820 
or just nerf or kill moves so that she
really<00:04:39.390> doesn't<00:04:39.540> have<00:04:39.810> to<00:04:39.840> kill<00:04:40.200> at<00:04:40.410> all<00:04:40.530> any

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
really doesn't have to kill at all any

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.680 
really doesn't have to kill at all any
longer<00:04:41.160> but<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:41.640> could<00:04:41.940> also<00:04:42.090> make<00:04:42.390> her<00:04:42.510> very

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
longer but that could also make her very

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.360 
longer but that could also make her very
bad<00:04:42.990> without<00:04:43.230> having<00:04:43.620> any<00:04:43.770> kill<00:04:43.980> moves<00:04:44.160> at<00:04:44.280> all

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
bad without having any kill moves at all

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.370 
bad without having any kill moves at all
any<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.150> these<00:04:45.240> could<00:04:45.510> put<00:04:45.720> her<00:04:45.840> more<00:04:46.080> into<00:04:46.260> an

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
any of these could put her more into an

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.930 
any of these could put her more into an
equal<00:04:46.740> spot<00:04:47.010> with<00:04:47.130> all<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.370> other<00:04:47.490> characters

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
equal spot with all the other characters

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.250 
equal spot with all the other characters
and<00:04:47.970> more<00:04:48.330> balanced<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.720> game<00:04:48.900> but<00:04:49.080> at<00:04:49.170> the

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
and more balanced the game but at the

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.960 
and more balanced the game but at the
same<00:04:49.410> time<00:04:49.680> if<00:04:49.890> they're<00:04:50.100> done<00:04:50.310> too<00:04:50.520> much<00:04:50.700> it

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
same time if they're done too much it

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.760 
same time if they're done too much it
could<00:04:51.420> make<00:04:51.600> Sheik<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:51.900> very<00:04:52.110> bad<00:04:52.320> character

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
could make Sheik a very bad character

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.950 
could make Sheik a very bad character
she<00:04:53.220> is<00:04:53.250> just<00:04:53.610> on<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:53.820> line<00:04:53.970> between<00:04:54.180> Opie<00:04:54.750> and

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
she is just on the line between Opie and

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.470 
she is just on the line between Opie and
a<00:04:55.530> good<00:04:56.070> nerf<00:04:56.280> could<00:04:56.550> make<00:04:56.700> her<00:04:56.790> really<00:04:57.030> bad<00:04:57.210> so

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
a good nerf could make her really bad so

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.360 
a good nerf could make her really bad so
it's<00:04:57.900> really<00:04:58.140> hard<00:04:58.290> to<00:04:58.350> nerf<00:04:58.530> her<00:04:58.680> but<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.130> hope

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
it's really hard to nerf her but I hope

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.740 
it's really hard to nerf her but I hope
the<00:04:59.490> intended<00:04:59.820> does<00:04:59.970> come<00:05:00.180> up<00:05:00.300> with<00:05:00.450> something
