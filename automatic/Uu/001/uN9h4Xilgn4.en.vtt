world everything snaps together and all
the<00:00:16.520> pieces<00:00:16.730> index<00:00:17.390> in<00:00:17.689> so<00:00:18.439> like<00:00:18.619> when<00:00:18.830> I<00:00:18.859> start

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
the pieces index in so like when I start

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.609 
the pieces index in so like when I start
this<00:00:19.820> up<00:00:20.150> right<00:00:20.539> instead<00:00:20.990> of<00:00:21.109> like<00:00:21.259> trying<00:00:21.529> to

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
this up right instead of like trying to

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.519 
this up right instead of like trying to
index<00:00:22.070> it<00:00:22.220> in<00:00:22.339> off<00:00:22.519> the<00:00:22.550> table<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.810> poles<00:00:24.169> are

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
index it in off the table the poles are

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.829 
index it in off the table the poles are
already<00:00:24.859> set<00:00:25.159> in<00:00:25.369> a<00:00:25.460> precision<00:00:25.849> fit<00:00:26.269> so<00:00:26.599> when<00:00:26.749> I

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:26.839 
already set in a precision fit so when I

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.200 
already set in a precision fit so when I
put<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:27.710> upright<00:00:27.859> in<00:00:28.249> it's<00:00:28.489> already<00:00:28.849> straight

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
put the upright in it's already straight

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.529 
put the upright in it's already straight
and<00:00:29.449> indexed<00:00:30.140> with<00:00:30.349> this<00:00:30.619> all<00:00:30.970> dead<00:00:31.970> nuts<00:00:32.239> on

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
and indexed with this all dead nuts on

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.760 
and indexed with this all dead nuts on
before<00:00:35.539> I<00:00:35.570> had<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:35.930> like<00:00:36.079> make<00:00:36.320> a<00:00:36.350> frame

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
fixture and weld a bunch of stuff for

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.869 
fixture and weld a bunch of stuff for
every<00:00:38.870> frame<00:00:39.140> was<00:00:39.500> different<00:00:39.980> so<00:00:40.609> I<00:00:40.640> had<00:00:40.760> to
