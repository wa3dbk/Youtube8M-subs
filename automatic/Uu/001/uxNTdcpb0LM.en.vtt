your<00:00:13.980> tires<00:00:14.250> need<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.730> be<00:00:14.820> fitted<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.480> they

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
your tires need to be fitted so they

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.019 
your tires need to be fitted so they
rotate<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> correct<00:00:16.680> direction<00:00:16.770> as<00:00:17.550> per

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029

rotate in the correct direction as per
the<00:00:18.300> markings<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:18.960> your<00:00:19.109> side<00:00:19.350> wall<00:00:19.650> they<00:00:20.160> also
