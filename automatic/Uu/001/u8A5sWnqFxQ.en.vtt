00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.040 

something<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.620> that<00:00:32.660> which<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.810> a<00:00:33.840> good

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
something like that which is a good

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.930 
something like that which is a good
warm-up<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.620> mean<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.220> this<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.490> nothing

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
warm-up I mean this and this is nothing

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.320 
warm-up I mean this and this is nothing
with<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.240> doubles<00:00:37.070> it's<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.280> lot<00:00:38.460> easier<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.030> go

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
with the doubles it's a lot easier to go

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.380 
with the doubles it's a lot easier to go
for<00:00:39.630> extended<00:00:40.230> periods<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.680> time<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.970> for

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
for extended periods of time and so for

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.190 
for extended periods of time and so for
what<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> would<00:00:42.900> do<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:44.790> get<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
what I would do for that to get the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.420 
what I would do for that to get the
stamina<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.620> insurance<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:48.330> to<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.050> do

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
stamina and the insurance is to just do

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.190 
stamina and the insurance is to just do
some<00:00:50.430> syncopation<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.809> whole<00:00:52.020> book

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
some syncopation do the the whole book

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.560 
some syncopation do the the whole book
through<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.770> mean<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.580> takes<00:00:53.790> a<00:00:53.970> problem<00:00:54.360> about

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
through I mean it takes a problem about

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.030 
through I mean it takes a problem about
an<00:00:54.690> hour<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> half<00:00:55.230> when<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.830> that

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
an hour and a half when you can do that

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.610 
an hour and a half when you can do that
it's<00:00:56.610> great<00:00:56.940> all<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.900> stick<00:00:58.379> in

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it's great all you do is you stick in

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.410 
it's great all you do is you stick in
the<00:00:58.800> triplets<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.370> between<00:00:59.790> the<00:00:59.940> notes<00:01:00.090> here

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the triplets in between the notes here

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.260 
the triplets in between the notes here
so<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.750> play<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> first<00:01:01.290> time<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:09.119> that's

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
so if I play the first time so that's

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.710 
so if I play the first time so that's
what<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.479> first<00:01:09.930> line<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.500> would<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:11.720> so

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
what that first line here would be so

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.180 
what that first line here would be so
all<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.259> accent<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.890> learn

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
all you do is your accent you learn

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.790 
all you do is your accent you learn
instead<00:01:14.340> your<00:01:15.300> leg<00:01:15.540> learns<00:01:15.899> also<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
instead your leg learns also get to

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.280 
instead your leg learns also get to
accent<00:01:17.399> which<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.149> basically<00:01:18.720> what<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.140> do

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
accent which is basically what we do

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.020 
accent which is basically what we do
when<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:19.710> rudiments<00:01:19.979> we're<00:01:20.430> always<00:01:20.520> keeping

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
when your rudiments we're always keeping

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
when your rudiments we're always keeping
our<00:01:21.270> Buddha<00:01:21.840> mental<00:01:22.229> solos<00:01:22.619> we're<00:01:22.860> always

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
our Buddha mental solos we're always

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.780 
our Buddha mental solos we're always
keeping<00:01:23.520> up<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.540> little<00:01:25.490> layer<00:01:26.490> of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
keeping up like this little layer of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:43.670 
keeping up like this little layer of
little<00:01:27.180> ghost<00:01:27.420> notes

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.990 

so<00:01:44.680> that's<00:01:44.890> what<00:01:45.040> I<00:01:45.070> kind<00:01:45.370> of<00:01:45.460> want<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.790> do<00:01:45.880> with

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
so that's what I kind of want to do with

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.990 
so that's what I kind of want to do with
the<00:01:46.120> feet<00:01:46.360> but<00:01:47.140> first<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:47.830> just<00:01:48.580> wanted<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:48.850> get

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
the feet but first I just wanted to get

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.360 
the feet but first I just wanted to get
into<00:01:49.180> some<00:01:49.600> interesting<00:01:50.470> Polly<00:01:50.860> rhythmic

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
into some interesting Polly rhythmic

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.710 
into some interesting Polly rhythmic
patterns<00:01:51.790> just<00:01:52.480> going<00:01:52.780> with<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.230> sheet<00:01:53.590> here

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
patterns just going with the sheet here

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.470 
patterns just going with the sheet here
like<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.900> first<00:01:56.110> one<00:01:56.410> is<00:01:56.440> just<00:01:56.800> a<00:01:57.010> 38<00:01:57.580> over<00:01:57.880> 44

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
like the first one is just a 38 over 44

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.050 
like the first one is just a 38 over 44
then<00:01:59.200> when<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.440> start<00:01:59.710> rolling<00:02:00.190> it<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:00.550> sounds

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
then when you start rolling it it sounds

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.030 
then when you start rolling it it sounds
like<00:02:01.180> it's<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.540> nine<00:02:01.720> stroke<00:02:02.020> roll<00:02:02.350> which

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
like it's a nine stroke roll which

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.090 
like it's a nine stroke roll which
sounds<00:02:03.460> pretty<00:02:03.850> cool<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:04.810> at<00:02:04.960> times<00:02:05.230> number

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
sounds pretty cool so at times number

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:19.770 
sounds pretty cool so at times number
three<00:02:06.460> here

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.170 

sounds<00:02:20.780> like<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:22.070> this<00:02:22.520> is<00:02:22.610> all<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:22.970> now

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
sounds like that so this is all and now

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.210 
sounds like that so this is all and now
you<00:02:23.240> get<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.570> harder<00:02:24.110> things<00:02:24.140> or<00:02:24.560> more<00:02:24.740> this<00:02:25.130> is

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
you get to harder things or more this is

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.770 
you get to harder things or more this is
what<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.490> can<00:02:25.640> do<00:02:25.820> with<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.300> doubles<00:02:26.690> is

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
what you can do with the doubles is

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.320 
what you can do with the doubles is
where<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.380> find<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:28.010> don't<00:02:28.460> tell<00:02:28.730> my<00:02:28.910> students

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
where I find I don't tell my students

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.240 
where I find I don't tell my students
not<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.570> be<00:02:29.780> restricted<00:02:30.200> keep<00:02:30.650> going<00:02:31.070> don't

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
not to be restricted keep going don't

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.350 
not to be restricted keep going don't
ever<00:02:32.020> don't<00:02:33.020> ever<00:02:33.230> like<00:02:33.860> end<00:02:34.100> with<00:02:34.490> just<00:02:34.520> you

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
ever don't ever like end with just you

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.360 
ever don't ever like end with just you
got<00:02:35.540> your<00:02:35.720> feet<00:02:35.960> going<00:02:36.290> fast<00:02:36.590> great<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.220> can

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
got your feet going fast great you can

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.800 
got your feet going fast great you can
do<00:02:37.460> a<00:02:37.520> couple<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:37.940> accents<00:02:38.450> like<00:02:38.510> in<00:02:38.720> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
do a couple of accents like in the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.610 
do a couple of accents like in the
warm-ups<00:02:39.320> so<00:02:40.310> what<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:40.970> wanted<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.480> do<00:02:41.690> was<00:02:41.720> add

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
warm-ups so what I wanted to do was add

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.300 
warm-ups so what I wanted to do was add
let's<00:02:43.460> start<00:02:43.820> adding<00:02:44.890> two<00:02:45.890> kinds<00:02:46.250> of

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
let's start adding two kinds of

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.610 
let's start adding two kinds of
rudiments<00:02:46.820> together<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.390> I've<00:02:47.510> got<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
rudiments together so I've got the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.030 
rudiments together so I've got the
paradiddle<00:02:49.400> with<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.790> hands<00:02:50.240> with<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.500> five

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
paradiddle with the hands with the five

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.960 
paradiddle with the hands with the five
the<00:02:52.250> diddle<00:02:52.520> which<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.640> sounds

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
the diddle which is this so that sounds

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:16.200 
the diddle which is this so that sounds
like<00:02:59.060> this

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.330 

that's<00:03:17.210> one<00:03:17.450> more<00:03:17.570> tighter<00:03:17.930> now<00:03:18.770> before<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.190> go

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
that's one more tighter now before I go

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.920 
that's one more tighter now before I go
into<00:03:19.370> how<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:19.940> can<00:03:20.300> else<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.780> can

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
into how you can else you can

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.980 
into how you can else you can
orchestrate<00:03:21.140> this<00:03:21.710> I'll<00:03:22.400> just<00:03:23.120> keep<00:03:23.660> going

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
orchestrate this I'll just keep going

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.350 
orchestrate this I'll just keep going
here<00:03:24.290> like<00:03:24.620> I'll<00:03:24.830> start<00:03:25.190> with<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.580> tape<00:03:26.210> the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
here like I'll start with the tape the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.140 
here like I'll start with the tape the
triplets<00:03:26.870> with<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.140> feed<00:03:27.380> plate<00:03:28.010> over<00:03:28.340> 44<00:03:28.850> but

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
triplets with the feed plate over 44 but

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.480 
triplets with the feed plate over 44 but
now<00:03:29.270> offset<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.050> make<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.380> in<00:03:30.530> sixteenth<00:03:31.220> notes

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
now offset it make it in sixteenth notes

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:40.490 
now offset it make it in sixteenth notes
it<00:03:31.670> sounded<00:03:31.940> like<00:03:31.970> this

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.280 

now<00:03:41.500> add<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.310> Swiss<00:03:42.610> Army<00:03:42.849> triplet<00:03:43.360> which<00:03:43.989> is

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
now add the Swiss Army triplet which is

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.440 
now add the Swiss Army triplet which is
just<00:03:44.349> it's<00:03:44.950> two<00:03:45.670> sets<00:03:45.969> of<00:03:46.060> doubles

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
just it's two sets of doubles

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.729 
just it's two sets of doubles
overlapping<00:03:48.420> no<00:03:52.079> reason<00:03:53.079> you<00:03:53.170> can't<00:03:53.319> do<00:03:53.560> that

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
overlapping no reason you can't do that

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.440 
overlapping no reason you can't do that
so<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:54.909> get<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.269> going<00:03:57.209> triplet<00:03:58.209> 1<00:03:58.420> triplet

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
so you get that going triplet 1 triplet

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.750 
so you get that going triplet 1 triplet
2<00:03:58.720> triplet<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.590> make<00:03:59.890> it<00:04:00.069> in<00:04:00.250> sixteenth

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
2 triplet and that make it in sixteenth

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:16.170 
2 triplet and that make it in sixteenth
notes<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.209> sounds<00:04:01.480> like<00:04:01.599> this

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.720 

that's<00:04:17.180> what<00:04:17.419> that<00:04:17.570> sounds<00:04:17.930> like<00:04:18.489> now<00:04:19.489> one<00:04:19.700> of

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
that's what that sounds like now one of

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.430 
that's what that sounds like now one of
my<00:04:19.850> favorite<00:04:19.940> patterns<00:04:20.750> actually<00:04:21.139> got<00:04:21.290> this

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
my favorite patterns actually got this

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.140 
my favorite patterns actually got this
from<00:04:21.650> Thomas<00:04:22.130> lang<00:04:22.340> is<00:04:22.550> taking<00:04:22.940> a<00:04:23.090> three<00:04:23.840> for

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
from Thomas lang is taking a three for

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.870 
from Thomas lang is taking a three for
bass<00:04:26.150> drum<00:04:26.389> pattern<00:04:26.780> putting<00:04:27.110> it<00:04:27.200> over<00:04:27.380> 44<00:04:28.130> so

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
bass drum pattern putting it over 44 so

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.690 
bass drum pattern putting it over 44 so
it's<00:04:29.440> more<00:04:30.440> polyrhythmic<00:04:31.040> stuff<00:04:31.430> so<00:04:31.580> it's

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
it's more polyrhythmic stuff so it's

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.909 
it's more polyrhythmic stuff so it's
just<00:04:31.840> one<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:35.240> two<00:04:35.660> E<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:35.870> A<00:04:36.200> three<00:04:36.230> E<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.560> on

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
just one and two E and A three E and on

00:04:36.919 --> 00:05:01.480 
just one and two E and A three E and on
the<00:04:37.040> feet<00:04:37.250> played<00:04:37.970> over<00:04:38.240> 44

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.910 

and<00:05:02.490> now<00:05:02.900> before<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:03.930> get<00:05:04.020> into<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.530> might<00:05:04.860> as

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
and now before I get into a might as

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.190 
and now before I get into a might as
well<00:05:05.040> new<00:05:05.220> number<00:05:05.460> seven<00:05:05.850> just<00:05:06.330> it's<00:05:06.930> five

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
well new number seven just it's five

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.070 
well new number seven just it's five
stroke<00:05:07.500> rolls<00:05:08.240> syncopated<00:05:09.240> in<00:05:09.360> 74<00:05:09.930> which

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
stroke rolls syncopated in 74 which

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:18.950 
stroke rolls syncopated in 74 which
sounds<00:05:10.350> like

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.989 

so<00:05:19.960> that's<00:05:20.199> this<00:05:20.499> generally<00:05:21.430> what<00:05:21.639> I<00:05:21.669> would

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:21.999 
so that's this generally what I would

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:24.420 
so that's this generally what I would
yes<00:05:22.749> let's<00:05:23.139> hand<00:05:23.439> out<00:05:23.619> the<00:05:23.770> animals<00:05:24.159> that<00:05:24.309> are

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
yes let's hand out the animals that are

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.989 
yes let's hand out the animals that are
the<00:05:24.520> jobs<00:05:24.789> that<00:05:24.879> are<00:05:25.059> interested<00:05:25.599> in<00:05:25.719> learning

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:26.999 
the jobs that are interested in learning

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:29.700 
the jobs that are interested in learning
what<00:05:27.999> I<00:05:28.029> did<00:05:28.389> because<00:05:28.569> usually<00:05:28.930> like<00:05:29.439> like

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.749 
the soul with all this stuff
incorporated<00:05:33.789> in<00:05:33.939> it<00:05:34.149> but<00:05:34.990> I'm<00:05:35.649> sure<00:05:36.309> like

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 
incorporated in it but I'm sure like

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.549 
incorporated in it but I'm sure like
like<00:05:37.029> a<00:05:37.059> lot<00:05:37.360> of<00:05:37.509> people<00:05:37.659> they<00:05:38.050> I<00:05:38.080> mean<00:05:38.199> if<00:05:38.469> you

you're doing stuff with your feet and
the<00:06:11.080> hands<00:06:11.319> in<00:06:11.529> different<00:06:11.860> time<00:06:12.009> sent<00:06:12.279> you<00:06:12.399> but

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
the hands in different time sent you but

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.480 
the hands in different time sent you but
now<00:06:12.699> move<00:06:12.999> them<00:06:13.300> around<00:06:13.389> so<00:06:13.870> you're<00:06:14.529> doing<00:06:14.949> the

now move them around so you're doing the

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.279 
now move them around so you're doing the
right<00:06:15.669> side<00:06:16.029> over<00:06:16.449> the<00:06:16.569> left<00:06:16.779> side<00:06:17.020> coming

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
right side over the left side coming

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:37.740 
right side over the left side coming
like<00:06:17.499> this<00:06:17.529> so<00:06:18.219> if<00:06:18.339> i<00:06:18.430> do<00:06:18.490> that<00:06:18.759> five<00:06:19.059> again

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:49.770 

with<00:06:38.750> triplets<00:06:39.530> over

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.530 

now<00:06:50.780> what<00:06:51.020> I<00:06:51.050> wanted<00:06:51.380> to<00:06:51.440> do<00:06:51.710> is<00:06:51.890> also<00:06:52.330> what<00:06:53.330> I'm

come up with an ostinato with the feet
and<00:06:59.030> play<00:06:59.960> a<00:06:59.990> time<00:07:00.350> signature<00:07:00.620> with<00:07:01.400> the<00:07:01.550> right

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760

with the left so I showed the how the
triplets<00:07:06.230> can<00:07:06.380> be<00:07:06.500> superimposed<00:07:06.860> as

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
triplets can be superimposed as

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.160 
triplets can be superimposed as
sixteenth<00:07:08.030> notes<00:07:08.470> over<00:07:09.470> 44<00:07:09.980> and<00:07:10.250> 44<00:07:10.990> same<00:07:11.990> with

sixteenth notes over 44 and 44 same with
the<00:07:12.260> five<00:07:12.500> and<00:07:12.860> four<00:07:13.100> for<00:07:13.310> now<00:07:13.880> I'll<00:07:14.270> do<00:07:14.960> the

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.130 
left hand will do that over 44 / I've

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.360 
left hand will do that over 44 / I've
inverted<00:07:20.060> paradiddle<00:07:20.890> using<00:07:21.890> multiple

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370 
inverted paradiddle using multiple

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.240 
inverted paradiddle using multiple
pebbles<00:07:22.850> which<00:07:23.660> the<00:07:24.200> accents<00:07:24.830> that's<00:07:24.980> another

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.250
