 And I am trying to dark. Now what I am going to know the song band is determined 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:52.230
 Do you think many words will become water in the field 3? 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.550
 I do not know at all, but you have to look at it. 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.359

 A little help can be grateful 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:20.960
 Now that I thought about it , the skin that I had underwent surgery did not shrink again. 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:25.759
 If you think about it, I can do a simple operation. 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.759
 The procedure was very difficult. 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:36.330
 And are you the one to help you now, you can see what the source in Japan 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.850
 There's a bit of resilience to allow me to go to the blood sugar level 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.210
 It's not scaled back, it's scented. 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.390
 Of course, going to Japan and operating 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.380

 And as the summer passes , what will happen then ? 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:24.780
 I think I once cried Jacob, who regretted asking for it someday . 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:29.520
 I've always thought that maybe I should have saved it . 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.820

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.569
 With guilt 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:08.739
 Every time I get an operation every time I get an operation 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:11.140
 I was troubled by the fact that I was in my head. 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:17.590
 Because you probably would have been about 1 year 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:22.840
 The company was on fire in the vehicle-to-something to buy that music video that Haven 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.770
 We are not a woman but our male prodigy. How do you get on the runway? 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.520
 Do not go outside 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:31.900
 While watching the physical scene, 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:37.370
 It's just outside. I have to roll my feet and listen to it. 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:40.970
 I've got to do it this way. 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.580
 I have these days 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:48.260
