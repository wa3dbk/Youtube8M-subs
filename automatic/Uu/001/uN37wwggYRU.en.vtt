00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.340
 do not 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.340
 when I 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.840
 how about play I hope you are super good 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.340
 and for some guys we are in a 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.260
 new video this time in a new one 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.630
 trick that has been done for quite some time 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.400
 that is already but now it is easier in 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.560
 steel points 2.1 as we can bend 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.480
 or not for this other as they need nothing 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.860
 nothing difficult, we're going to need a fence 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.140
 of any color that I have this of the 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.120
 neider and we are also going to need sand 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.280
 and a night vision position but 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.780
 is not it is not totally necessary that 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.699
 but it will give you a better result if 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.489
 use it ok let me passed the first 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.780
 person over here and how this is done by 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.639
 example that we're going to end up where they want 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.120
 me but here I have an active point 

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:50.670
 I'm going to finish 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.620
 and good goats where they want me to go 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.260
 to finish up here and they're going to put a 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.500
 fence like this after they're going to put two 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.860
 sand blocks on you one two and 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.329
 we are going to bend over and there is forgiveness and as 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.159
 mercedes the entire game system but 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.440
 they see everything dark and then the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.659
 true that good is not so dark 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.250
 but it does not serve us anything that 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.659
 see all curupay for that we're going to 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.030
 use the night vision position 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.159
 well here we take it and we can see everything 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.100
 what's down there eat there is a zombie 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.630
 with spam there too they can see 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.610
 all the minerals that there is this is 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.380
 super useful to look for diamonds in 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.490
 survival guys for when it 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.270
 there are jobs left and nothing is found 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.710
 they can get things and I think that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.470
 that would be all this guys video but 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.659
 you liked it I know it's something short 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.369
 before there was a more different methods 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.140
 to knit 12 but it was with others 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.530
 resources that was the rail and tnt something like that 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.300
 but this is much easier but I hope 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.800
 that you liked the video I know that 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:53.660

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.040

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.250
