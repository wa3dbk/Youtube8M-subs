it will show that the phone has passed

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.420 
it will show that the phone has passed
our<00:01:06.720> next<00:01:07.110> road<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:08.000> star<00:01:09.000> hash<00:01:09.920> one<00:01:10.920> two<00:01:11.130> three

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
our next road is star hash one two three

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.480 
our next road is star hash one two three
four

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
four

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.740 
four
it<00:01:14.490> will<00:01:14.729> show<00:01:14.880> D<00:01:15.060> version<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> software

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
it will show D version of the software

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.520 
it will show D version of the software
so<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.159> not<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.549> much<00:01:17.790> importance<00:01:18.659> next

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
so it is not that much importance next

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.469 
so it is not that much importance next
what<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.710> star<00:01:20.130> has<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.640> seven<00:01:21.680> eight<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.070> hash

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
what is star has you seven eight to hash

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.039 
what is star has you seven eight to hash
it<00:01:24.479> will<00:01:24.900> show<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> exact<00:01:25.590> clock<00:01:26.420> another<00:01:27.420> two

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
it will show the exact clock another two
