00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.669
 the youtube galera that tells us that the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.139
 max 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:15.240
 I'm the staff today, I'm bringing 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.789
 type for the channel a box is from my mouse 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.699
 game as you said in the previous video 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.519
 I was putting together a good computer 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.439
 computer game setup of course 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.339
 A computer game needs a mouse. 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.880
 game is the brand robson I already have one 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.470
 phone brand that I quite like and 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.330
 dies right here on a mouse 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.230
 conventional way as you can see a 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.390
 amount of ipi and fps tram 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.710
 it comes with six buttons to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.880
 set up to play better and let's 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:01:07.350
 open catch my friend stiletto this 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:01:10.649
 open a moment there guys this cable 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.460
 here is a meter and little enough 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.549
 accomplished 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.439
 it's a very strong material as you can 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:23.820
 see that it is great to be able to feel 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:28.499
 play quite a lot of teaching and learning 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.789
 middle and durable material that is to 

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:38.039
 take the hit is how it is here 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:41.939
 the mouse protects and looks only guys 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:45.509
 look at this three-dimensional mouse effect 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.729
 It seems that there are some lights down here. 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.520
 or more of it and here is a 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.310
 little button of the report to set up 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.649
 one in the middle also 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.420
 and this very three-dimensional effect 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.439
 so beautiful a green with no effect 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:09.590
 The following people are brilliant, I'm going to be there. 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:12.960
 on the pc to see how it turns on is coming 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.040
 I came back as you can see already caught in 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.969
 machine 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.359
 until neither the civil wheel nor 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:22.950
 Tarciso the other side is unclear 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:26.189
 effect was not so good because 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.969
 still afternoon here so you can not really have 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:32.640
 whole experience of old and use 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.959
 but I quite liked the footprint it seems 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.840
 a good mouse 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.090
 It's not that cheap , but if you 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.299
 look for the inec you may even find 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.310
 some promotion such that even I will not 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.209
 test him to see if in practice he is 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.019
 really good 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.220
 I like it a lot and it is 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.959
 that's right 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.689

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.519
