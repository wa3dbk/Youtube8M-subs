00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.069
 big hello to everyone and today i'm filming 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.080
 videos about their purchases her site for a long time, I 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.090
 I did not shoot a similar video plan, although 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.370
 I have already accumulated quite a lot 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.460
 number of different natural products 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.779
 you just let them pass and 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.760
 first I want to show you this 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.740
 oil called bay 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.470
 If translated into Russian then this 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.140
 bay leaf heard just huge 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.789
 number of different positive reviews 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.759
 a large number of people advised me 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.469
 buy it and say that from this oil 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.270
 quickly grow hair that they 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.210
 become more so strong and 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.489
 healthy and shiny therefore decided it 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.800
 Order while I did not use it, but 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.920
 soon plan to start doing 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.520
 masks with this oil as for smell 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.620
 who's just some kind of horror i'm not at all 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.510
 I love the smell of bay leaf and I don't know 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.340
 how will i put it on the roots rather 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.930
 I will add a lot of everything 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.850
 different essential mother of course i 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.100
 ordered her favorite lotion from the company 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.710
 tires are my favorite cucumber and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.280
 also decided to try with lemon and 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.470
 as far as I remember, he is more faithful to us 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.170
 alcohol base so be sure to sweat 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.689
 share some impressions 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.659
 The next one ordered thermal protection from 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.680
 firms giovanni this series 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.799
 Brazilian keratin with argan oil 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.590
 If you remember, I ordered shampoo 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.670
 and air conditioning from this series somewhere 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.220
 probably a month ago they are to me and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.009
 ended and they completely I did 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.680
 didn't hit they didn't do my hair 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.119
 no longer know smoother more obedient 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.220
 well, that is absolutely not like they are not 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.170
 affected my hair all the same I decided 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.119
 give chance to this firm the arma method means 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.540
 really liked her very much 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.460
 pleasant light smell with hints of coconut 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.920
 the exact same smell as shampoo 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.070
 air conditioner i liked how she 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.350
 unravels the hair they become 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.590
 soft and even a little shiny 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.759
 so with pleasure i use and 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.520
 I will order the opportunity because I have 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.070
 there was a desert desert injury 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.840
 essence coconut and she me not very 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.650
 rather liked not so much 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.740
 liked 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.130
 I did not notice any action that is 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.930
 she didn't seem to unravel her hair 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.640
 hair as if not particularly soft 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.340
 especially brilliant therefore 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.290
 from this thermal protection I see the result 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.810
 further ordered myself again from the company 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.060
 giovanni and this is some kind of elixir for 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.310
 hair and as far as I understood it something 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.590
 like moroccan oil 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.260
 on sweet 1 pass don't remember how she 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.470
 called since my oil is already 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.110
 coming to the end decided to order myself 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.790
 something more or less natural though 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.860
 silicone is not silicones and the third time 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.560
 in a row and order myself eye cream from 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.660
 reviva labs is such 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.270
 here it is a small plastic jar and 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.280
 here 21 grams is actually his 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.560
 long enough because he 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.930
 such a fat, quite necessary 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.950
 a little bit he just perfectly moisturizes 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.450
 this area 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.220
 he does not slide at all if 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.780
 apply it under make up so all i 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.120
 his advice is sure that you too 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.650
 will like myself ordered two creams 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.810
 from the company avalon organics 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.989
 it's day and night let's start with 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.600
 day I have it with vitamin c in it 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.480
 very pleasant smell rather pleasant for 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.640
 me because it smells like oranges 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.650
 naturally very tasty so to whom 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.140
 like this smell like no one 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.019
 so I do not advise because the smell 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.550
 very so cutting very explicit and 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.830
 long enough to keep on face 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.510
 consistency it is enough fat Nikita 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.330
 the topic would quietly tilt the jar 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.580
 He is not going anywhere at first I thought that 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.160
 that I will put his face I will 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.410
 bold shine but no i put it on them 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.320
 immediately absorbed literally instantly 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.000
 and my face became dull 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.480
 I had a rather strange reaction to 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.239
 this cream I have brushed brow brushes and 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.610
 chin as I recall and I decided 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.070
 read reviews and very many Pezic 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.950
 there it turns red but then later it gets used to 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.790
 this cream is fine 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.590
 indeed it was so where for 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.590
 I had red skin for two or three days 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.600
 somewhere probably about 15 minutes later this 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.790
 beauty subsided and everything was fine 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.230
 but to be honest, at first, I am very 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.060
 strongly frightened because never 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.360
 I have such a reaction was not on any 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.200
 cream is probably the reaction minaj in Kamenets 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.900
 cream like it is great for 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.510
 oily probably for combined for 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.720
 normal skin for dry probably everything 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.940
 still moisture will not be enough and 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.280
 the next is night cream with lavender 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.710
 again the smell is very bright very strong 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.080
 i love the smell of lavender so me he 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.720
 I like him very dense 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.240
 enough consistency it is such 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.000
 little white inside again he is very 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.120
 quickly absorbed by the skin no 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.310
 no shine like him 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.170
 moisturizes my skin this moisturizing 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.560
 enough but if you are dry 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.870
 skin then I think you need to look for something 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.730
 more such a feeder probably the most 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.520
 the main thing that I did not score, these creams are far 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.890
 and use it ghetto probably two weeks 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.460
 so this first impression is not me 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:14.400
 she said she also liked 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.240
 once again cream from the company Jason with 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.130
 vitamin e 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.740
 but this time somehow probably from 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.720
 inattention I ordered a cream with more 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.000
 lower content of the very vitamin 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.130
 and the consistency of this cream is more 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.440
 light film has exactly the same smell 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.710
 quite specific it doesn't smell 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.320
 some kind of flower fruits in principle 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.910
 it goes without smell but when you 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.250
 put it on your face after all he 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.950
 appears not the most pleasant therefore 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.780
 if you don't like some weird 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.670
 smells I think that we certainly do not 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.560
 perfect for this cream 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.930
 for combination skin unlike 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.450
 the same cream but with another 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.720
 vitamin e content and using and 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.250
 delightfully for the night we put on of course 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.440
 don't fall it anyway more like that 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.480
 bold and the last thing I bought myself 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.670
 Again cream from firm Jason but in this 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.040
 I decided to try some more cocoa 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.720
 I also want to note that these creams 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.730
 fairly universal points can 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.900
 apply both on face and body as 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.480
 written in the description 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.910
 although many leave their feedback that is not 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.190
 inflicts only on the face I do not know 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.650
 I will try to apply on the body on the face later 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.780
 take on tell you about my some 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.520
 I haven’t opened the results yet because 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.530
 I still have a huge amount 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.010
 different unfinished jars 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.750
 It is in principle and all today I hope that 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.120
 you liked this review 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.830
 tell me what you got 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.570
 news from this site that you 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.370
 liked that did not like everyone 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.240
 thank you so much for watching everyone bye 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.240
 to new meetings
