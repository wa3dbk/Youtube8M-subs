00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.729 
check how each setting looks if you're
getting<00:03:49.670> crushed<00:03:50.000> details<00:03:50.569> in<00:03:50.810> shadows<00:03:51.379> and

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
getting crushed details in shadows and

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:58.960 
getting crushed details in shadows and
then<00:03:53.049> check<00:03:54.049> Auto<00:03:54.440> or<00:03:55.269> some<00:03:56.269> other<00:03:56.480> option<00:03:57.970> no

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
then check Auto or some other option no

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.089 
then check Auto or some other option no
changes<00:03:59.629> for<00:03:59.900> this<00:04:01.120> I'm<00:04:02.650> going<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.859> auto

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099

Motion<00:04:04.579> Plus<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.430> TV<00:04:07.760> offers<00:04:08.120> different

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
Motion Plus so this TV offers different

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.430 
Motion Plus so this TV offers different
preset<00:04:09.530> standard<00:04:10.040> smooth<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.640> custom

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
preset standard smooth and custom

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.650 
preset standard smooth and custom
basically<00:04:12.440> all<00:04:12.650> in<00:04:12.799> custom<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:13.430> can<00:04:13.660> reduce

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
basically all in custom you can reduce

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.839 
basically all in custom you can reduce
or<00:04:14.989> increase<00:04:15.049> each<00:04:15.889> other<00:04:16.070> reduction

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
or increase each other reduction

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.759 
or increase each other reduction
basically<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.539> other<00:04:17.780> reduction<00:04:18.289> means<00:04:18.440> that

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
basically the other reduction means that

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.339 
basically the other reduction means that
you<00:04:18.889> will<00:04:19.010> get<00:04:19.190> soap<00:04:19.579> opera<00:04:20.239> effect<00:04:20.570> during

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
you will get soap opera effect during

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.779 
you will get soap opera effect during
watching<00:04:21.650> movie<00:04:22.130> content<00:04:23.530> so<00:04:24.530> if<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:25.580> want

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
watching movie content so if you want

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.350 
watching movie content so if you want
smoother<00:04:26.210> picture<00:04:26.810> increase<00:04:27.770> this<00:04:27.919> value<00:04:28.360> but

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
smoother picture increase this value but

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.710 
smoother picture increase this value but
you<00:04:29.960> should<00:04:30.200> know<00:04:30.410> that<00:04:31.090> sometimes<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.539> can

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
you should know that sometimes you can

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.600 
you should know that sometimes you can
get<00:04:32.840> artifacts<00:04:33.530> in<00:04:33.650> picture<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.400> also

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
get artifacts in picture and also

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.300 
get artifacts in picture and also
sometimes<00:04:35.120> picture<00:04:35.870> will<00:04:36.050> be<00:04:36.470> smoother<00:04:36.950> and

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
sometimes picture will be smoother and

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.460 
sometimes picture will be smoother and
sometimes<00:04:37.849> depending<00:04:38.330> on<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:38.510> complexity<00:04:39.320> of

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
sometimes depending on the complexity of

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.810 
sometimes depending on the complexity of
the<00:04:39.530> scene<00:04:39.889> it<00:04:40.160> will<00:04:40.570> return<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.810> 24<00:04:42.380> Hertz

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
the scene it will return to 24 Hertz

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.190 
the scene it will return to 24 Hertz
with<00:04:43.820> choppy<00:04:44.510> movement<00:04:46.120> led<00:04:47.120> clear<00:04:47.690> motion

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
with choppy movement led clear motion

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.480 
with choppy movement led clear motion
the<00:04:48.349> only<00:04:48.530> way<00:04:48.650> to<00:04:48.710> increase<00:04:48.950> motion

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
the only way to increase motion

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.879 
the only way to increase motion
resolution<00:04:49.669> is<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.539> turn<00:04:50.810> on<00:04:50.990> this<00:04:51.169> option<00:04:51.410> but

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
resolution is to turn on this option but

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.390 
resolution is to turn on this option but
then<00:04:52.130> you<00:04:52.460> will<00:04:52.729> get<00:04:52.940> flickering<00:04:53.599> and<00:04:53.810> also

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
then you will get flickering and also

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.310 
then you will get flickering and also
significantly<00:04:55.400> decrease<00:04:56.270> brightness<00:04:56.870> of<00:04:57.139> the

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
significantly decrease brightness of the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.960 
significantly decrease brightness of the
screen<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:58.990> recommend<00:04:59.990> turning<00:05:00.770> this<00:05:01.099> option

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
screen I recommend turning this option

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.870 
screen I recommend turning this option
off<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:02.539> just<00:05:03.380> play<00:05:03.680> with<00:05:03.830> other<00:05:04.130> reduction

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
off and just play with other reduction

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.710 
off and just play with other reduction
and<00:05:05.800> finally<00:05:06.800> analog<00:05:07.460> clean<00:05:07.880> view<00:05:08.120> this<00:05:08.510> is

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
and finally analog clean view this is

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.770 
and finally analog clean view this is
for<00:05:08.960> analog<00:05:09.349> sources<00:05:10.039> where<00:05:10.729> you<00:05:10.760> can<00:05:11.389> produce

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
for analog sources where you can produce

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.060 
for analog sources where you can produce
noise<00:05:12.680> in<00:05:13.070> that<00:05:13.310> types<00:05:13.880> of<00:05:14.090> signal<00:05:14.680> once<00:05:15.680> you

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
noise in that types of signal once you

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.450 
noise in that types of signal once you
do<00:05:18.070> modifications<00:05:19.000> you<00:05:19.600> can<00:05:19.930> copy<00:05:20.650> this

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
do modifications you can copy this

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.170 
do modifications you can copy this
picture<00:05:21.970> mode<00:05:22.650> settings<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.980> all<00:05:24.010> sources<00:05:24.730> or

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
picture mode settings to all sources or

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.570 
picture mode settings to all sources or
keep<00:05:25.780> them<00:05:25.990> at<00:05:26.170> current<00:05:26.920> source<00:05:29.580> basically

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
keep them at current source basically

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.630 
keep them at current source basically
that's<00:05:31.030> it<00:05:31.270> with<00:05:31.750> contrast<00:05:32.230> around<00:05:32.620> 2000<00:05:33.310> to

is pleasant to watch but you should know
that<00:05:43.060> only<00:05:43.420> when<00:05:44.080> watching<00:05:44.860> the<00:05:45.250> screen

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
that only when watching the screen

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.730 
that only when watching the screen
directly<00:05:46.150> in<00:05:46.570> front<00:05:46.840> you<00:05:47.050> will<00:05:47.170> get<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:47.530> best

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
directly in front you will get the best

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.520 
directly in front you will get the best
contrast<00:05:48.310> and<00:05:48.580> colors<00:05:49.350> watching<00:05:50.350> at

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
contrast and colors watching at

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.520 
contrast and colors watching at
different<00:05:51.430> angles<00:05:51.640> will<00:05:52.330> reduce<00:05:52.750> color

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
different angles will reduce color

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.220 
different angles will reduce color
saturation<00:05:54.100> and<00:05:54.520> also<00:05:55.210> contrast<00:05:55.870> will<00:05:56.080> be

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
saturation and also contrast will be

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.290 
saturation and also contrast will be
