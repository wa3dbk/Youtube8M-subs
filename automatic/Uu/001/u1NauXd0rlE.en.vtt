00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 and they lived on the earth that today is 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.950
 Mexico more than 70 million years ago 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.450
 that is known thanks to his bones the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.480
 discovery of dinosaur fossils 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.090
 in Mexico has been an adventure 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.830
 adventure that began a hundred years ago 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.330
 first it's easy is dinosaurs are 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.270
 found by a team of geologists 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.640
 Germans who came to study the 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.260
 state of coahuila and there in a 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.510
 locality in the municipality of sierra la 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.430
 wet earth is where they discover 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.010
 the first remains of dinosaurs and they are 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.989
 brought to Germany to study 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.600
 North America was divided by one not 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.290
 we can say an ocean if we can not 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.530
 say a continental sea a great 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.800
 invasion of the ocean waters of the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.140
 waters of the sea to the continent is so 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.170
 great that really started to 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.710
 North America in two and Mexico as you want 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.660
 that is is god as the coasts of 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.309
 that inland sea that joined with the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.649
 sea ​​of ​​tethys I think dinosaurs 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.380
 they exist in him at the end of the day 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.430
 software that after cultures and ccoo 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.770
 really our country for its 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.899
 conditions is the Cretaceous in 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.960
 interesting there will be a few localities 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:18.970
 basic there is no Triassic that I 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.860
 know and everything else is 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.150
 Mexico is a very rich country in terms 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.910
 of that 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.980
 paleontological heritage there is no 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.170
 state of the republic that does not have 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.310
 fossils though and despite this 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.770
 fossil wealth 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.240
 for decades nobody cared about 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.330
 study the paleontological heritage 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.510
 of the country or for expeditions of 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.610
 Rescue and armed search from 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.020
 the mid 80's is when the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.870
 most prolific period of the study of 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.670
 genetic dynastar that is described in 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.540
 several locations and you start the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.580
 study let's say more in shape by 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.400
 Mexican scientist as he recalls one of 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.530
 the original hikers find 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.630
 dinosaur bones was not the goal 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.840
 initial of Mexican paleontologists 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.990
 in fact when they performed one of the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.860
 first gallant expeditions was a 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.880
 chance the fundamental idea was not 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:20.270
 prospect for dinosaurs but it was 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.900
 try to look for Cretaceous mammals 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.939
 that by the way we do not find them 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.959
 then we find many organisms 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:32.329
 sailors but we started to find 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.090
 true fields full of bones of 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.010
 dinosaur the paleontological richness in 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.110
 Mexico has resulted in the discovery 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.959
 of new species and genera of 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.260
 dinosaurs thanks to the possible that 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.970
 in our territory have been found 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.700
 the first two were identified in the 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.239
 rosario baja california three more in 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.040
 coahuila and the most recent one in michoacán 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.959
 the latter a sick species that 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.670
 she also became the first to be 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.370
 described and named by scientists 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.480
 Mexicans the characteristic that I had 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.000
 as such a scene could walk well 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.359
 another had an injury at the level of the wave 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 practically the muscles were spending 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.889
 atrophy hitting of this structure 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.639
 and also this one could not breathe much 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.620
 there was for 2009 that already you 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.680
 identifies the material as a new 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.960
 dinosaur until 2012 becomes official 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.660
 the name of fiona shaw 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.570
 this dinosaur was laid eggs canout 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.650
 the dissidences first what of the word 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:39.140
 old web refers to 84 million 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.550
 Nahuatl's years one does not know 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.040
 I imagined in terms of pick up and drive 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.800
 which is why he was put on 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.540
 channel egg + and the other term and 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.750
 fitch in joke refers to the town of 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.250
 tiquicheo is practically the exemplary 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.100
 of meeting between the people of 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.990
 and float to a century of 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.440
 first findings the runoff 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.300
 continue but that will stop me 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.960
 Mexican territory for scientists 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.020
 towards the future the answer will be 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.130
 study objects during the next 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.130
 100 years of fossils
