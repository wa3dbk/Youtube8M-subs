00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.720
 on skyrim as you can see 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.039
 so here I am with my barge barge 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.650

 but just a few places not bad 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.300
 we can find stuff so there by 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.530
 example I'm going to show you how 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:50.180
 make the quest for the gold claw from the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:54.030
 start that can be really good 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.530
 here is the quest for the claw 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.780
 Golden 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.670
 already we will go the furthest from the most 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.170
 far from the farthest I will quickly 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.470
 hurry because 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.030
 tafer and videos too long so here 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.170
 where she so from rivoyre here 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.320
 so you see that's the two entered 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.600
 wood shores but from there you 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.479
 so can run all the way and so 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:26.430
 so you go after you have traveled the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:31.020
 way to the ball to you go 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.600
 to find something not bad at all it's a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.929
 little camp says no that I think that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.179
 everyone knows him but I think 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.600
 that there are people who do not take the 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.819
 time to search it so this game I 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.729
 want to show you this really 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.500
 as they say who is really not bad 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.490
 so that's when you continue 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.509

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.030
 little con gangster that after having 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.760

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.210
 following very quickly typing at 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.180
 we will immediately get out 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.620

 hidden somehow so you can 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.400
 simply cut by the river 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:05:01.409
 I take the route here 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:05.110
 base ie the little bridge there 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:08.800
