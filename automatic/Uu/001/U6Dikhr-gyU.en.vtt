force<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:58.350> could<00:01:58.440> be<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.650> case<00:01:58.830> too

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
force that could be the case too

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.770 
force that could be the case too
let's<00:02:01.400> find<00:02:01.579> out<00:02:01.759> if<00:02:01.820> it's<00:02:01.939> a<00:02:02.000> mirror<00:02:02.210> force<00:02:02.509> I

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
let's find out if it's a mirror force I

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.630 
let's find out if it's a mirror force I
know<00:02:03.049> this<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.470> gonna<00:02:03.590> be<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.829> useless<00:02:04.280> tool<00:02:04.399> we

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
know this is gonna be a useless tool we

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.730 
know this is gonna be a useless tool we
both<00:02:04.820> have<00:02:05.000> 1800<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:05.750> it's<00:02:05.990> gonna<00:02:06.200> end<00:02:06.439> up<00:02:06.619> with

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
both have 1800 so it's gonna end up with

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.199 
both have 1800 so it's gonna end up with
nothing<00:02:06.890> but<00:02:07.280> if<00:02:07.399> it's<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:07.610> mirror<00:02:07.820> force<00:02:08.060> it

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
nothing but if it's a mirror force it

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.350 
nothing but if it's a mirror force it
will<00:02:08.330> activate<00:02:09.190> no<00:02:10.190> okay<00:02:10.700> all<00:02:10.729> right<00:02:11.060> well<00:02:11.209> so

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
will activate no okay all right well so

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.790 
will activate no okay all right well so
wasn't<00:02:11.569> that<00:02:11.780> don't<00:02:12.380> know<00:02:12.500> what<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.770> is

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
wasn't that don't know what it is

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.800 
wasn't that don't know what it is
doesn't<00:02:13.220> give<00:02:13.340> me<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.489> good<00:02:13.640> example<00:02:13.970> I'll<00:02:14.450> wait

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
doesn't give me a good example I'll wait

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.600 
doesn't give me a good example I'll wait
for<00:02:15.080> her<00:02:15.200> card<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.010> come<00:02:16.160> down<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.459> can

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
for her card to come down that can

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.610 
for her card to come down that can

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.259 
that one back I guess to summon in her
own<00:02:26.150> monster<00:02:26.540> may<00:02:26.690> be<00:02:27.819> interesting<00:02:28.819> or<00:02:29.060> to

soldier that away in fact I think I

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.520

might<00:02:45.890> just<00:02:46.069> do<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.220> as<00:02:46.700> opposed<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.209> even

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
might just do that as opposed to even

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.410 
might just do that as opposed to even
the<00:02:48.530> change<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.489> heart<00:02:49.730> because<00:02:50.060> right<00:02:50.269> now<00:02:50.390> I

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.170 

okay<00:03:12.680> flip<00:03:12.950> activated<00:03:13.640> let's<00:03:13.849> go<00:03:13.970> ahead<00:03:14.030> and

you<00:03:17.360> didn't<00:03:17.569> activate<00:03:17.900> those<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.319> maja<00:03:18.680> it

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
you didn't activate those to the maja it

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.800 
you didn't activate those to the maja it
would've<00:03:18.980> made<00:03:19.040> more<00:03:19.190> sense<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.519> me<00:03:19.640> but<00:03:20.120> she

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
would've made more sense to me but she

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.399 
would've made more sense to me but she
wasn't<00:03:21.019> feeling<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.920> guess<00:03:22.780> all<00:03:23.780> right<00:03:24.049> so

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
wasn't feeling that I guess all right so

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:25.960 
wasn't feeling that I guess all right so
let's<00:03:24.590> go<00:03:24.709> ahead<00:03:24.799> and<00:03:24.980> get<00:03:25.099> into<00:03:25.250> action<00:03:25.760> here

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
let's go ahead and get into action here

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.550 
let's go ahead and get into action here
we<00:03:26.090> will<00:03:26.209> be<00:03:26.299> doing<00:03:26.420> summoned<00:03:26.840> skull<00:03:27.110> remember

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
we will be doing summoned skull remember

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.559 
we will be doing summoned skull remember
well<00:03:27.950> no<00:03:28.129> actually<00:03:28.250> we<00:03:28.459> won't<00:03:28.670> be<00:03:28.819> because

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
well no actually we won't be because

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:30.520

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
let's just do it this way either way it

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.430 
let's just do it this way either way it
works<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.629> could<00:03:32.810> change<00:03:32.959> your<00:03:33.049> heart<00:03:33.319> but

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
this section will be a better plan I

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.050 
this section will be a better plan I
think<00:03:36.010> we<00:03:37.010> were<00:03:37.129> search<00:03:37.370> our<00:03:37.519> monster<00:03:37.790> yes<00:03:37.909> I
