with<00:00:25.910> now<00:00:26.910> there's<00:00:27.150> two<00:00:27.390> ways<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.869> can

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
with now there's two ways that you can

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.679 
with now there's two ways that you can
mark<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> pins<00:00:28.680> here<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.160> prefer<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.480> take<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
mark the pins here I prefer to take a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.610 
mark the pins here I prefer to take a
piece<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:30.990> tape<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:32.270> Mark<00:00:33.380> right<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.500> the

piece of tape and Mark right in the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.700 
piece of tape and Mark right in the
black<00:00:35.660> directly<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> connector<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.590> when

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
black directly on the connector so when

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
black directly on the connector so when
I'm<00:00:37.800> putting<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.190> back<00:00:38.309> together<00:00:38.520> there's<00:00:39.300> no

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
I'm putting it back together there's no

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.850 
I'm putting it back together there's no
mistaking<00:00:39.989> myself

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
mistaking myself

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.700 
mistaking myself

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
orientation along with the direction of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
orientation along with the direction of
the<00:00:49.800> plug<00:00:50.129> itself<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:51.030> not<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:51.360> yourself

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the plug itself to not get yourself

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.939 
the plug itself to not get yourself
mixed<00:00:51.899> up<00:00:52.199> while<00:00:52.410> you're<00:00:52.530> putting<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.829> back

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.639 

and<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:56.519> is<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:56.969> removing<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.930> pincer<00:00:58.410> now

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and this is for removing this pincer now

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.680 
and this is for removing this pincer now
when<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> use<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.519> what<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.059> need<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.480> is

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.880 
to do is just take your finger under
here<00:01:05.180> pop<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> door<00:01:06.509> open<00:01:06.900> comes<00:01:07.350> open<00:01:07.619> quite

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
here pop the door open comes open quite

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.260 
here pop the door open comes open quite
easy<00:01:08.070> make<00:01:08.400> sure<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> don't<00:01:08.850> try<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
easy make sure you don't try it the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.340 
easy make sure you don't try it the
other<00:01:09.299> way<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:09.750> you'll<00:01:09.869> break<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
other way or you'll break it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.030 
other way or you'll break it
and<00:01:10.500> your<00:01:11.430> pins<00:01:11.670> are<00:01:11.880> right<00:01:12.030> inside<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> here

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
and your pins are right inside of here

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.070 
and your pins are right inside of here
now<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.490> quite<00:01:14.970> deceiving<00:01:15.570> because

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
now this can be quite deceiving because

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.630 
now this can be quite deceiving because
when<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.350> look<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> almost<00:01:17.159> looks<00:01:17.549> like

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
when you look at it it almost looks like

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.100 
when you look at it it almost looks like
you're<00:01:17.820> has<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.000> take<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.390> four<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.690> these<00:01:18.840> out

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you're has to take all four of these out

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.370 
you're has to take all four of these out
but<00:01:19.590> since<00:01:20.460> there's<00:01:20.640> only<00:01:20.700> two<00:01:21.000> wires<00:01:21.380> once

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
but since there's only two wires once

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.200 
but since there's only two wires once
you<00:01:22.530> open<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> door<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.700> only<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
you open the door you only have to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.560 
you open the door you only have to
remove<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.630> two<00:01:24.840> pins<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.670> side<00:01:26.940> it's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
remove the two pins on the one side it's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.969 
remove the two pins on the one side it's
basically<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.320> we're<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.800> that

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
basically here we're going to do that

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.249 
basically here we're going to do that
real<00:01:29.159> quick<00:01:29.399> now<00:01:30.360> when<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.600> look<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.929> here

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
real quick now when you look in here

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.550 
real quick now when you look in here
there's<00:01:32.009> two<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.490> flared<00:01:33.380> clips<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
there's two little flared clips that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.980 
there's two little flared clips that
stick<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.130> where<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> pin<00:01:35.550> is<00:01:35.869> what<00:01:36.869> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
stick out of where the pin is what you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.290 
stick out of where the pin is what you
want<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.679> take<00:01:38.429> your<00:01:38.580> tool<00:01:38.819> you<00:01:39.149> can

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
want to do is take your tool you can

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.270 
want to do is take your tool you can
either<00:01:39.450> use<00:01:39.690> a<00:01:39.720> power<00:01:40.319> supply<00:01:40.500> modding<00:01:41.069> tool

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
either use a power supply modding tool

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.139 
either use a power supply modding tool
like<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.700> one<00:01:41.970> from<00:01:42.720> Sunbeam<00:01:43.229> tech<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:44.149> you

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
like this one from Sunbeam tech or you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.529 
like this one from Sunbeam tech or you
can<00:01:45.330> use<00:01:45.539> a<00:01:45.569> staple<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.800> strong<00:01:47.310> pin<00:01:48.240> that

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
can use a staple or a strong pin that

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.809 
can use a staple or a strong pin that
works<00:01:48.750> too<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.979> what<00:01:50.069> you<00:01:50.190> want<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.729> you

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
works too so what you want to do is you

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.520 
works too so what you want to do is you
want<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> find<00:01:51.240> your<00:01:52.159> little<00:01:53.159> tabs<00:01:53.549> here<00:01:53.970> and

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
want to find your little tabs here and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.539 
want to find your little tabs here and
then<00:01:55.530> bend<00:01:55.860> them<00:01:56.009> in

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
then bend them in

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.609 
then bend them in
sometimes<00:01:58.420> this<00:01:58.600> can<00:01:58.810> take<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.020> few<00:01:59.289> tries<00:01:59.560> to

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
sometimes this can take a few tries to

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.640 
sometimes this can take a few tries to
get<00:01:59.950> it

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.880 

on<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.280> side

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
and then they pop right out simple as

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.980 
and then they pop right out simple as
that

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.410
