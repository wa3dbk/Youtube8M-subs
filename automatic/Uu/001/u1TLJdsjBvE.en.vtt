00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
huge achievement that I think I took a

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.720 
huge achievement that I think I took a
big<00:00:48.230> deep<00:00:48.530> breath<00:00:48.559> McVie<00:00:49.129> at<00:00:49.400> the<00:00:49.519> end<00:00:49.670> of

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
big deep breath McVie at the end of

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.819 
big deep breath McVie at the end of
those<00:00:49.850> I'd<00:00:50.329> take<00:00:50.570> that<00:00:50.750> goal<00:00:50.989> off<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.350> Western

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270

myself I think that's been a strong
point<00:01:35.110> in<00:01:35.289> the<00:01:35.350> past<00:01:35.560> but<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.159> think<00:01:36.369> over

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
point in the past but I think over

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.080 
point in the past but I think over

turned it around now and and made my
strong<00:01:40.420> points<00:01:40.810> not<00:01:41.020> just<00:01:41.079> my<00:01:41.409> time<00:01:41.649> trial<00:01:42.009> and
