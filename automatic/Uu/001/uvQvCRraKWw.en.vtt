00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.610
 Christian Bley with the 3 to 1 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.430
 although the players came from the innstadt 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.130

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.719
 clear between the vfb and fortuna 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:39.969
 that shows start there as a whole 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.889
 Vogtland championship fights for the first time 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.110
 team from plauen put the circle master 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.539
 will play the yellow kicker of the 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.280
 vfc got into the game better and left 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.969
 through this violence shot toni sale 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.650
 in leadership 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:55.139
 the rejoicing had not quite faded away 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.139
 oliver ketzel increased to the 20 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:00.250
 one-third of the 15-minute game time 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:02.620
 was over as the fortuna annex that 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.930
 ricardo klaus was allowed to cheer for the first time 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.219
 with the connection hit 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.949
 both teams were on the same 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:10.900
 level and came to your chances and 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.879
 even the bad luck was divided fairly 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.150
 so there would be a few times the aluminum 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:18.129
 on both sides the vfb-kicker found 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.810
 First, the way back as the torflaute 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.680
 and increased shortly before the end 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.180
 bruni freimann bet on 3 to 1 fortuna 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.009
 now everything on a map 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.229
 it was still possible to get through ricardo klaus 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:43.930
 subsequent goal after that was over 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:45.849
 da vfb hit fortuna just under 3 2 the 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.949
 second team of the vfc plauen so 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:49.509
 got the whole for the first time 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.150
 Vogtland championship title 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:54.190
 but that's not enough with Patrick 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.289
