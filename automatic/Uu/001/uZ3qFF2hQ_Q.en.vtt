00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.460
 6 and we who do not want to see 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.849
 it does not make any breizh 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.769
 present for the rib of beef it's dead 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.599
 if I do not put charcoal for 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.539
 for the chipotere it's enough 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.250
 you see for the fifth gadgets on the 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.129
 grid and then that's easy to 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:39.260
 gruissan for the good more and more 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.300
 I love it has a particular taste 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.890
 so here we let a little 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.190
 Besides, I'm going to burn 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.190
 wire rack 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.410
 Alas 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:08.410
 My secret is what is it? 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:11.020
 little senses it hums that trick 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.600
 is to see if the embers are well 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:21.970
 red 6-1 gross who got their hands on it's 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:23.880
 the case so why do I put them in 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.479
 this meaning end because because otherwise 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.340
 when that when his thigh has shrunk 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.080
 diameter is reduced and if I put them 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.550
 in the other direction 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.640
 either we fall early apple bread apple 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.240
 quite as before I was taking 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.600
 little wood 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.390
 you have not much choice this paper calculation 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.720
 newspaper is directly coal from 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.800
 me it's complicated we get you wood 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.509
 do you take fear there are sure 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.009
 adds coal as a bouake band 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.570
 time you start you start every 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.920
 lights you're not starting the fact that the 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.630
 charcoal since room in brief 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:09.940
 opposite on something that is already hot 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:11.890
 after him he does the rest of the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.840
 secrets of the barbecue is the presence 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.340
 that is, you can discuss the case 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.950
 like cooking power 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.030
 you have to be past when 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.390
 it burns ok it's water it's us 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.430
 quite simply 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.250
 so there are some who make elders the 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.379
 glass must be well known 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.930
 through far it's through pork 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.629
 it is very serious so there is very fat said 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:44.780
 it burns right away in the pen 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:45.980
 roses the embers directly greets so 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.019
 still so in any case complaints you 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.700
 asparagus a little water quickly made of 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.900
 the heat but not to complain is that 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.280
 because we are proclaiming the problem it is 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.310
 that some black right away like 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.230
 basically done there would partially 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:08.000
 open line up 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:12.290
 ok so where does a permanent presence that 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.780
 Roman and firemen in time so here 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.230
 we judge that it is cooked when the color 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.590
 yeah well yeah but it's going fast by the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:31.959
 worry if we smoke a force before 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:36.190
 even these words eat them no but there 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.190
 you see we bring her back 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.660
 and so the coast of the sea the specificity 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.890
 suddenly for the beef ribs seized ah 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.500
 yes it takes ten minutes on each side 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.500
 had anyway but I put on going 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.490
 you do not have to burn it because if 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.540
 you want to cook it 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.180
 if he cooked too fast the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.300
 edge charcoal board for them 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.550
 be tender 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.140
 cook long so for fashion 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.800
 and laughed she was raising the tray 20 days 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.800
 reasonable yes 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.640
 you know what it feels good 20 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.150
 minutes this is it yeah it's 10 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.310
 minutes on each side is normally 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.840
 but the time is not too thick blow 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.450
 be them here anyway ah yes yes 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.540
 sadaoui not stop if they can be 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.540
 good 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.379
 making the knife look better
