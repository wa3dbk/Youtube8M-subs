science<00:04:56.099> and<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:57.090> I<00:04:57.150> wanted<00:04:57.509> to<00:04:57.569> share<00:04:58.169> that<00:04:58.229> I

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
science and so I wanted to share that I

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.680 
science and so I wanted to share that I
think<00:04:58.710> especially<00:04:58.830> with<00:04:59.280> biology<00:04:59.819> there's<00:05:00.240> so

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
think especially with biology there's so

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.240 
think especially with biology there's so
much<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:01.110> know<00:05:01.229> about<00:05:01.259> the<00:05:01.620> world<00:05:01.770> around<00:05:01.919> you

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
much to know about the world around you

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.689 
much to know about the world around you
and<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:02.849> enjoy<00:05:02.970> it<00:05:03.180> more<00:05:03.629> if<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:04.080> understand

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
and you enjoy it more if you understand

and you enjoy it more if you understand
I've<00:05:05.699> had<00:05:05.970> students<00:05:06.479> that<00:05:06.629> have<00:05:06.780> come<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.379> tell

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
I've had students that have come to tell

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.459 
I've had students that have come to tell
me<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:08.550> actually<00:05:08.789> understand<00:05:09.599> science<00:05:10.139> that's

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:10.469 
me I actually understand science that's

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.129 
me I actually understand science that's
been<00:05:10.680> really<00:05:10.860> rewarding<00:05:11.129> for<00:05:11.909> me<00:05:11.969> or<00:05:12.330> I<00:05:12.690> didn't

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
been really rewarding for me or I didn't

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.959 
been really rewarding for me or I didn't
I<00:05:13.289> didn't<00:05:13.590> like<00:05:13.710> science<00:05:14.069> it<00:05:14.190> was<00:05:14.280> too<00:05:14.490> hard<00:05:14.699> or

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:14.969 
I didn't like science it was too hard or

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:16.129 
I didn't like science it was too hard or
something<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.479> made<00:05:15.629> it<00:05:15.780> so<00:05:15.900> that<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:16.050> could

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
something you made it so that I could

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.119 
something you made it so that I could
understand<00:05:16.800> it<00:05:16.979> I<00:05:18.379> think<00:05:19.379> the<00:05:19.469> most<00:05:19.650> helpful

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
understand it I think the most helpful

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.360 
understand it I think the most helpful
thing<00:05:20.550> for<00:05:20.819> teachers<00:05:21.719> is<00:05:22.050> having<00:05:22.680> parents

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
thing for teachers is having parents

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.899 
thing for teachers is having parents
that<00:05:23.490> are<00:05:23.639> involved<00:05:24.419> and<00:05:24.930> they<00:05:25.740> really<00:05:26.370> are

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
that are involved and they really are

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.580 
that are involved and they really are
interested<00:05:27.180> in<00:05:27.599> what<00:05:27.750> their<00:05:27.930> students<00:05:28.440> are

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
interested in what their students are

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:44.620 
interested in what their students are
