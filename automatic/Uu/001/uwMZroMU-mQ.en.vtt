00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
with a mirrored caverns review this is a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.180 
with a mirrored caverns review this is a
map<00:00:13.799> from<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.309> map<00:00:14.460> pack<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.360> just

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
map from the map pack and this is just

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.689 
map from the map pack and this is just
incredible<00:00:18.050> downloads<00:00:19.050> below<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.920> it's

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
incredible downloads below so it's

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.240 
incredible downloads below so it's
really<00:00:20.910> hard<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.240> show<00:00:21.420> guys<00:00:21.630> with<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.890> with

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
really hard to show guys with this with

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.040 
really hard to show guys with this with
the<00:00:23.789> shorter<00:00:24.240> render<00:00:24.539> distance<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the shorter render distance that

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.769 
the shorter render distance that
partition<00:00:25.560> provides<00:00:25.859> but<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.880> awesome

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
partition provides but this is awesome

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.320 
partition provides but this is awesome

floating island in the middle of a huge
cavern<00:00:38.489> over<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.420> massive<00:00:40.460> abyss<00:00:41.460> of

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
cavern over just a massive abyss of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.940 
cavern over just a massive abyss of
water<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.480> really<00:00:42.780> really<00:00:43.110> cool<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
water so it's really really cool and the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.799 
water so it's really really cool and the
island<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.550> looks<00:00:44.879> sweet<00:00:45.210> unfortunately

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
island just looks sweet unfortunately

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.420 
island just looks sweet unfortunately
there's<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> bad<00:00:46.469> letting<00:00:46.860> air<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
there's a bad letting air there and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.220 
there's a bad letting air there and
didn't<00:00:47.640> realize<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.750> switch

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
didn't realize that so we will switch

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.170 
didn't realize that so we will switch
over<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> side<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.700> see<00:00:50.910> it's

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
over to the side as you can see it's

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.389 
over to the side as you can see it's
just<00:00:51.420> epic<00:00:51.989> there's<00:00:52.379> close<00:00:52.649> soon<00:00:52.890> everywhere

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
just epic there's close soon everywhere

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.850 
just epic there's close soon everywhere
so<00:00:53.640> glowstone<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.390> hard<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.690> come<00:00:54.930> by<00:00:55.140> but

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
so glowstone is not hard to come by but

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.830 
so glowstone is not hard to come by but
trees<00:00:56.190> are<00:00:56.520> these<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> only<00:00:57.180> trees<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
trees are these are the only trees and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.510 
trees are these are the only trees and
the<00:00:57.899> only<00:00:58.050> grass<00:00:58.379> you're<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:58.980> so

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the only grass you're going to get so

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.529 
the only grass you're going to get so
use<00:00:59.850> them<00:01:00.059> wisely<00:01:01.730> there<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.879> dirt<00:01:03.149> over<00:01:03.390> here

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
use them wisely there is dirt over here

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.420 
use them wisely there is dirt over here
now<00:01:03.809> maybe<00:01:04.019> there's<00:01:04.229> not<00:01:04.379> actually<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.920> didn't

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
now maybe there's not actually I didn't

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.800 
now maybe there's not actually I didn't
realize<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.060> didn't<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.780> check

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
realize that I didn't think to check

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.320 
realize that I didn't think to check
that<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.470> these<00:01:08.010> caverns<00:01:08.610> are<00:01:08.700> awesome<00:01:09.150> on

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that but these caverns are awesome on

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.780 
that but these caverns are awesome on
the<00:01:09.930> glowstone<00:01:10.380> starts<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.950> disappear<00:01:11.549> though

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the glowstone starts to disappear though

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.120 
the glowstone starts to disappear though
the<00:01:12.479> farther<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.930> go<00:01:13.320> away<00:01:13.740> um<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.130> less

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the farther you go away um the the less

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.190 
the farther you go away um the the less
glowstone<00:01:17.640> appears<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.750> thing<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.020> you

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
glowstone appears one thing that you

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.260 
glowstone appears one thing that you
guys<00:01:19.500> may<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.250> about<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> think

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
guys may not like about this but I think

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.929 
guys may not like about this but I think
is<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> best<00:01:22.229> thing<00:01:22.500> they<00:01:22.590> did<00:01:22.830> was<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.580> wall

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
is the best thing they did was this wall

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.330 
is the best thing they did was this wall
here<00:01:24.270> instead<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.170> leaving<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.619> open<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
here instead of leaving it open so you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.080 
here instead of leaving it open so you
could<00:01:26.520> see<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.970> sky<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:28.790> like<00:01:29.790> say

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
could see the sky like this like say

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.780 
could see the sky like this like say
that's<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.750> end<00:01:31.009> you'd<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.159> able<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.400> see<00:01:32.460> this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
that's the end you'd be able to see this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.460 
that's the end you'd be able to see this
guy<00:01:32.850> unfortunately<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.720> render<00:01:33.990> distance<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
guy unfortunately the render distance is

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.770 
guy unfortunately the render distance is
causing<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> map<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.299> instead<00:01:36.630> of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
causing that not the map but instead of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.719 
causing that not the map but instead of
just<00:01:37.020> seeing<00:01:37.259> open<00:01:37.799> blue<00:01:38.040> sky<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.369> light

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
just seeing open blue sky and light

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.370 
just seeing open blue sky and light
coming<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:39.450> blocked<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.960> off<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
coming in here they blocked it off so

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
coming in here they blocked it off so
it's<00:01:40.530> more<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.979> caved<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.759> think<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it's more like a caved so I think that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.090 
it's more like a caved so I think that
was<00:01:42.689> great<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.229> they<00:01:43.350> didn't<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:43.799> took<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
was great that they didn't they took the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.450 
was great that they didn't they took the
extra<00:01:44.460> time<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.689> very<00:01:45.960> very<00:01:46.890> very

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
extra time to do that so very very very

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.179 
extra time to do that so very very very
very<00:01:47.670> good<00:01:48.140> decision<00:01:49.140> by<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.350> mapmaker<00:01:49.770> props

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
very good decision by the mapmaker props

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.010 
very good decision by the mapmaker props
to<00:01:50.369> him<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.670> doing<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.780> see

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
to him for doing that but as you can see

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.840 
to him for doing that but as you can see
this<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.530> awesome<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.549> one<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.729> the

let's<00:04:00.090> just<00:04:00.239> go<00:04:00.390> under<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.720> map<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:00.989> don't<00:04:01.140> know

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
let's just go under the map I don't know

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.190 
let's just go under the map I don't know
why<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.380> didn't<00:04:01.650> do<00:04:01.739> this<00:04:01.769> before<00:04:02.519> but<00:04:03.060> oh<00:04:03.300> I

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
why I didn't do this before but oh I

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.590 
why I didn't do this before but oh I
guess<00:04:04.830> we<00:04:05.160> were<00:04:05.280> close<00:04:05.459> enough<00:04:05.489> anyway<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.540> as

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
guess we were close enough anyway so as

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.750 
guess we were close enough anyway so as
you<00:04:06.660> can<00:04:06.810> see<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.530> caverns<00:04:08.040> in<00:04:08.190> here<00:04:08.549> are

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
you can see the caverns in here are

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.610 
you can see the caverns in here are
ridiculous<00:04:09.480> there<00:04:09.959> are<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.080> lot<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.290> air

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
ridiculous there are a lot of air

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.460 
ridiculous there are a lot of air
pockets<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.430> seems<00:04:11.730> but<00:04:12.030> this<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:12.959> common<00:04:13.380> with

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
pockets it seems but this is common with

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.050 
pockets it seems but this is common with
a<00:04:13.530> lot<00:04:13.739> of<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.920> map<00:04:14.100> so<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.340> don't<00:04:14.610> think<00:04:14.820> it<00:04:14.940> was

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
a lot of the map so I don't think it was

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.759 
a lot of the map so I don't think it was
on<00:04:15.209> accident<00:04:15.390> I<00:04:15.720> think<00:04:15.989> they<00:04:16.200> had<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.350> reason<00:04:16.739> to

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
on accident I think they had a reason to

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.270 
on accident I think they had a reason to
maybe<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.700> was<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.940> take<00:04:18.120> out<00:04:18.359> redstone<00:04:19.280> but

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
maybe it was to take out redstone but

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.830 
maybe it was to take out redstone but
there<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.489> still<00:04:20.789> a<00:04:20.910> lot<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.180> red<00:04:21.390> zone<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:21.810> I

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
there is still a lot of red zone so I

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.320 
there is still a lot of red zone so I
don't<00:04:22.020> know<00:04:22.109> why<00:04:22.289> but<00:04:22.530> awesome

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
don't know why but awesome

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.999 
don't know why but awesome
again<00:04:24.569> it's<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.750> very<00:04:25.020> very<00:04:25.199> cool<00:04:25.439> map<00:04:25.680> look<00:04:25.919> at

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009
