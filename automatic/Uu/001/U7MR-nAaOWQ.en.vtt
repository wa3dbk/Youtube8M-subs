00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.629
 and then I'm giving continuity to 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.730
 our last lesson that is of the text being 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:17.180
 A father in this people will learn a 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.350
 little about the animations and right filter 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.290
 is that in animations if we apply in 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.230
 apply we have several options for example 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.980
 that o 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.710
 Click here to login. 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.230
 we have the drop here and it has some effects 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.720
 that we can insert this insert 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:43.210
 we already see it in our text 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.699
 but I see it is as it adds the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.809
 donation size effect you place 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:52.900
 here you put the you place smaller 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.050
 here the faster she will see the 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.050
 example 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.109
 sure, the faster she will be 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.109
 let's select here 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.089
 right 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:15.380
 slim bland I see that not only have drop in 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:19.940
 faith fly move pet only has several options 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.190
 o you already see a pre mini view 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:29.000
 of the effect that will be in your text 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:33.220
 It's okay to have vegf and have a zum you 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.940
 puts an entry full of the zoom 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:41.170
 input use where output right I'll give 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.170
 a play here for you 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.750
 There's no way, you gotta do this. 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.630
 configuration 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:57.650
 Let's select the text that we're going to see 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:02:00.740
 if you can work and filter what would be 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.729
 we will not type it if he so 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.860
 option 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:17.840
 we have to add an effect of 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:21.910
 drug even if we already have a 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.920
 animation proof and replace 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.170
 So he hits him, he's going to 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.900
 part 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.150
 attributes the filter right to people 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.730
 down down here 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:41.690
 we have a way of adding a filter 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:44.540
 black one sure pulls and icÃ³ 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.660
 see the effect he made right then 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.489
 That's the way he plays you. 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.220
 for the part of filton sounds op a tab 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:59.600
 especially patah effects is perfect 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.030
 text has several options where 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.920
 Phil Pulls Safe 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:09.560
 you already have an effect the right 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.739
 So this class was like this in the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.930
 next classes we will maybe 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.989
 to deepen these tools 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.560
 I hope you next class and to 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.560
 square
