00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
I think there are always things we learn

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.700 
I think there are always things we learn
the<00:02:10.670> process<00:02:10.880> we<00:02:11.330> learn<00:02:11.540> what<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.470> lights

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
the process we learn what the lights

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.870 
the process we learn what the lights
going<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.040> do<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.340> then<00:02:13.460> there<00:02:13.580> will<00:02:13.640> be<00:02:13.760> an

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
going to do and then there will be an

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.490 
going to do and then there will be an
added<00:02:14.090> dimension<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.840> learning<00:02:15.230> with<00:02:15.350> them

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
added dimension of learning with them

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.150 
added dimension of learning with them
fog<00:02:15.920> does<00:02:16.490> we<00:02:17.390> try<00:02:17.690> as<00:02:18.020> best<00:02:18.050> as<00:02:18.440> we<00:02:18.470> can<00:02:18.830> to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
fog does we try as best as we can to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.270 
fog does we try as best as we can to
understand<00:02:19.730> what<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.780> sculpture<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.980> going

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
understand what the sculpture is going

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.390 
understand what the sculpture is going
to<00:02:22.340> look<00:02:22.520> like<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.330> studio<00:02:23.720> but<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:24.400> very

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
to look like in the studio but it's very

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.270 
to look like in the studio but it's very
difficult<00:02:25.960> we've<00:02:26.960> probably<00:02:27.200> built<00:02:27.470> 40<00:02:27.890> models

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
difficult we've probably built 40 models

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.060 
difficult we've probably built 40 models
of<00:02:28.520> this<00:02:28.730> at<00:02:29.090> varying<00:02:29.780> scales<00:02:30.230> full<00:02:30.710> scale

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
of this at varying scales full scale

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.070 
of this at varying scales full scale
studying<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.880> perfect<00:02:32.270> pattern<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.990> the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
studying the perfect pattern and the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.680 
studying the perfect pattern and the
fold<00:02:33.380> too<00:02:34.310> like<00:02:34.730> looking<00:02:35.030> at<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.240> whole<00:02:35.390> Plaza

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
fold too like looking at the whole Plaza

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.950 
fold too like looking at the whole Plaza
and<00:02:36.260> just<00:02:37.220> understanding<00:02:37.630> what<00:02:38.630> this<00:02:38.810> is

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
and just understanding what this is

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.510 
and just understanding what this is
actually<00:02:39.350> going<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.590> be<00:02:39.740> at<00:02:39.830> full<00:02:40.040> scale<00:02:40.190> and

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
actually going to be at full scale and

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.570 
actually going to be at full scale and
then<00:02:40.640> today<00:02:40.850> we<00:02:41.210> have<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.660> chance<00:02:41.960> to<00:02:42.170> really

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
then today we have a chance to really

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.340 
then today we have a chance to really
refine<00:02:43.580> certain<00:02:44.450> things<00:02:44.690> like<00:02:44.900> its<00:02:45.050> look<00:02:45.140> too

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
refine certain things like its look too

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.950 
refine certain things like its look too
clunky<00:02:45.710> we<00:02:46.100> can<00:02:46.340> shape<00:02:47.090> things<00:02:47.120> off<00:02:47.690> we've

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
clunky we can shape things off we've

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.740 
clunky we can shape things off we've
never<00:02:48.230> seen<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.650> before<00:02:48.740> we've<00:02:49.370> never

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
never seen it before we've never

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.210 
never seen it before we've never
experienced<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.290> it's<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.590> process

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
experienced this and so it's a process

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.010 
experienced this and so it's a process
of<00:02:52.400> just<00:02:52.640> trying<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:52.970> understand<00:02:54.610> as<00:02:55.780> close<00:02:56.780> as

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
of just trying to understand as close as

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.470 
of just trying to understand as close as
we<00:02:57.170> can<00:02:57.320> get<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.740> the<00:02:57.830> actual<00:02:58.190> thing

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
we can get to the actual thing

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.450 
we can get to the actual thing
essentially<00:02:59.480> what<00:03:00.260> we<00:03:00.470> do<00:03:00.740> as<00:03:01.040> part<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.370> the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
essentially what we do as part of the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.910 
essentially what we do as part of the
process<00:03:01.670> also<00:03:02.060> because<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.840> lot<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.710> work

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
process also because a lot of the work

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.830 
process also because a lot of the work
is<00:03:04.130> really<00:03:04.400> can't<00:03:05.000> say<00:03:05.150> okay<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.570> looks<00:03:05.600> just

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
is really can't say okay it looks just

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.740 
is really can't say okay it looks just
like<00:03:06.050> this<00:03:06.440> oh<00:03:06.620> it's<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:07.040> rectangle<00:03:07.730> oh<00:03:07.910> that

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
like this oh it's a rectangle oh that

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.660 
like this oh it's a rectangle oh that
the<00:03:09.020> clients<00:03:09.560> can<00:03:09.740> come<00:03:09.950> here<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.310> see

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
the clients can come here and see

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.760 
the clients can come here and see
actually<00:03:11.270> what<00:03:11.300> this<00:03:11.570> looks<00:03:11.780> like<00:03:11.870> before<00:03:12.620> it

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
actually what this looks like before it

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.260 
actually what this looks like before it
comes<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.250> site<00:03:13.489> because<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.910> can<00:03:14.090> often

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
comes to the site because it can often

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.390 
comes to the site because it can often
be<00:03:14.480> a<00:03:14.510> shock<00:03:14.870> they<00:03:15.350> see<00:03:15.590> this<00:03:15.739> giant

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
be a shock they see this giant

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.070 
be a shock they see this giant
monstrosity<00:03:16.520> coming<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.630> site<00:03:17.840> and

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
monstrosity coming to the site and

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.990 
monstrosity coming to the site and
they've<00:03:18.230> never<00:03:18.470> seen<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:18.890> before<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:19.459> it's<00:03:19.940> a

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
they've never seen it before so it's a

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.870 
they've never seen it before so it's a
great<00:03:20.180> way<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.540> incorporating<00:03:21.430> them<00:03:22.430> into<00:03:22.459> the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
great way of incorporating them into the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.910 
great way of incorporating them into the
process<00:03:23.360> it's<00:03:23.600> called<00:03:23.840> exhale<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.709> it's<00:03:24.770> a

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
process it's called exhale and it's a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.610 
process it's called exhale and it's a
project<00:03:25.760> that<00:03:25.790> collects<00:03:26.390> rainwater<00:03:27.200> runoff

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
project that collects rainwater runoff

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.250 
project that collects rainwater runoff
and<00:03:28.340> essentially<00:03:29.150> exhales<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:29.900> out<00:03:30.020> of<00:03:30.170> the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
and essentially exhales it out of the

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.680 
and essentially exhales it out of the
ground<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.459> perf<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.180> lighting

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
ground and so the perf and the lighting

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.380 
ground and so the perf and the lighting
is<00:03:32.959> all<00:03:33.800> about<00:03:34.130> this<00:03:34.280> choreography<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.150> an

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
is all about this choreography of an

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.330 
is all about this choreography of an
experience<00:03:36.020> of<00:03:36.260> something<00:03:36.920> that's<00:03:37.070> about

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
experience of something that's about

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.890 
experience of something that's about
sustainability

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
sustainability

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.430 
sustainability
taking<00:03:40.900> water<00:03:41.200> from<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:42.040> site<00:03:42.280> it's<00:03:42.580> taking<00:03:43.180> a

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
taking water from the site it's taking a

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.620 
taking water from the site it's taking a
problem<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.650> they<00:03:44.770> have<00:03:44.980> most<00:03:45.700> sites<00:03:46.000> have<00:03:46.600> a

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
problem that they have most sites have a

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.450 
problem that they have most sites have a
kind<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:46.960> limit<00:03:47.320> of<00:03:47.440> how<00:03:47.560> much<00:03:47.680> runoff<00:03:48.040> they

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
kind of limit of how much runoff they

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.180 
kind of limit of how much runoff they
can<00:03:48.730> allow<00:03:49.570> off<00:03:49.930> their<00:03:50.320> site<00:03:50.530> especially<00:03:50.800> when

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
can allow off their site especially when

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.130 
can allow off their site especially when
they<00:03:51.340> do<00:03:51.400> new<00:03:51.700> development<00:03:52.360> so<00:03:52.930> we're

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
they do new development so we're

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.890 
they do new development so we're
retaining<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.800> runoff<00:03:54.510> storing<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:55.630> under

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
retaining that runoff storing it under

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.130 
retaining that runoff storing it under
some<00:03:56.140> underground<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.610> then<00:03:58.209> exhaling<00:03:58.870> it

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
some underground and then exhaling it

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.380 
some underground and then exhaling it
when<00:03:59.290> we<00:03:59.410> have<00:03:59.620> it<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.100> so<00:04:00.280> it's<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.850> becomes<00:04:01.270> a

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
when we have it and so it's it becomes a

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.630 
when we have it and so it's it becomes a
kind<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:01.930> amenity<00:04:02.380> for<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.950> for<00:04:03.610> the

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
kind of amenity for the for the

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.930 
kind of amenity for the for the
community<00:04:04.180> it's<00:04:04.690> not<00:04:04.990> something<00:04:05.590> that

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
community it's not something that

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.870 
community it's not something that
utilizes<00:04:06.940> water<00:04:07.240> and<00:04:07.690> wasteful<00:04:08.680> fashion<00:04:09.250> so

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
utilizes water and wasteful fashion so

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.510 
utilizes water and wasteful fashion so
it's<00:04:10.180> kind<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.750> win-win<00:04:11.020> for<00:04:11.590> everybody<00:04:11.920> and

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
it's kind of win-win for everybody and

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.490 
it's kind of win-win for everybody and
then<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.330> lights<00:04:13.630> have<00:04:14.140> a<00:04:14.170> kind<00:04:14.440> of

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
then the lights have a kind of

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.250 
then the lights have a kind of
choreography<00:04:15.280> of<00:04:15.310> on<00:04:15.610> and<00:04:15.850> off<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.359> so<00:04:16.510> we

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
choreography of on and off and so we

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.770 
choreography of on and off and so we
design<00:04:17.650> that<00:04:17.890> as<00:04:18.040> well<00:04:18.250> light<00:04:18.820> scoring<00:04:19.540> and

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
design that as well light scoring and

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.990 
design that as well light scoring and
it's<00:04:20.140> very<00:04:20.320> much<00:04:20.470> like<00:04:20.530> scoring<00:04:21.160> music<00:04:21.730> we

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
it's very much like scoring music we

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.820 
it's very much like scoring music we
score<00:04:22.360> each<00:04:22.540> of<00:04:22.720> these<00:04:22.840> individual<00:04:23.350> LEDs<00:04:23.500> and

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
score each of these individual LEDs and

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.670 
score each of these individual LEDs and
the<00:04:24.669> technologies<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.300> LEDs<00:04:25.810> have<00:04:26.020> become<00:04:26.320> so

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
the technologies of LEDs have become so

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.520 
the technologies of LEDs have become so
powerful<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:27.790> allows<00:04:28.090> for<00:04:28.120> us<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.750> create

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
powerful it allows for us to create

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.530 
powerful it allows for us to create
sequencing<00:04:30.520> of<00:04:30.610> life<00:04:30.820> that<00:04:30.970> we<00:04:31.120> couldn't<00:04:31.450> do

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
sequencing of life that we couldn't do

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.970 
sequencing of life that we couldn't do
before<00:04:31.690> so<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.710> lights<00:04:33.340> fill<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:35.080> space<00:04:35.680> is

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
before so the lights fill the space is

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.430 
before so the lights fill the space is
all<00:04:36.220> between<00:04:36.520> what<00:04:37.390> happens<00:04:37.540> is<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.020> they'll

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
all between what happens is that they'll

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.400 
all between what happens is that they'll
turn<00:04:39.220> on<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.850> off<00:04:40.000> as<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.600> mist<00:04:40.840> turns<00:04:41.080> on<00:04:41.260> and

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
turn on and off as the mist turns on and

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.800 
turn on and off as the mist turns on and
off<00:04:41.500> is<00:04:41.770> a<00:04:41.800> kind<00:04:42.010> of<00:04:42.100> sequence<00:04:42.640> so<00:04:42.880> if<00:04:43.450> the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
off is a kind of sequence so if the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.330 
off is a kind of sequence so if the
sculpture<00:04:44.200> will<00:04:44.320> kind<00:04:44.500> of<00:04:44.530> breathe<00:04:44.860> in<00:04:45.190> its

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
sculpture will kind of breathe in its

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.580 
sculpture will kind of breathe in its
own<00:04:45.520> way<00:04:45.790> most<00:04:46.419> landscape<00:04:46.840> architects<00:04:47.350> don't

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
own way most landscape architects don't

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.010 
own way most landscape architects don't
design<00:04:47.890> art<00:04:48.160> works<00:04:48.400> like<00:04:48.640> this<00:04:48.820> commune<00:04:49.240> does

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
design art works like this commune does

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.510 
design art works like this commune does
that<00:04:50.169> explain<00:04:50.950> some<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:51.400> are<00:04:51.460> thinking

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
that explain some of you are thinking

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.510 
that explain some of you are thinking
behind

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
behind

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.220 
behind
well<00:04:53.520> it's<00:04:53.700> something<00:04:53.850> that<00:04:54.360> because<00:04:54.900> I<00:04:54.930> have

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
well it's something that because I have

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.140 
well it's something that because I have
a<00:04:55.260> background<00:04:55.590> both<00:04:56.070> in<00:04:56.340> sculpture<00:04:56.790> and

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
a background both in sculpture and

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.050 
a background both in sculpture and
landscape<00:04:57.690> architecture<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:58.620> design<00:04:59.010> it's<00:04:59.880> a

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
landscape architecture and design it's a

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.770 
landscape architecture and design it's a
kind<00:05:00.360> of<00:05:00.510> hybrid<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:02.610> then<00:05:03.120> on<00:05:03.240> top<00:05:03.480> of<00:05:03.540> that

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
kind of hybrid and then on top of that

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.600 
kind of hybrid and then on top of that
there's<00:05:04.170> a<00:05:04.260> kind<00:05:04.500> of<00:05:04.590> choreography<00:05:05.430> which

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
there's a kind of choreography which

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.140 
there's a kind of choreography which
comes<00:05:05.880> from<00:05:06.090> my<00:05:06.870> undergrad<00:05:07.500> study<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.670> music

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
comes from my undergrad study of music

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.630 
comes from my undergrad study of music
and<00:05:09.390> so<00:05:09.570> I<00:05:09.870> think<00:05:10.350> that<00:05:10.650> I've<00:05:10.980> been<00:05:11.220> able<00:05:11.340> to

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
and so I think that I've been able to

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.760 
and so I think that I've been able to
and<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.060> were<00:05:12.240> kind<00:05:12.600> of<00:05:12.660> bring<00:05:12.870> together<00:05:13.080> a

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
and the were kind of bring together a

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.210 
and the were kind of bring together a
kind<00:05:14.640> of<00:05:15.200> the<00:05:16.200> landscape<00:05:16.470> becomes<00:05:17.070> a

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
kind of the landscape becomes a

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.730 
kind of the landscape becomes a
performance<00:05:17.850> becomes<00:05:18.450> an<00:05:18.630> experience<00:05:19.290> and<00:05:19.620> I

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
performance becomes an experience and I

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.100 
performance becomes an experience and I
for<00:05:20.580> me<00:05:20.760> that's<00:05:21.060> so<00:05:21.330> important<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:22.080> really

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
for me that's so important it really

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.760 
for me that's so important it really
comes<00:05:22.650> from<00:05:22.770> our<00:05:23.360> kind<00:05:24.360> of<00:05:24.450> the<00:05:25.020> base<00:05:25.380> work

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
comes from our kind of the base work

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.880 
comes from our kind of the base work
that<00:05:26.070> we<00:05:26.250> did<00:05:26.490> from<00:05:27.230> when<00:05:28.230> I<00:05:28.260> started<00:05:28.350> my

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
that we did from when I started my

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.730 
that we did from when I started my
practice<00:05:29.190> which<00:05:29.610> is<00:05:29.640> with<00:05:29.970> kids<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:30.740> with

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
practice which is with kids and with

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.730 
practice which is with kids and with
kids<00:05:32.040> there<00:05:32.490> was<00:05:32.850> this<00:05:33.060> real<00:05:33.420> freedom<00:05:33.930> that<00:05:34.710> we

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
kids there was this real freedom that we

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.250 
kids there was this real freedom that we
had<00:05:35.130> and<00:05:35.370> in<00:05:35.580> defining<00:05:36.300> what<00:05:36.570> play<00:05:36.810> is<00:05:36.840> in<00:05:37.200> the

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
had and in defining what play is in the

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.740 
had and in defining what play is in the
public<00:05:37.410> realm<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:38.090> so<00:05:39.090> they<00:05:39.270> don't<00:05:39.480> want

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
public realm and so they don't want

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.900 
public realm and so they don't want
something<00:05:39.990> that's<00:05:40.230> just<00:05:40.350> flat<00:05:40.710> right<00:05:41.550> they

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
something that's just flat right they

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.670 
something that's just flat right they
want<00:05:42.180> something<00:05:42.420> that's<00:05:42.690> three<00:05:43.020> dimensional

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
want something that's three dimensional

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.490 
want something that's three dimensional
and<00:05:43.890> that<00:05:44.010> engages<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.790> public<00:05:45.240> when<00:05:45.900> we<00:05:46.290> go

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
and that engages the public when we go

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.050 
and that engages the public when we go
and<00:05:46.680> talk<00:05:46.860> to<00:05:46.890> arts<00:05:47.250> commissioners<00:05:47.790> and<00:05:47.820> this

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
and talk to arts commissioners and this

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.030 
and talk to arts commissioners and this
is<00:05:48.210> an<00:05:48.330> Arts<00:05:48.570> Commission<00:05:48.900> actually<00:05:49.470> we<00:05:49.830> say

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
is an Arts Commission actually we say

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.760 
is an Arts Commission actually we say
you<00:05:50.100> know<00:05:50.250> we<00:05:50.970> can<00:05:51.240> actually<00:05:51.720> do<00:05:51.870> it<00:05:52.050> all<00:05:52.230> we're

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
you know we can actually do it all we're

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.500 
you know we can actually do it all we're
licensed<00:05:53.280> landscape<00:05:53.460> architects<00:05:54.210> where

this Plaza and the sculpture and so it

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.100 
this Plaza and the sculpture and so it
was<00:06:09.870> like<00:06:10.050> a<00:06:10.080> multi-faceted<00:06:11.600> situation<00:06:12.600> when

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
was like a multi-faceted situation when

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.040 
sculpture public art they can do
performative<00:06:23.700> works<00:06:24.000> with<00:06:24.210> light<00:06:24.510> they<00:06:24.810> can

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050

do<00:06:26.690> landscape<00:06:27.690> and<00:06:27.870> they<00:06:27.960> can<00:06:28.140> do<00:06:28.320> planning

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
do landscape and they can do planning

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.190 
do landscape and they can do planning
work<00:06:29.460> and<00:06:29.730> then<00:06:29.910> they<00:06:30.210> can<00:06:30.420> bring<00:06:30.690> all<00:06:30.930> those

together<00:06:31.470> we<00:06:32.430> think<00:06:32.670> of<00:06:32.760> this<00:06:32.910> as<00:06:32.970> landscape

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480 
together we think of this as landscape

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.450 
together we think of this as landscape
architecture<00:06:34.140> this<00:06:34.440> is<00:06:34.590> part<00:06:34.860> of<00:06:34.950> what<00:06:35.130> we<00:06:35.250> do

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
architecture this is part of what we do

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.630 
architecture this is part of what we do
and<00:06:35.670> I<00:06:35.760> think<00:06:36.000> with<00:06:36.150> our<00:06:36.300> knowledge<00:06:36.810> of

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
and I think with our knowledge of

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.930 
and I think with our knowledge of
sustainability<00:06:38.640> and<00:06:38.880> ecology<00:06:39.690> and<00:06:40.080> paving

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
sustainability and ecology and paving

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.110 
sustainability and ecology and paving
plant<00:06:41.940> material<00:06:42.660> metal<00:06:43.160> lighting<00:06:44.160> all<00:06:44.400> that

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
plant material metal lighting all that

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.760 
plant material metal lighting all that
comes<00:06:45.390> together<00:06:45.570> to<00:06:45.840> create<00:06:46.110> something<00:06:46.470> I

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
comes together to create something I

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.900 
comes together to create something I
think<00:06:47.010> that<00:06:47.190> can<00:06:47.400> be

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
think that can be

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.870 
think that can be
that's<00:06:48.360> often<00:06:48.990> dynamic<00:06:49.950> and<00:06:50.190> exciting<00:06:50.490> for

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
that's often dynamic and exciting for

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.360 
that's often dynamic and exciting for
the<00:06:50.940> public
