00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 here in my company there is simona sinopoli 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.320
 president of the arc roma that how to say 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.870
 arci roma villa from perfect when of 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.790
 at the same pace they have it together arches 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.490
 Rome for 22 years 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.660
 the first edition of roma meets the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.449
 world dates back to 22 years ago and for 22 years 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.180
 the arch and villa from have joined in a 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.199
 perfect combination and the summer 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.269
 Roman 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.980
 Roman summer roma laces there is always 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.300
 has been in this section for 20 years 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.210
 to be there we hope that also in 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.790
 future I can go so what to say the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.750
 festival started twenty days ago e 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 had we say a cut that in the course 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.520
 of the time in short of offer 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.800
 to say and has changed because yes 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.070
 they change the times so we also say 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.510
 at the level of musical offer it was 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.370
 very focused on 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.710
 on etna on world music and so on 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.170
 now you have even been able to 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.850
 hear we have first said there 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.799
 it will be great attention and a great musical 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.380
 in short, folk pay great attention to India 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.649
 but the fundamental point that I have 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.500
 in other words we say that the contents of 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.720
 This festival is about styles 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.140
 of life 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.909
 we say and good practices and this is it 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.649
 stamped the whole party so not 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.229
 only the musical billboard but also the 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.759
 events that frame or rather are 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.840
 substance of this festival and therefore 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.759
 we have summer camps for children 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.170
 we have the smartphone then innovation 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.840
 technology 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.569
 we have arcs that they will animate 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.140
 the same the same festival and we have 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.860
 even if I can say about the days 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.270
 dedicated to 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.640
 of the important themes that are then the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.260
 ropes in the atc then immigration asylum 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.670
 prison welcome for which we in short 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.979
 we believe that 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.659
 it is important to give a musical offer 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.000
 so make culture through music 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.250
 but the culture is therefore at 360 degrees 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.590
 let's say so as in the DNA of the ark no 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.690
 in short, we carry out a series of 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.300
 experiences and we hope in short that this 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.550
 be appreciated by the public al 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.390
 which we turn to elsewhere times 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.340
 change 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.410
 the world changes the answers we need 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.270
 give are different and we hope to succeed 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.830
 to give in a world in the best way 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.230
 in short, we hope to be appreciated 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.240
 what to say the other I saw that there are 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.560
 also breakfast in the park a lot 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.770
 interesting where it will be done anyway 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.470
 breakfast itself but you can talk 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.270
 of books or otherwise entertain yourself 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.820
 with guests who end each time 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.980
 week will be different will be there 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.630
 present authors and so on 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.450
 really really culture 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.130
 touched in all its forms and in all 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.190
 its manifestations or therefore from 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.020
 Technology from sustainability will be 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.420
 the bicycle to recharge 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:03.040
 in short, the solar cell phones 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.720
 just like the hand memories 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.060
 a composting station and then 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.380
 a whole series of sayings of actions 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.720
 also aimed at how to say exactly 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.489
 respect the environment nature the world 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.850
 surrounding so also quality food 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.010
 there will be some 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.520
 as I said before good practices e 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.520
 lifestyles 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.769
 believing precisely to do with this is 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.090
 a choice let's say not only that 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.579
 in the top ropes I think it is 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.799
 necessary because we have 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.340
 need especially right now 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.810
 of 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.810
 lifestyles and good practices 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.740
 in the whole world in which 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.630
 we live in the whole society, in short, there is 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.250
 things are happening that are not there 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.170
 like I don't say that with a 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.480
 festivals then resolve but surely 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.030
 you can try in the small also a 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.860
 change a number of things culture 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.350
 culture is fundamental to society 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.270
 it also serves this and the culture becomes in 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.920
 many ways 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.920
