00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
is an insane amount in terms of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.420 
is an insane amount in terms of
secondary<00:00:46.460> qualities<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.719> choose

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
marksmanship because again that will

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.260 
marksmanship because again that will
allow<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.230> take<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:52.860> two<00:00:52.980> people

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
allow you to take out one or two people

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.139 
allow you to take out one or two people
before<00:00:54.800> you're<00:00:55.800> actually<00:00:56.190> up<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.940> face

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
before you're actually up in your face

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.459 
before you're actually up in your face
in<00:00:57.390> combat<00:00:58.789> also<00:00:59.789> illusion<00:01:00.449> magic<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:01.050> quite

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
in combat also illusion magic is quite

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.130 
in combat also illusion magic is quite
important<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.030> would<00:01:03.539> say<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.809> terms<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
important now I would say in terms of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.980 
important now I would say in terms of
marksman<00:01:04.710> or<00:01:04.860> illusion<00:01:05.580> choose<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.540> other

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
marksman or illusion choose one or other

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.960 
marksman or illusion choose one or other
not<00:01:07.590> both<00:01:07.830> okay

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
not both okay

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.990 
not both okay
reason<00:01:09.330> for<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:10.950> illusion<00:01:11.670> is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
reason for this is that illusion is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.789 
reason for this is that illusion is
going<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.869> make<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.170> more<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.500> pure

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
going to make you more of a pure

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.580 
going to make you more of a pure
assassin<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.659> that<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.930> are<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> be

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
assassin in that you are going to be

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.160 
assassin in that you are going to be
investing<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.220> lot<00:01:17.369> more<00:01:17.580> Magica<00:01:18.450> instead<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
investing a lot more Magica instead of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.230 
investing a lot more Magica instead of
health<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.250> you're<00:01:20.369> real<00:01:20.549> big<00:01:20.729> advantage<00:01:21.180> is

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
health so you're real big advantage is

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.550 
health so you're real big advantage is
the<00:01:21.330> fact<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.720> won't<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.350> kill

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the fact that you won't have to kill

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.300 
the fact that you won't have to kill
very<00:01:22.830> many<00:01:22.979> people<00:01:23.430> except<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.119> bosses

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
very many people except for the bosses

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.940 
very many people except for the bosses
however<00:01:26.450> if<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.570> go<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:27.840> marksman<00:01:28.350> you're

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
however if you go for marksman you're

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.289 
however if you go for marksman you're
going<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.130> invest<00:01:29.400> more<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.670> health<00:01:29.909> because

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
going to invest more in health because

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.030 
going to invest more in health because
you<00:01:30.750> only<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.170> shot<00:01:31.439> everyone's<00:01:31.860> gonna

there<00:05:42.830> and<00:05:43.010> then<00:05:43.550> identify<00:05:44.300> the<00:05:44.330> weakest

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
there and then identify the weakest

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.140 
there and then identify the weakest
target<00:05:45.110> and<00:05:45.260> take<00:05:45.410> him<00:05:45.530> out<00:05:45.620> first<00:05:45.950> if<00:05:46.610> you're

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
target and take him out first if you're

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.670 
target and take him out first if you're
going<00:05:47.240> for<00:05:47.390> the<00:05:47.450> pure<00:05:47.630> assassin<00:05:48.020> build<00:05:48.260> then

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
going for the pure assassin build then

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.400 
going for the pure assassin build then
when<00:05:49.280> you<00:05:49.340> go<00:05:49.460> into<00:05:49.610> a<00:05:49.700> room<00:05:49.850> identify<00:05:50.600> where

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
when you go into a room identify where

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.130 
when you go into a room identify where
people<00:05:51.740> walk<00:05:52.720> which<00:05:53.720> way<00:05:53.870> they're<00:05:54.020> looking

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
people walk which way they're looking

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.800 
people walk which way they're looking
and<00:05:54.560> then<00:05:54.850> choose<00:05:55.850> your<00:05:56.030> route<00:05:56.180> in<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.450> way<00:05:56.570> that

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
and then choose your route in a way that

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.120 
and then choose your route in a way that
you<00:05:56.930> won't<00:05:57.170> get<00:05:57.680> noticed<00:05:59.440> another<00:06:00.440> good<00:06:00.830> plan

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
you won't get noticed another good plan

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.720 
you won't get noticed another good plan
is<00:06:02.350> when<00:06:03.350> you're<00:06:03.530> actually<00:06:03.740> doing<00:06:04.490> your

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
is when you're actually doing your

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.300 
is when you're actually doing your
attacks<00:06:05.030> in<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.300> first<00:06:05.540> place<00:06:06.310> particularly

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
attacks in the first place particularly

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.910 
attacks in the first place particularly
if<00:06:07.760> they're<00:06:08.060> majority'<00:06:08.510> flee<00:06:08.660> on<00:06:08.960> the<00:06:09.260> outside

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
if they're majority' flee on the outside

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.370 
if they're majority' flee on the outside
okay<00:06:10.610> so<00:06:10.880> not<00:06:11.210> actually<00:06:11.600> in<00:06:11.690> a<00:06:11.780> dungeon<00:06:11.960> I

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
okay so not actually in a dungeon I

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.800 
okay so not actually in a dungeon I
would<00:06:13.250> say<00:06:13.430> take<00:06:13.700> them<00:06:13.880> on<00:06:13.970> at<00:06:14.090> night<00:06:14.300> this<00:06:14.690> is

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
would say take them on at night this is

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.600 
would say take them on at night this is
because<00:06:15.080> obviously<00:06:15.320> you're<00:06:16.040> much<00:06:16.220> harder<00:06:16.490> to

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
because obviously you're much harder to

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.020 
because obviously you're much harder to
detect<00:06:16.730> at<00:06:17.150> night<00:06:17.330> and<00:06:17.570> you<00:06:18.020> blend<00:06:18.230> in<00:06:18.470> more

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
detect at night and you blend in more

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.220 
detect at night and you blend in more
even<00:06:20.030> if<00:06:20.120> you're<00:06:20.240> in<00:06:20.330> a<00:06:20.390> dungeon<00:06:20.570> be<00:06:21.020> aware

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
even if you're in a dungeon be aware

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.110 
even if you're in a dungeon be aware
that<00:06:21.290> some<00:06:21.740> dungeons<00:06:22.190> have<00:06:22.430> sort<00:06:22.640> of<00:06:22.670> ceilings

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
that some dungeons have sort of ceilings

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.870 
that some dungeons have sort of ceilings
that<00:06:24.080> have<00:06:24.530> holes<00:06:24.740> in<00:06:25.070> them<00:06:25.220> so<00:06:25.430> like<00:06:25.670> we'll

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
that have holes in them so like we'll

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.390 
that have holes in them so like we'll
get<00:06:26.060> through<00:06:26.390> if<00:06:26.570> you're<00:06:27.200> attacking<00:06:28.010> at<00:06:28.220> night

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
get through if you're attacking at night

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.650 
get through if you're attacking at night
then<00:06:28.730> obviously<00:06:29.150> that<00:06:29.270> won't<00:06:29.390> happen<00:06:31.660> general

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
then obviously that won't happen general

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.530 
then obviously that won't happen general
rule<00:06:32.870> these<00:06:33.110> guys<00:06:33.350> is<00:06:33.710> just<00:06:34.160> again<00:06:34.760> not<00:06:35.240> to<00:06:35.450> get

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
rule these guys is just again not to get

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.480 
rule these guys is just again not to get
cornered<00:06:35.990> because<00:06:36.710> then<00:06:36.860> you<00:06:37.010> can't<00:06:37.220> run<00:06:37.400> away

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
cornered because then you can't run away

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.510 
cornered because then you can't run away
and<00:06:38.240> of<00:06:38.360> course<00:06:38.570> not<00:06:38.780> to<00:06:38.870> get<00:06:39.020> surrounded

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
and of course not to get surrounded

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.860 
and of course not to get surrounded
okay<00:06:41.520> so<00:06:41.580> that<00:06:41.850> concludes<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.360> boss<00:06:42.570> killer

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
okay so that concludes the boss killer

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.080 
okay so that concludes the boss killer
build
