00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.649 
off the edge and you can actually get
inside<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.490> building<00:01:33.940> I<00:01:34.030> believe<00:01:34.330> this<00:01:34.479> is

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
inside the building I believe this is

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.840 
inside the building I believe this is
just<00:01:34.840> down<00:01:35.049> to<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.350> development<00:01:36.220> of<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.610> map

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
just down to the development of the map

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.370 
just down to the development of the map
because<00:01:37.030> I<00:01:37.150> think<00:01:37.210> every<00:01:37.900> building<00:01:38.320> has

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
because I think every building has

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.950 
because I think every building has
barriers<00:01:39.220> on<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.549> sides<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.090> sometimes<00:01:40.690> the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
barriers on the sides and sometimes the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.660 
barriers on the sides and sometimes the
barriers<00:01:41.350> that<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.590> get<00:01:41.740> moved<00:01:41.979> by<00:01:42.220> accident

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
barriers that you get moved by accident

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.370 
barriers that you get moved by accident
during<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.180> development<00:01:43.630> process<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:44.350> I

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
during the development process and I

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.690 
during the development process and I
believe<00:01:44.650> that<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:44.950> exactly<00:01:45.250> what<00:01:45.580> has

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
believe that is exactly what has

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.280 
believe that is exactly what has
happened<00:01:45.729> here<00:01:46.090> as<00:01:46.540> you<00:01:46.659> can<00:01:46.720> see<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:47.049> can<00:01:47.170> get

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
happened here as you can see you can get

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.840 
happened here as you can see you can get
in<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.409> building<00:01:47.860> which<00:01:47.979> we<00:01:48.130> don't<00:01:48.340> want<00:01:48.670> to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
in the building which we don't want to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.980 
in the building which we don't want to
make<00:01:48.970> sure<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.299> lock<00:01:49.450> has<00:01:49.600> said<00:01:49.780> gone

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
make sure that lock has said gone

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.649 
make sure that lock has said gone
twister<00:01:50.380> make<00:01:50.619> sure<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:50.799> tag<00:01:51.130> me<00:01:51.159> in<00:01:51.400> it<00:01:51.520> at<00:01:51.760> SSX

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
twister make sure to tag me in it at SSX

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.080 
twister make sure to tag me in it at SSX
shadows<00:01:53.020> x<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.590> also<00:01:54.010> tag<00:01:54.250> respawn<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:54.939> out

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
shadows x and also tag respawn it out

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.179 
shadows x and also tag respawn it out
respawn<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.780> also<00:01:56.229> this<00:01:56.380> video<00:01:56.560> so<00:01:56.920> they<00:01:56.950> can

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
respawn and also this video so they can

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.679 
respawn and also this video so they can
see<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.520> proof<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:58.030> in<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.330> next<00:01:58.570> update

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
see the proof and in the next update

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.749 
see the proof and in the next update
hopefully<00:01:59.619> they<00:01:59.770> can<00:01:59.830> get<00:02:00.009> it<00:02:00.070> fixed<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:00.670> they

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
hopefully they can get it fixed so they

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.460 
hopefully they can get it fixed so they
just<00:02:00.939> make<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.210> whole<00:02:01.240> time<00:02:01.840> full<00:02:02.140> experience

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
just make the whole time full experience

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.469 
just make the whole time full experience
that<00:02:02.890> much<00:02:03.070> better<00:02:03.369> I<00:02:03.670> haven't<00:02:04.030> actually<00:02:04.150> seen

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
that much better I haven't actually seen

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.390 
that much better I haven't actually seen
anyone<00:02:04.930> exploit<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.530> skillet<00:02:05.890> so<00:02:06.100> far

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
anyone exploit the skillet so far

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.160 
anyone exploit the skillet so far
actually<00:02:06.580> found<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.180> by<00:02:07.330> mistake<00:02:07.540> which<00:02:08.019> is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
actually found it by mistake which is

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.019 
actually found it by mistake which is
good<00:02:08.409> at<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.919> moment<00:02:09.069> however<00:02:09.489> probably

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:10.029 
good at the moment however probably

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.729 
good at the moment however probably
after<00:02:10.359> this<00:02:10.450> video<00:02:10.659> a<00:02:10.810> bunch<00:02:11.169> of<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.469> will<00:02:11.620> go

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.500 
after this video a bunch of you will go
try<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.069> out<00:02:12.279> so<00:02:12.609> hopefully<00:02:12.909> it<00:02:13.120> gets<00:02:13.209> patched

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
try it out so hopefully it gets patched

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.580 
try it out so hopefully it gets patched
straight<00:02:13.810> away<00:02:14.019> that's<00:02:14.319> it

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590
