let's try as the way we did whatever
it's<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:56.950> exciting

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.880 

very<00:03:10.709> much<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.099> London<00:03:11.700> accent<00:03:12.689> with<00:03:13.379> a<00:03:13.590> lot<00:03:13.859> of

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
very much a London accent with a lot of

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.440 
very much a London accent with a lot of
influence<00:03:14.609> of<00:03:15.230> pop<00:03:16.230> music

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
so I think this is the best so if you

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.789 
so I think this is the best so if you
see<00:03:29.549> we<00:03:29.819> are<00:03:29.849> all<00:03:30.000> contemporaries<00:03:30.959> but<00:03:31.200> we<00:03:31.469> are

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
see we are all contemporaries but we are

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.849 
see we are all contemporaries but we are
all<00:03:32.129> standing<00:03:32.700> on<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.180> shoulders<00:03:33.359> of<00:03:33.859> masters

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
all standing on the shoulders of masters

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.520 
all standing on the shoulders of masters
I<00:03:35.180> like<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.389> way<00:03:36.540> actually<00:03:36.810> what<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.379> just

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
I like the way actually what you just

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.940 
I like the way actually what you just
did

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
did

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.879 
did
I<00:03:37.980> think<00:03:38.280> it's<00:03:38.420> vibrant<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.540> firing<00:03:39.989> yeah<00:03:40.319> the

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
I think it's vibrant is firing yeah the

00:03:40.889 --> 00:04:05.210 
I think it's vibrant is firing yeah the
force<00:03:41.189> movement<00:03:41.459> is

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220
