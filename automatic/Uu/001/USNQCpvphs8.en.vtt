in<00:01:58.860> some<00:01:59.070> sort<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.310> cheesy<00:01:59.610> Christmas<00:02:00.180> special

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
in some sort of cheesy Christmas special

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.600 
in some sort of cheesy Christmas special
and<00:02:00.780> they<00:02:01.140> had<00:02:01.320> no<00:02:01.560> choice<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.159> act<00:02:02.340> out

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
and they had no choice but to act out

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.789 
and they had no choice but to act out
the<00:02:02.820> cheesy<00:02:03.090> heartwarming<00:02:03.840> tropes<00:02:04.170> through

the cheesy heartwarming tropes through

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.440 
the cheesy heartwarming tropes through
grudgingly<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.850> would<00:02:06.000> actually<00:02:06.299> be<00:02:06.420> pretty

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
grudgingly that would actually be pretty

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.800 
grudgingly that would actually be pretty
funny<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:08.039> anyway<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.910> wouldn't<00:02:09.209> expect<00:02:09.479> it

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
funny but anyway you wouldn't expect it

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.140 
funny but anyway you wouldn't expect it
because<00:02:09.929> Zim<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> dark<00:02:11.190> show<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.879> course

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
because Zim is a dark show of course

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.430 
because Zim is a dark show of course
it's<00:02:12.360> gonna<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:12.870> dark

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it's gonna have this dark

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.110 
it's gonna have this dark
Christmas<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.160> really<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:14.790> another

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
Christmas and really it's just another

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.000 
Christmas and really it's just another
Zim<00:02:15.570> tries<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.020> take<00:02:16.170> over<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.500> world<00:02:16.680> plot

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
Zim tries to take over the world plot

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.880 
Zim tries to take over the world plot
just<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.970> slightly<00:02:18.390> Christmasy<00:02:19.260> shell<00:02:19.590> and

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
just in a slightly Christmasy shell and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.800 
just in a slightly Christmasy shell and
there's<00:02:20.310> nothing<00:02:20.610> wrong<00:02:20.790> with<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.240> as<00:02:21.420> an

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
there's nothing wrong with that as an

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.410 
there's nothing wrong with that as an
episode<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.350> works<00:02:22.590> perfectly<00:02:23.130> fine<00:02:23.460> in<00:02:23.790> fact

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
episode it works perfectly fine in fact

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.970 
episode it works perfectly fine in fact
I'd<00:02:24.660> say<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.960> works<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.350> its<00:02:25.440> favor<00:02:25.710> because

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
I'd say it works to its favor because

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.680 
I'd say it works to its favor because
you<00:02:26.640> don't<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:26.970> want<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.240> watch<00:02:27.450> this

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
you don't just want to watch this

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.470 
you don't just want to watch this
episode<00:02:27.840> at<00:02:28.470> Christmastime<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.910> really<00:02:30.330> just

is enough here that I suppose justifies

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.870 
is enough here that I suppose justifies
watching<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.200> during<00:02:37.440> Christmas<00:02:37.920> time<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.430> mean

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
episode it is strange that that's just

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.220 
episode it is strange that that's just
strikingly<00:03:23.640> similar<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.420> mean<00:03:24.720> I'm<00:03:24.810> not<00:03:24.930> saying

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
Zim ripped it off after all this was

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.479 
Zim ripped it off after all this was
like<00:03:27.390> three<00:03:27.420> years<00:03:28.050> later<00:03:28.410> I'm<00:03:28.739> just<00:03:29.250> saying

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
like three years later I'm just saying

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.020 
like three years later I'm just saying
there<00:03:30.030> are<00:03:30.060> very<00:03:30.720> very<00:03:30.870> similar<00:03:31.650> concepts<00:03:32.489> I'm

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
there are very very similar concepts I'm

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.850 
there are very very similar concepts I'm
definitely<00:03:33.600> not<00:03:33.810> gonna<00:03:33.959> recommend<00:03:34.380> this<00:03:34.680> to
