00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.550
 in life there are different situations under 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.050
 can sleep yourself in bed and nobody 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.529
 touch and here you are at three in the morning 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.750
 Wake you in the desert with no Al Khali 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.939
 that any of this from the sands of ancient rose 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.070
 the city that mixed fragments from 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.279
 different time weather forecasters say something 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.809
 from adverse terrain conditions 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.610
 it remains only to briskly put on the ports 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.440
 jump into a helicopter where you are already waiting 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.520
 six more gifted soldiers and 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.719
 go to save the world right away 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.690
 need to warn 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.059
 the game is not for the faint of heart there is no 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.120
 there are no extreme nightmares but there is blood here 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.710
 totally unthinkable amount of monsters 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.660
 which you will face 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.070
 assembled from individual pieces of meat with 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 some kind of pointed iron 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.789
 inserts surrounding corridors littered with 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.530
 internal organs 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.270
 and some opponents altogether 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.970
 explode happily scattering around 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.100
 surroundings their hands and feet even in 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.650
 screen saver and menu at the very beginning of the game on 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.640
 background shows a bloody mess in 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.200
 the screen is flying something like a whole swarm boo 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.390
 otherwise we have a standard 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.400
 fighter with a bias in our tactics 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.299
 ward of the alpha and beta groups of three 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.159
 man in each 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.390
 from birth have certain 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.670
 unique abilities 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.259
 someone can slow down someone 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.210
 stop opponents on some 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.220
 distance from yourself and some in general 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.240
 put down fiery demons on the enemy 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.190
 conveniently caught on the right hand 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.050
 when someone from the friendly team of jericho 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.580
 blast struck or stuffed 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.710
 falls on his knees 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.590
 it doesn't mean we lost it 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.430
 forever enough to approach the student on 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.830
 half a man 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.810
 press space and it miraculously healed 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.510
 stand on his feet and with double zeal 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.630
 will go into battle such local 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.760
 immortality and only if they fall all at once 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.070
 We will send the nearest checkpoint 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.260
 this system is by the way not always correct 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.300
 it works it happens that someone stays in 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.280
 alive and keeps fighting the screen all 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.330
 equal with characteristic sound fill 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.800
 perfume with a hint to download the game 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.540
 Jericho's gameplay consists of 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.120
 fairly uniform battles from the location 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.290
 colocation however battle successfully diluted 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.030
 script you scenes 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.310
 without flawlessly animated characters 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.380
 something happens sometimes they even 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.959
 quarrel with each other comes to 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.760
 weapons use most in memory 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.630
 Of course, the moment is not delayed 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.730
 from the beginning of the game 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.130
 when the hero first moves to 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.920
 another's body you see your dying 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.989
 character from understanding that from you 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.280
 there is only a soul left without some 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.709
 physical basis 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.390
 very impressive not often so 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.180
 worked scenes are found in 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.739
 modern computer games 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.330
 gradually your soul will be allowed to all 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.860
 alpha and beta group members 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.690
 so it will be possible to move in and 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.739
 control anyone you like 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.269
 hero girls including worth noting 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.959
 successful find developers with 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.610
 mini games 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.440
 It is long known and very 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.630
 common phenomenon on consoles 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.870
 however, in the piss to the players it is the most 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.269
 remembered by masterpiece fahrenheit 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.380
 when it falls from above 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.690
 bloodied not on screen 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.340
 the necessary buttons are highlighted and if 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.110
 time to press then your hero will start 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.420
 resist hitting the enemy 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.870
 push away from yourself and then spectacularly 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.489
 will kill him by and large if you 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.190
 not sickened by the abundance of red on 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.870
 the screen then pass erih it is worth something 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.700
 originally from well optimized 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.370
 engine design with dark to pain 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.860
 Doom- like corridors 3 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.800
 characters and the main opponent in the face 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.140
 baby 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.850
 by the way on the first commercial for the game 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.970
 there was a wrong impression 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.720
 only concepts but its genre here it is 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.720
 how it all turned out 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.220
 game is woven from solid contradictions 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.140
 great sound effects and 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.570
 dull level design 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.530
 great artist work and dull 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.290
 game process 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.570
 shortcomings enough but try 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.570
 Jericho taste is still worth
