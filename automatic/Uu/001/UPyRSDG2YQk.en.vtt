okay<00:00:00.240> in<00:00:00.329> this<00:00:00.450> segment<00:00:00.659> we<00:00:01.110> want<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.380> talk

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
okay in this segment we want to talk

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.550 
okay in this segment we want to talk
about<00:00:01.709> in<00:00:02.040> wall<00:00:02.340> and<00:00:02.700> side<00:00:03.510> wall<00:00:03.720> flashing<00:00:04.230> in

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
about in wall and side wall flashing in

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.789 
about in wall and side wall flashing in
wall<00:00:05.520> is<00:00:05.790> always<00:00:06.060> where<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.359> panels<00:00:06.750> in<00:00:06.899> side

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
wall is always where the panels in side

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.919 
wall is always where the panels in side
walls<00:00:08.160> are<00:00:08.429> always<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.420> side<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
walls are always on the side of the

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.870 
walls are always on the side of the
panels<00:00:10.349> so<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.650> easy<00:00:10.980> way<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.280> determine<00:00:11.460> the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
panels so the easy way to determine the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.780 
panels so the easy way to determine the
-<00:00:12.059> now<00:00:12.870> we've<00:00:13.230> looked<00:00:13.590> here<00:00:14.130> you'll<00:00:14.309> see<00:00:14.549> an

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
- now we've looked here you'll see an

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.349 
- now we've looked here you'll see an
outside<00:00:15.450> closure<00:00:16.670> always<00:00:17.670> have<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.119> in<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
outside closure always have that in the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.630 
outside closure always have that in the
end<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.630> all<00:00:18.750> situation<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.949> what<00:00:20.220> seals

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
end of all situation that is what seals

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.380 
end of all situation that is what seals
this<00:00:21.029> space<00:00:21.420> between<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.439> ribs<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.980> trim

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
this space between the ribs and the trim

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.120 
this space between the ribs and the trim
now<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.480> always<00:00:24.869> want<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.230> put<00:00:25.380> butyl<00:00:25.740> sealant

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
now you always want to put butyl sealant

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.580 
now you always want to put butyl sealant
tape<00:00:26.310> under<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:26.910> closure<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:28.109> top<00:00:28.380> of

tape under this closure and on top of
the<00:00:28.680> closure<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.340> will<00:00:29.490> ensure<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.119> weather

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
the closure that will ensure a weather

the closure that will ensure a weather
tight<00:00:30.810> seal<00:00:31.669> now<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> end<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.210> sidewalls

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
tight seal now the end of all sidewalls

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.370 
tight seal now the end of all sidewalls
it's<00:00:34.050> same<00:00:34.290> trim<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.890> an<00:00:35.300> ASW<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:36.540> now<00:00:37.170> if

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
it's same trim it's an ASW one now if

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.590 
it's same trim it's an ASW one now if
you<00:00:37.500> want<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> specify<00:00:38.030> when<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.149> order<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
you want to specify when you order the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.530 
you want to specify when you order the
material<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.860> your<00:00:41.010> pitch<00:00:41.309> will<00:00:41.910> break<00:00:42.239> this

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
material for your pitch will break this

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.380 
material for your pitch will break this
or<00:00:42.750> bend<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.170> metal<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.800> fit<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:44.730> now<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
or bend this metal to fit here now the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.290 
or bend this metal to fit here now the
sidewall<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.170> always<00:00:46.469> 90<00:00:46.940> now<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.270> have

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
sidewall is always 90 now what we have

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.930 
sidewall is always 90 now what we have
for<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.110> demonstration<00:00:49.440> which<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.489> probably

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
for this demonstration which is probably

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.029 
for this demonstration which is probably
a<00:00:51.059> good<00:00:51.149> thing<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.230> more<00:00:52.379> difficult<00:00:52.530> of

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
a good thing is the more difficult of

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.220 
a good thing is the more difficult of
the<00:00:53.129> two<00:00:53.430> scenarios<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.180> run<00:00:54.329> into<00:00:54.539> we're

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the two scenarios you can run into we're

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.200 
the two scenarios you can run into we're
going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.500> attaching<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> flat<00:00:56.489> now

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
going to be attaching to the flat now

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.060 
going to be attaching to the flat now
the<00:00:57.270> end<00:00:57.539> wall<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.020> always<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.500> top<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the end wall is always on top of the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.400 
the end wall is always on top of the
ribs<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.460> we've<00:00:59.730> got<00:00:59.969> an<00:01:00.180> elevation<00:01:00.930> change<00:01:00.960> of

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
ribs so we've got an elevation change of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.539 
ribs so we've got an elevation change of
3/4<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:01.980> an<00:01:02.190> inch<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:03.359> rib<00:01:03.830> ended<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:04.949> over

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
3/4 of an inch if this rib ended up over

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.050 
3/4 of an inch if this rib ended up over
here<00:01:06.650> you'd<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> same<00:01:08.159> elevation<00:01:08.610> going

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
here you'd have the same elevation going

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.730 
here you'd have the same elevation going
all<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> way<00:01:09.450> across<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.590> bit

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
all the way across it's a little bit

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.350 
all the way across it's a little bit
easier<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.400> an<00:01:11.490> install<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.299> this

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
easier of an install so for this

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.240 
easier of an install so for this
demonstration<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:13.170> good<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
demonstration it's good that we have the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.210 
demonstration it's good that we have the
more<00:01:14.369> difficult<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.030> two<00:01:15.860> now<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.070> thing

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
more difficult of the two now one thing

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.679 
more difficult of the two now one thing
that<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.400> want<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.790> thinking<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.270> any<00:01:18.420> time

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that you want to be thinking of any time

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.840 
that you want to be thinking of any time
you're<00:01:18.900> doing<00:01:19.020> flashings<00:01:19.710> especially<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:20.729> you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
you're doing flashings especially if you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.820 
you're doing flashings especially if you
have<00:01:21.000> two<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.420> tied<00:01:21.659> together<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.590> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
have two that are tied together is it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.830 
have two that are tied together is it
the<00:01:22.979> flow<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.700> water<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.479> water<00:01:24.659> is

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the flow of the water the water is

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
the flow of the water the water is
always<00:01:25.020> flowing<00:01:25.409> down<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.979> roof<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.430> want<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
always flowing down the roof you want to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.249 
always flowing down the roof you want to
make<00:01:26.820> sure<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.270> you're<00:01:27.420> stacking<00:01:28.049> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
make sure that you're stacking and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.740 
make sure that you're stacking and
staggering<00:01:28.799> trims<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> water<00:01:30.479> flows

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
staggering trims so that the water flows

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.969 
staggering trims so that the water flows
over<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.680> doesn't<00:01:32.009> flow<00:01:32.310> into<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.770> now<00:01:34.770> what

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
over and doesn't flow into one now what

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.640 
over and doesn't flow into one now what
we've<00:01:35.189> done<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.700> ours<00:01:39.409> we're<00:01:40.409> going<00:01:40.590> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
we've done with ours we're going to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.980 
we've done with ours we're going to
marry<00:01:40.860> these<00:01:41.070> two<00:01:41.280> together<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.180> you

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
marry these two together like this you

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.649 
marry these two together like this you
can<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.770> we've<00:01:43.950> bent<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.060> over

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
can see that we've bent this up and over

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.969 
can see that we've bent this up and over
to<00:01:46.470> make<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.159> elevation<00:01:47.909> change<00:01:48.979> now

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
to make up for this elevation change now

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.560 
to make up for this elevation change now
what<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.369> would<00:01:50.549> do<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> field<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.450> would

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
what you would do in the field you would

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
then we would also put butyl sealant

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.590 
then we would also put butyl sealant
tape<00:02:25.680> between<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.400> two<00:02:26.580> trims<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.240> that<00:02:27.480> the
