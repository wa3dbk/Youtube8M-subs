00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
for resolutions higher than 480p so I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.120 
for resolutions higher than 480p so I
can't<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.630> right<00:01:42.689> now<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.500> fixed<00:01:44.040> my

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
can't do it right now but if I fixed my

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.460 
can't do it right now but if I fixed my
TV<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.270> fixed<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.399> ps3<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.659> at

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
TV and fixed the ps3 so it can be at

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.179 
TV and fixed the ps3 so it can be at
least<00:01:49.710> phone<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.340> ap<00:01:50.640> I'll<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:51.060> able<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.509> it

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
least phone and ap I'll be able to do it

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.100 
least phone and ap I'll be able to do it
but<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.610> reason<00:01:53.909> why<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.299> higher<00:01:54.899> than

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
but the reason why is not higher than

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.990 
but the reason why is not higher than
that<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:56.040> my<00:01:56.189> recording<00:01:56.700> device

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that is because of my recording device

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.740 
that is because of my recording device
is<00:01:57.299> gonna<00:01:57.540> be<00:01:57.890> less<00:01:58.890> than<00:01:59.040> 480p<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.479> anyway

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
is gonna be less than 480p but anyway

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.649 
is gonna be less than 480p but anyway
and<00:02:01.049> then<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:02.130> add<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.329> also
