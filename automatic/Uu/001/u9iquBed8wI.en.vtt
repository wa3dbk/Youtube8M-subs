00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.870
 hello guys martÃ­n is from street in 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.389
 Spanish the written we the new 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.039
 samsung in x 30 and you know it's about 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.950
 a model that comes to replace the 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.900
 previous in x 20 basically I knew 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.350
 physically it looks a lot like yes 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.360
 brings new aspects such as for example 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.990
 this electronic folding seen that 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.880
 arrives 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.810
 and with the patient as pain to shoot 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.970
 that is, taking 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.970
 also good the screen has been included 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.840
 to be alone 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.840
 rotating 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:51.530
 and in basic aspects that offers greater 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.510
 greater function 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.510
 by said higher image sensitivity 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.730
 what can you say basically 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.110
 well here we can see a little more of 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.600
 close this new in x30 has a 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.520
 pretty soft control dial is changed 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.409
 quite easily quite easily 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.729
 another day around here, tiny 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.189
 lever where we can 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.460
 select the type of blasted shot 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.200
 with countdown or braque team also 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.110
 we have here these little buttons for 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.960
 choose the exposure mode or activate 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.570
 the wifi and its different modes of 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.280
 share the mind 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.510
 the power button with the shot 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.390
 recording button over here more vials 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.510
 another day with multifunction button for 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.910
 make it in concise display and so on more 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.910
 control buttons folding screen 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.640
 it's a pretty good resolution 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.210
 and also calls attention for being 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.210
 pretty finite 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.840
 very finite 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.420
 and that helps once deployed 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.550
 well, do not excel too much in the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.000
 body of the camera quite interesting 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.000
 this screen 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.950
 internally good as it offers a 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.000
 hybrid approach system that allows 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.540
 achieve enough focus speeds 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.540
 fast 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.780
 as we have already said the 20 sensor as 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.640
 3 mega pixels of type semos and account 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.760
 also good with the possibility of 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.990
 record video at 1080p with a rate of 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.990
 frame of 60 images per second 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.580
 next to her as we said 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.250
 previously good before we go back to 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.250
 review the electronic viewer a little 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.459
 very peculiar since it allows us to shoot 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.280
 vertically without changing the plane of the 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.440
 view is very well quite comfortable from 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.970
 adjust the angle of the camera 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.780
 to offer greater comfort at the time 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.780
 to shoot without a doubt 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.689
 As we said before, it comes accompanied 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.749
 of new objectives in this case 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:14.480
 This is a 1650 with the inauguration of the 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:15.889
 new range s from the manufacturer 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.590
 they are good targets because he uses 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.780
 premium materials as well has 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.219
 liked to say samsung are good 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.430
 20 higher quality objectives 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:27.049
 higher prices for example the ring 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.290
 of focus because you can see that it's very, very 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.120
 Soft features the classic function button 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.370
 of the samsung lens when a guy 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.800
 of touch with respect to the previous one 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.070
 has a stronger and firmer click 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.050
 good so they are more qualities about 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.460
 all obviously we are talking about a 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.819
 very bright lens with system 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.609
 integrated optical stabilization 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.680
 are 2.8 the opening that is we are 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.630
 talking about a performance goal 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.090
 very advanced 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.310
 I too fast against him then 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:03.620
 comes the new 1650 with engine let's say 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.720
 which is another 1650 obviously I do not know if 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.790
 they have nothing to do with each other but 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.130
 be good then opt for another system 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.760
 for example, it offers a system of 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.880
 these motorized and before these buttons 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.709
 here digitally effect and masters the 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.750
 they are and adjust called the the focus and he 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.240
 forgiveness in the focal 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.400
 and well then this the other other objective 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.990
 that comes with the camera let's say it's 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.330
 one pancake type pretty picked up and 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.069
 pretty practical yes 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.120
 nothing to see clearly with the range 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:42.520
 high of the series 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.340
 so good this is the new one of 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.840
 samsung in x30 it is true that it comes with 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.550
 a look very much like the reflex 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.530
 of mirror that we can find others 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.500
 manufacturers like canon and nikon is a 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.760
 very serious bet has a hilt 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.650
 quite prominent which gives 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.690
 aspect completely of reflect that 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.870
 be one without a mirror and if it 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.639
 we add the one that accompanies it in lenses 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.590
 great quality because we are good then 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.210
 we have a pretty interesting set 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.750
 by samsung and we'll see how 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.430
 they take the tests but for now 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.430
 good aspect of this in x30
