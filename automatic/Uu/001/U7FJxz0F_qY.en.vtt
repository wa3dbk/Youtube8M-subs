own<00:02:02.790> does<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.930> actually<00:02:05.390> increases<00:02:06.799> the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
own does is it actually increases the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.940 
own does is it actually increases the
synthesis<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.179> proteins<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.869> proteins<00:02:10.739> we

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
synthesis of proteins and proteins we

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.850 
synthesis of proteins and proteins we
all<00:02:11.099> know<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.580> or<00:02:11.730> what<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.599> building<00:02:13.020> blocks

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
all know is or what the building blocks

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.880 
all know is or what the building blocks
of<00:02:13.950> muscle<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.270> what<00:02:16.200> we're<00:02:16.320> doing<00:02:16.650> with<00:02:16.800> this

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
of muscle so what we're doing with this

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.060 
of muscle so what we're doing with this
product<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.430> where<00:02:17.610> we'll<00:02:18.030> give<00:02:18.930> our<00:02:19.170> self<00:02:19.980> a

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
product is where we'll give our self a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.400 
product is where we'll give our self a
chance<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.780> increase<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.960> amount<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.260> weight

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
chance to increase the amount of weight

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.810 
chance to increase the amount of weight
that<00:02:22.440> we're<00:02:22.680> living<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.190> give<00:02:23.340> us<00:02:23.490> deeper

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
that we're living to give us deeper

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.230 
that we're living to give us deeper
tears<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.330> then<00:02:25.020> we're<00:02:25.140> also<00:02:25.490> increasing<00:02:26.490> the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
tears and then we're also increasing the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.570 
tears and then we're also increasing the
synthesis<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.260> proteins<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:29.310> going<00:02:29.520> to

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
synthesis of proteins it's going to

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.820 
synthesis of proteins it's going to
repair<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.030> mustard<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.470> an<00:02:31.710> awesome

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
repair the mustard so this is an awesome

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.370 
repair the mustard so this is an awesome
product<00:02:32.310> called<00:02:32.970> Tess<00:02:33.240> clean<00:02:33.540> it's<00:02:34.200> for

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
product called Tess clean it's for

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.270 
product called Tess clean it's for
belium<00:02:34.740> enterprises<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.310> highly<00:02:35.700> recommend<00:02:35.820> it
