that<00:01:55.920> tells<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> t45<00:01:57.210> how<00:01:57.899> much<00:01:58.079> water<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that tells the t45 how much water it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.380 
that tells the t45 how much water it
should<00:01:58.649> brew<00:01:59.130> into<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.670> tea<00:01:59.909> disc<00:02:00.149> when<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
should brew into this tea disc when I

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.789 
should brew into this tea disc when I
put<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.780> into<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> machine

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
put it into the machine

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.350 
put it into the machine
so<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:02.399> see<00:02:02.520> how<00:02:02.670> quickly<00:02:02.969> it's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
so you can see how quickly it's

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.789 
so you can see how quickly it's
finishing<00:02:03.719> up<00:02:04.020> brewing<00:02:04.380> right<00:02:04.530> now<00:02:04.649> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
finishing up brewing right now and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.709 
finishing up brewing right now and
that's<00:02:04.920> because<00:02:05.009> espresso<00:02:05.850> does<00:02:06.329> not<00:02:06.479> make

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
that's because espresso does not make

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.949 
that's because espresso does not make
use<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.049> much<00:02:07.469> water<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.310> strong<00:02:08.789> blend<00:02:09.599> of

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
use of much water it's a strong blend of

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.130 
use of much water it's a strong blend of
coffee<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.129> strong<00:02:11.489> brew<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.780> now<00:02:12.989> I'm

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
coffee and it's a strong brew so now I'm

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.710
