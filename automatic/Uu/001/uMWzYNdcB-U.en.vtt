to do is I'm going to come underneath
the<00:00:03.740> distance<00:00:04.740> that<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:04.950> retreat<00:00:05.549> dictates

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
the distance that you retreat dictates

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.750 
the distance that you retreat dictates
the<00:00:06.299> distance<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.140> cut<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.740> onion<00:00:08.069> now

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
the distance of the cut of the onion now

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.240 
the distance of the cut of the onion now
I<00:00:08.820> cut<00:00:09.179> underneath<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.260> bring<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.710> onion

I cut underneath and I bring the onion
towards<00:00:11.849> me<00:00:12.000> because<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:13.049> gap<00:00:13.440> between

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
towards me because of this gap between

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.560 
towards me because of this gap between
the<00:00:14.009> knife<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> board<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.910> want<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.450> be

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.509 
the top and now I come straight down
using<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.869> rocking<00:00:22.410> motion<00:00:22.439> just<00:00:23.039> like<00:00:23.130> that

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
using a rocking motion just like that

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.970 
using a rocking motion just like that
and<00:00:23.930> there<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.109> diced<00:00:25.590> onion<00:00:26.689> our<00:00:27.980> next

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
do is I use a rocking motion again same

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.350 
do is I use a rocking motion again same
technique<00:00:46.860> my<00:00:47.370> knuckles<00:00:47.760> are<00:00:47.850> perpendicular

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
technique my knuckles are perpendicular

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.529 
technique my knuckles are perpendicular
to<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.739> cutting<00:00:49.770> surface<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.820> I'm<00:00:51.210> rocking

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539

control and proper balance of the blade

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.770 
control and proper balance of the blade
and<00:01:01.289> there<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.160> proper<00:01:02.940> julienne<00:01:03.539> which

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
and there we have proper julienne which

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.830 
and there we have proper julienne which
is<00:01:03.870> approximately<00:01:04.140> 18<00:01:04.949> x<00:01:05.159> 18<00:01:05.939> thick<00:01:06.420> by<00:01:06.810> two

our next cut is brune wah which is
finely<00:01:14.490> minced<00:01:15.290> now<00:01:16.290> what<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:16.920> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
finely minced now what you do is you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.830 
finely minced now what you do is you
take<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.340> julienne<00:01:18.000> cut<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
take the julienne cut and it's just a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.410 
take the julienne cut and it's just a
variation<00:01:19.170> from<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.549> take<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
variation from that you just take the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.780 
variation from that you just take the
julienne<00:01:21.810> cut<00:01:22.049> turn<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.610> it's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
julienne cut turn it now so it's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.210
