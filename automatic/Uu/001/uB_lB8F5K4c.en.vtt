00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.910
 and now we will analyze the most efficient 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.930
 the punch will be delicious and show you how you can 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.810
 work out the tax and so when you hit 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.560
 right you were no less dangerous musk 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.369
 can expand training 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.439
 of this thrill she will begin to finish 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.790
 that is, when the blow is almost 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.770
 reached the goal hand stretched a little bit 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.060
 bent valak series quite a bit for 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.700
 so that the minimum should be gone 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.690
 times either the workers' sign is supposedly 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.690
 do that is left to the goal 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.020
 which we should work with a brush 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.020
 to put. 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.130
 finance 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.130
 that is, by 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.259
 virtually no excess mixture on the ledges 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.840
 on it can now right a little under 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.420
 yourself and put in this finish not 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.109
 the position then the foot is already ready for 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.590
 jerk 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:23.340
 that is ready to take a step and charge 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.479
 hit from bullets. that is, the position . 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.689
 fist we go off and stand process on 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.359
 goals moves and find board wife to 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.520
 the middle point where you need to include 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:38.609
 leg and accelerate maximum stiffness and 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.319
 much where it is when finishing and 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:45.749
 now with a jerk of the foot and a conclusion in 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:49.399
 hand-to-market syndrome is a must 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:49.399
 work doing action 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.080
 and of course we can forget that 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.580
 necessarily to the working masses 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.490
 turns back due to the twisting of the back 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:21.000
 and sat down 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:21.959
 finish almost in the process already 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.230
 practically 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.480
 from the villas at a distance initially as 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.270
 running bush himself kept a bunch in front 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.390
 you already get it yourself . 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.580
 nothing foretells trouble for 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.540
 opponents I prick but we know that 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:43.200
 Now go in a straight line without unnecessary angles 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.209
 Immediately goals and rewards you need us. 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.630
 help speed up hitting make it 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:53.850
 maximally we will consider now 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.270
 another version of the direct 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.980
 right 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:01.049
 couscous style first again rights 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.560
 the hand is appreciated by the goal we practically 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:09.480
 fully straighten process up 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.110
 I add weight and mass to shock with 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.440
 shells 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.549
 flooded ahead but did not even fail 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.950
 after getting the truth substitute 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:25.950
 there we purposely falls out 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:33.260
 forward to get against that is 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:48.019
 u kobi ahead and immediately 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:51.840
 Now the goal is otherwise the further 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:57.410
 have it can give long distances 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.410
 can be reduced by tricky
