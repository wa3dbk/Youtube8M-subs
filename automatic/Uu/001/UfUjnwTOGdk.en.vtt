to being run free see the belt is not
there<00:00:13.650> now<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.219> it's<00:00:14.400> been<00:00:14.580> wrapped<00:00:14.820> around

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
there now and it's been wrapped around

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.890 
there now and it's been wrapped around
the<00:00:15.179> crankshaft<00:00:16.880> what<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.000> need<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.330> do<00:00:18.570> is

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the crankshaft what we need to do is

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.349 
the crankshaft what we need to do is
check<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.260> markers<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> crankshaft<00:00:20.359> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
camshaft and the fuel injection pump so

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.359 
camshaft and the fuel injection pump so
let's<00:00:29.609> get<00:00:29.880> rid<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.539> timing<00:00:31.380> belt<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:32.130> is

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
let's get rid of the timing belt this is

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.040 
let's get rid of the timing belt this is
no<00:00:32.520> use<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.880> anybody<00:00:33.090> now<00:00:33.420> look<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.809> stay

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
no use to anybody now look at the stay

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.630 
no use to anybody now look at the stay
of<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.350> shredded<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.460> pieces

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
of that shredded to pieces

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.010 
of that shredded to pieces
we<00:00:38.640> took<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> rocker<00:00:39.090> shaft<00:00:39.329> off<00:00:39.600> because<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
we took the rocker shaft off because the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.750 
we took the rocker shaft off because the
valves<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.280> are<00:00:41.579> actually

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
valves as you can see are actually

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.779 
valves as you can see are actually
protruding<00:00:42.450> into<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> combustion<00:00:43.110> area<00:00:43.789> okay

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
protruding into the combustion area okay

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.540 
protruding into the combustion area okay
with<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.480> lift<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.860> impossible

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
with it can lift on this is impossible

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.209 
with it can lift on this is impossible
turn<00:00:48.030> anything<00:00:48.660> around<00:00:49.079> fully<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.010> we've

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
turn anything around fully so we've

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.700 
turn anything around fully so we've
removed<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.120> I've<00:00:51.719> also<00:00:51.899> removed<00:00:52.469> these

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
removed this and I've also removed these

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.250 
removed this and I've also removed these
four<00:00:53.219> glow<00:00:53.579> plugs<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.270> make<00:00:54.629> sure<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.989> have

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
four glow plugs to make sure that I have

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.939 
four glow plugs to make sure that I have
as<00:00:55.680> least<00:00:56.010> resistance<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.730> possible<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> we're

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
as least resistance as possible so we're

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.520 
as least resistance as possible so we're
looking<00:00:59.219> at<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> camshaft<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.320> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.440> see

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.370 
rely on finding a slot on the flywheel
here<00:04:17.160> because<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.030> won't<00:04:18.209> work

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
here because it won't work

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.530 
here because it won't work
okay<00:04:19.650> now<00:04:20.550> let's<00:04:20.850> turn<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.150> engine<00:04:21.360> back

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
okay now let's turn the engine back

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.930 
okay now let's turn the engine back
round<00:04:21.750> again<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.230> know<00:04:22.530> it's<00:04:23.190> difficult

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
round again I know it's difficult

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.690 
round again I know it's difficult
because<00:04:24.390> you'll<00:04:24.690> have<00:04:24.810> this<00:04:24.870> in<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.110> vehicle

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
because you'll have this in the vehicle

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.910 
because you'll have this in the vehicle
however<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:27.450> way<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:28.200> can<00:04:28.380> see<00:04:28.590> exactly

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
however this way you can see exactly

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.890 
however this way you can see exactly
what's<00:04:29.220> going<00:04:29.490> on<00:04:29.760> all<00:04:30.120> right<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:30.630> all<00:04:30.660> the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
what's going on all right so all the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.870 
what's going on all right so all the
pulleys<00:04:31.170> are<00:04:31.320> set<00:04:31.500> now<00:04:31.710> you<00:04:32.190> can<00:04:32.340> see<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.640> the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
pulleys are set now you can see that the

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.300 
pulleys are set now you can see that the
markers<00:04:33.270> here<00:04:33.450> this<00:04:34.200> is<00:04:34.380> Boyan<00:04:34.620> once<00:04:35.190> you've

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
markers here this is Boyan once you've

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.900 
markers here this is Boyan once you've
got<00:04:35.490> this<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.790> can<00:04:35.910> put<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.150> timing<00:04:36.510> belt<00:04:36.660> on
