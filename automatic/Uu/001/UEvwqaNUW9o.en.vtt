quite a bit of speed so doing things

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.790 
quite a bit of speed so doing things

steering lightly to stay in the middle
of<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.300> spiral<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.410> basically<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.070> spiral<00:00:53.699> is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
of the spiral so basically the spiral is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.180 
of the spiral so basically the spiral is
the<00:00:54.030> only<00:00:54.270> thing<00:00:54.750> really<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.530> map<00:00:55.770> worth

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the only thing really on this map worth

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.880 
the only thing really on this map worth
checking<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.149> now<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> don't<00:00:57.899> understand<00:00:58.680> why

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
checking out now I don't understand why

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.170 
checking out now I don't understand why
there's<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> couple<00:00:59.370> other<00:00:59.579> maps<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.120> are

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
there's a couple other maps that are

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.119 
there's a couple other maps that are
similar<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.899> why<00:01:01.289> do<00:01:01.350> all<00:01:01.710> these<00:01:01.890> type<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
similar to this why do all these type of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.119 
similar to this why do all these type of
maps<00:01:02.460> only<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:04.170> cool<00:01:04.559> thing<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
maps only have one really cool thing and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.980 
maps only have one really cool thing and
then<00:01:05.339> they<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:05.909> anything<00:01:06.390> else<00:01:06.780> on

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
then they don't have anything else on

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050 
then they don't have anything else on
the<00:01:07.140> entire<00:01:07.470> map<00:01:07.710> besides<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.340> checkpoint<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the entire map besides just checkpoint I

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.250 
the entire map besides just checkpoint I
wish<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.360> would<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.479> no<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.900> throw<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
wish there would be no just throw in a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.960 
wish there would be no just throw in a
few<00:01:10.439> jumps<00:01:10.770> here<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.250> there<00:01:11.369> something<00:01:11.790> like

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
few jumps here and there something like

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.789 
few jumps here and there something like
that<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.450> besides<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.290> know<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.590> map

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
that but besides that you know this map

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.249 
that but besides that you know this map
is<00:01:13.830> unbelievable<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> lot<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.869> fun<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.140> go

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
is unbelievable it's a lot of fun to go

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.800 
is unbelievable it's a lot of fun to go
on<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> spiral<00:01:16.979> my<00:01:17.790> suggestion<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.659> course

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
on the spiral my suggestion is of course

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.390 
on the spiral my suggestion is of course
you<00:01:18.990> got<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.200> follow<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.500> race<00:01:19.650> lines<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you got to follow the race lines of the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.359 
you got to follow the race lines of the
red<00:01:21.000> tanks<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:22.500> suggestion<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.100> whenever

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
red tanks but my suggestion is whenever

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.550 
red tanks but my suggestion is whenever
you're<00:01:23.610> first<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> spiral<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
you're first going up the spiral you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.320 
you're first going up the spiral you
know<00:01:25.680> kind<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.009> tap<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> right<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.299> little

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
know kind of tap to the right a little

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.810 
know kind of tap to the right a little
bit<00:01:27.659> because<00:01:28.350> you'll<00:01:28.619> drift<00:01:28.979> more<00:01:29.340> off<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
bit because you'll drift more off to the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.219 
bit because you'll drift more off to the
left<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.390> once<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.780> start<00:01:31.079> going

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
left and then once you start going

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.679 
left and then once you start going
upside<00:01:31.770> down<00:01:32.009> then<00:01:32.610> tap<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> left<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
upside down then tap to the left a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.240 
upside down then tap to the left a
little<00:01:33.869> bit<00:01:34.049> because<00:01:34.200> you'll<00:01:34.530> kind<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> go<00:01:35.009> off

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
little bit because you'll kind of go off

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.859 
little bit because you'll kind of go off
to<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> right<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.329> little<00:01:36.479> bit<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.780> a

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
to the right so it's a little bit of a

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.539 
to the right so it's a little bit of a
tricky<00:01:37.170> thing<00:01:37.259> there<00:01:37.770> you're<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.400> have

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
