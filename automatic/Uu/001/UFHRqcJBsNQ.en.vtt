overview this week I got serious about

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.200 
overview this week I got serious about
setting<00:00:07.830> up<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.040> schedule<00:00:08.250> for<00:00:08.460> myself<00:00:09.030> and

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
setting up a schedule for myself and

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.509 
setting up a schedule for myself and
sticking<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.750> it<00:00:09.900> trying<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.800> get<00:00:10.920> as<00:00:11.070> many<00:00:11.219> art

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
sticking to it trying to get as many art

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.990 
sticking to it trying to get as many art
assets<00:00:11.969> done<00:00:12.210> as<00:00:12.420> possible<00:00:13.670> so<00:00:14.670> far<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
assets done as possible so far the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.450 
assets done as possible so far the
results<00:00:15.150> are<00:00:15.480> pretty<00:00:15.570> good<00:00:15.839> I'm<00:00:16.830> able<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.160> do

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
results are pretty good I'm able to do

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.710 
results are pretty good I'm able to do
about<00:00:17.760> two<00:00:18.600> models<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.410> day<00:00:19.590> although<00:00:20.600> some<00:00:21.600> of

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
about two models a day although some of

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.359 
about two models a day although some of
these<00:00:21.840> models<00:00:22.199> are<00:00:22.289> pretty<00:00:22.500> simple<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:26.189> new

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
these models are pretty simple the new

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.429 
these models are pretty simple the new
models<00:00:26.730> are<00:00:27.029> two<00:00:27.269> more<00:00:27.510> fractured<00:00:28.050> pillars

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
models are two more fractured pillars

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.519 
models are two more fractured pillars
for<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> hex<00:00:28.949> creep<00:00:29.189> set<00:00:29.720> one<00:00:30.720> debris<00:00:31.140> model

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
for the hex creep set one debris model

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.180 
for the hex creep set one debris model
and<00:00:31.740> two<00:00:32.399> decals<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.290> think<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.530> Browns<00:00:34.920> this

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and two decals I think that Browns this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.709 
and two decals I think that Browns this
set<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.520> nicely<00:00:37.969> here's<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.059> better<00:00:39.270> look<00:00:39.360> at

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
set out nicely here's a better look at

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:56.260 
set out nicely here's a better look at
all<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.410> assets<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.219> set

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.230 

now<00:00:56.870> that<00:00:57.200> I<00:00:57.230> figured<00:00:57.650> out<00:00:57.830> how<00:00:58.700> to<00:00:58.760> make<00:00:59.000> all

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
now that I figured out how to make all

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.990 
now that I figured out how to make all
of<00:00:59.270> the<00:00:59.510> assets<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.170> way<00:01:00.320> that<00:01:00.500> I<00:01:00.530> want<00:01:00.770> them

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
of the assets the way that I want them

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.670 
of the assets the way that I want them
it's<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.150> lot<00:01:02.270> easier<00:01:02.330> to<00:01:02.840> set<00:01:03.020> a<00:01:03.050> schedule<00:01:03.290> and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
it's a lot easier to set a schedule and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.830 
it's a lot easier to set a schedule and
keep<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.250> it<00:01:04.699> wasn't<00:01:05.059> practical<00:01:05.480> before

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
keep to it it wasn't practical before

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.720 
keep to it it wasn't practical before
because<00:01:06.140> I<00:01:06.380> kept<00:01:06.590> running<00:01:06.740> into<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:07.430> lot<00:01:07.670> of

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
because I kept running into a lot of

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.270 
because I kept running into a lot of
technical<00:01:08.090> problems<00:01:08.660> that<00:01:09.380> I<00:01:09.680> had<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.070> try<00:01:10.220> to

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
technical problems that I had to try to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:22.820 
technical problems that I had to try to
figure<00:01:10.490> out

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.220 

since<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.700> finished<00:01:23.760> the<00:01:24.150> hex<00:01:24.360> Crete<00:01:24.690> set<00:01:25.020> I

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
since I finished the hex Crete set I

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.530 
since I finished the hex Crete set I
started<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.340> new<00:01:26.400> set<00:01:28.460> this<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.700> sphere

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
started on a new set this is sphere

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.850 
started on a new set this is sphere
creek<00:01:31.160> so<00:01:32.160> this<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.730> the<00:01:32.880> new<00:01:33.240> set<00:01:33.480> I<00:01:33.860> started

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
creek so this is the new set I started

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.800 
creek so this is the new set I started
experimenting<00:01:35.190> with<00:01:35.580> some<00:01:35.910> new<00:01:36.060> materials<00:01:36.600> on

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
experimenting with some new materials on

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.110 
experimenting with some new materials on
these<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.290> don't<00:01:38.250> think<00:01:38.310> they're<00:01:38.640> totally

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
these I don't think they're totally

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.910 
these I don't think they're totally
finished<00:01:39.330> but<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.930> kind<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.350> how<00:01:40.530> they're

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
finished but I kind of like how they're

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:52.660 
finished but I kind of like how they're
looking<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.430> far

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.820 

one<00:01:53.270> thing<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:53.600> like<00:01:53.750> about<00:01:53.780> this<00:01:54.049> set<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.650> that

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
one thing I like about this set is that

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.350 
one thing I like about this set is that
they're<00:01:55.159> a<00:01:55.189> little<00:01:55.369> bit<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:55.790> challenge<00:01:56.030> to

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
they're a little bit of a challenge to

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.890 
they're a little bit of a challenge to
platform<00:01:56.840> on<00:01:58.180> next<00:01:59.180> week<00:01:59.330> I'm<00:01:59.509> going<00:01:59.689> to

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
platform on next week I'm going to

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.260 
platform on next week I'm going to
continue<00:02:00.200> working<00:02:00.560> on<00:02:00.799> this<00:02:00.979> set<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.399> I'm

also going to start concept work on a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.240 
also going to start concept work on a
new<00:02:05.210> building<00:02:05.780> asset<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.380> should<00:02:06.979> be<00:02:07.100> pretty

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
new building asset that should be pretty
