00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.719 
forward to the day in the week now and
the<00:02:07.110> question<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.740> moment<00:02:07.890> would<00:02:08.429> Indy

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the question of the moment would Indy

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.460 
the question of the moment would Indy
car<00:02:08.910> experience<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.780> any<00:02:10.020> value<00:02:10.200> in

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
car experience be of any value in

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.010 
car experience be of any value in
Formula<00:02:10.830> One

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
Formula One

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.070 
Formula One
I<00:02:12.850> think<00:02:13.850> in<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.060> car<00:02:14.240> racing<00:02:14.750> what<00:02:14.960> you've

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
I think in the car racing what you've

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.780 
I think in the car racing what you've
got<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.260> appreciate<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.890> last<00:02:16.100> two<00:02:16.310> years<00:02:16.520> is

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
got to appreciate the last two years is

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.870 
got to appreciate the last two years is
I've<00:02:16.940> driven<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.330> passive<00:02:17.750> car<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.880> so

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
I've driven a passive car and so

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.640 
I've driven a passive car and so
therefore<00:02:20.390> with<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.870> new<00:02:21.020> regulation

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
therefore with the new regulation

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.520 
therefore with the new regulation
changes<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.280> there<00:02:22.400> are<00:02:22.520> in<00:02:22.670> Formula<00:02:23.090> one

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
changes that there are in Formula one

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.150 
changes that there are in Formula one
hopefully<00:02:24.530> there'll<00:02:24.770> be<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.890> lot<00:02:25.070> of

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
hopefully there'll be a lot of

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.120 
hopefully there'll be a lot of
similarities<00:02:26.350> but<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.500> remains<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.980> be<00:02:28.010> seen

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
similarities but it remains to be seen

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.850
