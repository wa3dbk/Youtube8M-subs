if you think about it this could make

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
if you think about it this could make

the entire game formable while still

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.929 
the entire game formable while still
making<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.350> lot<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> player<00:01:26.040> choices<00:01:26.610> quite

important you're not going to be able to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.130 
important you're not going to be able to
just<00:01:28.950> swap<00:01:29.460> skills<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.420> fly<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.900> the

time because you'll be losing that buff

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.120 
time because you'll be losing that buff
and<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.570> my<00:01:33.750> opinion<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.259> buff<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.560> incredibly

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
and in my opinion the buff is incredibly

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.530 
and in my opinion the buff is incredibly
essential<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.790> you're<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.150> farming

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
with a unique color and the answer to

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.449 
with a unique color and the answer to
that<00:04:11.019> was<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.530> no<00:04:11.709> they<00:04:11.920> don't<00:04:12.160> have<00:04:12.310> any

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
that was that no they don't have any

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.190 
that was that no they don't have any
particle<00:04:12.850> effects<00:04:13.090> for<00:04:13.510> now<00:04:13.690> they<00:04:13.959> can

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
particle effects for now they can

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.750 
particle effects for now they can
technically<00:04:14.650> only<00:04:14.859> be<00:04:15.100> single<00:04:15.519> color

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
technically only be single color

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.330 
technically only be single color
gradients<00:04:16.539> and<00:04:16.690> yes<00:04:17.289> as<00:04:17.500> you<00:04:17.620> can<00:04:17.830> see<00:04:18.099> and

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
gradients and yes as you can see and

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.819 
gradients and yes as you can see and
hear<00:04:18.370> there<00:04:18.789> are<00:04:18.820> tons<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.269> questions

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
hear there are tons of questions

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.710 
hear there are tons of questions
and<00:04:19.919> answers<00:04:20.340> about<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.789> game's<00:04:20.970> cosmetics

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
and answers about the game's cosmetics

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.839

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
so if you that aren't cosmetic related

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.369 
so if you that aren't cosmetic related
Blizzard<00:04:24.270> say<00:04:24.419> that<00:04:24.569> they<00:04:24.689> do<00:04:24.750> have<00:04:25.020> feats<00:04:25.259> of
