so<00:00:19.820> Lindsay<00:00:20.270> air<00:00:20.480> compressor<00:00:20.990> in<00:00:21.650> is<00:00:21.800> based

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
so Lindsay air compressor in is based

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.440 
so Lindsay air compressor in is based
off<00:00:22.280> the<00:00:22.310> Merkel<00:00:22.850> motor<00:00:23.090> wheel<00:00:23.920> it<00:00:25.360> uses<00:00:26.360> the

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
off the Merkel motor wheel it uses the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.690 
off the Merkel motor wheel it uses the
cylinder<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.440> piston<00:00:27.470> not<00:00:28.220> sure<00:00:28.400> about<00:00:28.490> the

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
cylinder the piston not sure about the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.260 
cylinder the piston not sure about the
rod<00:00:29.020> and<00:00:30.020> the<00:00:30.110> carburetor<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.970> exhaust

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
rod and the carburetor the exhaust

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:44.489 
rod and the carburetor the exhaust
system<00:00:39.399> this<00:00:40.399> is<00:00:40.609> the<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.300> engine<00:00:41.480> side<00:00:41.899> here

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.499 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:48.549 

and<00:00:45.499> this<00:00:45.890> is<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.249> compressor<00:00:46.760> side<00:00:47.559> you

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
and this is the compressor side you

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.079 
and this is the compressor side you
notice<00:00:48.739> it's<00:00:49.960> mechanically<00:00:50.960> operated<00:00:51.940> off<00:00:52.940> a

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
notice it's mechanically operated off a

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.250 
notice it's mechanically operated off a
cam<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.870> compressor<00:00:54.379> when<00:00:54.530> it<00:00:54.620> reaches<00:00:54.890> up<00:00:55.039> to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
cam the compressor when it reaches up to

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.619 
cam the compressor when it reaches up to
pressure<00:00:57.670> there's<00:00:58.670> an<00:00:58.760> unloader<00:00:59.120> valve<00:00:59.239> that

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
pressure there's an unloader valve that

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.020 
pressure there's an unloader valve that
deactivates<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.710> push<00:01:01.219> rod<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:03.940> stops<00:01:04.940> the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
deactivates the push rod and stops the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.070 
deactivates the push rod and stops the
pumping<00:01:05.330> air<00:01:06.520> this<00:01:07.520> is<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.760> nice<00:01:08.330> portable<00:01:08.630> unit

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
pumping air this is a nice portable unit

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:17.109 
pumping air this is a nice portable unit
it's<00:01:09.710> got<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:10.540> place<00:01:12.700> fold-in<00:01:13.700> handle<00:01:16.119> taking

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
it's got a place fold-in handle taking

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:28.419 
it's got a place fold-in handle taking
it<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:17.479> out<00:01:17.570> of<00:01:17.630> your<00:01:17.689> garage

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.190 

it's<00:01:29.429> an<00:01:29.520> air-cooled<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.149> fan<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.780> you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
it's an air-cooled as a fan there you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.319 
it's an air-cooled as a fan there you
can<00:01:31.350> see<00:01:35.359> and<00:01:36.359> this<00:01:36.509> would<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.969> fan<00:01:38.969> turn

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
can see and this would be the fan turn

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.160 
can see and this would be the fan turn
and<00:01:41.329> change<00:01:42.329> River<00:01:42.569> mag<00:01:44.780> you<00:01:45.780> wondered<00:01:46.079> about

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and change River mag you wondered about

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.359 
and change River mag you wondered about
that<00:01:46.500> chain<00:01:46.799> there<00:01:47.509> long<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> fan<00:01:48.869> shift

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
that chain there long the fan shift

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.719 
that chain there long the fan shift
that's<00:01:50.369> uh<00:01:51.740> kind<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.890> interesting<00:01:53.459> it's<00:01:53.640> uh

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
that's uh kind of interesting it's uh

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.349 
that's uh kind of interesting it's uh
that's<00:01:54.179> actually<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> governor<00:01:56.240> when<00:01:57.240> that

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
that's actually the governor when that

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.469 
that's actually the governor when that
rotates<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.109> speed<00:01:58.909> that<00:01:59.909> chain<00:02:00.209> will<00:02:00.329> come

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
rotates up to speed that chain will come

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.979 
rotates up to speed that chain will come
out<00:02:01.130> swinging<00:02:02.130> out<00:02:02.420> now<00:02:03.420> they<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:05.929> see<00:02:06.929> if

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:06.989 
out swinging out now they just see if

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:13.759 
out swinging out now they just see if
the<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.819> throttle<00:02:12.209> linkage<00:02:12.299> here<00:02:12.780> that

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
the the throttle linkage here that

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:24.800 
the the throttle linkage here that
allows<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:16.190> throttle<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.280> close<00:02:19.340> oh<00:02:23.810> there's

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
allows the throttle to close oh there's

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.550 
allows the throttle to close oh there's
the<00:02:24.900> oil<00:02:25.110> fill<00:02:25.379> for<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.620> compressor<00:02:27.410> does<00:02:28.410> he

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
the oil fill for the compressor does he

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.849 
the oil fill for the compressor does he
check<00:02:28.829> your<00:02:29.040> oil<00:02:29.599> level<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:33.260> starter
