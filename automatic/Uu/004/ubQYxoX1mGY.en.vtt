called tag collector confirms weren't
the<00:00:19.320> only<00:00:19.350> good<00:00:19.619> things<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.010> came<00:00:20.279> from

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
the only good things that came from

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.730 
the only good things that came from
modern<00:00:20.880> warfare<00:00:21.029> 3<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:22.199> very<00:00:22.439> similar<00:00:22.619> to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
modern warfare 3 it's very similar to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.259 
modern warfare 3 it's very similar to
team<00:00:23.010> deathmatch<00:00:23.250> with<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> added<00:00:24.000> twist

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
team deathmatch with the added twist

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.490 
team deathmatch with the added twist
they've<00:00:24.539> actually<00:00:24.720> got<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> collect<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
they've actually got to collect the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.439 
they've actually got to collect the
enemy's<00:00:25.830> dog<00:00:26.010> tags<00:00:26.310> which<00:00:26.910> works<00:00:27.150> pretty<00:00:27.330> well

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
enemy's dog tags which works pretty well

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.720 
enemy's dog tags which works pretty well
in<00:00:27.720> minimizing<00:00:28.080> camping<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.220> gets<00:00:29.400> everyone

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
in minimizing camping and gets everyone

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.240 
in minimizing camping and gets everyone
actually<00:00:29.880> moving<00:00:30.420> around<00:00:30.769> so<00:00:31.769> moving<00:00:32.070> around

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
actually moving around so moving around

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.979 
actually moving around so moving around
is<00:00:32.430> obviously<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> key<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.270> winning<00:00:33.540> goes<00:00:33.780> to

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
is obviously a key to winning goes to

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.110 
is obviously a key to winning goes to
confirm<00:00:34.380> games<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> setup<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.880> gonna<00:00:36.030> be

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
confirm games so the setup is gonna be

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.569 
confirm games so the setup is gonna be
based<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.600> agility<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.320> maneuverability

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
based on agility and maneuverability

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.799 
based on agility and maneuverability
you<00:00:38.700> know<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:38.940> helping<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.270> take<00:00:39.480> down<00:00:39.660> your

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
you know it's helping you take down your

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.690 
you know it's helping you take down your
enemies<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.379> secure<00:00:40.800> those<00:00:41.010> tanks<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> win

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
enemies and secure those tanks to win

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.970 
enemies and secure those tanks to win
the<00:00:41.820> game<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.329> let's<00:00:43.140> get<00:00:43.260> started<00:00:43.680> take<00:00:43.920> a

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the game so let's get started take a

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.260 
the game so let's get started take a
look<00:00:44.219> at<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> weapon<00:00:44.700> sets<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.030> we're<00:00:45.180> gonna

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
look at the weapon sets that we're gonna

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.900 
look at the weapon sets that we're gonna
use<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.539> our<00:00:45.809> tag<00:00:46.110> collect<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.590> loadout<00:00:46.980> we're

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
use for our tag collect to loadout we're

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.310 
use for our tag collect to loadout we're
gonna<00:00:48.000> want<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> weapon<00:00:48.450> class<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.050> grants

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
gonna want the weapon class that grants

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.270 
gonna want the weapon class that grants
us<00:00:49.469> full<00:00:49.649> mobility

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
us full mobility

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950 
us full mobility
so<00:00:50.760> other<00:00:50.910> than<00:00:51.000> secondary<00:00:51.480> weapons<00:00:51.840> that

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
so other than secondary weapons that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.540 
so other than secondary weapons that
leaves<00:00:52.230> either<00:00:52.500> submachine<00:00:53.129> guns<00:00:53.340> or<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
leaves either submachine guns or the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.760 
leaves either submachine guns or the
shotguns<00:00:53.969> no<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.110> submachine<00:00:55.530> guns

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
shotguns no the to the submachine guns

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.220 
shotguns no the to the submachine guns
are<00:00:55.890> definitely<00:00:56.190> more<00:00:56.309> reliable<00:00:56.850> oh<00:00:57.230> this

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
are definitely more reliable oh this

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.389 
are definitely more reliable oh this
with<00:00:58.379> machine<00:00:58.590> gun<00:00:58.770> class<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.129> could<00:00:59.219> really

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
with machine gun class you could really

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.279 
with machine gun class you could really
get<00:00:59.579> away<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.940> using<00:01:00.090> any<00:01:00.390> weapon<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.199> I'm

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
get away with using any weapon but I'm

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.569 
get away with using any weapon but I'm
going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.500> narrow<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.890> down<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.309> two

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
going to narrow it down to the two

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.450 
going to narrow it down to the two
heavyweights<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.420> tvw<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> MSMC<00:01:04.979> both

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
heavyweights the tvw and the MSMC both

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.310 
heavyweights the tvw and the MSMC both
of<00:01:05.610> which<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.970> achieve<00:01:06.270> three<00:01:06.600> shot<00:01:06.810> kills<00:01:07.110> at

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
of which can achieve three shot kills at

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.260 
of which can achieve three shot kills at
close<00:01:07.350> range<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:08.130> opposed<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> usual<00:01:08.970> four

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.830 
rate weapons both the PDW on the MSMC
both<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.700> their<00:01:14.850> advantages<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.659> I'm<00:01:15.750> gonna

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
both have their advantages but I'm gonna
