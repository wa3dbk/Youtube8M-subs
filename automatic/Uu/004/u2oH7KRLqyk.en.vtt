here<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.690> see<00:03:33.810> what<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:33.989> can<00:03:34.049> do<00:03:34.290> they<00:03:34.440> were

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
here and see what I can do they were

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.070 
here and see what I can do they were
they<00:03:34.769> did<00:03:34.950> do<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.130> fullback<00:03:35.580> fullback<00:03:36.360> run<00:03:36.930> and

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
they did do a fullback fullback run and

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.900 
they did do a fullback fullback run and
play<00:03:37.110> though<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:37.950> if<00:03:38.070> they<00:03:38.190> had<00:03:38.430> gone<00:03:38.640> for<00:03:38.880> a

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
play though so if they had gone for a

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.979 
play though so if they had gone for a
play-action<00:03:39.090> I'm<00:03:39.450> sure<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.750> could<00:03:39.840> have

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
play-action I'm sure it could have

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.020

gotten<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.320> sack<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.400> backfield<00:03:41.580> by<00:03:41.880> new

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
gotten that sack in the backfield by new

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
ideal and now on fourth down and a call

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.390 
ideal and now on fourth down and a call
another<00:03:49.320> timeout<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.799> we<00:03:49.860> do<00:03:50.010> it'll<00:03:50.250> get<00:03:50.340> in

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400

defense<00:06:29.759> which<00:06:30.030> is<00:06:30.180> you<00:06:30.539> know<00:06:30.630> looking<00:06:30.930> like

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
defense which is you know looking like

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.570 
defense which is you know looking like
it's<00:06:31.259> gonna<00:06:31.320> be<00:06:31.469> very<00:06:31.500> possible<00:06:32.099> saying<00:06:32.340> as<00:06:32.430> my

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
it's gonna be very possible saying as my

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.740 
it's gonna be very possible saying as my
defense<00:06:32.909> has<00:06:33.030> played<00:06:33.210> really<00:06:33.360> good<00:06:33.570> this

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
defense has played really good this

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.930 
defense has played really good this
whole<00:06:33.900> game<00:06:34.159> so<00:06:35.159> they<00:06:35.250> have<00:06:35.339> a<00:06:35.370> minute<00:06:35.669> left<00:06:35.849> to

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
whole game so they have a minute left to

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.390 
whole game so they have a minute left to
score<00:06:36.449> with<00:06:36.990> only<00:06:37.139> one<00:06:37.349> score<00:06:37.919> three<00:06:38.130> times

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
score with only one score three times

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.010 
score with only one score three times
and<00:06:38.729> they<00:06:38.789> only<00:06:38.909> have<00:06:39.060> one<00:06:39.240> timeout<00:06:39.270> so

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
and they only have one timeout so

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.330 
and they only have one timeout so
it<00:06:40.440> doesn't<00:06:40.710> look<00:06:40.770> like<00:06:40.889> that's<00:06:41.069> gonna<00:06:41.280> be

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
it doesn't look like that's gonna be

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.430 
it doesn't look like that's gonna be
possible<00:06:41.430> especially<00:06:42.389> with<00:06:42.780> my<00:06:42.870> good<00:06:43.050> defense

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
possible especially with my good defense

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.830 
possible especially with my good defense
here<00:06:43.530> so<00:06:44.129> now<00:06:44.250> I'm<00:06:44.400> third<00:06:44.580> down<00:06:44.759> guys<00:06:45.030> I<00:06:45.360> just

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
here so now I'm third down guys I just

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.689 
here so now I'm third down guys I just
need<00:06:46.020> to<00:06:46.229> I'm<00:06:46.800> gonna<00:06:46.979> use<00:06:47.160> a<00:06:47.190> Jack<00:06:47.520> Lambert

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 
need to I'm gonna use a Jack Lambert

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.550 
need to I'm gonna use a Jack Lambert
here<00:06:48.120> use<00:06:48.449> in<00:06:48.599> the<00:06:48.690> middle<00:06:48.930> real<00:06:49.080> quick<00:06:49.289> and

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
here use in the middle real quick and

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.369 
here use in the middle real quick and
hopefully<00:06:50.009> stop<00:06:50.789> him<00:06:51.030> and<00:06:51.270> I<00:06:51.659> do<00:06:51.720> end<00:06:52.199> up

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:52.379 
hopefully stop him and I do end up

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:53.839 
hopefully stop him and I do end up
deflecting<00:06:52.919> this<00:06:53.039> ball<00:06:53.250> but<00:06:53.400> I<00:06:53.460> really<00:06:53.789> should

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849 
deflecting this ball but I really should

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:56.149 
deflecting this ball but I really should
have<00:06:54.060> been<00:06:54.150> an<00:06:54.270> interception<00:06:54.720> and<00:06:55.080> what<00:06:56.069> I'm

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:56.159 
have been an interception and what I'm

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:57.860 
have been an interception and what I'm
thinking<00:06:56.220> is<00:06:56.669> if<00:06:56.819> he<00:06:56.940> had<00:06:57.060> caught<00:06:57.360> that<00:06:57.389> ball<00:06:57.810> I

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
thinking is if he had caught that ball I

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.779 
thinking is if he had caught that ball I
probably<00:06:58.199> would<00:06:58.379> have<00:06:58.409> been<00:06:58.530> a<00:06:58.590> pick<00:06:58.800> six<00:06:59.099> but

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
probably would have been a pick six but

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:01.369 
probably would have been a pick six but
now<00:06:59.819> I'm<00:07:00.000> on<00:07:00.300> fourth<00:07:00.539> down<00:07:00.629> guys<00:07:00.930> report<00:07:01.259> that

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:01.379 
now I'm on fourth down guys report that

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.559 
now I'm on fourth down guys report that
forced<00:07:01.770> to<00:07:01.860> go<00:07:01.979> for<00:07:02.250> it<00:07:02.340> and<00:07:02.490> I<00:07:03.120> kind<00:07:03.330> of<00:07:03.389> failed

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.569 
forced to go for it and I kind of failed

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:06.260 
forced to go for it and I kind of failed
that<00:07:03.720> user-pic<00:07:04.530> but<00:07:04.919> we<00:07:05.610> do<00:07:05.759> end<00:07:05.970> up<00:07:06.030> stopping

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
that user-pic but we do end up stopping

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.790 
that user-pic but we do end up stopping
them<00:07:06.569> before<00:07:06.840> the<00:07:06.930> liner<00:07:07.080> before<00:07:07.349> the<00:07:07.590> first

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
them before the liner before the first

them before the liner before the first
down<00:07:07.979> line<00:07:08.220> so<00:07:08.789> we<00:07:09.030> are<00:07:09.150> able<00:07:09.389> to<00:07:09.690> Neil<00:07:10.139> the

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:10.259 
down line so we are able to Neil the

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:11.540 
down line so we are able to Neil the
ball<00:07:10.440> and<00:07:10.680> that'll<00:07:10.889> take<00:07:11.039> us<00:07:11.159> to<00:07:11.220> the<00:07:11.370> end<00:07:11.490> of
