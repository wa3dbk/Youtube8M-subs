probably<00:03:03.340> quickly<00:03:03.670> than<00:03:03.820> I<00:03:03.910> thought<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.510> also

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.900 
some of the younger younger guys have
stepped<00:03:07.900> up<00:03:08.080> pretty<00:03:08.980> well<00:03:09.040> in<00:03:09.430> those<00:03:09.670> last

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
stepped up pretty well in those last

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.970 
stepped up pretty well in those last
couple<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.300> games<00:03:10.360> but<00:03:11.200> obviously<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:11.770> is<00:03:11.950> a

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
couple of games but obviously this is a

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.460 
couple of games but obviously this is a
new<00:03:12.190> level<00:03:12.670> new<00:03:12.970> step<00:03:13.270> up<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.720> we'll<00:03:14.140> see<00:03:14.350> how

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
new level new step up and we'll see how

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.220 
new level new step up and we'll see how
we<00:03:14.530> go<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:15.120> guess<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.570> New<00:03:16.720> Zealand's<00:03:17.080> case

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.680 
we go I guess in New Zealand's case
there<00:03:17.500> are<00:03:17.680> you<00:03:18.310> know<00:03:18.430> several<00:03:19.240> turning
