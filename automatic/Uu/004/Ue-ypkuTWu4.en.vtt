kind of when I wear it I feel like my

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.949 
kind of when I wear it I feel like my
eyelashes<00:03:44.760> look<00:03:44.850> very<00:03:45.090> natural<00:03:45.269> but<00:03:45.810> they're

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
eyelashes look very natural but they're

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.720 
eyelashes look very natural but they're
still<00:03:46.079> awake<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:47.340> know<00:03:47.459> there's<00:03:47.639> still

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
still awake you know there's still

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.420 
still awake you know there's still
curled<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.540> they<00:03:48.750> look<00:03:48.989> nice<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:49.769> like<00:03:50.190> it

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
curled and they look nice so I like it

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.910 
curled and they look nice so I like it
but<00:03:51.150> if<00:03:51.329> it<00:03:51.450> came<00:03:51.660> time<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:51.959> repurchase<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.739> i

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
but if it came time to repurchase it i

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.289 
but if it came time to repurchase it i
think<00:03:52.980> i<00:03:53.220> would<00:03:53.280> just<00:03:53.489> stick<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.850> my<00:03:54.000> covergirl

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
think i would just stick to my covergirl

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.449 
think i would just stick to my covergirl
LashBlast<00:03:55.049> volume<00:03:55.530> because<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:55.950> gives<00:03:56.250> me

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
LashBlast volume because it gives me

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.670 
LashBlast volume because it gives me

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
like it works you know and then we have

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.870 
like it works you know and then we have
the<00:04:03.239> Ulta<00:04:03.750> amped<00:04:04.440> lashes<00:04:04.920> volume<00:04:05.250> mascara<00:04:05.400> and

really<00:04:09.180> intense<00:04:09.810> black<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.709> think<00:04:10.950> this<00:04:11.069> is

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
really intense black and I think this is

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.290 
just wear whatever mascara I'm wearing
and<00:04:25.349> then<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.530> top<00:04:26.039> it<00:04:26.070> off<00:04:26.340> with<00:04:26.520> this<00:04:26.789> and

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
and then I top it off with this and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.909 
and then I top it off with this and
it<00:04:27.389> just<00:04:27.599> makes<00:04:27.840> him<00:04:28.110> really<00:04:28.379> intense<00:04:28.800> and

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
it just makes him really intense and

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.879 
it just makes him really intense and
black<00:04:29.159> and<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.879> does<00:04:30.060> add<00:04:30.270> fullness<00:04:30.569> um<00:04:31.110> I

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
black and it does add fullness um I

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.649 
black and it does add fullness um I
don't<00:04:32.159> really<00:04:32.460> like<00:04:32.789> to<00:04:32.940> use<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.210> on<00:04:33.300> its<00:04:33.449> own

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
don't really like to use it on its own

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.480 
don't really like to use it on its own
because<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:34.020> doesn't<00:04:34.319> hold<00:04:34.560> my<00:04:34.800> curl<00:04:35.099> as<00:04:35.280> well

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
because it doesn't hold my curl as well

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.790

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
has little fibers in it but honestly

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.670 
has little fibers in it but honestly
like<00:04:51.509> I<00:04:51.690> can't<00:04:51.960> really<00:04:52.020> notice<00:04:52.379> the

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
like I can't really notice the
