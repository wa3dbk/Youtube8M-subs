right further to the video I made on
putting<00:00:13.740> two-stroke<00:00:14.190> oil<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
putting two-stroke oil in with the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.240 
putting two-stroke oil in with the
diesel<00:00:18.080> there's<00:00:19.080> been<00:00:19.380> nouns<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.830> comments

diesel there's been nouns and comments
on<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.789> video<00:00:21.980> that's<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.460> should<00:00:23.640> point

on that video that's what I should point
a<00:00:24.510> few<00:00:24.660> things<00:00:24.720> out<00:00:25.140> because<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.449> don't<00:00:27.449> want

a few things out because I don't want
anyone<00:00:27.720> putting<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> wrong<00:00:28.289> stuff<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:29.000> now<00:00:30.000> it

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
anyone putting the wrong stuff in now it

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.840 
anyone putting the wrong stuff in now it
has<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:33.530> where's<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.620> sounded<00:00:35.070> has<00:00:35.670> to

has to be and where's it sounded has to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.500 
has to be and where's it sounded has to
be<00:00:35.969> low<00:00:36.180> ash<00:00:37.700> these<00:00:38.700> are<00:00:38.820> stuff<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.239> me<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
be low ash these are stuff for me that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.990 
be low ash these are stuff for me that
matter<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.200> has<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.500> low<00:00:41.190> ash<00:00:41.750> um<00:00:44.000> if

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
matter but it has to be low ash um if

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.900 
matter but it has to be low ash um if
you<00:00:45.120> ain't<00:00:45.270> low<00:00:45.450> ash<00:00:45.980> look<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> more<00:00:47.760> ash

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you ain't low ash look at the more ash

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.860 
you ain't low ash look at the more ash
might<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:48.989> no<00:00:49.110> good<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.680> not<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.010> want<00:00:50.870> it

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
might be no good it's not you want it

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.229 
might be no good it's not you want it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
has to be mineral absolutely has to be

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.450 
has to be mineral absolutely has to be
mineral<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.260> probably<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.129> most

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
mineral that is probably the most

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.900 
mineral that is probably the most
important<00:01:00.239> thing<00:01:00.570> because<00:01:01.760> if<00:01:02.760> it's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
important thing because if it's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.929 
important thing because if it's
synthetic<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:04.280> pointed<00:01:05.280> out<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
synthetic as pointed out in one of the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.050 
synthetic as pointed out in one of the
comments<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:08.430> won't<00:01:08.700> go<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.180> diesel<00:01:09.510> um<00:01:11.060> it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
comments it won't go with diesel um it

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.690 
comments it won't go with diesel um it
won't<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:13.530> know<00:01:13.650> won't<00:01:13.920> bond<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> won't

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
won't you know won't bond with it won't

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.530 
won't you know won't bond with it won't
merge<00:01:14.909> with<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:16.220> won't<00:01:17.220> mix<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.700> no<00:01:18.509> I

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
merge with it won't mix with it no I

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.429 
merge with it won't mix with it no I
mean<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.960> would<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:20.630> build<00:01:21.630> up<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
mean it would just build up in the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.859 
mean it would just build up in the
bottom<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> tank<00:01:23.009> somewhere<00:01:23.570> slosh<00:01:24.570> about

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
bottom of the tank somewhere slosh about

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.330 
bottom of the tank somewhere slosh about
and<00:01:25.049> bought<00:01:25.200> me<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> tank<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.799> its<00:01:25.920> own<00:01:26.040> little

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and bought me a tank in its own little

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.460 
and bought me a tank in its own little
group<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.470> oil<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.150> then<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.420> day<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:31.020> will

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
group of oil and then one day it will

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.620 
group of oil and then one day it will
get<00:01:31.650> sucked<00:01:31.920> into<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:32.280> pump<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.240> would

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
get sucked into your pump and that would

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.230 
get sucked into your pump and that would
just<00:01:33.659> pump<00:01:34.560> pure<00:01:34.920> two-stroke<00:01:35.520> cord<00:01:35.790> into<00:01:36.000> your

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
just pump pure two-stroke cord into your

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.929 
just pump pure two-stroke cord into your
engine<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.689> well<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.799> don't<00:01:38.490> know<00:01:38.549> whether<00:01:38.729> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
engine in well I don't know whether it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.510 
engine in well I don't know whether it
will<00:01:39.030> run<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.420> whether<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:40.310> mess<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.460> your

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
will run or whether it will mess up your

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.149 
will run or whether it will mess up your
injectors<00:01:42.030> or<00:01:42.119> what<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:42.799> one<00:01:43.799> day<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> will

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
injectors or what but one day it will

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.859 
injectors or what but one day it will
just<00:01:44.310> pump<00:01:44.549> pure<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.060> throw<00:01:45.270> oil<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.689> your

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
just pump pure to throw oil in your

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.030 
just pump pure to throw oil in your
engine<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:48.030> don't<00:01:48.180> want<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> I'm

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
engine and you don't want that so I'm

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.740 
engine and you don't want that so I'm
not<00:01:50.220> sure<00:01:50.280> about<00:01:50.520> semi<00:01:50.880> synthetic<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.540> don't

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
not sure about semi synthetic I don't

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.630 
not sure about semi synthetic I don't
think<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.110> will<00:01:52.200> bond<00:01:52.409> either<00:01:52.619> start<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.490> my

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
think that will bond either start to my

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.690 
think that will bond either start to my
knowledge<00:01:53.880> semi<00:01:54.479> synthetic<00:01:54.720> doesn't<00:01:55.470> either

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
knowledge semi synthetic doesn't either

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.670 
knowledge semi synthetic doesn't either
so<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.759> want<00:01:57.149> 100<00:01:57.960> percent<00:01:58.040> mineral<00:01:59.420> oil

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
so you want 100 percent mineral oil

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.959 
so you want 100 percent mineral oil
two-stroke<00:02:01.680> oil<00:02:01.860> now<00:02:03.079> um<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.729> don't<00:02:05.729> think

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
two-stroke oil now um I don't think

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.779 
two-stroke oil now um I don't think
I<00:02:07.000> don't<00:02:07.719> know<00:02:07.899> just<00:02:08.200> mineral<00:02:09.130> oil<00:02:09.340> coming

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
I don't know just mineral oil coming

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.000 
I don't know just mineral oil coming
other<00:02:09.940> cars<00:02:10.209> I've<00:02:10.630> only<00:02:10.929> ever<00:02:11.050> seen<00:02:11.349> in<00:02:11.470> green

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
other cars I've only ever seen in green

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.220 
other cars I've only ever seen in green
it<00:02:12.940> might<00:02:13.150> come<00:02:13.330> with<00:02:13.510> other<00:02:13.630> colors<00:02:13.989> but<00:02:14.140> I've

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
it might come with other colors but I've

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.960 
it might come with other colors but I've
only<00:02:14.380> ever<00:02:14.500> seen<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:14.980> green<00:02:15.190> but<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.760> don't

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
only ever seen it in green but I don't

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.729 
only ever seen it in green but I don't
think<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.330> color<00:02:16.569> makes<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.930> difference<00:02:17.290> it

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
think the color makes a difference it

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.089 
think the color makes a difference it
can<00:02:17.920> be<00:02:18.069> pink<00:02:18.459> blue<00:02:19.090> orange<00:02:19.989> whatever<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.980> don't

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
can be pink blue orange whatever I don't

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.420 
can be pink blue orange whatever I don't
care

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
care

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.050 
care
red<00:02:22.200> I've<00:02:23.200> only<00:02:23.349> ever<00:02:23.440> seen<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.830> in<00:02:23.920> green<00:02:24.190> so

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
red I've only ever seen it in green so

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.610 
red I've only ever seen it in green so
as<00:02:25.120> far<00:02:25.390> as<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.569> know<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.810> only<00:02:25.930> comes<00:02:26.200> in<00:02:26.319> green

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
as far as I know it only comes in green
