00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
use this slip and arrow food so then you

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.510

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
so then I click the wrench and I kind of

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.430 
so then I click the wrench and I kind of
sometimes<00:06:10.950> move<00:06:11.550> the<00:06:11.730> exposure<00:06:12.300> up<00:06:12.750> a<00:06:13.020> little

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
sometimes move the exposure up a little

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.850 
sometimes move the exposure up a little
maybe<00:06:14.400> to<00:06:14.640> like<00:06:14.790> two<00:06:15.240> or<00:06:15.270> one

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
maybe to like two or one

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.969 
maybe to like two or one
and<00:06:16.979> then<00:06:17.550> I<00:06:17.580> normally<00:06:18.210> do<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:18.960> contrast<00:06:19.620> and

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
and then I normally do the contrast and

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.730 
and then I normally do the contrast and
move<00:06:20.159> it<00:06:20.310> up<00:06:20.460> about<00:06:20.729> one<00:06:21.090> or<00:06:21.300> two<00:06:21.330> and<00:06:21.840> then<00:06:22.680> I

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
move it up about one or two and then I

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.700 
move it up about one or two and then I
go<00:06:23.009> to<00:06:23.039> saturation<00:06:23.340> and<00:06:24.330> I<00:06:24.930> move<00:06:25.169> it<00:06:25.319> up<00:06:25.439> about

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
go to saturation and I move it up about

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.490 
go to saturation and I move it up about
one<00:06:26.069> and<00:06:26.400> that's<00:06:27.330> me<00:06:27.539> and<00:06:27.810> it's<00:06:28.050> nothing

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
one and that's me and it's nothing

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.230 
one and that's me and it's nothing
really<00:06:28.530> difficult<00:06:29.280> but<00:06:29.520> that's<00:06:29.699> how<00:06:29.909> i<00:06:29.939> edit
