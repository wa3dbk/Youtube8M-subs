00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
they're all little so it's not really

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.680 
they're all little so it's not really
worth<00:00:41.740> cutting<00:00:42.130> along<00:00:42.310> but<00:00:43.060> I<00:00:43.090> do<00:00:43.180> need<00:00:43.390> one<00:00:43.420> so

once cutting the tree and killing the
guy<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.990> wouldn't<00:01:02.680> recommend<00:01:02.860> it<00:01:03.070> if<00:01:03.160> there's

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
guy I wouldn't recommend it if there's

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.189 
guy I wouldn't recommend it if there's
like<00:01:03.490> two<00:01:03.760> or<00:01:03.790> more<00:01:04.119> of<00:01:04.299> them<00:01:04.420> because<00:01:04.900> they'll

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
like two or more of them because they'll

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.020 
like two or more of them because they'll
quickly<00:01:05.470> overwhelm<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.040> but<00:01:06.250> not<00:01:06.820> right<00:01:06.880> now

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030

cat<00:01:07.330> mommy's<00:01:08.110> trying<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.320> get<00:01:08.409> mad<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:12.010> as<00:01:12.159> you

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
cat mommy's trying to get mad but as you

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.470 
cat mommy's trying to get mad but as you
can<00:01:12.340> see<00:01:12.460> it's<00:01:12.580> only<00:01:12.730> doing<00:01:12.909> one<00:01:13.030> damage<00:01:13.330> per

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
can see it's only doing one damage per

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.140 
can see it's only doing one damage per
hit<00:01:13.510> so<00:01:14.340> I'll<00:01:15.340> be<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.520> while<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:17.350> higher<00:01:17.680> level

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
hit so I'll be a while the higher level

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.880 
hit so I'll be a while the higher level
equipment<00:01:19.150> does<00:01:19.300> better<00:01:19.510> damage<00:01:20.229> but<00:01:20.650> I<00:01:20.680> still

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
equipment does better damage but I still

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.050 
equipment does better damage but I still
wouldn't<00:01:21.070> really<00:01:21.190> recommend<00:01:21.310> using<00:01:21.760> it<00:01:21.940> as<00:01:22.030> a

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
wouldn't really recommend using it as a

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.550 
wouldn't really recommend using it as a
weapon<00:01:22.240> although<00:01:22.840> there<00:01:23.050> is<00:01:23.140> one<00:01:23.170> axe

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
weapon although there is one axe

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.860 
weapon although there is one axe
actually<00:01:24.040> that<00:01:24.220> both<00:01:25.210> works<00:01:25.479> as<00:01:25.630> an<00:01:25.720> axe

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
actually that both works as an axe

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.110 
actually that both works as an axe
letting<00:01:26.290> you<00:01:26.380> cut<00:01:26.560> down<00:01:26.710> trees<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:27.880> really

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
letting you cut down trees and is really

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.390 
letting you cut down trees and is really
good<00:01:28.240> as<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.390> weapon<00:01:28.630> also<00:01:29.050> but<00:01:29.740> that's<00:01:29.950> a<00:01:30.190> late

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
good as a weapon also but that's a late

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.149 
good as a weapon also but that's a late
item<00:01:30.820> as<00:01:31.510> far<00:01:31.659> as<00:01:31.780> items<00:01:32.049> go<00:01:32.229> you<00:01:32.290> make<00:01:32.710> most<00:01:32.950> of

swimming<00:01:37.810> clippers<00:01:38.290> because<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.250> only<00:01:39.370> find

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
swimming clippers because you only find

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.940 
swimming clippers because you only find
them<00:01:39.729> really<00:01:40.150> deep<00:01:40.360> under<00:01:40.659> and<00:01:40.870> if<00:01:41.650> I<00:01:41.740> was<00:01:41.860> able

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
them really deep under and if I was able

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.289 
them really deep under and if I was able
to<00:01:42.040> go<00:01:42.190> deep<00:01:42.460> in<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.670> water<00:01:42.820> I<00:01:42.909> wouldn't<00:01:43.210> use

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
to go deep in the water I wouldn't use

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.920 
to go deep in the water I wouldn't use
with<00:01:43.420> me<00:01:43.510> oh<00:01:43.960> my<00:01:44.830> gosh<00:01:44.979> taking<00:01:45.490> forever<00:01:45.610> today

there now I got some more wood so now I

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.570 
there now I got some more wood so now I
can<00:01:49.780> go<00:01:49.869> back<00:01:50.049> and<00:01:50.380> there<00:01:50.979> isn't<00:01:51.159> really<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.340> run

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
can go back and there isn't really a run

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.039 
can go back and there isn't really a run
but<00:01:51.909> there<00:01:52.030> are<00:01:52.119> Pegasus<00:01:52.540> boots<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:52.930> have

your<00:02:31.390> knapsack<00:02:32.390> has<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.569> magic<00:02:32.870> power<00:02:33.050> of

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
your knapsack has a magic power of

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.740 
your knapsack has a magic power of
sustaining<00:02:33.770> crystals<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:34.819> can't<00:02:35.180> see<00:02:35.690> I

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
sustaining crystals so I can't see I

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.210 
sustaining crystals so I can't see I
went<00:02:35.900> outside<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.230> that's<00:02:36.590> bothering<00:02:36.920> me<00:02:36.950> but

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
went outside and that's bothering me but

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.650

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
I don't have a hammer yet so I can't

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.780 
I don't have a hammer yet so I can't
take<00:02:38.750> care<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:39.019> it<00:02:39.140> yeah<00:02:39.890> it's<00:02:40.280> daytime<00:02:40.519> again

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790

take care of it yeah it's daytime again
as<00:02:41.000> evinced<00:02:41.300> by<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.660> music<00:02:41.959> changing<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:43.220> you

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
as evinced by the music changing so you

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.660 
as evinced by the music changing so you
want<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:43.940> finish<00:02:44.060> filling<00:02:44.390> this<00:02:44.630> in<00:02:44.810> because

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
want to finish filling this in because

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.040 
want to finish filling this in because
until<00:02:46.670> we<00:02:46.760> do<00:02:46.910> there's<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.450> chance<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.750> enemies

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
until we do there's a chance of enemies

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.990 
until we do there's a chance of enemies
spawning<00:02:48.290> in<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.590> supposedly<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.550> don't

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
spawning in it supposedly I don't

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.370 
spawning in it supposedly I don't
actually<00:02:50.150> have<00:02:50.300> enemies<00:02:50.690> fun<00:02:50.900> inside<00:02:51.170> that

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
actually have enemies fun inside that

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.470 
actually have enemies fun inside that
often<00:02:51.739> but<00:02:52.010> there's<00:02:52.850> always<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.090> chance<00:02:53.269> plus

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
often but there's always a chance plus

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.320 
often but there's always a chance plus
it's<00:02:53.660> just<00:02:53.720> looks<00:02:54.410> weird<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.950> have<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:56.090> be<00:02:56.180> able

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
it's just looks weird I have to be able

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.910 
it's just looks weird I have to be able
to<00:02:56.390> see<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.660> mountain<00:02:57.290> through<00:02:57.650> your<00:02:57.799> back

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
to see the mountain through your back

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.850 
to see the mountain through your back
wall<00:03:03.730> just<00:03:04.730> me<00:03:04.910> my<00:03:05.060> mind<00:03:05.299> was<00:03:06.170> that<00:03:06.230> nice<00:03:06.440> and

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
wall just me my mind was that nice and

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.720 
wall just me my mind was that nice and
there<00:03:07.819> isn't<00:03:08.000> any<00:03:08.090> holes<00:03:08.330> but<00:03:08.989> sometimes<00:03:09.950> it's

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
there isn't any holes but sometimes it's

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.710 
there isn't any holes but sometimes it's
good<00:03:10.850> to<00:03:10.880> just<00:03:10.970> go<00:03:11.180> around<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:11.420> make<00:03:11.570> sure

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
good to just go around and make sure

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.509 
good to just go around and make sure
sometimes<00:03:12.590> with<00:03:12.680> like<00:03:12.829> stone<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.220> stuff<00:03:13.400> it's

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
sometimes with like stone and stuff it's

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.560 
sometimes with like stone and stuff it's
harder<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.790> tell<00:03:13.910> if<00:03:14.000> there's<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.180> hole<00:03:14.329> and

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
harder to tell if there's a hole and

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.509 
harder to tell if there's a hole and
supposedly<00:03:15.440> if<00:03:15.590> there's<00:03:15.829> even<00:03:16.040> one<00:03:16.070> tiny<00:03:16.310> hole

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
supposedly if there's even one tiny hole

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.150 
supposedly if there's even one tiny hole
it'll<00:03:16.700> make<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.910> difference
