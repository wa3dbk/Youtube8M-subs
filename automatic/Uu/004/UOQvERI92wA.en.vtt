00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
like a West Coast style offense he can

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.800 
like a West Coast style offense he can
work<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.670> any<00:01:29.729> offense<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.390> Peyton's<00:01:30.689> gonna

contractually<00:01:37.979> obviously<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> big<00:01:38.820> issue

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
contractually obviously the big issue

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.550 
contractually obviously the big issue
with<00:01:39.119> Indianapolis<00:01:39.720> was<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> bonus<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.439> he

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
with Indianapolis was the bonus that he

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.200 
with Indianapolis was the bonus that he
was<00:01:40.680> due<00:01:40.860> contractually<00:01:41.610> how<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:41.970> expect

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
was due contractually how do you expect

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.420 
was due contractually how do you expect
teams<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.720> set<00:01:42.930> him<00:01:43.140> up<00:01:43.170> financially<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.220> do

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
teams to set him up financially and do

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.639 
teams to set him up financially and do
expect<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.909> team<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.750> sign<00:01:46.020> him<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.290> they<00:01:46.409> don't

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
expect a team to sign him if they don't

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.440 
expect a team to sign him if they don't
have<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> contingency<00:01:47.369> plan<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.360> on

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
have a contingency plan to go all in on

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.090 
have a contingency plan to go all in on
Peyton<00:01:48.810> Manning<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.140> think<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.619> think<00:01:49.920> whatever

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
Peyton Manning I think I think whatever

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.260 
Peyton Manning I think I think whatever
he<00:01:50.369> gets<00:01:50.520> there's<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.030> some

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
he gets there's going to be some

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.330 
he gets there's going to be some
incentives<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.320> contract<00:01:52.860> he's<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
incentives in the contract he's going to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.340 
incentives in the contract he's going to
obviously<00:01:53.520> want<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.720> value<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
obviously want to have the value of the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.899 
obviously want to have the value of the
contract<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.770> he<00:01:55.860> had<00:01:56.040> from<00:01:56.219> Indianapolis

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
contract that he had from Indianapolis

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.490 
contract that he had from Indianapolis
but<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.719> some<00:01:57.869> teams<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.380> want

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
but I think some teams are going to want

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.440 
but I think some teams are going to want
to<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.710> incentives<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.369> there<00:01:59.549> the<00:02:00.240> key

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
to have incentives in there the key

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
to have incentives in there the key
issue<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.899> him<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.140> he's<00:02:01.290> healthy<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.770> teams

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
issue with him is he's healthy and teams

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.440 
issue with him is he's healthy and teams
don't<00:02:02.219> know<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.909> because<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
don't know that so because of that

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.149 
don't know that so because of that
little<00:02:03.810> X<00:02:04.049> Factor<00:02:04.469> there<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.799> not<00:02:04.979> going<00:02:05.070> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
little X Factor there it's not going to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.240 
little X Factor there it's not going to
quite<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.399> what<00:02:05.700> he<00:02:05.790> had

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
quite be what he had

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.969 
quite be what he had
Annapolis<00:02:06.670> but<00:02:07.050> Payton<00:02:08.050> will<00:02:08.200> get<00:02:08.350> paid<00:02:08.530> okay

another<00:02:14.770> team<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.040> he<00:02:15.250> could<00:02:15.430> go<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.610> and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
another team that he could go to and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
right but part of me wants Peyton

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.370 
right but part of me wants Peyton
Manning<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.510> go<00:02:31.630> somewhere<00:02:31.990> else<00:02:32.020> where<00:02:32.320> he

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
Manning to go somewhere else where he

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.930 
Manning to go somewhere else where he
can<00:02:32.530> win<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:32.770> championship<00:02:33.070> because<00:02:33.640> if<00:02:33.850> he

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
can win a championship because if he

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.670 
can win a championship because if he
wins<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.209> championship<00:02:34.240> with<00:02:34.900> another<00:02:35.140> team<00:02:35.440> I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
wins a championship with another team I

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.630 
wins a championship with another team I
don't<00:02:35.920> know<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.100> any<00:02:36.190> other<00:02:36.280> quarterback

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
don't know of any other quarterback

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.980 
don't know of any other quarterback
that's<00:02:36.940> done<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.209> in<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.300> modern<00:02:37.480> era<00:02:37.720> I

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
that's done that in the modern era I

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.420 
that's done that in the modern era I
think<00:02:38.350> he<00:02:38.440> would<00:02:38.560> cement<00:02:38.739> himself<00:02:39.010> as<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
think he would cement himself as the
