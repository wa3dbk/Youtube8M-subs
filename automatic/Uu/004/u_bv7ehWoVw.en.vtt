00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:11.460
 Tell me more, what's a video? 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.030
 way and memories 2 because I'll show you 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.630
 you 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.939
 the game functions so let's go there as 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.310
 opponent chose amÃ©ric the first 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.090
 I'm still at the beginning of the game. I'm in 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.699
 tournament 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.699
 in campaign mode then let's go 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.099
 in the beginning the cards opponent everything 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.099
 filth 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:45.629
 ae 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:49.579
 Let me see if I'll throw everything away and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:57.059
 leave only the right time for what is the 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:59.430
 which is most useful here for the merger between 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.260
 some of these letters but the merger is a 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.260
 very fragile merger is not worth much 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:17.270
 and 400 very strong so better to play powder 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:42.299
 come here, but you father will give you 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:44.869
 another 1,800 byron defense 0 well 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.869
 pay 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:11.959
 this was not one of the best views 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.810
 of the beginning of the game because each card 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:21.620
 other than monster do not add monster 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.160
 who will merge will win 400 points 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.230
 then the original attack was of 1600 will 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.230
 stay 2 thousand points 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.530
 remembering that it is done only by 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.950
 only at the moment for example in the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.390
 time you put it on the field and 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.660
 example after picking up more letters 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.850
 magical will not change anything that I by 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.799
 example use this card also also 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.420
 will not change anything because the effect already 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:56.570
 was used and continues with the same 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.609
 points out that he is in the case two thousand 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:03.350
 points 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:07.579
 I've already left him at 3,300 and gaining strength 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:17.290
 field and I was with two cards in the 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:22.790
 hand but the game alone very good 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:29.989
 fox will but can record the new name 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:32.530
 takes place if a mode magnet does not 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.530
 it's very worth it 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.390
 the thing here 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:14.730
 the totem dragon, but such a method of 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:19.440
 111 one of my favorite cards 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:22.130
 This game that is Christmas is vegan 2,400 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.130
 it also helps a lot 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.150
 1800 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.830
 sometimes he uses the chicken giga giga 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.190
 oh op 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.190
 That makes it difficult 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:07.620
 although all my letters try 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:07.620
 had been abusing the 1,800 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.819
 although in this case I will focus on 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:47.389
 detail is the one of the one we go here all 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:53.120
 no cambodian afternoons start of the game 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:53.120
 not to have destroyed his team here 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:16.100
 oh how lucky insects devil and stone 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.270
 get 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.470
 sometimes he used five magic in the 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:58.280
 Slovak katarina now has to 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:58.280
 achieve a merger with more than 1300 2 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.900
 The best in the world is fire, right? 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.640
 I'm talking this, says guys 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:37.869
 right demon in nine years and I won 

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:39.009
 so this guys hope you guys 

00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:42.459
 have enjoyed 

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:46.179
 It's over, let's see what ordinance I 

00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:48.719
 I gained weak 

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:48.719
 thanks
