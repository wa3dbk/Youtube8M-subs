00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.729
 if you have not seen the first part yet, the first one should end up 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:09.379
 Day lie 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.450
 He now sees our destination in the background, so our target is officially 2 54 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:15.519
 the processor 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.279
 there is a film about the book to make four 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.859
 and how he had that goal comes to you this video 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.399
 The first step is her book becomes quite normal in systems and then goes in 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.409
 Bayern with us I have one from Rockport and there I go with the BIOS 

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.409
 internally, the button or the button simmered 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.580
 then open the door and put on the looks 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.710
 if its expression has with us 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.350
 and build up there it rocks well 70 you look around I bite Babel the whole first 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.110
 once 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.430
 because I realize they should be in the process for a long time in the x3 450 as x4 too 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.130
 has run 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.130
 Cooper has recently reached temperatures that are more 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.040
 and then goes to need exit 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.870
 Now there on the PC for Champions in the text will be 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.140
 the whole thing is about death 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.220
 and what you sacrifice now will be Schubach and not at all 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.220
 Have concern 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.290
 now the whole thing up I've got that come up hold this too 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.509
 CDU time taken 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.660
 and the test can cause errors 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.950
 So no great mistake but she did not think that one 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.670
 Percent today run properly or consequently should have weird because of that 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.000
 the software 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.520
 to restart it exactly 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.020
 and here you see the only one the CDU as she cooks tea areas 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.330
 as a final project 2 54 with the 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.210
 Arana core 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.590
 so also the three has already been said 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.220
 with empty single bits per cash and Vienna 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.439
 Speed ​​of three municipalities too high 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.270
 Jiang Steer 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 it's the initial situation, so to speak 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.140
 I bought 4 no just under 300 four days 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.319
 and 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.769
 have then seen that you can unlock him wonderful also 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.890
 Defining recommendations to defuse nba-profi and how it works 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.129
 SID now in reach again unreachable 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.129
 Restart more to see the reduction 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.139
 then he takes stock 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:25.119
 he still sees air in it Alston 2 6 3 4 0 50 detected 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.029
 Ben to Breuer 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.119
 that does not save too 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.409
 back on the rider Ozzy Spieker 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.589
 then he nods 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:41.819
 Control buttons for the first time in the concrete and look I'm very glad today fast 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.959
 okay Weilrods Ried Spieker now with issued is called down 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.779
 go to the entry 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.699
 but as Rock UCITS IV 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.109
 from Lokstedt for the EM manufacturers 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.430
 and and 17 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.549
 attract 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.059
 CPU pipe 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:05.329
 but if the Sable is the whole inside that is called the whole 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.059
 possible routinely 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:08.449
 or that 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.689
 that works and then the rest 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.259
 the reason he stands 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.589
 on NP picture or off show 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.069
 that means he should say himself 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.230
 as 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.639
 the frequencies of other things are 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.849
 that has to find out for itself then I want 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.259
 First of all, do not change anything 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:30.519
 then there are other videos but that is actually only comment 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.789
 Wickeder Tutorial 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:36.570
 so now it seems told in the text will again confirm with OKI 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.219
 the screen is relaxed again the postman do not worry 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.569
 and after starting up and restarting cpu-z he sees 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.129
 our goal 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.400
 and so now we have an Athlon Zbot x3 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.179
 quiet becomes 50 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:56.819
 a Phenom made to ground four came up with a propos it 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.979
 the question is how does it work? 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.550
 below mentioned in the first video 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.080
 are the whole actually four-core processors 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.799
 at most sin Carne only 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.989
 is not unlocked 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.919
 with the software is the Queen I checked all over again you see it 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.969
 are the four cpu-kernels and the temperatures are all in the open 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:21.809
 By the way, the area Allied 64 has not indicated anything else to me and myself 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:25.220
 test primetime 90 the IG has performed 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.210
 Berlin Gallen 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.310
 without complications so I hope we see each other at the next video 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.139
 I'll give you 10 extra one more normal before Unoh blocks 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:35.990
 other 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.389
 to check had Kvitova stands 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.509
 and we are not there yet the country feels al-wazir
