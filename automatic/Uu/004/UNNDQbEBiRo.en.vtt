00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.840 
execution modes the objective of each
team<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.830> kill<00:00:31.980> all<00:00:32.160> members<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.520> dynamic

revived at the end of the time instead
of<00:00:48.239> dying<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.530> execute<00:00:49.890> them<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
of dying so you have to execute them to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.819 
of dying so you have to execute them to
kill<00:00:50.430> them<00:00:50.579> which<00:00:51.420> obviously<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:52.170> pretty<00:00:52.680> much

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
kill them which obviously is pretty much

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.290 
kill them which obviously is pretty much
identical<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.370> execution<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:53.940> know<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.270> love

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
identical to execution we know and love

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.900 
identical to execution we know and love
now<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:55.020> lot<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.530> people<00:00:55.649> were<00:00:56.070> incredibly

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
now a lot of people were incredibly

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.310 
now a lot of people were incredibly
annoyed<00:00:57.149> by<00:00:57.360> execution<00:00:57.780> being<00:00:58.079> removed

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
annoyed by execution being removed

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.439 
annoyed by execution being removed
undone<00:00:58.710> banal<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.280> hopefully<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.239> will

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
undone banal so hopefully this will

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.090 
undone banal so hopefully this will
alleviate<00:01:00.690> some<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> concerns<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.859> are

these concerns initially and because

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.620 
these concerns initially and because
execution<00:01:08.490> was<00:01:08.610> never<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:08.939> favorite<00:01:09.240> playlist

it's<00:02:44.580> for<00:02:45.270> execution<00:02:45.960> I<00:02:46.170> guess<00:02:46.470> and

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
it's for execution I guess and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.340 
it's for execution I guess and
domination<00:02:48.030> at<00:02:48.300> least<00:02:48.480> maybe<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.290> for

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
domination at least maybe it's for

overrun and whether or not it's going to

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.540 
overrun and whether or not it's going to
be<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:49.380> know<00:03:49.470> something<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.250> place

ranked<00:03:52.860> well<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.370> actually<00:03:53.430> could<00:03:53.760> be<00:03:53.880> because

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
ranked well it actually could be because

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.550 
ranked well it actually could be because
it<00:03:54.240> does<00:03:54.420> have<00:03:54.570> a<00:03:54.630> lot<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.810> depth<00:03:55.020> of<00:03:55.110> strategy

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
it does have a lot of depth of strategy

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.830

probably<00:04:09.030> going<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.240> be<00:04:09.300> people<00:04:09.480> staple

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
probably going to be people staple

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.900 
probably going to be people staple
creature<00:04:10.830> when<00:04:11.010> they're<00:04:11.100> on<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.280> locust<00:04:11.670> a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
creature when they're on the locust a

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.640 
creature when they're on the locust a
team<00:04:12.300> because<00:04:12.450> it's<00:04:12.720> got<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.930> once<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.560> after

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
team because it's got a once and after

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.550 
team because it's got a once and after
so<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.820> can<00:04:14.970> basically<00:04:15.150> plague<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.470> way

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
so you can basically plague is the way

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.620 
so you can basically plague is the way
you<00:04:16.620> don't<00:04:17.160> have<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.310> play<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.640> but<00:04:18.090> if<00:04:18.570> you

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
you don't have to play it but if you

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.120 
you don't have to play it but if you
want<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:18.959> get<00:04:19.320> if<00:04:19.620> you<00:04:19.739> don't<00:04:19.859> defeat<00:04:20.040> the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
want to get if you don't defeat the

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.320 
want to get if you don't defeat the
enemy<00:04:20.310> team<00:04:20.459> quickly<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.940> know<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.090> really

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
enemy team quickly you know you really

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.090 
enemy team quickly you know you really
need<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.570> start<00:04:22.260> using<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.650> malls<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.040> the

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
need to start using the malls and the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.530 
need to start using the malls and the
cop<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.490> corpses<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:23.970> particular<00:04:24.210> we're

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
cop the corpses in particular we're

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.420 
cop the corpses in particular we're
ridiculously<00:04:25.110> hard<00:04:25.260> to<00:04:25.380> stop<00:04:25.590> when<00:04:26.250> you're<00:04:26.340> in

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
ridiculously hard to stop when you're in

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.560 
ridiculously hard to stop when you're in
the<00:04:26.490> core<00:04:26.640> team<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.030> class

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
the core team and the class

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.590 
the core team and the class
works<00:04:27.810> well<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:29.430> call<00:04:29.670> did<00:04:30.000> have<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.150> boom<00:04:30.360> shot

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
works well the call did have a boom shot

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.850 
works well the call did have a boom shot
on<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.840> ad<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.050> ammo<00:04:31.230> crate<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:31.650> he<00:04:31.740> basically

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
on the ad and ammo crate so he basically

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.350 
on the ad and ammo crate so he basically
had<00:04:32.130> unlimited<00:04:32.370> boom<00:04:32.700> shots<00:04:32.940> which<00:04:33.120> was

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
had unlimited boom shots which was

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.940 
had unlimited boom shots which was
obviously<00:04:33.510> overpowered<00:04:34.200> but<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.560> know<00:04:34.710> they've

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
obviously overpowered but I know they've

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.980 
obviously overpowered but I know they've
already<00:04:35.070> addressed<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.900> they've<00:04:36.900> been

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
already addressed that and they've been

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.240 
already addressed that and they've been
a<00:04:37.080> lot<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.230> work<00:04:37.380> on<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.620> balancing<00:04:38.010> so<00:04:38.160> I'm

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
a lot of work on the balancing so I'm

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.770 
a lot of work on the balancing so I'm
not<00:04:38.340> in<00:04:38.460> a<00:04:38.520> position<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.850> comment<00:04:39.090> on<00:04:39.240> that<00:04:39.420> but

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
not in a position to comment on that but
