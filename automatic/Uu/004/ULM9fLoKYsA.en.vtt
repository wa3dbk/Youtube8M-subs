00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
shaped and the attack banana has it it's

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.479

a reverse camber in between the feet and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.160 
a reverse camber in between the feet and
then<00:00:45.120> from<00:00:45.329> underneath<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.870> feet<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
then from underneath the feet to the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
then from underneath the feet to the
contact<00:00:46.680> points<00:00:47.010> both<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.430> nose<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.760> the

contact points both the nose and the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.430 
contact points both the nose and the
tail<00:00:47.879> will<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.300> an<00:00:48.480> elliptical<00:00:48.780> camber<00:00:49.230> so

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
tail will have an elliptical camber so

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.590 
tail will have an elliptical camber so
it's<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> full<00:00:50.070> camber<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:51.030> not<00:00:51.239> mild

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
it's not a full camber it's not mild

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.869 
it's not a full camber it's not mild
flat<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.829> kind<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.460> right<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
flat it's just kind of right in the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.180 
flat it's just kind of right in the
center<00:00:54.300> now<00:00:54.960> overall<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.590> attack<00:00:55.829> banana<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
center now overall the attack banana is

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.700 
center now overall the attack banana is
gonna<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.539> fluctuating<00:00:57.539> by<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> lip<00:00:58.500> Jack

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
gonna have a fluctuating by a lip Jack

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.010 
gonna have a fluctuating by a lip Jack
of<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.250> six<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> seven<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.510> think<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> whole

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
of a six to a seven I think the whole

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.660 
of a six to a seven I think the whole
range<00:01:01.320> will<00:01:01.530> probably<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.399> closed<00:01:02.640> for

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
range will probably have closed for

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.270 
range will probably have closed for
maybe<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> six<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> 6.5<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.949> little<00:01:05.189> bit

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
maybe to a six to a 6.5 a little bit

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.980 
maybe to a six to a 6.5 a little bit
stiffer<00:01:05.549> than<00:01:05.580> average<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.869> know

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
stiffer than average but you know

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.600 
stiffer than average but you know
responsible<00:01:07.560> enough<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> get<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.310> where<00:01:08.520> you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
responsible enough to get you where you

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.250 
responsible enough to get you where you
want<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> go<00:01:09.000> when<00:01:09.240> you're<00:01:09.360> taking<00:01:09.990> off<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
want to go when you're taking off the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440 
want to go when you're taking off the
lips<00:01:10.470> inside<00:01:11.280> as<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> Columbian<00:01:11.880> gold<00:01:12.119> wood

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
lips inside as a Columbian gold wood

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.370 
lips inside as a Columbian gold wood
core<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.140> there's<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> cool<00:01:14.600> laminate<00:01:15.600> kind<00:01:16.290> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
core and there's a cool laminate kind of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.039 
core and there's a cool laminate kind of
combination<00:01:17.340> there's<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.030> basalt<00:01:18.479> fibers<00:01:18.900> and

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
combination there's a basalt fibers and

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.620 
combination there's a basalt fibers and
fiberglass<00:01:19.770> inside<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.670> they<00:01:20.790> wrap<00:01:21.420> that

fiberglass inside and they wrap that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.780 
fiberglass inside and they wrap that
core<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.710> what's<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.280> great<00:01:23.400> about<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
core but what's really great about the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.030 
core but what's really great about the
deck<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.450> kind<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.350> been<00:01:25.530> beefed<00:01:25.860> up

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
deck is that it's kind of been beefed up

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.819 
deck is that it's kind of been beefed up
on<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.490> rails<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.630> don't<00:01:28.350> know<00:01:28.530> it

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
on the rails like if you don't know it

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
on the rails like if you don't know it
about<00:01:29.250> libtech<00:01:29.670> they<00:01:29.820> they're<00:01:30.180> pretty<00:01:30.479> darn

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
about libtech they they're pretty darn

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.870 
about libtech they they're pretty darn
beefy<00:01:31.409> boards<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.040> think<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
beefy boards and I think one of the I

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.060 
beefy boards and I think one of the I
don't<00:01:33.450> mean<00:01:33.570> beefy<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.320> weight<00:01:34.710> but

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
don't mean beefy as in like weight but

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.700 
don't mean beefy as in like weight but
the<00:01:35.280> amount<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.820> durability<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:37.229> they<00:01:37.439> have

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
the amount of durability that they have

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.649 
the amount of durability that they have
you<00:01:38.220> know<00:01:38.250> they're<00:01:38.460> made<00:01:38.670> by<00:01:38.700> snowboarders

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
you know they're made by snowboarders

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.870 
you know they're made by snowboarders
that<00:01:39.810> actually<00:01:40.170> care<00:01:40.439> about<00:01:40.880> snowboarding

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that actually care about snowboarding

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.969 
that actually care about snowboarding
because<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.720> relied<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.439> they<00:01:43.740> want<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
because they relied and they want to

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.130 
because they relied and they want to
make<00:01:44.100> quality<00:01:44.399> products<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:45.780> reason

make quality products and one reason

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.630

that<00:01:46.229> these<00:01:46.619> things<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.070> such<00:01:47.280> high

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that these things have such high

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.210 
that these things have such high
durability<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.720> think<00:01:48.899> because<00:01:49.680> ultra<00:01:50.040> high

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
durability is I think because ultra high

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.190 
durability is I think because ultra high
molecular<00:01:50.250> weighted<00:01:50.820> sidewall<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
molecular weighted sidewall and then the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.590 
molecular weighted sidewall and then the
power<00:01:52.500> transfer<00:01:53.070> internal<00:01:53.640> sidewall<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.479> it's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
power transfer internal sidewall so it's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.450 
power transfer internal sidewall so it's
like<00:01:54.689> almost<00:01:54.960> two<00:01:55.380> side<00:01:55.649> walls<00:01:55.860> which<00:01:56.189> give

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
like almost two side walls which give

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.539 
like almost two side walls which give
