your<00:00:42.750> Eller<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.170> which<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:44.040> did<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.550> I'm

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
your Eller on which I just did and I'm

your Eller on which I just did and I'm
going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.820> disarm<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.660> you'll<00:00:45.809> see<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.370> self

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
going to disarm and you'll see that self

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.000 
going to disarm and you'll see that self
level<00:00:47.700> mode<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.149> turned<00:00:48.390> off<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:49.410> what<00:00:49.890> we

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
level mode is turned off but what we

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.970 
level mode is turned off but what we
ultimately<00:00:50.129> want<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.590> somewhat<00:00:52.590> easier

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
ultimately want to be somewhat easier

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.459 
ultimately want to be somewhat easier
and<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.640> could<00:00:53.760> argue<00:00:53.910> fancier<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.350> this

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
and you could argue fancier is with this

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.520 
and you could argue fancier is with this
walkera<00:00:56.270> transmitter<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.960> want<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.230> connect

the gear switch so that we can toggle in
and<00:01:01.920> out<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.219> self<00:01:02.489> level<00:01:02.820> mode<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.350> do

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and out of self level mode and to do

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.460 
and out of self level mode and to do
that<00:01:04.680> we'll<00:01:04.890> start<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:06.080> connecting<00:01:07.080> our

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470

we're going to go to menu option C and
we're<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.799> change<00:01:50.009> self<00:01:50.369> level<00:01:50.700> mode

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
we're going to change self level mode

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.679 
we're going to change self level mode
from<00:01:51.119> our<00:01:51.329> sticks<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.950> auxilary<00:01:53.759> port<00:01:54.240> someone

from our sticks to auxilary port someone

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.130 
from our sticks to auxilary port someone
hit<00:01:54.840> C<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.320> change<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.119> then<00:01:57.119> hit<00:01:57.450> B<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.990> go

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
hit C to change and then hit B to go

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.139 
hit C to change and then hit B to go
back<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.430> next<00:01:59.670> thing<00:01:59.820> we're<00:02:00.000> going<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
back and the next thing we're going to

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.770 
back and the next thing we're going to
do<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.600> we're<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.110> go<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> option<00:02:01.860> F<00:02:02.780> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
do is we're going to go to option F and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.870 
do is we're going to go to option F and
we're<00:02:03.960> going<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.170> set<00:02:04.439> our<00:02:04.680> P<00:02:04.950> gain<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.579> P

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
we're going to set our P gain and P

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.109 
we're going to set our P gain and P
limit<00:02:06.299> now<00:02:07.079> values<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.890> I've<00:02:08.039> found<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:09.090> be

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
limit now values that I've found to be

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.410 
limit now values that I've found to be
pretty<00:02:09.450> useful<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:11.220> P<00:02:11.400> gain

pretty useful for the P gain

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.280 
pretty useful for the P gain
I'll<00:02:12.900> hit<00:02:13.080> C<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.560> then<00:02:13.650> I'll<00:02:13.770> type<00:02:13.950> 50<00:02:15.290> hit

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
I'll hit C and then I'll type 50 hit

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.160 
I'll hit C and then I'll type 50 hit
enter<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.940> then<00:02:17.940> I'll<00:02:18.090> hit<00:02:18.300> C<00:02:18.690> again<00:02:19.020> to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
enter and then I'll hit C again to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.330 
enter and then I'll hit C again to
change<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.650> limit<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.070> I'll<00:02:20.190> type<00:02:20.430> 20<00:02:22.340> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
change the limit and I'll type 20 and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.840 
change the limit and I'll type 20 and
I'll<00:02:23.520> hit<00:02:23.730> enter<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.680> then<00:02:25.680> B<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.100> go<00:02:26.220> back<00:02:26.490> and

I'll hit enter and then B to go back and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.020 
I'll hit enter and then B to go back and
then<00:02:27.630> we'll<00:02:27.810> write<00:02:28.050> those<00:02:28.730> changes<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
then we'll write those changes to the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.430 
then we'll write those changes to the
board<00:02:30.210> by<00:02:30.990> hitting<00:02:31.200> P<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:32.760> enter<00:02:36.410> okay

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
board by hitting P and then enter okay

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.650 
board by hitting P and then enter okay
our<00:02:37.710> changes<00:02:38.190> have<00:02:38.340> been<00:02:38.520> written<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.120> we're

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
our changes have been written so we're

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.220 
our changes have been written so we're
gonna<00:02:39.750> go<00:02:39.930> ahead<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.260> hit<00:02:40.380> Q<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.740> quit<00:02:41.070> and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
gonna go ahead and hit Q to quit and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.410 
gonna go ahead and hit Q to quit and
let's<00:02:43.230> go<00:02:43.380> ahead<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.890> test<00:02:44.250> our<00:02:44.550> self<00:02:45.030> level

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
let's go ahead and test our self level

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.420 
let's go ahead and test our self level
settings

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
settings

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.270 
settings
okay<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.490> let's<00:02:47.880> give<00:02:48.060> our<00:02:48.560> take<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.770> self

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
okay so let's give our take a to self

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.979 
okay so let's give our take a to self
level<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.900> try<00:02:51.900> now<00:02:52.830> you'll<00:02:53.010> notice<00:02:53.989> your

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
level a try now you'll notice your

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.290 
level a try now you'll notice your
switches<00:02:55.470> up<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.640> we're<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:56.940> take<00:02:57.150> off

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
switches up so we're going to take off

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.420 
switches up so we're going to take off
them<00:02:57.480> self<00:02:57.720> level<00:02:58.020> mode<00:02:58.200> then<00:02:59.010> while<00:02:59.160> I'm<00:02:59.280> in

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
them self level mode then while I'm in

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.720 
them self level mode then while I'm in
the<00:02:59.520> air<00:02:59.720> I'm<00:03:00.720> going<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.959> switch<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.730> manual

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
the air I'm going to switch to manual

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.449 
the air I'm going to switch to manual
mode<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.560> switch<00:03:04.560> back<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:04.860> see<00:03:05.220> how<00:03:05.340> it

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
mode and switch back and see how it

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.690 
mode and switch back and see how it
flies<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:06.750> go<00:03:06.959> ahead<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.170> arm

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:21.280 

we're<00:03:11.700> arm

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.240 

self<00:03:21.920> level<00:03:22.220> modes<00:03:22.430> working

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
self level modes working

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.730 
self level modes working
really<00:03:24.760> well

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.080 

you<00:03:31.980> know

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
you know

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:42.610 
you know
comes<00:03:33.720> back<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.930> level

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:50.370 

now<00:03:43.129> go<00:03:43.340> ahead<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:43.550> switch<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.180> manual<00:03:44.569> mode

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.490 

and<00:03:50.860> now<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.070> can<00:03:51.340> kind<00:03:51.490> of<00:03:51.610> see<00:03:51.820> if<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:52.320> roll<00:03:53.320> in

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
and now you can kind of see if I roll in

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:05.640 
and now you can kind of see if I roll in
one<00:03:53.650> direction<00:03:53.830> it<00:03:54.280> stays<00:03:54.580> that<00:03:54.610> way

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.670 

I'll<00:04:06.159> go<00:04:06.280> ahead<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.640> flip<00:04:06.849> back<00:04:07.409> into<00:04:08.409> self

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
I'll go ahead and flip back into self

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.220 
I'll go ahead and flip back into self
level<00:04:08.980> mode

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:23.680 

now<00:04:12.230> we're<00:04:12.440> in<00:04:12.530> South<00:04:12.709> level<00:04:13.069> mode<00:04:13.250> again

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.260 

so<00:04:24.690> it's<00:04:24.930> really<00:04:25.169> tough<00:04:25.530> to<00:04:25.590> be<00:04:25.949> KK<00:04:26.639> to<00:04:26.699> self

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
so it's really tough to be KK to self

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.840 
so it's really tough to be KK to self
level<00:04:27.600> mode<00:04:27.780> for<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.199> money<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:29.550> hope<00:04:29.699> that

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
level mode for the money and I hope that

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.610 
level mode for the money and I hope that
was<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.000> useful<00:04:30.240> demonstration<00:04:31.080> of<00:04:31.229> using<00:04:31.530> the

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
was a useful demonstration of using the

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.700 
was a useful demonstration of using the
