00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.930
 which will be on February 17 next 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:34.760
 they are in person because they did not think 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:37.480
 it was possible to achieve it and many people who 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.480
 We will not be able to 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.480
 an audience chosen for the program is 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.640

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.010
 episode in the case of gabriel alejandro 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.770
 competed with two Colombians and one 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.360
 Argentina they vote based on others 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.600
 criteria the most impressing the one that 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.059
 I liked 7 v the 55.2 percent the 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.180
 votes or more than half of them 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.610
 impresses his challenge was to arm 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.680
 three subic cubes without seeing for which 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.810
 he had four minutes to memorize and 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.360
 three minutes to put together these ones 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.970
 last only used one minute with 20 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.980
 seconds, yes, we are very happy 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.900
 because I was very nervous like the 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.900
 first time they left not then 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 will be one more time and if you do not do the challenge 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.930
 it means it says not to feel special 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.640
 nor is considered a super brain for him 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.090
 constancy in practice and the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.020
 determination they have put it where it is 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.880
 regardless of the result of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.890
 TV contest already plans 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.020
 participate in the national cube of 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.480
 rubik organized by us in august 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.300
 next and in the global competition in 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.970
 2015 , however, recognizes that the factor 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.040
 economic is perhaps the most difficult 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.229
 what a sponsor would like to have 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.810
 for these trips so everyone 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.640
 he goes on his own then and so still 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.530
 do not get a sponsorship there is no longer 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.810
 learn from one the cost in prison is 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.119
 really very very little then the cost 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.979
 real is the trip since he is a 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.869
 super sonoran brain that holds the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.580
 third place in the world ranking of
