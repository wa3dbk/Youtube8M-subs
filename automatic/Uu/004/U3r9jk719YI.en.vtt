00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello welcome to kitchen for all today 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.940
 let's make a cake of the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.220
 butter that I based on the recipe 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.660
 of martín berasátegui and to make it 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.929
 we are going to need the following 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.390
 ingredients a cup or 250 grams of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:23.070
 wheat flour 210 grams of sugar 250 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.779
 grams of butter 5 eggs 40 grams 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.939
 of sugar a pinch of salt and optional 10 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.130
 milliliters of a liqueur in the recipe 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.620
 Original Cognac is used but I'm going to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.600
 use hazelnut liquor first 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.160
 what we are going to do is melt the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.800
 butter in the microwave at low 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.660
 power or in a saucepan once melted 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.850
 the butter we reserve if we continue 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.430
 with the recipe now we will put the oven 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.239
 preheated to 170 degrees with heat by 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.280
 up and down 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.800
 now we will separate the whites from the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.800
 buds on one side we will put the whites 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.070
 and in another container the yolks and so on 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.920
 the 5 eggs in the bowl where they are 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.409
 the yolks add the pinch of salt 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.049
 and the 210 grams of sugar 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.770
 let's beat it until the mixture 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.770
 white 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.710
 once the mixture has bleached it 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:29.350
 we add the butter is we sink to 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.350
 beginning and we beat again 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.240
 we have already integrated the butter to 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.740
 low speed and now let's move on to 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.280
 Sift the flour in the same bowl 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.280
 ah 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.490
 and we beat again 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.110
 we have already integrated the flour and now we 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.570
 let's move to the edge where we had 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.890
 the whites we add the 40 grams of 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.659
 sugar 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.659
 and we are going to assemble it well 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.930
 once we have collected the clear 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.810
 point of snow as you can see form 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.200
 we are going to add peaks to the dough 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.200
 previous 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.599
 and we mix it with the help of the tongue 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.709
 pastry and wrapping movements for 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.709
 that the mixture does not get off 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.780
 finally we add the liquor what 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.780
 we integrate 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.320
 we have the ready mix I have prepared 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.080
 also the mold what we are going to do 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.680
 our sponge cake is a type mold 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.790
 25 centimeters in diameter I have put 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.610
 butter and flour so you do not 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.690
 hit so that everything is ready 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.690
 let's add the mixture 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.320
 we have already put all the mixture so 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.480
 let's put it in the oven we leave it to 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.640
 170 degrees with heat above and by 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.100
 down 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.050
 55 minutes have passed and our cake 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.600
 is already ready so let's get it out 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.120
 let's cool it down for a few minutes 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.730
 to be able to deport him we have not 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.560
 disassembled then this on a part and 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.020
 I have caused a little icing sugar 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.940
 above our cake is already 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.410
 ready so I'm going to cut a piece 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.020
 so you can see how it looks 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.570
 already we have cut a piece and 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.880
 You can see the bit as I cut and 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.010
 Sheen has a cake into pieces 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.110
