00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
these not so light not so driving what I

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.200 
these not so light not so driving what I
mean<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.220> they<00:02:14.490> don't<00:02:14.700> seem<00:02:15.000> that

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
mean is that they don't seem that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.090 
mean is that they don't seem that
mandate<00:02:15.600> they've<00:02:15.840> got<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.050> creaminess<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.710> them

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
mandate they've got a creaminess to them

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.620 
mandate they've got a creaminess to them
so<00:02:17.820> they're<00:02:18.780> almost<00:02:18.990> like<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.350> semi<00:02:19.800> man<00:02:20.630> not

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
so they're almost like a semi man not

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.560 
so they're almost like a semi man not
quite<00:02:22.160> completely<00:02:23.160> mad<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.760> not<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.240> creamy

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
quite completely mad and not that creamy

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.010 
quite completely mad and not that creamy
so<00:02:24.930> they're<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.260> between<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:27.270> color<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.810> get

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
so they're in between the color you get

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.050 
so they're in between the color you get
in<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.320> bully<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:29.130> basically<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.910> third

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
in the bully is basically the third

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.850 
in the bully is basically the third
color<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.750> get<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.230> your<00:02:31.260> lips<00:02:31.620> the
