first I thought this story about the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.750 
first I thought this story about the
Prancing<00:02:18.620> elites<00:02:18.950> because<00:02:19.160> that's<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.580> name

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
Prancing elites because that's the name

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.820 
Prancing elites because that's the name
of<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.930> group<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.430> thought<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.490> was<00:02:22.580> funny<00:02:22.790> I

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
of the group I thought it was funny I

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.180 
of the group I thought it was funny I
thought<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.040> know<00:02:25.840> an<00:02:26.890> accident<00:02:27.890> like<00:02:27.980> that

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
thought you know an accident like that

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.330 
thought you know an accident like that
in<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.490> red<00:02:28.700> state<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:30.680> can<00:02:30.710> imagine<00:02:31.250> that

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
in a red state and you can imagine that

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.030 
in a red state and you can imagine that
they're<00:02:31.520> super<00:02:31.670> outgoing<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:33.800> just

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
they're super outgoing and it just

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.520 
they're super outgoing and it just
struck<00:02:34.220> me<00:02:34.400> as<00:02:34.520> comical<00:02:35.140> but<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.200> don't<00:02:36.410> really

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
struck me as comical but I don't really

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.170 
struck me as comical but I don't really
think<00:02:36.650> it's<00:02:36.980> all<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.400> funny<00:02:37.910> anymore

think it's all that funny anymore

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.280 
think it's all that funny anymore
