00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.099
 so our new smartphone is really 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.990
 latest modern mtk processor 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.460
 6589 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:18.690
 let's look at its characteristics 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:24.650
 antutu so here it is wonderful 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:30.539
 number 13 thousand what is his result so 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:36.719
 more detailed it looks like this 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:45.739
 so so information collected by 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:50.930
 the device has its name from 96 2 0 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.930
 mtk 6589 processor 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.340
 graphics accelerator 544 IPC Why 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.610
 exactly the same graphic 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.729
 Accelerator installed on samsung galaxy 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.780
 s4 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:14.509
 which is the last but also respectively 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.909
 it's gigabytes of ram so 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.300
 main camera 8 and front camera 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.300
 say 5 is amazingly interesting 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.700
 will test how much it is 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.710
 matches 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.649
 so well and let's compare with someone 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.899
 from known but for example 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:40.720
 samsung galaxy s3 compare 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:44.050
 so I remind you that the processor mtk 6589 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.429
 two or three times more 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.530
 energy efficient than the one that 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:53.810
 installed on samsung galaxy s3 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.229
 if you pay attention then again by 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:02.689
 to all parameters he is about a quarter 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:04.009
 loses samsung'a from 96 2 0 well 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.840
 except naturally graphic 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.470
 accelerator this again is due to 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:15.200
 that this graphics accelerator is also 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.959
 installed on galaxy s4 if we 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.440
 you will be equal to some 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.440
 study ivan x 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.850
 too, our results will be such 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.330
 We will lose interest in the 7 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.340
 performance 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.380
 so we have samsung galaxy 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.720
 note 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:42.790
 but here is the advantage of a 96 20 I just do not 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.459
 raises doubts and all that 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.540
 it is very energy efficient processor 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:52.920
 processor from that we will see more than once 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.920
 our reviews will show thanks
