00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.790 
him I've been looking for these guys for
a<00:00:24.510> while<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:24.869> where<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> get<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> while

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
a while now where I get that for a while

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.470 
a while now where I get that for a while
I<00:00:25.830> guess<00:00:25.890> since<00:00:26.189> they<00:00:26.279> came<00:00:26.460> out<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> yeah<00:00:29.480> you

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
I guess since they came out so yeah you

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.420 
I guess since they came out so yeah you
get<00:00:30.570> Optimus<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.080> Megatron<00:00:31.170> Optimus<00:00:32.099> has<00:00:32.250> his

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
get Optimus and Megatron Optimus has his

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.030 
get Optimus and Megatron Optimus has his
trailer<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.630> think<00:00:34.050> overall<00:00:34.350> Optimus

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
trailer and I think overall Optimus

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.990 
trailer and I think overall Optimus
looks<00:00:35.280> more<00:00:36.149> natural<00:00:36.890> plugged<00:00:37.890> into<00:00:38.219> his

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
looks more natural plugged into his

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.260 
looks more natural plugged into his
launcher<00:00:39.920> but<00:00:40.920> Megatron<00:00:41.309> does<00:00:41.550> peg<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> lot

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
launcher but Megatron does peg in a lot

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.310 
launcher but Megatron does peg in a lot
more<00:00:42.450> securely<00:00:42.899> into<00:00:43.140> his<00:00:43.410> uh<00:00:45.079> whatever<00:00:46.079> his

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
more securely into his uh whatever his

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.260 
more securely into his uh whatever his
tank<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.770> doing<00:00:47.070> he<00:00:47.370> does<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.879> g1

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
tank is doing he does have like a g1

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.069

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
inspired can appear as well but but he

as you pick it up he kind of droops a
little<00:01:18.810> bit<00:01:18.960> because<00:01:19.259> he<00:01:19.350> doesn't<00:01:19.560> peg<00:01:19.799> in

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
little bit because he doesn't peg in

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.190 
little bit because he doesn't peg in
quite<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.340> salty<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.670> Megatron<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.659> well<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.049> he

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
quite as salty as Megatron as well as he

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.630 
quite as salty as Megatron as well as he
doesn't<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.530> anything<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.950> hold<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.430> halves

box shots I think you just push down on
this<00:01:48.240> gun<00:01:48.479> right<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.590> flips<00:01:49.829> out

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
this gun right here and it flips out

couple<00:02:01.890> little<00:02:02.189> cannons<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.670> flip<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.210> from

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
couple little cannons that flip out from

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.840 
couple little cannons that flip out from
the<00:02:03.540> inside<00:02:03.869> here<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:05.340> give<00:02:05.460> him<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> little

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the inside here to give him a little

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.559 
the inside here to give him a little
attack<00:02:06.390> base<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:06.899> well<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.970> then<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.119> push

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
attack base as well and then you push

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.870 
attack base as well and then you push
this<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.929> these<00:02:10.080> levers<00:02:10.289> back

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
this to these levers back

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.160 
this to these levers back
and<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.060> kind<00:02:12.210> of<00:02:12.240> have<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.390> hold<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.930> like

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
and you kind of have to hold it in like

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.780 
and you kind of have to hold it in like
right<00:02:13.380> here<00:02:13.770> because<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.310> back<00:02:14.490> bumper

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
right here because the back bumper

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.040 
right here because the back bumper
serves<00:02:15.210> as<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.750> launch<00:02:16.680> button<00:02:17.010> as<00:02:17.660> well<00:02:18.660> as<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
serves as a launch button as well as the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.320 
serves as a launch button as well as the
cannon<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.710> just<00:02:20.460> push<00:02:20.640> down<00:02:20.820> on<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.000> cannon

cannon so just push down on the cannon

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.450 
cannon so just push down on the cannon
again<00:02:21.570> once<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.260> locked<00:02:22.500> back<00:02:22.710> it'll

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
again once this is locked back it'll

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.400 
again once this is locked back it'll
fire<00:02:23.760> these<00:02:24.000> two<00:02:24.240> things<00:02:24.450> forward<00:02:24.930> which

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
fire these two things forward which

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.730 
fire these two things forward which
launches<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.890> bot<00:02:26.040> shot<00:02:26.810> now<00:02:27.810> only<00:02:28.080> Optimus

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
launches the bot shot now only Optimus

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.310 
launches the bot shot now only Optimus
and<00:02:28.860> Megatron<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.610> attach<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.630> trailer<00:02:31.110> mode

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
and Megatron can attach in trailer mode

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.500 
and Megatron can attach in trailer mode
but<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.250> use<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.000> launchers<00:02:33.360> to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
but you can use the the launchers to

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.660 
but you can use the the launchers to
launch<00:02:33.720> any<00:02:33.960> boss<00:02:34.200> shot<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.770> I'm<00:02:35.490> gonna

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
launch any boss shot you have I'm gonna

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.160 
launch any boss shot you have I'm gonna
get<00:02:35.820> make<00:02:36.060> without<00:02:36.270> this<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> same<00:02:37.020> thing

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
get make without this is the same thing

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.360 
get make without this is the same thing
push<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.500> back<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:38.010> either<00:02:38.100> push

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
push it back and you can either push

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.340 
push it back and you can either push
down<00:02:38.550> here<00:02:39.000> or<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> back<00:02:39.870> bumper<00:02:40.110> to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
down here or on the back bumper to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.000 
down here or on the back bumper to
launch<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.930> basically<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.350> just<00:02:43.410> fires<00:02:43.740> them

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
launch and basically it just fires them

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.700 
launch and basically it just fires them
at<00:02:44.190> each<00:02:44.340> other<00:02:48.230> didn't<00:02:49.230> get<00:02:49.350> quite<00:02:49.530> far

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
from making contact let me back these up

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.130 
from making contact let me back these up
off<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.210> screen<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> little<00:02:54.750> bit<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:54.960> launch

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140

version of Megatron tends to have a
habit<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.320> kind<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.650> just<00:03:29.160> popping<00:03:29.550> up<00:03:29.700> on<00:03:30.270> his

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
habit of kind of just popping up on his

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.720 
habit of kind of just popping up on his
he's<00:03:31.020> he<00:03:31.470> unfolds<00:03:31.950> but<00:03:32.040> he<00:03:32.130> ends<00:03:32.280> up<00:03:32.370> just<00:03:32.460> kind

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
he's he unfolds but he ends up just kind

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.700 
he's he unfolds but he ends up just kind
of<00:03:32.790> popping<00:03:33.090> up<00:03:33.270> like<00:03:33.420> that

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
of popping up like that

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.470 
of popping up like that
on<00:03:35.370> his<00:03:35.610> feet<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.590> really<00:03:37.770> all<00:03:37.860> depends<00:03:38.480> but

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
on his feet so it really all depends but

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.630 
on his feet so it really all depends but
they<00:03:39.630> do<00:03:39.690> both<00:03:39.990> pop<00:03:40.710> up<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.040> it's<00:03:41.490> kind<00:03:41.610> of

like<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.970> stays<00:03:42.600> facedown<00:03:43.080> but<00:03:43.290> pops<00:03:43.500> open

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
like that stays facedown but pops open

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.780 
like that stays facedown but pops open
but<00:03:45.930> they<00:03:46.350> do<00:03:46.440> pop<00:03:46.650> open<00:03:46.830> like<00:03:47.460> every<00:03:47.730> other

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
but they do pop open like every other

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.770 
but they do pop open like every other
pot<00:03:48.060> shot<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:49.860> just<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.130> show<00:03:50.310> off<00:03:50.630> how<00:03:51.630> they

pot shot and just to show off how they

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.910 
pot shot and just to show off how they
work<00:03:56.810> will<00:03:57.810> launch<00:03:58.020> it<00:03:58.230> launched<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.650> couple

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
work will launch it launched a couple

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.420 
work will launch it launched a couple
different<00:03:59.160> gene<00:03:59.280> put<00:03:59.400> prowl<00:03:59.700> in<00:03:59.850> here<00:04:00.300> and

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
different gene put prowl in here and

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.410 
different gene put prowl in here and
sitting<00:04:02.430> all<00:04:02.610> over<00:04:02.820> here<00:04:03.140> in<00:04:04.140> Megatron's

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.770 

like<00:04:09.020> that<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.470> they<00:04:09.620> do<00:04:09.680> launch<00:04:10.570> just<00:04:11.570> as

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
like that and they do launch just as

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.509 
like that and they do launch just as
well<00:04:11.960> as<00:04:13.270> the<00:04:14.270> other<00:04:14.390> boss<00:04:14.630> shots<00:04:14.900> again<00:04:15.710> that

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
well as the other boss shots again that

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.410 
well as the other boss shots again that
one<00:04:16.670> probably<00:04:16.850> would<00:04:17.030> have<00:04:17.090> worked<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.329> little

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
one probably would have worked a little

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.630 
one probably would have worked a little
better<00:04:17.600> except<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.380> ramps<00:04:18.739> on<00:04:18.890> here<00:04:19.130> sit<00:04:19.370> up<00:04:19.400> a

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
better except the ramps on here sit up a

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.099 
better except the ramps on here sit up a
little<00:04:19.760> higher<00:04:19.970> they<00:04:20.630> don't<00:04:20.810> go<00:04:20.930> all<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.049> way

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
little higher they don't go all the way

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.330 
little higher they don't go all the way
down<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.440> floor<00:04:21.590> cuz<00:04:21.890> otherwise<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.310> just

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
down to the floor cuz otherwise you just

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.280 
down to the floor cuz otherwise you just
kind<00:04:22.640> of<00:04:22.670> Ram<00:04:22.910> your<00:04:23.150> bought<00:04:23.810> shot<00:04:24.020> into<00:04:24.230> the

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
kind of Ram your bought shot into the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.540 
kind of Ram your bought shot into the
floor<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:24.620> he'd<00:04:24.770> just<00:04:24.800> transform<00:04:25.370> when<00:04:25.460> he

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
floor and he'd just transform when he

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.590 
floor and he'd just transform when he
hit<00:04:27.670> yeah<00:04:28.670> and<00:04:28.850> then<00:04:28.970> you<00:04:29.030> just<00:04:29.150> fold<00:04:29.300> up<00:04:29.480> the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
hit yeah and then you just fold up the

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.920 
hit yeah and then you just fold up the
guns<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:31.250> flip<00:04:31.520> up<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.760> panels<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.420> then

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
guns and flip up the panels and then

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.520 
guns and flip up the panels and then
same<00:04:33.230> on<00:04:33.380> Megatron<00:04:33.830> just<00:04:34.040> put<00:04:34.220> these<00:04:34.370> up<00:04:35.530> you

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
same on Megatron just put these up you

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.950 
same on Megatron just put these up you
also<00:04:36.650> want<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:36.950> flip<00:04:37.130> up<00:04:37.280> this<00:04:37.430> thing<00:04:37.810> watch<00:04:38.810> it

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
also want to flip up this thing watch it

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.450 
also want to flip up this thing watch it
all<00:04:39.020> together<00:04:39.140> and<00:04:39.710> then<00:04:40.100> you<00:04:40.160> just<00:04:40.340> take

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
all together and then you just take

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.620 
all together and then you just take
Optimus<00:04:40.940> he<00:04:41.570> just<00:04:41.750> plugs<00:04:42.050> right<00:04:42.260> in<00:04:43.450> on<00:04:44.450> the

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
Optimus he just plugs right in on the

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.030 
Optimus he just plugs right in on the
bottom<00:04:44.930> there<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:45.260> like<00:04:45.470> I<00:04:45.530> said<00:04:45.650> Megatron

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
bottom there and like I said Megatron

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.620 
bottom there and like I said Megatron
plugs<00:04:46.340> in<00:04:47.110> on<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.230> bottom<00:04:48.590> as<00:04:48.740> well<00:04:48.980> as<00:04:49.630> onto

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
plugs in on the bottom as well as onto

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.110 
plugs in on the bottom as well as onto
these<00:04:50.750> two<00:04:50.960> pegs<00:04:50.990> up<00:04:51.410> here<00:04:51.680> and<00:04:52.130> then<00:04:52.880> you<00:04:52.910> have

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
these two pegs up here and then you have

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.550 
these two pegs up here and then you have
them<00:04:53.300> back<00:04:53.480> in<00:04:53.810> their<00:04:54.740> vehicle<00:04:55.190> modes<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:57.440> yeah

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
them back in their vehicle modes so yeah

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.110 
them back in their vehicle modes so yeah
knit<00:04:57.800> see<00:04:57.919> little<00:04:58.130> devices<00:04:58.370> if<00:04:58.669> you<00:04:58.760> have<00:04:58.880> BOTS

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
knit see little devices if you have BOTS

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.230 
knit see little devices if you have BOTS
shots<00:04:59.440> you<00:05:00.440> can<00:05:00.590> launch<00:05:00.830> several<00:05:01.130> spot<00:05:02.000> shots

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
shots you can launch several spot shots

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.870 
shots you can launch several spot shots
at<00:05:02.360> a<00:05:02.390> time<00:05:02.600> out<00:05:02.840> of<00:05:02.960> them

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
at a time out of them

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.200 
at a time out of them
are<00:05:04.880> they<00:05:05.030> necessary<00:05:05.540> know<00:05:06.790> about<00:05:07.790> most<00:05:07.970> about

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
are they necessary know about most about

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.230 
are they necessary know about most about
Megatron<00:05:08.660> to<00:05:08.780> have<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:08.960> counterpart<00:05:09.530> to

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
Megatron to have a counterpart to

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.310 
Megatron to have a counterpart to
Optimus<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.330> think<00:05:11.480> Optimus<00:05:11.810> looks<00:05:11.990> cool<00:05:12.200> with

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
Optimus I think Optimus looks cool with

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.890 
Optimus I think Optimus looks cool with
this<00:05:12.380> trailer<00:05:12.760> and<00:05:13.760> also<00:05:14.090> because<00:05:14.330> I<00:05:14.360> like<00:05:14.750> the
