what to do with and we'll try to train

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.610 
what to do with and we'll try to train
these<00:01:00.120> guys<00:01:00.359> overnight<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.230> something<00:01:01.530> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
these guys overnight for something that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.049 
these guys overnight for something that
normally<00:01:01.739> takes<00:01:01.949> three<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:02.280> five<00:01:02.550> years<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
normally takes three or five years and

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.990 
normally takes three or five years and
we're<00:01:03.629> doing<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.519> accelerated<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.729> thing

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
we're doing this accelerated the thing

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.210 
we're doing this accelerated the thing
that<00:01:06.180> was<00:01:06.299> very<00:01:06.390> scary<00:01:06.960> part<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> problem

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
that was very scary part of the problem

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.969 
that was very scary part of the problem
during<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.790> period<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.210> time<00:01:09.299> was<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:10.650> had<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
make sure that the American public

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.710 
make sure that the American public
didn't<00:01:13.530> lose<00:01:13.770> confidence<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.640> air<00:01:15.119> traffic

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720

other<00:01:18.060> part<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.930> my<00:01:19.080> job<00:01:19.350> during<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
other part of my job during that was a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.410 
other part of my job during that was a
spin<00:01:21.930> control<00:01:22.280> we<00:01:23.280> had<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.549> send<00:01:23.850> little

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
spin control we had to send little

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.359 
spin control we had to send little
tricks<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.900> out<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.409> says<00:01:25.619> how<00:01:25.830> great<00:01:26.189> and

wonderful we are and how the system is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.520 
wonderful we are and how the system is
as<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:28.979> today<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.600> year<00:01:30.990> ago<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
as good today as it was a year ago and

as good today as it was a year ago and
not<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.890> worry<00:01:31.920> about<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.579> right<00:01:33.090> after<00:01:33.270> they

California twice in one week to midair
collisions<00:01:39.590> we<00:01:40.590> had<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.890> construct<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:42.119> twix

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
collisions we had to construct a twix

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.679 
collisions we had to construct a twix
that<00:01:42.869> says<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.979> system<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.729> safer<00:01:45.390> now<00:01:45.659> than

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
that says the system is safer now than

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.639 
that says the system is safer now than
it<00:01:46.229> was<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.890> year<00:01:47.009> ago<00:01:47.540> which<00:01:48.540> was<00:01:48.960> impossible

technical country on the planet how can

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.789 
technical country on the planet how can
we<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.700> American<00:02:06.270> citizens<00:02:06.450> say<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.619> is

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
we as American citizens say there is

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.490 
we as American citizens say there is
somebody<00:02:08.129> someplace<00:02:08.759> else<00:02:09.119> who<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.229> more

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
somebody someplace else who was more

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.620 
somebody someplace else who was more
technical<00:02:11.160> than<00:02:11.190> us<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:12.239> can

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
technical than us that can

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.780 
technical than us that can
from<00:02:13.050> one<00:02:13.230> plant<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.830> other<00:02:14.010> when<00:02:14.580> we're

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
from one plant to the other when we're

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.310 
from one plant to the other when we're
having<00:02:14.940> problems<00:02:15.300> getting<00:02:15.630> across<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
having problems getting across the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.900 
having problems getting across the
country<00:02:16.650> without<00:02:16.800> running<00:02:17.250> into<00:02:17.430> each<00:02:17.580> other

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
country without running into each other

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.350 
country without running into each other
so<00:02:18.630> there<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.110> problem<00:02:19.500> with<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.580> mindset

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
so there is a problem with the mindset

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.420 
so there is a problem with the mindset
we<00:02:21.810> don't<00:02:22.020> want<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.440> American<00:02:22.980> public<00:02:23.400> to

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
think that we ought number one and and

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.100 
think that we ought number one and and
we<00:02:28.350> want<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.680> make<00:02:28.710> sure<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.220> understand<00:02:29.820> that
