00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
hour battery let's go ahead give it a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.939 
hour battery let's go ahead give it a
drive<00:00:18.570> see<00:00:18.900> how<00:00:18.960> quick<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.380> whether<00:00:19.680> that's

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
drive see how quick it is whether that's

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:28.450 
drive see how quick it is whether that's
worth<00:00:20.160> your<00:00:20.460> carbine<00:00:20.850> buck

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.950

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
so the I me looks like a golf cart and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.780 
so the I me looks like a golf cart and
it<00:00:31.140> dries<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> golf<00:00:31.980> cart<00:00:32.250> there's<00:00:32.610> not

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
it dries like a golf cart there's not

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.729 
it dries like a golf cart there's not
much<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.390> that's<00:00:33.570> practical<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.379> that<00:00:34.530> goes

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
much here that's practical and that goes

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.979 
much here that's practical and that goes
