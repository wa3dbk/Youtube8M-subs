launching from about the end of this
the<00:02:13.400> ugly<00:02:13.520> truth<00:02:13.910> book<00:02:14.500> which<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:15.530> when

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
the ugly truth book which is when

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.690 
the ugly truth book which is when
launchers<00:02:16.220> now<00:02:16.930> okay<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:19.100> this<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
launchers now okay so this is the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.260 
launchers now okay so this is the
distance<00:02:20.500> but<00:02:21.500> they<00:02:21.680> all<00:02:21.860> made<00:02:22.090> over<00:02:23.090> there

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
distance but they all made over there

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.520 
distance but they all made over there
that<00:02:23.510> one<00:02:23.750> thing<00:02:24.170> right<00:02:24.410> there<00:02:24.740> is<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.760> Carl

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
that one thing right there is the Carl

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.490 
that one thing right there is the Carl
that's<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.680> proof<00:02:27.800> all<00:02:28.040> wash<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.500> they're

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
that's the proof all wash and they're

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.410 
that's the proof all wash and they're
right<00:02:30.770> there<00:02:31.040> we've<00:02:31.580> got<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.880> far<00:02:32.060> this<00:02:32.240> is

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
right there we've got the far this is
