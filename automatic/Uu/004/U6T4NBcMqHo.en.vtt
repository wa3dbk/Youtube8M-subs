00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:03.219 
consider this at the highest but you
know<00:05:00.919> for<00:05:01.129> streaming<00:05:01.399> definitely<00:05:02.229> acceptable

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
know for streaming definitely acceptable

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.639 
know for streaming definitely acceptable
and<00:05:03.519> probably<00:05:04.519> even<00:05:04.579> better<00:05:04.729> than<00:05:04.999> acceptable

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:05.649 
and probably even better than acceptable

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:07.899 
and probably even better than acceptable
