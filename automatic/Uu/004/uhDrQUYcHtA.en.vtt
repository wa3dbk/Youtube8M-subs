half<00:06:35.410> hitch<00:06:35.620> tool<00:06:35.919> back<00:06:36.160> towards<00:06:36.580> me<00:06:36.759> too<00:06:37.090> and

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
half hitch tool back towards me too and

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.230 
half hitch tool back towards me too and
that<00:06:38.050> helped<00:06:38.259> slide<00:06:38.680> those<00:06:38.889> off<00:06:39.130> I'll<00:06:39.789> do<00:06:40.030> this

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
that helped slide those off I'll do this

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.850 
that helped slide those off I'll do this
three<00:06:40.509> times<00:06:41.039> and<00:06:42.039> then<00:06:42.460> I'll<00:06:42.610> pull<00:06:43.090> back<00:06:43.860> away

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
three times and then I'll pull back away

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.360 
three times and then I'll pull back away
from<00:06:45.190> me<00:06:45.370> to<00:06:45.669> secure<00:06:46.180> that<00:06:46.360> third<00:06:46.659> loop<00:06:47.590> you're

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 
from me to secure that third loop you're

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.610 
from me to secure that third loop you're
tightening<00:06:48.759> that<00:06:49.060> so<00:06:49.449> then<00:06:49.840> I'll<00:06:49.960> do<00:06:50.139> a<00:06:50.169> second

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
tightening that so then I'll do a second

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:58.080 
tightening that so then I'll do a second
set<00:06:50.860> of<00:06:50.889> three<00:06:51.280> one<00:06:52.620> two<00:06:53.620> three<00:06:56.669> pull<00:06:57.669> it<00:06:57.849> to

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
set of three one two three pull it to

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:08.490 
set of three one two three pull it to
secure<00:06:58.539> it<00:06:59.190> clip<00:07:01.740> clip<00:07:02.740> the<00:07:02.889> thread<00:07:06.599> add<00:07:07.599> some

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
secure it clip clip the thread add some

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.550 
secure it clip clip the thread add some
glue<00:07:08.800> to<00:07:08.830> the<00:07:09.580> thread<00:07:10.270> wrap<00:07:10.509> to<00:07:10.930> secure<00:07:11.380> them

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 
glue to the thread wrap to secure them

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.920 
glue to the thread wrap to secure them
and<00:07:12.280> there<00:07:12.520> you<00:07:12.669> have<00:07:12.699> the<00:07:14.219> redfish<00:07:15.219> seducer

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
and there you have the redfish seducer

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:21.419 
and there you have the redfish seducer
using<00:07:16.930> the<00:07:17.110> whiting<00:07:18.030> impact<00:07:19.030> and
