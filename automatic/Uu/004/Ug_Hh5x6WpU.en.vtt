one<00:01:43.740> which<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:44.939> would<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.450> good<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
one which I think would be good for the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.539 
one which I think would be good for the
size<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.399> my<00:01:47.579> ear<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.659> big<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.159> so<00:01:50.159> this

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
size of my ear and the big one so this

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.149 
size of my ear and the big one so this
is<00:01:50.610> what<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.210> put<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.689> aside<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:53.009> is

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
is what you can put it aside and this is

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.160 
is what you can put it aside and this is
the<00:01:53.280> interesting<00:01:53.640> part<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.390> really<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the interesting part I really like it

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.530 
the interesting part I really like it
it's<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.770> kind<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.340> an<00:01:56.460> adapter<00:01:57.000> for<00:01:57.030> wipe

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it's a kind of like an adapter for wipe

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.870 
it's a kind of like an adapter for wipe
so<00:01:58.110> basically<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:58.950> use<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.520> laptop

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
so basically you can use it on a laptop

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.270 
so basically you can use it on a laptop
which<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.780> becomes<00:02:01.560> actually<00:02:02.040> with<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
which we becomes actually with the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.870 
which we becomes actually with the
different<00:02:03.079> ports<00:02:04.079> for<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.350> mic<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
different ports for the mic and the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.119 
different ports for the mic and the
headphone<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.750> see<00:02:07.170> I'm<00:02:07.680> not<00:02:07.890> sure<00:02:08.009> whether

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
