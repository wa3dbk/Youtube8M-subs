inch<00:02:14.260> adapter<00:02:15.420> another<00:02:16.420> one<00:02:16.600> here<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.870> will

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
inch adapter another one here that will

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.500 
inch adapter another one here that will
fit<00:02:17.260> into<00:02:17.410> this<00:02:17.620> female<00:02:18.069> in<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.550> these<00:02:19.330> are

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
fit into this female in and these are

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.280 
fit into this female in and these are
1/2<00:02:19.690> inch<00:02:19.930> threaded<00:02:20.830> them<00:02:21.100> both<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.459> plugs<00:02:22.290> and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
1/2 inch threaded them both in plugs and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.530 
1/2 inch threaded them both in plugs and
then<00:02:23.530> these<00:02:24.070> parts<00:02:24.430> comes<00:02:24.610> with<00:02:24.820> them<00:02:25.000> thermos

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
then these parts comes with them thermos

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.229 
then these parts comes with them thermos
thermostatic<00:02:26.200> valve<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.620> screw<00:02:26.890> in<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:28.120> this

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
thermostatic valve that screw in so this

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.030 
thermostatic valve that screw in so this
is<00:02:28.360> put<00:02:28.540> on<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.660> tee<00:02:28.959> as<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.500> cold<00:02:29.830> water

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
is put on a tee as a cold water

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.880 
is put on a tee as a cold water
basically<00:02:30.610> will<00:02:30.760> come<00:02:30.910> in<00:02:31.030> here<00:02:31.620> goes<00:02:32.620> up<00:02:32.769> to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
basically will come in here goes up to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.530 
basically will come in here goes up to
the<00:02:32.980> faucet<00:02:33.190> also<00:02:33.940> comes<00:02:34.120> over<00:02:34.330> here<00:02:34.510> and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
the faucet also comes over here and

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.770 
the faucet also comes over here and
mixes<00:02:34.930> in<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.920> thermostatic<00:02:36.550> valve<00:02:36.780> so

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
mixes in to the thermostatic valve so

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.600 
mixes in to the thermostatic valve so
the<00:02:37.900> cold<00:02:38.140> hot<00:02:38.410> mixes<00:02:38.860> this<00:02:39.100> goes<00:02:39.280> your<00:02:39.489> hot

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
the cold hot mixes this goes your hot

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.009 
the cold hot mixes this goes your hot
water<00:02:39.850> tank<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:40.300> this<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.540> your<00:02:40.660> hot<00:02:40.780> water

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
water tank so this is your hot water

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.880 
water tank so this is your hot water
feed<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.440> let's<00:02:41.769> just<00:02:41.860> call<00:02:42.190> water<00:02:42.400> feed<00:02:42.700> in
