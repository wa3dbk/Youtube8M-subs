00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.400
 Hi, guys, how are you? 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.949
 well I am goian and today I bring you a 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.560
 new theory called the corrupt gems 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.259
 taken from steven's theories page 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.169
 universe punto blogspot.com that without more 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.300
 let's start talking about it through 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.869
 of the course of the steven series 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.879
 universe 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.219
 Steven and the Crystal Jens have fought 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.379
 against multiple enemies especially 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.940
 gigantic monsters and creatures 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.530
 hostile towards anyone who is 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.600
 go through these have been the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.489
 main antagonists of the series and 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.190
 apparently the main objective of 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.110
 Amethyst garnett and pearl crystals 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.750
 gems have the goal of winning and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.370
 contain these creatures especially 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.230
 for the safety of humans and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.480
 possibly safeguard some 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.640
 key places of its culture has been 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.770
 revealed that rose quartz the mother of 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.750
 steven could never heal the gems 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.820
 corrupt beings turned into monsters and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.829
 reverse the effect but if he had the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.320
 power to heal damaged gems in a 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.149
 been early with your tears 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.100
 Steven is capable of this but with his 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.109
 saliva shown when I repair the gem 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.300
 of amethyst and even fixed the view 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.490
 with and yet managed to have a 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.530
 of success with a corrupt gem the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.570
 centipede who in the end sacrificed his 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.640
 life to save steven by showing that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.240
 it is possible to cure them in some way in 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.880
 this case love and understanding the gems 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.560
 corrupt were once normal already 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.600
 has revealed thanks to pearl that the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.550
 Corrupt gems are essentially gems 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.370
 normal as a pearl or amethyst that have 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.570
 been corrupted for some reason 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.940
 abandoning its human natural state 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.100
 possibly to be damaged in battle and 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.650
 transforming into bestial versions 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.480
 from his old self a very clear example 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.700
 is the centipede gem in the episode 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.800
 monster buddy is bar friends monsters 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.630
 where you can observe briefly in 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.910
 its transformation a humanoid figure 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.040
 before transforming completely into 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.440
 a monster when steven breaks the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.880
 bubble that kept her trapped on 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.950
 centipede does not manage to have the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.110
 complete transformation instead 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.450
 it becomes a smaller version of 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.550
 this one I will show a theory 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.960
 that goes through my head about the phases 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.600
 that a gem can have in the 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.850
 the course of his life 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.430
 possible states of corruption of the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.620
 gems I have noticed that a corrupt gem is 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.380
 able to have states or phases according to 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.840
 develops his shift in her clarified 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.910
 for me the state of corruption of a 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.280
 crystal hem is caused by the damage that 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.410
 it has in its main gem still in 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.180
 the series does not explain if there is another 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.340
 way to achieve that state by leaving 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.260
 intact to the gem first state the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.480
 first state is neither more nor less than the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.490
 natural state of a crystal gene is the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.280
 stable physical and mental state of 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.080
 any crystal healthy gene second 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.180
 state is caused by damage 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.490
 considerable to the gem in this can be 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.680
 observe the slow deterioration as a physical 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.900
 and mental of a crystal gene like it does 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.670
 amethyst evidence having difficulties 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.400
 of keeping certain parts of your body 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.600
 stable to transform 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.730
 involuntarily or reordering from a 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.010
 random form and loss of control 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.500
 state of pre corruption 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.360
 scams especially I have problems of 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.220
 order it due to different evidences 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.260
 that has left the series of how the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.330
 corruption of a gem can occur 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.310
 in different ways and the ability to 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.560
 this one to bear it is possible that 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.300
 there are different types of corruption 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.400
 affect in a particular way to 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.560
 different gems in this example is 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.599
 pencil who despite his gem is 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.310
 broken does not show deterioration of control 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.530
 of his body as he did amethyst 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.360
 previously although it is unable to 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.580
 use your powers in all capacity 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.319
 as it is to fly in this state it 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.300
 shows how the gem has lost 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.730
 complete control of some of his powers 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.590
 like loss of reasoning is 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.870
 begins to notice the hostile character in 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.940
 their acts and selfish way of thinking the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.940
 gem still has consciousness and control 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.470
 Stable on your body and actions 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.810
 pencils the clearest example of this 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.549
 phase she lost one of her powers but 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.019
 he still manages to control his being 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.269
 staying in his human form 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.760
 losing some traits like their 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.830
 eyes and their wings healing is possible 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.780
 of the gem in this state as 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.670
 proves steven third state of 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.829
 corruption as in the phase 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.690
 earlier in this phase I have my doubts about 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.760
 where does it occur because the 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.979
 wild version of the gem is presented 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.990
 in a lesser or weaker way I do not know if 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.030
 it comes before or after the gem 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.860
 is completely corrupted because 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.510
 it may be a version about to be 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.040
 cured or about to transform 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.930
 completely the 3rd 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.330
 of corruption is the state of corruption 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.400
 complete pre of a gem in this the 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.350
 wild version of a gem seizes 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.240
 of it losing control and skill 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.860
 to preserve their human state as well 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.680
 of the loss of consciousness and 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.810
 intelligence about your actions in this 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.670
 phase the gem is hostile to other 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.920
 crystal gems because it feels 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.960
 threatened by them as demonstrated by the 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.090
 centipede when looking at the garnett pearl and 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.310
 amethyst your physique is transformed 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.470
 completely in an animal version 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.660
 of the original gem its behavior and 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.160
 way of acting makes a lot of reference to 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.590
 that of a puppy of any animal 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.360
 wild though you can show affection and 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.690
 understanding of commands and words 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.430
 simple full phase of corruption this 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.680
 is the last phase that presents a 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.450
 crystal gene with a corrupted gem in 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.280
 this gem is presented as a 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.920
 monstrous version of what ever 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.720
 it was a normal gem these gems have been 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.370
 the main antagonist of the series 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.140
 whose only way to stop them 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.810
 exposing them in bubbles for their 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.850
 containment occurs a total loss of 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.740
 control of the gem over your body and 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.540
 acts of this acting only for 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.000
 Wild survival instincts 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.520
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.890
