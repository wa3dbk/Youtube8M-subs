is phenomenally good the atlas hardware

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.849 
is phenomenally good the atlas hardware
is<00:01:00.270> great<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.960> i've<00:01:01.020> done<00:01:01.230> videos<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.710> this

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
is great and i've done videos on this

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.709 
is great and i've done videos on this
before<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.820> what<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.120> does<00:01:03.270> essentially

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
before because what it does essentially

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.750 
before because what it does essentially
is<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.019> eliminates<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.739> need<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.189> drill<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
is it eliminates the need to drill the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.880 
is it eliminates the need to drill the
shell<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:06.630> things<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.110> floor<00:01:07.470> tom<00:01:07.650> leg

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
shell for things like floor tom leg

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.120 
shell for things like floor tom leg
brackets<00:01:08.369> Spurs<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.780> Tom<00:01:10.020> holder<00:01:10.409> if<00:01:10.590> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
brackets Spurs and a Tom holder if you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.250 
brackets Spurs and a Tom holder if you
look<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> mounted<00:01:11.880> tom<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.900> there's<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
look at the mounted tom this there's a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.160 
look at the mounted tom this there's a
bracket<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.979> replaces<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> lug<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
bracket here that replaces a lug and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.200 
bracket here that replaces a lug and
then<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.590> also<00:01:16.830> have<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.460> same<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
then you also have the same thing on the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.929 
then you also have the same thing on the
bass<00:01:18.390> drum<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:19.020> two<00:01:19.619> brackets<00:01:20.130> that

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
bass drum you have two brackets that

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.300 
bass drum you have two brackets that
take<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> place<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.630> two<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.140> lugs<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
take the place of two of the lugs the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.039 
take the place of two of the lugs the
threads<00:01:23.640> go<00:01:24.030> right<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.330> there<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.750> for

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
threads go right in there for the for

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.010 
threads go right in there for the for
the<00:01:25.110> tension<00:01:25.590> rods<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.580> rail<00:01:26.880> slides<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.630> to

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the tension rods this rail slides in to

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.990 
the tension rods this rail slides in to
the<00:01:28.140> bracket<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.460> don't<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.790> drill

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the bracket and you don't have to drill

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.940 
the bracket and you don't have to drill
the<00:01:30.119> bass<00:01:30.270> drum<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:31.350> take<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.650> bracket

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the bass drum you can take this bracket

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.230 
the bass drum you can take this bracket
and<00:01:32.189> move<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> anywhere<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.850> want<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and move it anywhere you want on the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.609 
and move it anywhere you want on the
time<00:01:33.450> actually<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.140> came<00:01:34.290> out<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
time actually when it came out of the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.620 
time actually when it came out of the
factory<00:01:35.009> they<00:01:35.490> moved<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> little<00:01:36.210> too<00:01:36.390> close

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
factory they moved it a little too close

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.179 
factory they moved it a little too close
to<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.200> actually<00:01:37.380> should<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:37.770> facing

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
to this this actually should be facing

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.859 
to this this actually should be facing
the<00:01:38.340> front<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.030> move<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> bracket<00:01:39.479> over

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.620 
where you don't have to drill the shell
the<00:01:50.220> way<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.850> done<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the way this is done is you have the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.969 
the way this is done is you have the
same<00:01:51.810> thing<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> same<00:01:52.560> bracket

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
same thing you have the same bracket

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.609 
same thing you have the same bracket
that<00:01:53.100> replaces<00:01:53.640> lugs<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:55.229> creates<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
that replaces lugs and it creates a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.080 
that replaces lugs and it creates a
suspension<00:01:56.009> system<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.670> floor<00:01:56.880> time

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
suspension system for the floor time

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.630 
suspension system for the floor time
legs<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:58.259> they're<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:58.619> great<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
legs so they're really great and it

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.580 
legs so they're really great and it
creates<00:01:59.909> an<00:02:00.030> isolation<00:02:00.600> system<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.170> it's

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
creates an isolation system and it's

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.499 
creates an isolation system and it's
also<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.860> portability<00:02:02.310> issue<00:02:02.670> as<00:02:02.909> well<00:02:03.090> very

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
also a portability issue as well very

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.389
