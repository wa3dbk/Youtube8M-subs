00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.400 

Rebecca<00:00:03.520> so<00:00:03.700> far<00:00:03.940> it's<00:00:04.630> been<00:00:04.750> fast<00:00:05.170> and

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:05.410 
Rebecca so far it's been fast and

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
Rebecca so far it's been fast and
furious<00:00:05.710> you<00:00:05.859> know<00:00:05.980> we're<00:00:06.100> trying<00:00:06.279> to<00:00:06.340> get

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.430 
furious you know we're trying to get

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.270 
furious you know we're trying to get
figured<00:00:06.760> out<00:00:06.850> but<00:00:07.149> I<00:00:07.720> think<00:00:08.710> the<00:00:08.830> system<00:00:09.040> they

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.280 
figured out but I think the system they

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.340 
figured out but I think the system they
had<00:00:09.430> in<00:00:09.550> place<00:00:09.670> before<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:11.050> know<00:00:11.170> had<00:00:11.320> some

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 
had in place before you know had some

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.290 
had in place before you know had some
similar<00:00:11.800> concepts<00:00:12.310> and<00:00:12.520> so<00:00:12.670> it's<00:00:13.090> been<00:00:13.270> a

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.300 
similar concepts and so it's been a

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.240 
similar concepts and so it's been a
pretty<00:00:13.510> smooth<00:00:13.810> transition<00:00:14.410> thus<00:00:14.740> far<00:00:14.950> I

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
pretty smooth transition thus far I

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.640 
pretty smooth transition thus far I
think<00:00:15.280> they're<00:00:15.910> all<00:00:16.000> competing<00:00:16.330> hard<00:00:16.689> and<00:00:16.930> all

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
think they're all competing hard and all

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.190 
think they're all competing hard and all
great<00:00:17.949> kids<00:00:18.220> and<00:00:18.430> of<00:00:18.789> all<00:00:18.940> bought<00:00:19.570> in<00:00:19.780> so

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
developing quarterback so they're a

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.969 
developing quarterback so they're a
smart<00:01:36.580> group<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:37.180> that's<00:01:37.390> really<00:01:37.600> helped<00:01:37.810> me

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
heard so we're just trying to get them

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.370 
heard so we're just trying to get them
to<00:01:54.939> do<00:01:55.210> things<00:01:55.390> our<00:01:55.659> way<00:01:55.689> that's<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.200> main

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
to do things our way that's the main

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.920 
to do things our way that's the main
thing<00:01:56.409> any<00:01:56.770> habits<00:01:57.100> ahead<00:01:57.400> just<00:01:58.390> fittest<00:01:58.689> fit

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
thing any habits ahead just fittest fit

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.859 
thing any habits ahead just fittest fit
them<00:01:59.049> in<00:01:59.110> our<00:01:59.259> system<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:01.479> think<00:02:01.630> about<00:02:01.689> the

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
them in our system you think about the

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.260 
them in our system you think about the
running<00:02:02.079> back<00:02:02.200> or<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.560> got<00:02:02.590> here<00:02:02.920> this

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
running back or you got here this

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.999 
running back or you got here this
this<00:02:03.450> would<00:02:04.170> guess<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.680> probably<00:02:04.799> about

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
this would guess this is probably about

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.709 
this would guess this is probably about
as<00:02:05.250> deep<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.549> talented<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:06.000> bunch<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.479> had

getting<00:02:42.569> better<00:02:42.750> every<00:02:42.959> day<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.349> Darrell<00:02:43.799> you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
getting better every day and Darrell you

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.870 
getting better every day and Darrell you
know<00:02:44.099> it's<00:02:44.250> still<00:02:44.400> getting<00:02:44.610> used<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
know it's still getting used to the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.750 
know it's still getting used to the
speed<00:02:45.120> we<00:02:45.329> play<00:02:45.540> at<00:02:45.920> but<00:02:46.920> once<00:02:47.430> he<00:02:47.579> gets

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
speed we play at but once he gets

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.910 
speed we play at but once he gets
physically<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.299> think<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.569> little<00:02:48.690> stronger<00:02:49.200> it

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
physically I think a little stronger it

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.050 
physically I think a little stronger it
would<00:02:50.220> have<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.459> chance<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.790> be<00:02:50.849> really<00:02:51.030> good

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
would have a chance to be really good
