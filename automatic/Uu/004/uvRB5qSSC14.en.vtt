00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 and well it touches c max at the center max 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.230
 graf have resolutely and today 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.830
 we meet for the first video 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.960
 so this is a tutorial of how well 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.059
 set to the small fine as well as 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.580
 basic parameters to have the most fs 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.060
 possible and therefore less slip on 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.520
 Minecraft 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.029
 so I remind that at the small fine is 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.330
 add that she was detailed performance 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.460
 animations and others 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.009
 so I'm going to show you how 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.350
 all well set so all customers 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.750
 on your eyes so has it already we're going 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.320
 see how much to how many species I 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.760
 turns so years norman years in blood and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.340
 loire it is beautiful settings so good 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.260
 I have enough of my computer but you 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.910
 make a difference later if you 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:58.410
 had really a lot so me there I 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:02.340
 is running right now so 20 20 fps 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.199
 about 24 fps 22 when I'm really 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.740
 in motion sometimes it can really 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.909
 go down so we'll see we're going to 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.610
 put in the best we will be well 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.549
 quiet so optional so video 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.320
 setting so already graphics graphics 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:26.450
 you put fast smooth lighting you 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.299
 put of lava it changes nothing 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.340
 so I had here admit normal finally 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.170
 associate advisers because otherwise 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.900
 after your path when comes your 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.479
 field of vision it's like being in 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.329
 very small we could see watching a 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.510
 very small it's not terrible to play 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.820
 so 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.420
 I advise but normal weather like 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.850
 everyone britney have joined 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.590
 desired as you want so that's 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:02.710
 very important fox you put of 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 texture servers you put of so 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.180
 then ander distance in this are 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.330
 important if you put dini 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:18.760
 performance you put max fps wibaut 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.620
 bing you put of advanced sound open 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.950
 gl vd ostentation 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.170
 jank loading you put mistakes and 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:33.340
 ford start 0.8 so by passing all of 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:38.160
 continued with the quality so minimal to paul 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:42.180
 level so you put off 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:50.860
 so wait a little long time 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:53.380
 max and hop so here is then nice to 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.910
 tropics filtering you put of 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.300
 customers water you put of better 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.380
 thanks you put of custom make up 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.320
 of either color you put of as 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.769
 the tec texture you noted off that quits 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:16.300
 skyview and and so offers a statin 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:19.900
 clown so here you put in his 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:26.980
 mines and is neither a real center like 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:33.640
 it's not Russian then anti aliasing 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:37.000
 you put of london fashion wilton batna 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.660
 where do you put off that this theme how 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.660
 you put 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:49.730
 of organic funds you c on off and 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:53.390
 natural texture vote gold so to infinity 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:59.560
 for the world qualities not his name at 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:04.910
 detail so clouds we put you of 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:09.860
 wwii on the rise i'm you put some 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:18.680
 faults water you put faults sky 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:24.040
 you put in the sun and moon trial 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:29.690
 especially the focus on dialogue 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:32.150
 desired men jon eaton mistakes 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.900
 you put items on or was 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.900
 fake excuses me 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:42.440
 so are you put on off thanks 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:45.460
 so put winehouse faults you 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:52.360
 put mistakes 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:57.470
 starz you put wait on use of 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:01.120
 shocked capua was off and the item all 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:06.130
 types get mounts off 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:10.360
 so that's the details 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.680
 so then we pass performance 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.490
 then the performance is very easy 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:20.090
 so what beauty fps of the flagship host you 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.750
 put of shock update spurs frime 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.250
 la France 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.520
 how do you say excuse me I have bad 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.880
 please put yourself a layman 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.630
 turkish landing leave you offs either 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.229
 you leave more lojack I had 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.250
 off and dynamic days off 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.539
 so that's what was performance 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.780
 so it went very quickly we do not have 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:44.129
 a lot of money we asked national xi 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.050
 very easy 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.459
 so me it was on you put in 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.919
 down to luff 

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:52.339
 So that's already done so it's 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.779
 true that in the game there will be less of 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:56.219
 animation and so on but hey it's not 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.860
 very annoying but you really 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:06:02.929
 a lot more fps than if you put on 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:14.009
 So here we are and for what is 

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:17.309
 other so you put on the eraser 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:22.999
 and to weather you was child without 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:28.949
 full screen change mme mete 3d 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:32.129
 anaglyph whipping of dbacks profilers 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:34.979
 you put of time mistakes 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:37.439
 fust the mode of faults and autosave 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:42.419
 three minutes so that's important because 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:46.199
 otherwise it every two seconds 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:48.659
 you save the game and so it's a little 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.399
 there guy all three have all 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:51.619
 two seconds so it is three meters 

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:56.669
 minutes 

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:59.039
 so that's for what settings 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:01.199
 so now we'll see at 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:03.679
 how much fps I shoot as it should have 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.679
 improve a little 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:14.249
 so as you can see I turn 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:18.290
 at 30 fps just now I was before I 

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:21.600
 earned 10 fps but knowing that I 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:26.070
 that I hit open so for 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.940
 save so before I'm between 30 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.500
 or 40 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:33.000
 finally 40 or 50 fps so that's it 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.530
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.580
 and we meet again for the next 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:38.250
 video 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.110
 so maybe it will not be a tutorial 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:45.470
 I hope to start adventures or 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:45.470
 denver game i'm going to chao the world
