 Hey guys 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.680
 today we also have the archer 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.510
 stayed here 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.989
 so how I put it there in the forum 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.989
 I did not accuse the game of forgetting it down here. 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.339
 So I formed that I created the ones that go there and that one 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 six or normally enter the game 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.930

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.800
 What's missing is this. 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.800
 to negotiate it 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.370

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.420

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.210
