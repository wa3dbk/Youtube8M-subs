00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.930
 So something to move in the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.110
 Today 's apartment offers the best of the world 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.250
 currently this is the variant 2 12 213 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.859
 as the current model is currently of the 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.580
 video and although I have something for 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.020
 you come 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.180
 More to get the phasing out model 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.590
 and once the current model 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.630
 I'll show you stepped on the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.000
 different so you see and that 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.700
 actually we are big changed 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.070
 the flights on the side are 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.160
 permeable to others are so strong 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.410
 padded and front was hands on it 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.360
 is with the other one in the net area 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.239
 on it and here is practically the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.910
 history I personally tend 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.070
 know more about the newer model because 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.930
 I think there are little backpacks around 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.449
 the windows or the flights too big and 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.090
 I think only at 30 35 liter backpack 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.890
 I could use bigger finns nothing 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.420
 and next to each other 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.520
 Still, if I have both backpacks 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.830
 Of course, you can only be ultra class 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.920
 Look here you see practically high 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.020
 quality everything was very nice 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.350
 but here in direct comparison had 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.380
 that the house is modeled on the net and 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.119
 the current model here firmly otherwise 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.220
 something good comes out so small 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.030
 prudent and here has the thick 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.650
 padding and here you have one easy 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.840
 in the new model a slight 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.460
 padding open here 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.920
 would have to look what makes you feel better 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.720
 I like tend rather something like that 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.570
 with the device rather easier things 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.189
 So carry helmet or belt 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.290
 maybe hang in a few shoes 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.229
 and he is traveling in warmer history 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.869
 But if you were looking for what 50 you 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.820
 sports hero or the impeccable 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.369
 backpack more I want to you 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.560
 do not say big except one on the rhine too 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.440
 then you see the whole thing because they are 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.770
 also practically identical 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.930
 you can head to Cyprus with your helmet head 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.840
 a commission of the can your piece 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.660
 turn it on and that it's a model good 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.610
 fast video says zack zack because 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.200
 otherwise I'll bore you sometimes 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.060
 because I have you in detail 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.100
 presented and that is nothing big 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.250
 other than the front of the pocket bit 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.500
 different and behind the fans the wings 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.150
 I'm a little bit different 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.150
 like you a link with the below underneath
