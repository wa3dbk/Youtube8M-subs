rich on the Maserati while ago which got
me<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.630> couple<00:00:12.809> levels<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.889> figured<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.340> throw

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
me a couple levels so I figured I throw

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.250 
me a couple levels so I figured I throw
them<00:00:14.790> here<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.330> course<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.870> use<00:00:16.049> those

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
them here and of course I use those

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.080 
them here and of course I use those
lamps<00:00:16.500> on<00:00:16.710> her<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.890> crafting<00:00:17.279> because<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.910> me

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
lamps on her in crafting because to me

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.730 
lamps on her in crafting because to me
that's<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> only<00:00:18.900> logical<00:00:19.050> thing<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> use

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
that's the only logical thing to use

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.609 
that's the only logical thing to use
them<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:21.150> had<00:00:21.300> 78<00:00:21.689> agility<00:00:22.170> from<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
them on so we had 78 agility from the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.980 
them on so we had 78 agility from the
the<00:00:23.010> XP<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.670> then<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.820> believe<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.150> got<00:00:24.269> 78<00:00:24.750> room

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the XP and then I believe we got 78 room

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.070 
the XP and then I believe we got 78 room
crafting<00:00:25.380> also<00:00:25.650> oh<00:00:25.680> no<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.369> had<00:00:26.490> 77<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.330> then

crafting also oh no we had 77 and then

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.560
