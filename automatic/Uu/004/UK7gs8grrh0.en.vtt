00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
update on the Civilization three cheat

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.160 
update on the Civilization three cheat
now<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.670> she<00:00:17.880> did<00:00:18.119> turn<00:00:18.330> out<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.690> be<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> glitch

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
now that she did turn out to be a glitch

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.580 
now that she did turn out to be a glitch
because<00:00:19.680> if<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.550> had<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:21.810> vanilla<00:00:22.289> version

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
because if you had the vanilla version

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.320 
because if you had the vanilla version
of<00:00:22.920> civilization<00:00:23.670> through<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> very<00:00:24.119> first

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
of civilization through the very first

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330 
of civilization through the very first
version<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.630> was<00:00:24.810> released<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.010> bottom

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
version that was released in the bottom

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.310 
version that was released in the bottom
corner<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.060> title<00:00:27.630> menu<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.019> would<00:00:28.140> say

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
corner of the title menu it would say

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.429 
corner of the title menu it would say
version<00:00:28.710> 1.0<00:00:29.460> seven<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.199> version

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
version 1.0 seven so in that version

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.910 
version 1.0 seven so in that version
this<00:00:31.769> cheat<00:00:32.160> did<00:00:32.399> work<00:00:33.320> but<00:00:34.320> then<00:00:34.500> later<00:00:34.739> on

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
went to the Advisory menu you could

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.970 
went to the Advisory menu you could
upgrade<00:00:50.910> your<00:00:51.239> military<00:00:51.600> units<00:00:52.050> fortify<00:00:52.800> them

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
from there but one of the big things in

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
from there but one of the big things in
my<00:00:56.850> opinion<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> changed<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.559> it

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
my opinion that it changed was that it

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.590 
my opinion that it changed was that it
patched<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.460> cheat<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.570> before<00:01:01.190> in<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.600> 1.07

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
patched this cheat so before in the 1.07

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.580 
patched this cheat so before in the 1.07
update<00:01:04.250> you<00:01:05.250> could<00:01:05.519> extend<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> zeros<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
update you could extend the zeros up to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.179 
update you could extend the zeros up to
I<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.250> was<00:01:08.400> 20<00:01:08.790> million<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.950> AI

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
I think it was 20 million and the AI

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.390 
I think it was 20 million and the AI
would<00:01:11.640> accept<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.119> which<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:12.990> weird

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
would accept that which was really weird

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.330 
would accept that which was really weird
but<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.460> was<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> cool<00:01:14.939> glitch<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.740> 1.29

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
but it was a cool glitch but in the 1.29

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.109 
but it was a cool glitch but in the 1.29
F<00:01:17.640> update<00:01:18.060> they<00:01:18.750> limited<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.290> zeroes<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
F update they limited the zeroes to

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.520 
F update they limited the zeroes to
200,000<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.570> AI<00:01:21.750> won't<00:01:22.080> accept<00:01:22.409> it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
200,000 and the AI won't accept it

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.590 
200,000 and the AI won't accept it
anymore<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.520> now<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> problem<00:01:24.270> because

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
anymore so now we have a problem because

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.969 
anymore so now we have a problem because
if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.070> update<00:01:27.060> 1.29<00:01:27.689> F<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.590> cheat

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
if you have the update 1.29 F this cheat

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.499 
if you have the update 1.29 F this cheat
won't<00:01:29.159> work<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.060> probably

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
won't work for you so this is probably

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.090 
won't work for you so this is probably
why<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.780> won't<00:01:31.170> work<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.590> most<00:01:31.740> people

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
why it won't work for most people

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.289 
why it won't work for most people
because<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.490> bet<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.939> lot<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> people

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
because I bet you a lot of people

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.840 
because I bet you a lot of people
updated<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.340> check<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.670> by
