we'll<00:00:04.370> guess<00:00:05.370> they<00:00:05.490> came<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:05.850> way<00:00:09.559> okay<00:00:10.639> hit

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
we'll guess they came this way okay hit

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.160 
we'll guess they came this way okay hit
him<00:00:11.730> with<00:00:11.820> an<00:00:11.910> overcharge<00:00:12.300> if<00:00:12.720> you'd<00:00:12.870> overload

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
him with an overcharge if you'd overload

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.310 
him with an overcharge if you'd overload
at<00:00:13.260> least<00:00:13.380> one<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.650> his<00:00:13.710> systems<00:00:14.240> you<00:00:15.240> do<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.540> me

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
at least one of his systems you do it me

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.710 
at least one of his systems you do it me
fired<00:00:17.279> up<00:00:17.400> just<00:00:17.880> pull<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> trigger<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.570> let

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
fired up just pull the trigger and let

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.300 
fired up just pull the trigger and let
go<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.080> super<00:00:19.440> easy<00:00:21.830> if<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.949> doesn't<00:00:23.220> do

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
go it's super easy if it doesn't do

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.130 
go it's super easy if it doesn't do
anything<00:00:23.490> but<00:00:23.670> make<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.939> bad<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.510> already<00:00:24.990> made

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
anything but make it bad I already made

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.269 
anything but make it bad I already made
it<00:00:25.170> bad<00:00:25.380> once<00:00:25.619> when<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.890> didn't<00:00:26.070> really<00:00:26.189> work

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
it bad once when that didn't really work

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.920 
it bad once when that didn't really work
out<00:00:26.550> very<00:00:26.580> well<00:00:26.850> what<00:00:27.269> well<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:27.869> just

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
out very well what well it's just

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.870 
out very well what well it's just
improvised<00:00:28.650> yeah<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> don't<00:00:29.369> feel<00:00:29.550> entirely

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
improvised yeah I don't feel entirely

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:57.199 
improvised yeah I don't feel entirely
comfortable<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.720> answer<00:00:53.030> you<00:00:55.819> know<00:00:56.819> it

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:57.209 
comfortable with that answer you know it

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:58.250 
comfortable with that answer you know it
looks<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.359> you<00:00:57.510> overloaded<00:00:57.959> his<00:00:58.019> time

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
looks like you overloaded his time

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.750 
looks like you overloaded his time
distortion<00:00:58.739> unit<00:00:58.979> you<00:00:59.279> must<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.549> caused

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
distortion unit you must have caused

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.430 
distortion unit you must have caused
some<00:00:59.879> kind<00:00:59.999> of<00:01:00.089> inversion<00:01:00.389> instead<00:01:01.139> of<00:01:01.229> making

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
some kind of inversion instead of making

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.490 
some kind of inversion instead of making
everything<00:01:01.649> else<00:01:01.859> slow<00:01:02.159> it<00:01:02.459> made<00:01:02.699> em<00:01:02.999> slow

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
everything else slow it made em slow

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.130 
everything else slow it made em slow
yeah<00:01:04.530> score<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:05.579> the<00:01:05.850> fastest<00:01:06.509> are<00:01:07.020> you

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
yeah score one for the fastest are you

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.459 
yeah score one for the fastest are you
like<00:01:07.609> um<00:01:08.609> doc<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.600> wouldn't<00:01:10.020> get<00:01:10.079> too<00:01:10.229> close<00:01:10.350> to

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
like um doc I wouldn't get too close to

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.529 
like um doc I wouldn't get too close to
him<00:01:10.710> if<00:01:10.859> I<00:01:10.950> were<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.280> why<00:01:11.609> what's<00:01:12.149> he<00:01:12.210> gonna<00:01:12.270> do

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
him if I were you why what's he gonna do

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.240 
him if I were you why what's he gonna do
beat<00:01:13.079> me<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.289> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> course<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.920> next<00:01:13.979> two

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
beat me up of the course the next two

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.039 
beat me up of the course the next two
weeks<00:01:14.460> well<00:01:14.820> technically<00:01:15.539> he's<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:15.780> actually

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
weeks well technically he's not actually

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.109 
weeks well technically he's not actually
moving<00:01:16.469> slower<00:01:16.859> he's<00:01:17.460> moving<00:01:17.789> at<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.969> same

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
moving slower he's moving at the same

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.940 
moving slower he's moving at the same
speed<00:01:18.179> just<00:01:18.719> go<00:01:18.840> over<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> longer<00:01:19.350> period<00:01:19.530> of

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
speed just go over a longer period of

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.550 
speed just go over a longer period of
time<00:01:20.009> huh<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.240> relativistic<00:01:21.929> his<00:01:22.229> best

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
time huh it's relativistic his best

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.200 
time huh it's relativistic his best
still<00:01:22.770> travels<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.219> the<00:01:23.250> same<00:01:23.429> velocity<00:01:23.579> we

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
still travels at the same velocity we

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.639 
still travels at the same velocity we
just<00:01:24.390> view<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.600> from<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.899> faster<00:01:25.200> time<00:01:25.350> frame

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
just view it from a faster time frame

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.469 
just view it from a faster time frame
therefore<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.429> looks<00:01:26.609> slowed<00:01:26.969> down<00:01:27.210> but

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
therefore it looks slowed down but

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.819 
therefore it looks slowed down but
theoretically<00:01:27.719> it<00:01:28.049> should<00:01:28.229> still<00:01:28.560> carry<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
theoretically it should still carry the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:38.179 
theoretically it should still carry the
same<00:01:29.070> force<00:01:30.499> now<00:01:31.499> see<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.700> moving<00:01:32.880> taller

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.620 

see<00:01:39.189> that's<00:01:39.789> what<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:39.969> get<00:01:40.149> for<00:01:40.270> arguing

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
see that's what you get for arguing

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.039 
see that's what you get for arguing
science<00:01:41.110> stupid<00:01:41.860> bitch<00:01:42.159> lemons<00:01:43.000> give<00:01:43.659> me<00:01:43.750> this

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
science stupid bitch lemons give me this

00:01:44.049 --> 00:02:09.839 
science stupid bitch lemons give me this
wall

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.610

00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:35.470 

this<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.400> another<00:02:51.610> batch

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.790 

because<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.630> wasn't<00:03:36.840> driving<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.590> was

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
because that wasn't driving that was

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:48.229 
because that wasn't driving that was
flying<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.430> burning<00:03:45.920> all<00:03:46.920> this<00:03:47.130> why<00:03:47.819> can't<00:03:48.120> be

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
flying and burning all this why can't be

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:55.340 
flying and burning all this why can't be
kill<00:03:48.450> all<00:03:48.630> of<00:03:48.660> us<00:03:52.160> okay<00:03:53.660> this<00:03:54.660> is<00:03:54.780> not<00:03:54.959> going<00:03:55.260> to
