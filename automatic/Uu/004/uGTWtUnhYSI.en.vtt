00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.400
 welcome back reviews friends for hd 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.170
 this new video in which we will go to 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.809
 do lambo xing and review of 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.640
 tripod amazon basic tripod 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.230
 let's start to see what it contained 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.769
 the box I already removed the tripod 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.150
 for 13 we go to see inside 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.910
 as you can see the box is enough 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.460
 simple very compact we go to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.529
 there was no opening it immediately inside 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.920
 nothing that since we find the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.960
 easel inserted in the practical bag 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.180
 attached precisely this 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.450
 tripod the bag as you see 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.510
 here it is as you see very simple 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.780
 we also have the lace to put it on 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.309
 collapse or to transport it anyway 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.370
 more comfortable way 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.829
 here we then have the hinge that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.020
 allows you to open it up to the middle perhaps 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.090
 there would also have been an ace having a 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.090
 slightly longer and facilitate extraction 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.710
 however we say that there is not this one 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.590
 big problem regarding extraction 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.180
 or the insertion of the stand 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.610
 inside his practical bag 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.310
 we can therefore see what is done 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.840
 this amazon tripod that starts from 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.820
 a height of 50.8 cm to then regard 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.979
 up to one meter and 22 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.080
 this can be lengthened 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.180
 further reaching one meter e 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.170
 fifty two they go to intervene 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.240
 up in this support unscrewing this 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:40.350
 support and operating with this crank 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.970
 you go to raise or lower your foot 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.399
 central that allows to reach 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.560
 a considerably higher height 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.149
 let's talk about the materials that like 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.590
 you see they are very solid a lot 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.500
 even the joints are resistant 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.740
 plastic but they are excellent then the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.610
 easel 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.159
 very firm here we have how you see the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.140
 hook to increase the stability of 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.930
 this easel then housing 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.380
 obviously weights that will go to 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.870
 placing it further on the ground was 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.480
 funds maybe even disconnected here 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.370
 below we have the feet as you see 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.470
 they are adjustable and therefore there is no 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.360
 problem for the inclined soil 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.370
 excellent versatility of this 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.450
 easel 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.049
 so let's go and see for the part 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.080
 superior in the meantime we find 22 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.959
 levels that allow us to check 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:40.680
 the balance level of the 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:43.590
 easel here as you see there is a bubble 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.340
 so going to unscrew this a 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:55.330
 rotate this you can intervene as 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:57.430
 see on the angle of the here it is 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.950
 I'll show you the angle from here 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.480
 as you see the bubble moves a part 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.660
 to the other and then we will have to go to 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.790
 finish to get the right one 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.760
 angulation 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.370
 then obviously you have to do this 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.410
 type of operation to fix not 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.109
 allow the easel to change 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:25.420
 the angle here is going to intervene 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:26.739
 to rotate the central turret here 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.200
 let's go to fix it because otherwise 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.519
 it seems that this decline is little 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.160
 stable but on the contrary it is definitely a 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.340
 product that we recommend to everyone without 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.880
 go then spend over 30 euros 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.130
 for stands that cost the manufacturer 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.359
 the same as what it cost to amazon but 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.769
 which then theoretically offer the same in 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.170
 theory is also practically the same 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.540
 quality what to tell you about this 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.239
 easel 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.340
 we have seen a little of everything in general 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:05.760
 possibility to customize the 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.549
 main tower there is this support 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.269
 you go to regular 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:15.440
 as you see here the angle for 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:19.729
 being able to do vertical sight 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:24.870
 the last thing I show you is the 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:28.590
 here it is support that works 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.360
 practically like the classics you find 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.199
 in any other type of tripod 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.680
 that is, you have to raise this insert here 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:41.840
 the camera or video camera in the 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:47.580
 special slots then go to 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:51.930
 turn this this spring and finally 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.310
 close once your 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.320
 your shooting device 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.780
 camera is going to be inserted 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.669
 here as you can see there is a small one 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.710
 it will therefore still be necessary to climb uphill 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:08.780
 go do this here see how 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:12.510
 now it has gone down you will go to 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.570
 place it here so here's right here 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.770
 happens the insertion is crushed here 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.659
 the insertion and then it goes to close again 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.260
 a very stable stand recommended 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:27.960
 you all see it is very simple 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:32.039
 very light you can very well take 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.300
 with one hand completely 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.449
 functional for any type of 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.400
 framing for any type of 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:41.639
 even inclined surface 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.530
 excellent good shock resistance 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:47.550
 transportability thanks also to the 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:50.750
 practical custody and what to tell you promoted to 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.639
