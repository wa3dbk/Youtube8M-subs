00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
great victory for our team tonight I

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.540 
great victory for our team tonight I
think<00:00:09.690> they<00:00:09.990> played<00:00:10.500> pretty<00:00:10.800> well<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.280> little

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
think they played pretty well a little

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.129 
think they played pretty well a little
bit<00:00:11.700> sloppy<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.300> second<00:00:12.719> half<00:00:12.870> but<00:00:13.080> I

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
bit sloppy in the second half but I

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.919 
bit sloppy in the second half but I
think<00:00:13.549> San<00:00:14.549> Jose<00:00:14.849> deserves<00:00:15.269> credit<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:15.719> that

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
think San Jose deserves credit for that

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.170 
think San Jose deserves credit for that
the<00:00:16.139> way<00:00:16.260> they<00:00:16.440> hung<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.160> there<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.760> never

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the way they hung in there and never

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.150 
the way they hung in there and never
quit<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.660> attacked<00:00:19.199> us<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.619> made<00:00:19.920> things

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
quit and attacked us and made things

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.880 
quit and attacked us and made things
difficult<00:00:20.279> oh<00:00:20.820> yeah<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.750> sure<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.960> mean<00:00:22.260> you

know I just think that our guys came out

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.230 
know I just think that our guys came out
a<00:00:24.420> lot<00:00:24.600> more<00:00:24.810> confident<00:00:25.260> than<00:00:25.289> them<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.240> you

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
a lot more confident than them and you

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.790 
a lot more confident than them and you
know<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.720> did<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> great<00:00:28.289> job<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.500> sticking

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
know we did a great job of sticking

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.620 
know we did a great job of sticking
together<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> back<00:00:29.550> being<00:00:29.880> being<00:00:30.330> really

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
together in the back being being really

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.999 
together in the back being being really
close<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.380> challenging<00:00:31.800> for

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.320

what<00:01:04.140> Landon<00:01:04.439> as<00:01:04.530> well<00:01:04.680> making<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.220> good<00:01:06.119> runner

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
what Landon as well making a good runner

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.940 
what Landon as well making a good runner
I<00:01:06.600> made<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> good<00:01:07.080> running<00:01:07.290> behind<00:01:07.470> me<00:01:07.799> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
I made a good running behind me and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.500 
I made a good running behind me and
landings<00:01:08.760> always<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> find<00:01:09.390> yourself

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
landings always going to find yourself

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.320 
landings always going to find yourself
and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.920> think<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.369> was<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.490> difference<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and I think that was the difference that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.120 
and I think that was the difference that
we<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.540> players<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.900> conformed<00:01:13.560> little

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
we have players that conformed little

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.600 
we have players that conformed little
pockets<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:16.040> can<00:01:17.040> cause<00:01:17.220> them<00:01:17.460> problems

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
pockets in and can cause them problems

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.210 
pockets in and can cause them problems
and<00:01:18.210> certainly<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.020> did<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.290> very<00:01:19.860> happily

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and certainly we did that very happily

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.330 
and certainly we did that very happily
of<00:01:20.340> course<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:22.350> know<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.650> was<00:01:22.770> disappointed

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
of course you know we was disappointed

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.380 
of course you know we was disappointed
after<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.729> first<00:01:23.939> leg<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.720> think<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:26.390> we

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
after the first leg but I think we we

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.420 
after the first leg but I think we we
knew<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.869> could<00:01:28.320> score<00:01:28.740> against<00:01:28.979> this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
knew that we could score against this

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.770 
knew that we could score against this
thing<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.380> knew<00:01:31.560> what<00:01:31.770> they<00:01:31.920> could<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.310> so

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
thing and we knew what they could do so

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.060 
thing and we knew what they could do so
we<00:01:33.780> were<00:01:33.900> confident<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.740> think<00:01:34.950> we

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
we were confident and I think we

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.249 
we were confident and I think we
recovered<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:35.790> well<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.090> said<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.140> know

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
team and they know how to respond when

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.660 
team and they know how to respond when
things<00:01:54.869> go<00:01:55.320> against<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.039> we<00:01:56.520> actually

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
things go against you and we actually

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.109 
things go against you and we actually
thought<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.030> played<00:01:57.329> okay<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:58.460> Sunday<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.640> were

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
thought we played okay on Sunday we were

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.060 
thought we played okay on Sunday we were
little<00:02:00.329> unlucky<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.469> thought<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:01.829> did

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
little unlucky and we thought if we did

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.249 
little unlucky and we thought if we did
the<00:02:02.189> same<00:02:02.399> tonight<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.570> luck<00:02:03.719> might<00:02:03.929> change<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the same tonight the luck might change a

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.169 
the same tonight the luck might change a
little<00:02:04.380> bit<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.189> thought<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.090> were

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
little bit and I thought we were

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.710 
little bit and I thought we were
terrific<00:02:06.439> throughout<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.619> game<00:02:08.539> enough<00:02:09.539> for

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
terrific throughout the game enough for

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.110 
terrific throughout the game enough for
a<00:02:09.780> little<00:02:09.959> better<00:02:10.220> could<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.340> scored<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:12.000> lot

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
a little better could have scored a lot

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.930 
a little better could have scored a lot
of<00:02:12.269> goals<00:02:12.420> tonight<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.470> think<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.190> helps<00:02:14.790> us

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
of goals tonight and I think it helps us

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.989 
of goals tonight and I think it helps us
a<00:02:15.090> lot<00:02:15.120> going<00:02:15.480> into<00:02:15.540> Sunday
