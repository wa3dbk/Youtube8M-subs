what how do you even think about this

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.830 
what how do you even think about this
like<00:00:34.890> that's<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.280> ugly<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.600> damn

like that's so ugly I was like damn
kallik<00:00:37.559> out<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:38.820> you're<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> build<00:00:39.660> off

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
kallik out so if you're in the build off

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.150 
kallik out so if you're in the build off
Kyle<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.440> pretty<00:00:41.100> harsh<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.730> people<00:00:42.230> so<00:00:43.230> he's

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
Kyle is pretty harsh on people so he's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.680 
Kyle is pretty harsh on people so he's
probably<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> harder<00:00:45.059> judges<00:00:45.539> were

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
probably one of the harder judges were

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.299 
probably one of the harder judges were
pretty<00:00:45.960> mean<00:00:46.170> brighter<00:00:46.440> pretty<00:00:46.739> lenient<00:00:47.039> but

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
pretty mean brighter pretty lenient but

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.790 
pretty mean brighter pretty lenient but
Kyle<00:00:47.550> Hill<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.239> he'll<00:00:48.570> let<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.930> known<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.440> he

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
Kyle Hill it he'll let be known that he

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.880 
Kyle Hill it he'll let be known that he
doesn't<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.280> something<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.829> expect<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
doesn't like something so I expect that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.260 
doesn't like something so I expect that
when<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> build<00:00:53.520> off<00:00:53.610> results<00:00:54.030> come<00:00:54.180> out

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
when the build off results come out

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.090 
when the build off results come out
which<00:00:54.660> hopefully<00:00:55.050> will<00:00:55.289> come<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.590> later<00:00:55.620> this

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
which hopefully will come out later this

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.729 
which hopefully will come out later this
week<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:57.120> need<00:00:57.449> Brad<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.960> Kyle's<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.559> at

week I need Brad and Kyle's get on at

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.049 
week I need Brad and Kyle's get on at
the<00:00:58.800> same<00:00:58.920> time<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.579> judge<00:00:59.820> because

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the same time so we can judge because

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.510 
the same time so we can judge because
there's<00:01:00.390> some<00:01:00.539> new<00:01:00.960> builds<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> Kyle<00:01:02.250> hasn't

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
there's some new builds and Kyle hasn't

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.310 
there's some new builds and Kyle hasn't
seen<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.969> them<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.480> know<00:01:03.539> Brad<00:01:03.899> hasn't

seen all of them and I know Brad hasn't

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.440 
seen all of them and I know Brad hasn't
seen<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> couple<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.070> hopefully<00:01:06.030> they<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.270> on

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
seen a couple so hopefully they get on

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.719 
seen a couple so hopefully they get on
and<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.990> judge<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.500> by<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.250> end<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.520> week

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and we can judge in by the end this week

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.609 
and we can judge in by the end this week
have<00:01:08.939> them<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.450> i'll<00:01:09.840> show<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.140> mine<00:01:10.380> so

have them out so i'll show you mine so

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.500 
have them out so i'll show you mine so
the<00:01:10.830> reason<00:01:10.979> i<00:01:11.130> made<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.460> was<00:01:11.670> one<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.299> if

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the reason i made this was one to see if

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.880 
the reason i made this was one to see if
i<00:01:12.630> could<00:01:12.659> do<00:01:12.990> something<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.409> pretty<00:01:13.710> good

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
i could do something that's pretty good

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.580 
i could do something that's pretty good
because<00:01:14.580> people<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.960> first<00:01:16.170> build<00:01:16.439> off

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
because people in the first build off

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.120 
because people in the first build off
and<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> second<00:01:17.280> build<00:01:17.400> off<00:01:17.520> head<00:01:17.790> told<00:01:18.240> me

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
and the second build off head told me

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.030 
and the second build off head told me
that<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.460> wasn't<00:01:20.640> enough<00:01:20.970> room<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:22.200> build<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
that it wasn't enough room to build a

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.460 
that it wasn't enough room to build a
nice<00:01:23.280> house<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.880> not<00:01:24.840> everybody<00:01:25.259> but
