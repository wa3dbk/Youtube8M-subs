 is it better relish yes after all, but not 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.780
 if I look, Iâ€™ll go over there 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.370
 anything but if the touch was then 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.930
 Of course a penalty so it could be 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.220
 free bet 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.229
 where the hole is realized memory is still very 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.570
 good game really me very 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.540
 it's a shame even somewhere that was when empty 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.310
 tribunes, that is, viewers 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.160
 I liked it probably was very funny 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.030
 and there and there is a biting bite immediately 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.340
 rush on 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.280
 but this his yara times handkerchief 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.570
 since it is different in this can 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.150
 stop scrub 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:19.220
 and pierce unexpectedly to be shot on 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.640
 of course you should know 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.769
 these notes are nuances equal to the main point 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.690
 gave the work area great to hang out with 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.959
 eliminated such a little episode and such 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.470
 male Huskies have already chosen maxims Boers 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.810

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.210
 fun football was attacked and those and 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.100
 others ie nobody ain't closed 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.970
 no one was going there 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.170
 game this land that is played and both 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:58.770
 other games will throw so from whom sen 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:00.540

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.790
 make claims that is elbow and 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.130

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.240
 will be in three rounds on all people would 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:31.050
 let's finish with a letter 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:33.050
 grain mill warm DNA portion and at whose 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.800
 the law of peace is stranded 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:40.920
 subjective remember we played means but 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.730
 don't pinch the bones of the game 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.040
 the match we forgot two swords and arrows 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.750
 rich in moment high damage for us 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.880
 duzhe bagato means we didn't have 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.500
 control the ball i in the central zone between 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.140
 earthly you come off to us angles 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.110
 service attacks and in terms of defense we 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.150
 worked a lot of time on 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.890
 throughout these games there and the miner from 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.870
 dynamo of them rum so the organism 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.200
 organization in defense on 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.409
 good enough was the one that was 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.860
 removal we are by no means something 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:15.959

 we played more half before 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.600
 against the minority miner so we 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.520

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.590
 rearranged in terms of attack of course 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.590
 I want to want to realize those moments 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.169
