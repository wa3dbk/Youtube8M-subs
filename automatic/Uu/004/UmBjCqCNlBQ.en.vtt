00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.950 

okay<00:00:06.740> so<00:00:06.940> what<00:00:07.940> I<00:00:07.970> want<00:00:08.030> to<00:00:08.300> do<00:00:08.480> is<00:00:08.600> I<00:00:08.720> want<00:00:08.900> to

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
okay so what I want to do is I want to

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.720 
okay so what I want to do is I want to
enhance<00:00:09.230> the<00:00:09.530> grain<00:00:09.740> of<00:00:09.920> this<00:00:10.070> wood<00:00:10.400> and

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
enhance the grain of this wood and

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.520 
enhance the grain of this wood and
there's<00:00:11.540> a<00:00:11.630> bunch<00:00:12.020> of<00:00:12.080> different<00:00:12.200> ways<00:00:12.500> that

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
there's a bunch of different ways that

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.070 
there's a bunch of different ways that
you<00:00:12.710> can<00:00:12.980> do<00:00:13.160> it<00:00:13.310> and<00:00:14.120> I've<00:00:14.330> tried<00:00:14.720> just<00:00:14.960> about

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
you can do it and I've tried just about

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.929 
you can do it and I've tried just about
every<00:00:15.470> technique<00:00:15.860> and<00:00:16.040> I<00:00:16.130> found<00:00:16.430> that<00:00:16.700> it

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
every technique and I found that it

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.220 
every technique and I found that it
really<00:00:17.150> depends<00:00:17.570> on<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:17.750> kind<00:00:17.900> of<00:00:18.020> wood<00:00:18.200> that

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
really depends on the kind of wood that

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.220 
really depends on the kind of wood that
you're<00:00:18.500> using<00:00:18.740> this<00:00:19.670> particular<00:00:20.529> top<00:00:21.529> wood<00:00:21.860> is

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
you're using this particular top wood is

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.710 
you're using this particular top wood is
red<00:00:24.230> elm<00:00:24.560> which<00:00:24.950> I<00:00:25.130> booked<00:00:25.369> matched<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:25.970> let

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
red elm which I booked matched and let

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.290 
red elm which I booked matched and let
out<00:00:26.900> has<00:00:27.140> a<00:00:27.169> really<00:00:28.070> cool<00:00:28.279> grain<00:00:28.640> pattern<00:00:29.150> in

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
out has a really cool grain pattern in

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.819 
out has a really cool grain pattern in
it<00:00:29.450> it's<00:00:30.320> very<00:00:30.380> similar<00:00:31.149> to<00:00:32.149> ash<00:00:32.829> slightly

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
it it's very similar to ash slightly

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.040 
it it's very similar to ash slightly
different<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:34.610> it<00:00:34.700> has<00:00:34.820> a<00:00:34.850> little<00:00:35.180> bit<00:00:35.300> darker

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
different and it has a little bit darker

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.849 
different and it has a little bit darker
tint<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:36.530> it

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
tint to it

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.569 
tint to it
but<00:00:37.460> it<00:00:37.730> has<00:00:37.910> that<00:00:38.120> really<00:00:38.510> open<00:00:38.870> pore

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
but it has that really open pore

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.639 
but it has that really open pore
structure<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:40.850> what<00:00:41.090> I<00:00:41.120> want<00:00:41.359> to<00:00:41.390> do<00:00:41.570> is<00:00:41.989> I<00:00:42.379> want

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
structure so what I want to do is I want

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.000 
structure so what I want to do is I want
to<00:00:42.739> enhance<00:00:43.070> that<00:00:43.429> now<00:00:44.090> I<00:00:44.480> can<00:00:44.780> use<00:00:44.989> dye<00:00:45.289> I<00:00:45.679> can

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
to enhance that now I can use dye I can

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.329 
to enhance that now I can use dye I can
use<00:00:46.309> ink<00:00:46.760> I<00:00:47.179> could<00:00:47.929> use<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.590> tinted<00:00:48.980> grain

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
use ink I could use a tinted grain

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.810 
use ink I could use a tinted grain
filler<00:00:49.699> however<00:00:51.250> one<00:00:52.250> of<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.399> problems<00:00:52.730> I

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
filler however one of the problems I

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.790 
filler however one of the problems I
find<00:00:53.000> with<00:00:53.269> using<00:00:53.690> dyes<00:00:53.899> or<00:00:54.350> inks<00:00:55.210> is<00:00:56.210> that

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
find with using dyes or inks is that

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.040 
find with using dyes or inks is that
when<00:00:57.800> you<00:00:57.920> apply<00:00:58.399> them<00:00:58.820> they<00:00:59.239> really<00:00:59.780> soak

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
when you apply them they really soak

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.040 
when you apply them they really soak
into<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.350> wood<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:01.300> when<00:01:02.300> you<00:01:02.420> go<00:01:02.570> back<00:01:02.809> to

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
into the wood and when you go back to

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.960 
into the wood and when you go back to
sand<00:01:03.350> out<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.769> excess<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:04.519> have<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.790> put<00:01:04.940> a

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
sand out the excess you have to put a

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.480 
sand out the excess you have to put a
lot<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.300> effort<00:01:05.630> into<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:06.200> because<00:01:06.650> even<00:01:07.370> in

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
lot of effort into it because even in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.630 
lot of effort into it because even in
the<00:01:07.640> areas<00:01:08.350> where<00:01:09.350> they<00:01:09.560> don't<00:01:09.710> want<00:01:10.040> the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
the areas where they don't want the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.110 
the areas where they don't want the
stain<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:11.840> remain<00:01:12.230> you<00:01:13.190> have<00:01:13.340> to<00:01:13.460> sand<00:01:13.760> it<00:01:13.880> down

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
stain to remain you have to sand it down

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.120 
stain to remain you have to sand it down
pretty<00:01:14.540> aggressively<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.620> get<00:01:15.800> it<00:01:15.920> off<00:01:16.100> of

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
pretty aggressively to get it off of

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.900 
pretty aggressively to get it off of
there<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:16.610> sometimes<00:01:17.240> that<00:01:17.720> pulls<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.910> dye

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
there and sometimes that pulls the dye

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.600 
there and sometimes that pulls the dye
out<00:01:20.210> of<00:01:20.260> the<00:01:21.260> grain<00:01:21.590> where<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:22.040> want<00:01:22.340> it<00:01:22.490> to

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
out of the grain where you want it to

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.240 
out of the grain where you want it to
remain<00:01:22.940> so<00:01:25.390> you<00:01:26.390> can<00:01:26.570> also<00:01:26.780> use<00:01:27.100> as<00:01:28.100> I

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
remain so you can also use as I

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.680 
remain so you can also use as I
mentioned<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.910> tinted<00:01:29.660> grain<00:01:29.930> filler<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:31.690> that

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
mentioned a tinted grain filler and that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.320 
mentioned a tinted grain filler and that
can<00:01:32.870> work<00:01:32.990> fairly<00:01:33.290> well<00:01:33.410> -<00:01:33.890> however<00:01:34.250> most<00:01:35.180> of

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
can work fairly well - however most of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.780 
can work fairly well - however most of
the<00:01:35.390> water-based<00:01:36.050> grain<00:01:36.890> fillers<00:01:37.400> that<00:01:37.640> I've

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
the water-based grain fillers that I've

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.160 
the water-based grain fillers that I've
found<00:01:39.730> you<00:01:40.730> end<00:01:40.910> up<00:01:41.060> having<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.780> what<00:01:41.990> you've

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
found you end up having to what you've

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.840 
found you end up having to what you've
added<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.500> ten<00:01:42.800> you<00:01:42.920> have<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.190> water<00:01:43.430> them<00:01:43.670> down

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
added to ten you have to water them down

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.649 
added to ten you have to water them down
so<00:01:44.180> that<00:01:44.360> they'll<00:01:44.510> actually<00:01:44.690> go<00:01:45.140> into

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
so that they'll actually go into

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.080 
so that they'll actually go into
more<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.909> features<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> grain<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:51.030> you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
more so features of the grain and so you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.300 
more so features of the grain and so you
wind<00:01:51.329> up<00:01:51.509> kind<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.079> defeating<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> purpose<00:01:52.799> of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
wind up kind of defeating the purpose of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.359 
wind up kind of defeating the purpose of
using<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.789> grain<00:01:54.030> filler<00:01:54.360> when<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.840> that

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
using a grain filler when you do that

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.450 
using a grain filler when you do that
what<00:01:56.369> I'm<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:57.000> instead<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:58.530> I'm

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
what I'm going to do instead is I'm

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.440 
what I'm going to do instead is I'm
going<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.729> be<00:01:59.850> using<00:02:00.409> it's<00:02:01.409> an<00:02:01.590> acrylic<00:02:02.450> craft

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
going to be using it's an acrylic craft

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.899 
going to be using it's an acrylic craft
paint<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.350> get<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.649> stuff<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.159> any<00:02:05.759> of

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
paint you can get this stuff in any of

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.229 
paint you can get this stuff in any of
your<00:02:06.060> hobby<00:02:06.479> crafting<00:02:07.140> stores<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.090> it's<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
your hobby crafting stores and it's a

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.790 
your hobby crafting stores and it's a
fairly<00:02:09.630> thick<00:02:10.370> paint<00:02:12.230> but<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.410> it's

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
fairly thick paint but it's it's

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.339 
fairly thick paint but it's it's
essentially<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.730> black<00:02:15.300> pigment<00:02:15.900> mixed<00:02:16.110> in

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
essentially a black pigment mixed in

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.170 
essentially a black pigment mixed in
with<00:02:16.470> water<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:17.130> then<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.400> has<00:02:17.550> an<00:02:17.849> acrylic

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
with water and then it has an acrylic

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.339 
with water and then it has an acrylic
resin<00:02:18.810> as<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.019> binder<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.799> what<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.580> does<00:02:20.880> is

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
resin as a binder and what that does is

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.589 
resin as a binder and what that does is
it<00:02:22.349> allows<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:24.019> pigment<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.290> penetrate<00:02:26.280> into

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
it allows the pigment to penetrate into

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.930 
it allows the pigment to penetrate into
just<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.720> pores<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.380> when<00:02:29.099> when<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.700> water

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
just the pores and when when the water

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.240 
just the pores and when when the water
evaporates<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.989> then<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.590> acrylic<00:02:31.920> resin

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
evaporates and then the acrylic resin

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.500 
evaporates and then the acrylic resin
dries<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:33.269> binds<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.880> pigment<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.269> wood

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
dries that binds the pigment to the wood

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.350 
dries that binds the pigment to the wood
now<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.590> areas<00:02:38.310> where<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.549> don't<00:02:38.700> want<00:02:39.060> it

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
now on the areas where I don't want it

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.110 
now on the areas where I don't want it
to<00:02:39.840> remain<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.739> just<00:02:41.160> sits<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.640> top<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
to remain it just sits on the top of the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.150 
to remain it just sits on the top of the
wood<00:02:42.329> and<00:02:42.569> drives<00:02:42.959> there<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.769> when<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:43.950> go

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
wood and drives there so that when I go

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.280 
wood and drives there so that when I go
back<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.549> sand<00:02:44.849> it<00:02:44.970> off<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.660> actually<00:02:46.110> very

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
back and sand it off it's actually very

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.680 
back and sand it off it's actually very
easy<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.680> sand<00:02:47.010> off<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.000> really<00:02:48.360> stays

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
easy to sand off but it really stays

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.890 
easy to sand off but it really stays
down<00:02:49.079> inside<00:02:49.829> of<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.880> grain<00:02:51.150> where<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.450> want<00:02:51.810> it

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
down inside of the grain where I want it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.090 
down inside of the grain where I want it
to<00:02:51.959> remain<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:54.049> it<00:02:55.049> works<00:02:55.260> really<00:02:55.410> well<00:02:55.709> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
to remain so it works really well the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.870 
to remain so it works really well the
other<00:02:56.220> nice<00:02:56.459> advantage<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.329> it<00:02:57.359> is<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:58.880> once

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
other nice advantage to it is it once

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.879 
other nice advantage to it is it once
it's<00:03:00.090> down<00:03:00.299> inside<00:03:00.720> those<00:03:00.930> pores<00:03:01.319> because

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
it's down inside those pores because

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.460 
it's down inside those pores because
there's<00:03:02.100> an<00:03:02.190> acrylic<00:03:02.459> resin<00:03:02.910> binder<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.660> it

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
there's an acrylic resin binder in it it

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.349 
there's an acrylic resin binder in it it
plugs<00:03:04.799> up<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.190> grain<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.670> pores<00:03:05.970> and

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
plugs up the grain and the pores and

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.099 
plugs up the grain and the pores and
that<00:03:07.049> will<00:03:07.230> allow<00:03:07.500> me<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.769> add<00:03:08.930> or<00:03:09.930> when<00:03:10.079> I

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
that will allow me to add or when I

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.000 
that will allow me to add or when I
apply<00:03:10.560> my<00:03:10.970> clear<00:03:11.970> grain<00:03:12.840> filling<00:03:13.260> later<00:03:13.470> on<00:03:13.709> it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
apply my clear grain filling later on it

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.910 
apply my clear grain filling later on it
was<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.579> so<00:03:14.910> much

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.650 

it'll<00:03:18.190> fill<00:03:18.550> in<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.850> grain<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.270> sit<00:03:19.420> on<00:03:19.510> the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
it'll fill in the grain and sit on the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.970 
it'll fill in the grain and sit on the
top<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.050> it's<00:03:20.170> kind<00:03:20.350> of<00:03:20.410> like<00:03:20.530> I'm<00:03:20.710> sealing

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
top so it's kind of like I'm sealing

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.670 
top so it's kind of like I'm sealing
great<00:03:21.490> so<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.569> way<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.780> do<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.290> just<00:03:23.530> really

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
great so the way I do it is just really

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.050 
great so the way I do it is just really
simple<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.220> squirt<00:03:24.970> saliva<00:03:25.300> on<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.569> body<00:03:27.060> and

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
simple I squirt saliva on the body and

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.350 
simple I squirt saliva on the body and
then<00:03:28.300> I<00:03:28.390> take<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.660> rag<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.730> just<00:03:30.940> begin<00:03:31.240> to

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
then I take that rag and I just begin to

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.990 
then I take that rag and I just begin to
rub<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:32.069> you<00:03:33.069> use<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.310> little<00:03:33.550> bit<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.819> elbow

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
rub it in you use a little bit of elbow

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.199 
rub it in you use a little bit of elbow
grease<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.420> get<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.810> going<00:03:35.790> well<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:36.820> want<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.120> be

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
grease to get it going well I want to be

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.850 
grease to get it going well I want to be
really<00:03:37.450> careful<00:03:37.660> around<00:03:37.990> the<00:03:38.290> edges<00:03:38.320> because

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
really careful around the edges because

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.280 
really careful around the edges because
I<00:03:39.070> don't<00:03:39.400> want<00:03:39.640> this<00:03:39.880> stuff<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.209> drip<00:03:40.660> down<00:03:40.840> the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
I don't want this stuff to drip down the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.560 
I don't want this stuff to drip down the
sides<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:42.220> just<00:03:42.940> wanted<00:03:43.270> to<00:03:44.880> be<00:03:45.880> right<00:03:46.300> on<00:03:46.330> the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
sides I just wanted to be right on the

00:03:46.570 --> 00:04:25.260 
sides I just wanted to be right on the
top

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.470 

okay<00:04:26.270> so<00:04:26.330> now<00:04:26.690> I'm<00:04:26.870> standing<00:04:27.110> off<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:29.000> excess

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
okay so now I'm standing off the excess

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.480 
okay so now I'm standing off the excess
black<00:04:29.930> leaving<00:04:30.470> it<00:04:30.590> just<00:04:30.830> inside<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.280> green

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
black leaving it just inside the green

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.330 
black leaving it just inside the green
and<00:04:31.970> I'm<00:04:32.090> using<00:04:32.330> a<00:04:33.550> random<00:04:34.550> horrible<00:04:36.340> sheet

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
and I'm using a random horrible sheet

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.950 
and I'm using a random horrible sheet
sander<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:39.910> like<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.000> do<00:04:41.120> most<00:04:41.270> of<00:04:41.360> my<00:04:41.450> sanding

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
sander I like to do most of my sanding

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.980 
sander I like to do most of my sanding
by<00:04:42.080> hand<00:04:42.320> but<00:04:43.300> for<00:04:44.300> some<00:04:44.570> of<00:04:44.690> this<00:04:44.780> more

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
by hand but for some of this more

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.100 
by hand but for some of this more
tedious<00:04:45.350> work<00:04:45.530> out<00:04:45.710> I'll<00:04:46.100> go<00:04:46.280> ahead<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.610> use

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
tedious work out I'll go ahead and use

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.820 
tedious work out I'll go ahead and use
one<00:04:48.110> of<00:04:48.140> my<00:04:48.340> random<00:04:49.390> orbital<00:04:50.390> sanders<00:04:50.870> but

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
one of my random orbital sanders but

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.850 
one of my random orbital sanders but
these<00:04:52.790> Sanders<00:04:53.300> taken<00:04:53.600> a<00:04:53.690> certain<00:04:54.260> technique

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
these Sanders taken a certain technique

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.050 
these Sanders taken a certain technique
to<00:04:55.100> do<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.400> right<00:04:55.900> I've<00:04:56.900> noticed<00:04:57.320> when<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:57.590> watch

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
to do it right I've noticed when I watch

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.580 
to do it right I've noticed when I watch
youtube<00:04:59.060> videos<00:04:59.090> guys<00:04:59.960> are<00:05:00.200> doing<00:05:00.500> this<00:05:02.590> and

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
youtube videos guys are doing this and

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.110 
youtube videos guys are doing this and
that's<00:05:03.830> just<00:05:04.010> about<00:05:04.340> how<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:04.580> use<00:05:04.910> these

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
that's just about how you use these

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.090 
that's just about how you use these
Sanders<00:05:07.360> if<00:05:08.360> you've<00:05:08.690> ever<00:05:08.930> had<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:09.860> lot<00:05:10.010> of

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
Sanders if you've ever had a lot of

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.620 
Sanders if you've ever had a lot of
experience<00:05:10.580> with<00:05:10.700> these<00:05:10.790> you'll<00:05:11.030> notice<00:05:11.390> then

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
experience with these you'll notice then

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.030 
experience with these you'll notice then
oftentimes<00:05:12.140> they<00:05:12.440> can<00:05:12.560> leave<00:05:12.740> little

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
oftentimes they can leave little

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.430 
oftentimes they can leave little
curlicue<00:05:13.580> scratches<00:05:14.060> at<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.300> service<00:05:14.720> and

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
curlicue scratches at the service and

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.200 
curlicue scratches at the service and
that<00:05:15.650> happens<00:05:16.160> for<00:05:16.310> moving<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.700> sander<00:05:17.030> too

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
that happens for moving the sander too

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.880 
that happens for moving the sander too
quickly<00:05:17.480> or<00:05:17.630> putting<00:05:17.960> too<00:05:18.170> much<00:05:18.260> weight<00:05:18.530> on<00:05:18.560> it

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
quickly or putting too much weight on it

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.130 
quickly or putting too much weight on it
so<00:05:19.640> what<00:05:19.970> I<00:05:20.000> do<00:05:20.120> is<00:05:20.390> I<00:05:20.540> just<00:05:20.570> let<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:20.960> weight<00:05:21.110> of

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
so what I do is I just let the weight of

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.880 
so what I do is I just let the weight of
the<00:05:21.320> standard<00:05:22.750> do<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.870> work<00:05:24.080> and<00:05:24.320> then<00:05:24.530> I<00:05:24.560> just

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
the standard do the work and then I just

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.010 
the standard do the work and then I just
very<00:05:25.250> slowly<00:05:25.760> move<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.240> over<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.540> surface

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
very slowly move it over the surface

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.930 
very slowly move it over the surface
because<00:05:27.860> all<00:05:27.980> you<00:05:28.070> have<00:05:28.160> to<00:05:28.280> do<00:05:28.430> is<00:05:28.730> just

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
because all you have to do is just

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.760 
because all you have to do is just
suddenly<00:05:29.180> move<00:05:29.630> from<00:05:29.900> one<00:05:30.080> side<00:05:30.380> of<00:05:30.650> the

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
suddenly move from one side of the

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.160 
suddenly move from one side of the
guitar<00:05:31.430> body<00:05:31.700> to<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.090> other<00:05:32.120> and<00:05:32.810> you'll

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
guitar body to the other and you'll

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.020 
guitar body to the other and you'll
leave<00:05:33.350> those<00:05:33.620> curly-q<00:05:34.100> scratches<00:05:34.820> all<00:05:35.000> over

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
leave those curly-q scratches all over

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.240 
leave those curly-q scratches all over
