that<00:00:38.010> they've<00:00:38.219> already<00:00:38.370> done<00:00:38.670> which<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.090> why

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that they've already done which is why

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.330 
that they've already done which is why
I've<00:00:39.540> gone<00:00:39.780> through<00:00:39.840> two<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> older<00:00:40.890> ones

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
I've gone through two of the older ones

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.510 
I've gone through two of the older ones
so<00:00:41.910> now<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.680> cables<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.219> change

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
so now have cables that you can change

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.139 
so now have cables that you can change
from<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:46.100> so<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.399> damage<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.879> cable

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
from here so if you do damage your cable

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.000 
from here so if you do damage your cable
you<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.270> completely<00:00:48.809> change<00:00:48.899> out<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.800> keep

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
you can completely change out and keep

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.290 
you can completely change out and keep
the<00:00:50.160> earbuds<00:00:50.489> which<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.850> course<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> most

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the earbuds which is of course the most

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.260 
the earbuds which is of course the most
expensive<00:00:51.809> part<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.590> I'd<00:00:53.460> turn<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> path<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
expensive part if I'd turn the path of

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.119 
expensive part if I'd turn the path of
the<00:00:54.360> older<00:00:54.600> series<00:00:54.840> break<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.379> me<00:00:55.530> where<00:00:56.039> I've

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the older series break on me where I've

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.950 
the older series break on me where I've
only<00:00:56.309> ended<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:56.910> having<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.510> side<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.350> audio

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
only ended up having one side of audio

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.160 
only ended up having one side of audio
so<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.140> quite<00:01:01.350> simple<00:01:01.410> box<00:01:02.390> you<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
so it's quite simple box you can see the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
so it's quite simple box you can see the
different<00:01:04.680> tips<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.040> got<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.820> they've<00:01:05.939> got

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
different tips that got so they've got

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.149 
different tips that got so they've got
foam<00:01:06.299> sleeves<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.080> they've<00:01:07.229> got<00:01:07.439> soft<00:01:07.950> black

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
foam sleeves and they've got soft black

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.700 
foam sleeves and they've got soft black
sleeves<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.180> they've<00:01:09.420> got<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.560> almost

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
sleeves and they've got and it almost

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.649 
sleeves and they've got and it almost
got<00:01:10.890> carrying<00:01:11.250> case<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.299> got<00:01:12.450> these

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
got carrying case and got these

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.420 
got carrying case and got these
specifications<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.850> all<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.210> jazz<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.659> well

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
specifications and all that jazz as well

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.920 
specifications and all that jazz as well
so<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.640> fixie<00:01:18.090> range<00:01:18.270> from<00:01:18.509> 22<00:01:18.810> Hertz<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.470> 17.5

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
so the fixie range from 22 Hertz to 17.5

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.130 
so the fixie range from 22 Hertz to 17.5
kilohertz<00:01:21.930> again<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.740> doesn't<00:01:23.009> tell<00:01:23.189> us<00:01:24.140> how

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
kilohertz again it doesn't tell us how

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.200 
kilohertz again it doesn't tell us how
accurate<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.549> put<00:01:26.820> someone<00:01:27.000> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
accurate that is is you put someone is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.580 
accurate that is is you put someone is

maybe saying that you do want to look at
and<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.579> how<00:01:38.700> long<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> cable<00:01:39.240> is

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and you can see how long the cable is

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.749 
and you can see how long the cable is
which<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.570> 162<00:01:40.320> centimeters<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:43.490> can<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.670> on

which is 162 centimeters you can see on

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.630 
which is 162 centimeters you can see on
the<00:01:44.880> side<00:01:45.090> here<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.380> black<00:01:46.590> series<00:01:46.890> they

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the side here is the black series they

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.940 
the side here is the black series they
do<00:01:47.700> also<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.119> see-through<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.770> it's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
do also have a see-through one and it's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.240 
do also have a see-through one and it's
got<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> two<00:01:50.369> year<00:01:50.399> warranty<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.780> well<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:52.140> it

there<00:03:59.870> with<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:01.020> strain<00:04:01.709> relief<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.720> I've<00:04:03.810> just

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
there with a strain relief so I've just

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.780 
there with a strain relief so I've just
realized<00:04:04.260> what<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.530> tools<00:04:04.770> for<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:05.670> took

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
realized what that tools for just took

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.810 
realized what that tools for just took
off<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.239> default<00:04:06.840> foam<00:04:07.110> piece<00:04:07.410> here<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:07.950> can

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
off the default foam piece here you can

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.699 
off the default foam piece here you can
see<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.120> we've<00:04:09.270> got<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.570> canal<00:04:10.200> going<00:04:10.440> down

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
see that we've got a canal going down

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.860 
see that we've got a canal going down
into<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.190> unit<00:04:11.430> here<00:04:11.670> also<00:04:12.090> remove<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.540> cable

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
into the unit here also remove the cable

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.380 
into the unit here also remove the cable
one<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.770> the<00:04:13.910> interesting<00:04:14.910> things<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.270> the

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
one of the interesting things is the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.210 
one of the interesting things is the
connector<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:15.870> used<00:04:16.109> for<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.560> cable<00:04:16.919> it's

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
connector that used for the cable it's

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.379 
connector that used for the cable it's
kind<00:04:17.400> like<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.549> mini<00:04:17.820> coax<00:04:18.620> connector

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
kind like a mini coax connector

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.540 
kind like a mini coax connector
so<00:04:22.389> we<00:04:22.720> have<00:04:22.900> this<00:04:23.020> hole<00:04:23.229> here<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.949> if<00:04:24.160> some

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
so we have this hole here and if some

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.360 
so we have this hole here and if some
reason<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:24.940> does<00:04:25.180> get<00:04:25.330> clogged<00:04:25.630> or<00:04:26.100> any<00:04:27.100> kind

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
reason that does get clogged or any kind

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.450 
reason that does get clogged or any kind
of<00:04:27.430> debris<00:04:27.900> what<00:04:28.900> we<00:04:29.020> can<00:04:29.169> use<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:29.650> this<00:04:29.889> hook

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
of debris what we can use is this hook

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.200 
of debris what we can use is this hook
end<00:04:31.169> place<00:04:32.169> it<00:04:32.380> in<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:33.310> kind<00:04:33.610> of<00:04:33.699> scoop<00:04:33.970> out

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
end place it in and kind of scoop out

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.860 
end place it in and kind of scoop out
anything<00:04:34.449> that's<00:04:35.350> in<00:04:35.620> there<00:04:35.860> now<00:04:36.870> I

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
anything that's in there now I

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.129 
anything that's in there now I
personally<00:04:38.710> prefer<00:04:39.039> these<00:04:39.690> rubberized<00:04:40.690> ones

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
personally prefer these rubberized ones

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.540 
personally prefer these rubberized ones
because<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.470> find<00:04:41.710> them<00:04:41.830> easier<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:42.130> take<00:04:42.340> in

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
because I find them easier to take in

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.570 
because I find them easier to take in
and<00:04:42.699> out<00:04:42.789> especially<00:04:43.389> when<00:04:43.780> at<00:04:43.930> work<00:04:44.110> and

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
and out especially when at work and

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.730 
and out especially when at work and
although<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:45.789> do<00:04:46.030> need<00:04:46.180> a<00:04:46.240> good<00:04:46.449> seal<00:04:46.740> you

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
although you do need a good seal you

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.110 
although you do need a good seal you
might<00:04:47.889> be<00:04:47.979> taking<00:04:48.310> them<00:04:48.400> in<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:48.610> out<00:04:48.759> quite<00:04:49.060> a

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
might be taking them in and out quite a

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.560 
might be taking them in and out quite a
few<00:04:49.210> times<00:04:49.800> if<00:04:50.800> you're<00:04:50.979> doing<00:04:51.190> both<00:04:51.820> IMed<00:04:52.270> and

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
few times if you're doing both IMed and

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.170 
few times if you're doing both IMed and
wedges<00:04:52.780> so<00:04:53.250> there's<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.580> kind<00:04:54.729> of<00:04:54.849> medium

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
wedges so there's the kind of medium

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.310 
wedges so there's the kind of medium
ones<00:04:55.360> that<00:04:55.509> I'm<00:04:55.570> going<00:04:55.690> to<00:04:55.750> try<00:04:55.900> out

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
ones that I'm going to try out

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.150 
ones that I'm going to try out
I<00:04:56.349> might<00:04:57.220> even<00:04:57.430> lead<00:04:57.669> try<00:04:57.820> the<00:04:57.880> small<00:04:58.270> ones

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
I might even lead try the small ones

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.460 
I might even lead try the small ones
I've<00:05:00.160> removed<00:05:00.610> when<00:05:00.759> the<00:05:00.849> foam<00:05:01.030> ones<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:02.380> you

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
I've removed when the foam ones and you

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.279 
I've removed when the foam ones and you
can<00:05:02.590> actually<00:05:02.680> see<00:05:03.389> that<00:05:04.389> one's<00:05:04.599> direct<00:05:05.050> in

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
can actually see that one's direct in

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.950 
can actually see that one's direct in
but<00:05:05.979> these<00:05:06.180> foam<00:05:07.180> ones<00:05:07.449> actually<00:05:07.690> have<00:05:07.870> a

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
but these foam ones actually have a

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.200 
but these foam ones actually have a
grille<00:05:08.199> built<00:05:08.440> in<00:05:08.620> as<00:05:08.740> well<00:05:08.949> so<00:05:09.280> they<00:05:10.030> might

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
grille built in as well so they might

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.670 
grille built in as well so they might
actually<00:05:10.509> sound<00:05:10.900> slightly<00:05:11.289> different<00:05:11.590> as

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
actually sound slightly different as

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.920 
actually sound slightly different as
well<00:05:11.860> I'm<00:05:12.669> gonna<00:05:12.759> get<00:05:13.000> these<00:05:13.120> air<00:05:13.419> popped<00:05:13.690> on

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
well I'm gonna get these air popped on

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.909 
well I'm gonna get these air popped on
and<00:05:14.860> then<00:05:15.400> I'm<00:05:15.669> gonna<00:05:15.789> try<00:05:16.060> them<00:05:16.210> out<00:05:16.620> look<00:05:17.620> for

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
and then I'm gonna try them out look for

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.210 
and then I'm gonna try them out look for
