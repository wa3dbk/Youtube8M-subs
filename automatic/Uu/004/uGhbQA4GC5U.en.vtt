00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.650 
three-quarter inch line and the top line
we've<00:00:46.620> got<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> spare<00:00:48.140> wash<00:00:49.140> hose<00:00:49.910> water<00:00:50.910> and

we've got as a spare wash hose water and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
we've got as a spare wash hose water and
the<00:00:51.809> idea<00:00:52.140> where<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.500> when<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.550> get<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the idea where that is when we get the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.340 
the idea where that is when we get the
feeder<00:00:54.059> built<00:00:54.390> we'll<00:00:54.629> need<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> little<00:00:55.110> bit<00:00:55.289> of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
feeder built we'll need a little bit of

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:04.009 
feeder built we'll need a little bit of
water<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.920> top<00:00:56.100> water<00:00:58.520> just<00:01:02.570> zoom<00:01:03.570> into<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
water for top water just zoom into the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.210 
water for top water just zoom into the
action<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:07.560> we've<00:01:07.770> got<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
action here and we see we've got that

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.260 
action here and we see we've got that
nice<00:01:08.520> clean<00:01:08.909> action<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> bed

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
nice clean action in the bed

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.620 
nice clean action in the bed
most<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.750> fluidized<00:01:13.670> we've<00:01:14.670> got<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
most of it is fluidized we've got a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.810 
most of it is fluidized we've got a
little<00:01:16.320> bit<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.680> material<00:01:19.460> flowing<00:01:20.460> over<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
little bit of material flowing over the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.630 
little bit of material flowing over the
outside<00:01:21.299> edges<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.710> white<00:01:22.890> particles<00:01:23.490> you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
outside edges the white particles you

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.940 
outside edges the white particles you
can<00:01:23.700> see<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.320> this<00:01:25.320> happened<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> be<00:01:25.920> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
can see in this this happened to be a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.039 
can see in this this happened to be a
bucket<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.490> beach<00:01:26.939> sand<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.630> there's<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> lot

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
bucket of beach sand and there's a lot

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.830 
bucket of beach sand and there's a lot
of<00:01:28.080> shell<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> stuff<00:01:29.150> like<00:01:30.150> material<00:01:30.689> it's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
of shell and stuff like material it's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.090 
of shell and stuff like material it's
worked<00:01:31.079> its<00:01:31.229> way<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.710> top<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
worked its way to the top and is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.940 
worked its way to the top and is
overflowing<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:36.049> one<00:01:37.049> thing<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.439> had<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.680> do

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
overflowing and one thing we had to do

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.510 
overflowing and one thing we had to do
was<00:01:38.159> put<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> rubber<00:01:39.360> seal<00:01:39.659> around<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.520> make

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
was put a rubber seal around to make

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.200 
was put a rubber seal around to make
sure<00:01:41.549> all<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> water<00:01:42.240> from<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.170> base<00:01:44.210> that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
sure all the water from the base that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.060 
sure all the water from the base that
goes<00:01:45.509> through<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> bed<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.409> doesn't<00:01:46.770> try<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
goes through the bed and doesn't try and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.690 
goes through the bed and doesn't try and
bypass<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:48.710> that's<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.100> strip<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:51.439> rubber

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700

level<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:06.420> wheelbarrow<00:02:06.870> was<00:02:07.110> kind<00:02:07.440> of<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
level the wheelbarrow was kind of the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.150 
level the wheelbarrow was kind of the
only<00:02:07.740> contraption<00:02:08.490> I<00:02:08.610> could<00:02:09.500> only<00:02:10.500> tank<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.979> had

only contraption I could only tank I had
that<00:02:11.310> was<00:02:11.430> big<00:02:11.610> enough<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:12.060> would<00:02:13.010> pull<00:02:14.010> both

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
that was big enough they would pull both

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.810 
that was big enough they would pull both
the<00:02:14.460> pump<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.650> thing<00:02:16.860> for<00:02:17.100> testing<00:02:19.820> and

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
the pump and the thing for testing and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.280 
the pump and the thing for testing and
we<00:02:20.940> here<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.330> can<00:02:21.510> see<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.840> pulse<00:02:22.050> valve

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
we here we can see the pulse valve

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:37.520 
we here we can see the pulse valve
barely<00:02:25.290> working<00:02:25.680> away<00:02:36.110> anyway<00:02:37.110> hope<00:02:37.500> you
