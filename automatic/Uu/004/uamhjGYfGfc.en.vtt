00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.430
 there are nonsense fights on the internet goku 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.470
 against superman is undoubtedly one of them 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.190
 but as you did not ask I give them 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.190
 my opinion 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.890
 this topic is one of those things that neither 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.230
 you can not even imagine it to be a great 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.019
 discussion here in Mexico if someone will 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.890
 asks who wins superman oq the 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.770
 answer is the most obvious in the world 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.720
 Goku you do not even need to think about it 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.030
 a lot puts all the superheroes of the 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.550
 world with drink q I say that you win with the 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.590
 hand tied to the back then when 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.480
 a video of the parole show puts its 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.760
 opinion about who wins between these two 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.830
 titans a video with almost an hour of 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.379
 duration that by the way gives you the 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.390
 victory to the super bad practically everything 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.059
 the world goes crazy and the discussion 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.879
 it is only longer and 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.620
 to be honest I am a fan of prepared and 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.070
 since I saw the first minutes of 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.750
 video I knew that superman was going to win in 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.340
 special because I had already told him 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.700
 to other people 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.690
 superman has more than 75 years of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.440
 history 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.210
 goku only 30 just for that detail I think 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.880
 that it is obvious that if you face both 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.100
 it is obvious that someone will find the 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.920
 way of removing oppermann that in what 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.929
 personal both heroes I love does not 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.179
 a lot of uploading videos with almost two hours of 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.520
 duration talking about the whole history of 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.070
 superman and it's because he 's one of my beings 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.050
 favorites and I come what can I say 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.690
 I will love happy 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.180
 I encouraged myself favorite if I've seen that anime 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.250
 15 times I get few but if 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.470
 really give me to choose between who 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.710
 wins between the two easy 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.720
 Goku the day is a character so 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.240
 nice and identifiable that here in 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.370
 mexico inclusive every year we make a 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.110
 walk on day of the dead so 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.780
 deep is the taste of the community 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.790
 Mexican to ocu but again when 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.750
 someone arrives with the question who wins 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.330
 superman 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.590
 the truth I think that question is 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.760
 answer with another question which superman 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.520
 goku there is one 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.950
 superman there are dozens of them as is 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.590
 written by a superman person by 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.540
 certain just for that fact a question 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.880
 who wins between the two results from 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.860
 most useless if we go to the field of 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.860
 the literature between comics and manga 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.840
 there is a huge difference in comics 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.790
 we see that a superhero is a resource 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.250
 literary to continue telling stories 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.290
 why Superman is all kinds of 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.910
 stories while in the manga the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.310
 history is more important than 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.990
 characters itself that's why there's only been 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.330
 a history of goku 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.070
 it stays constant and if those who 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.170
 they write the manga they would like to make a 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.320
 eternal history would use others 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.120
 characters this is not how they are taught but if 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.460
 we go to the television there the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.350
 difference is clearer than water in 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.540
 television we have never seen the 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.690
 superman strong enough to 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.930
 fight the opposite or itch or krillin 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.790
 today wide and television we have seen a 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.810
 superman so weak that a wave 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.910
 Electric does not have an atomic bomb 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.800
 assuming good that is being weak 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.110
 things that are capable of leaving it 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.700
 dying while fighting against 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.180
 enemies that are capable of destroying 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.070
 planets with a finger all your some 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.290
 scare motor since pretty fires 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.780
 artificial then it is not who wins 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.850
 between goku and superman but who wins 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.120
 between bogut and the superman of the time of 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.880
 gold 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.820
 Goku can you superman electric handsome or 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.400
 superman prime one million that last yes 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.080
 you win in my personal point of view 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.150
 charge for the simple fact of being 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.130
 constant and because I like the truth 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.870
 in the end everyone can give 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.790
 the resolution you want is 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.310
 is stupid to a stupid question 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.590
 Goku lives in a land where he still 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.060
 there are dinosaurs and superman in 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.489
 a land where people do not give 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.349
 mind that is the one so let's stop 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.629
 ask stupid things and move on 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.129
 most important issues who wins between 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.129
 goku and parents want 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.849
 oh god you this exists thanks for your 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.370
 attention and in the next video 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.810
 we will continue talking about z grain and other 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.970
 of his subjects that has certain 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.180
 uncertainty really bad accounts 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.229
 Dragon Ball Z Battle of the Gods 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.229
 we'll see
