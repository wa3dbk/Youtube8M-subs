make a really easy pair of earrings I

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.459 
make a really easy pair of earrings I
made<00:00:08.519> these<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:09.090> less<00:00:09.300> than<00:00:09.450> 10<00:00:09.809> minutes<00:00:10.080> and

made these in less than 10 minutes and

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.200 
made these in less than 10 minutes and
i'm<00:00:10.710> going<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.889> show<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.010> exactly<00:00:11.219> how<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.969> do

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
i'm going to show you exactly how to do

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.269 
i'm going to show you exactly how to do
it<00:00:14.240> let's<00:00:15.240> get<00:00:15.660> started<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.770> i'm<00:00:16.890> working<00:00:17.039> with

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
it let's get started so i'm working with

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.359 
it let's get started so i'm working with
some<00:00:17.820> wire<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.750> just<00:00:18.930> craft<00:00:19.199> wire<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.830> is

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
some wire this is just craft wire it is

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.000 
some wire this is just craft wire it is
20<00:00:20.910> gauge<00:00:21.240> that's<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.230> thickness<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
20 gauge that's the thickness of the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.550 
20 gauge that's the thickness of the
wire<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.810> could<00:00:24.810> work<00:00:24.960> with<00:00:25.170> actual

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
wire and you could work with actual

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.519 
wire and you could work with actual
silver<00:00:26.010> if<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.250> wanted<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.849> just<00:00:26.880> work<00:00:27.240> with

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
silver if you wanted I just work with

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.500 
silver if you wanted I just work with
silver<00:00:28.529> colored<00:00:28.859> or<00:00:29.070> silver<00:00:29.340> coated<00:00:29.760> wire<00:00:30.090> I

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
silver colored or silver coated wire I

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.420 
silver colored or silver coated wire I
find<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.140> cheaper<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.740> easier<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.340> I'm

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
find it cheaper and easier so I'm

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.610 
find it cheaper and easier so I'm
stringing<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.969> three<00:00:33.329> beads<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.989> could<00:00:34.469> do

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
stringing on three beads you could do

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.410 
stringing on three beads you could do
any<00:00:34.950> number<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.309> beads<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.610> want<00:00:35.880> any<00:00:36.149> size

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
any number of beads you want any size

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.819 
any number of beads you want any size
just<00:00:36.660> make<00:00:36.780> sure<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.200> beads<00:00:37.440> aren't<00:00:37.620> too

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
just make sure that the beads aren't too

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.860 
just make sure that the beads aren't too
heavy<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.399> your<00:00:38.489> ear<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:38.730> an<00:00:39.090> earring<00:00:39.360> but

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
heavy for your ear for an earring but

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.720 
heavy for your ear for an earring but
I'm<00:00:39.989> taking<00:00:40.230> some<00:00:40.350> flat<00:00:40.649> nose<00:00:40.920> pliers<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
I'm taking some flat nose pliers and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.850 
I'm taking some flat nose pliers and
then<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.300> placing<00:00:42.840> them<00:00:43.110> against<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
then I'm placing them against one of the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.430 
then I'm placing them against one of the
beads<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.160> using<00:00:44.399> my<00:00:44.489> finger<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.180> push<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
beads and using my finger to push the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.920 
beads and using my finger to push the
wire<00:00:46.680> up<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> little<00:00:48.030> more<00:00:48.270> than<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> 90

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
wire up to a little more than a 90

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.750 
wire up to a little more than a 90
degree<00:00:49.050> angle<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.730> that

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
degree angle so you can see that that

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.600 
degree angle so you can see that that
bend<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.660> past<00:00:51.930> 90<00:00:52.440> degrees<00:00:52.829> okay<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
bend is a little past 90 degrees okay I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.729 
bend is a little past 90 degrees okay I
push<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> bead<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.660> against<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> bend<00:00:55.469> I'm

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
push the bead up against the bend I'm

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.810 
push the bead up against the bend I'm
going<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> take<00:00:56.100> those<00:00:56.250> flat<00:00:56.550> nose<00:00:56.789> pliers

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
going to take those flat nose pliers

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.240 
going to take those flat nose pliers
again<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.500> i'm<00:00:58.649> creating<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.039> little

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
again and now i'm creating a little

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.830 
again and now i'm creating a little
space<00:00:59.550> between<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.969> bead<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> bend<00:01:00.570> but

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
space between the bead and the bend but

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.660 
space between the bead and the bend but
i'm<00:01:00.930> doing<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> same<00:01:01.559> thing<00:01:01.949> i'm<00:01:02.100> pushing<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
i'm doing the same thing i'm pushing the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.549 
i'm doing the same thing i'm pushing the
wire<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.239> create<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> little<00:01:03.750> more<00:01:03.960> than<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.140> 90

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
wire to create a little more than a 90

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.560 
wire to create a little more than a 90
degree<00:01:04.650> angle<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.549> can<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.000> i<00:01:06.180> form

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
degree angle so you can see that i form

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.820 
degree angle so you can see that i form
something<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.140> looks<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.409> bit<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
something that looks a little bit like a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.580 
something that looks a little bit like a
triangle<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.780> now<00:01:09.990> i<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.290> that

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
triangle here so now i have that

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.590 
triangle here so now i have that
triangle<00:01:10.950> shape<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.490> i<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.150> determined

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
triangle shape and i just determined

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.750 
triangle shape and i just determined
where<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:13.409> overlap<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.310> i'm<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.610> take

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
where they overlap and i'm going to take

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.820 
where they overlap and i'm going to take
my<00:01:14.939> flat<00:01:15.180> nose<00:01:15.390> pliers<00:01:15.450> once<00:01:15.840> again<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.439> hold

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
my flat nose pliers once again to hold

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.609 
my flat nose pliers once again to hold
the<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.369> wires<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:18.119> place<00:01:18.150> now<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:19.140> bend

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the two wires in place now you can bend

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.340 
the two wires in place now you can bend
the<00:01:20.009> wire<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.520> too<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.570> i'm<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.140> show

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the wire here too but i'm going to show

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
the wire here too but i'm going to show
you<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.619> without<00:01:23.310> bending<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.939> all<00:01:24.119> i'm

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
you just without bending it all i'm

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.429 
you just without bending it all i'm
going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> do<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.630> I'm<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> wrap<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
going to do is I'm going to wrap that

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.370 
going to do is I'm going to wrap that
loose<00:01:25.860> end<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.340> wire<00:01:26.580> around<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.869> end<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
loose end of wire around the end of the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
loose end of wire around the end of the
wire<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:28.740> still<00:01:29.130> attached<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.880> coil

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
wire that's still attached to the coil

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.179 
wire that's still attached to the coil
of<00:01:30.540> wire<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> reasons<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.979> don't

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
of wire now one of the reasons I don't

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.800 
of wire now one of the reasons I don't
cut<00:01:32.460> my<00:01:32.579> wire<00:01:32.729> before<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.150> work<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.540> I'm<00:01:33.659> trying

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
cut my wire before I work is I'm trying

don't<00:02:57.360> know<00:02:57.450> what<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:59.010> now<00:02:59.220> I've

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
don't know what it is so now I've

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.550 
don't know what it is so now I've
created<00:02:59.760> my<00:02:59.940> basic<00:03:00.510> hook<00:03:00.720> shape<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.440> can

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
created my basic hook shape and you can

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.050 
created my basic hook shape and you can
see<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.830> right<00:03:01.980> there<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.580> I'm<00:03:02.670> going<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.850> go

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
see it right there so I'm going to go

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.940 
see it right there so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:03.209> with<00:03:03.570> my<00:03:03.720> wire<00:03:03.989> snips<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.560> I'm<00:03:04.830> going

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
ahead with my wire snips and I'm going

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.070 
ahead with my wire snips and I'm going
to<00:03:05.010> cut<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.310> off<00:03:05.610> from<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.330> rest<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.780> the

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
to cut that off from the rest of the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.620 
to cut that off from the rest of the
wire<00:03:07.459> so<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.489> hold<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.000> place<00:03:09.180> snippet

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
wire so I hold that and place snippet

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.380 
wire so I hold that and place snippet
and<00:03:09.840> now<00:03:10.590> i<00:03:10.950> have<00:03:11.070> my<00:03:11.340> earring<00:03:11.790> wire<00:03:11.940> however

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
and now i have my earring wire however

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.810 
and now i have my earring wire however
that<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.080> sharp<00:03:13.500> little<00:03:13.680> end<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.430> just<00:03:14.670> got

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
that is a sharp little end that just got

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.670 
that is a sharp little end that just got
cut<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.420> i'm<00:03:15.540> going<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.750> grab<00:03:15.840> some<00:03:15.959> sand<00:03:16.560> paper

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
cut so i'm going to grab some sand paper

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.229 
cut so i'm going to grab some sand paper
now<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.220> sand<00:03:17.549> paper<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.030> i<00:03:18.060> grabbed<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.959> a

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
now the sand paper that i grabbed is a

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.670 
now the sand paper that i grabbed is a
well<00:03:21.239> it's<00:03:21.480> not<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.660> fine<00:03:21.930> grit<00:03:22.200> it's<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.500> very

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
well it's not a fine grit it's a very

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.410 
well it's not a fine grit it's a very
heavy<00:03:22.860> grid<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.370> generally<00:03:23.880> prefer<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.239> use<00:03:24.390> a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
heavy grid I generally prefer to use a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.750 
heavy grid I generally prefer to use a
fine<00:03:24.720> grit<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.019> just<00:03:25.350> couldn't<00:03:25.500> find<00:03:25.860> any<00:03:26.070> today

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
fine grit I just couldn't find any today

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.570 
fine grit I just couldn't find any today
but<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.080> that's<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.830> better<00:03:28.980> way<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.220> just

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
but so that's the better way to just

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.390 
but so that's the better way to just
sand<00:03:29.820> off<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.510> little<00:03:30.810> sharp<00:03:31.260> bit<00:03:32.070> and<00:03:32.280> I

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
sand off that little sharp bit and I

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.310 
sand off that little sharp bit and I
just<00:03:32.610> take<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.120> earring<00:03:33.390> hook<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.780> rub<00:03:34.290> it

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
just take the earring hook and I rub it

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.979 
just take the earring hook and I rub it
onto<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.610> sand<00:03:35.880> paper<00:03:36.150> until<00:03:36.510> two<00:03:36.810> might

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
onto the sand paper until two might

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.800 
onto the sand paper until two might
touch<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.590> doesn't<00:03:37.950> feel<00:03:38.250> pokey<00:03:38.970> or<00:03:39.209> upsetting

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
touch it doesn't feel pokey or upsetting

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.520 
touch it doesn't feel pokey or upsetting
because<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.989> don't<00:03:40.110> wanna<00:03:40.230> put<00:03:40.350> something

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
because I don't wanna put something

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.470 
because I don't wanna put something
through<00:03:40.650> my<00:03:40.739> ear<00:03:40.920> that's<00:03:41.130> painful<00:03:41.610> now<00:03:42.390> i'm

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
through my ear that's painful now i'm

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.210 
through my ear that's painful now i'm

taking a metal block and if you don't

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.400 
taking a metal block and if you don't
have<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.519> metal<00:03:45.090> jewellers<00:03:45.720> block<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.260> can

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
have a metal jewellers block you can

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.470 
have a metal jewellers block you can
certainly<00:03:46.769> are<00:03:47.190> an<00:03:47.280> anvil<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:48.000> can<00:03:48.150> take<00:03:48.330> a

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
certainly are an anvil you can take a

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.720 
certainly are an anvil you can take a
hammer<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:49.709> can<00:03:49.860> use<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.130> hammer<00:03:50.370> as<00:03:50.700> a

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
hammer and you can use the hammer as a

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.460 
hammer and you can use the hammer as a
metal<00:03:51.180> block<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.630> then<00:03:51.690> use<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.900> second<00:03:52.320> hammer

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
metal block and then use a second hammer

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.600 
metal block and then use a second hammer
to<00:03:52.650> do<00:03:52.769> exactly<00:03:52.950> what<00:03:53.130> i'm<00:03:53.250> going<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.400> do<00:03:53.489> which

to do exactly what i'm going to do which

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.580 
to do exactly what i'm going to do which
is<00:03:53.640> I'm<00:03:53.850> hammering<00:03:54.390> this<00:03:54.690> now<00:03:54.930> this<00:03:55.080> is<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.260> tiny

is I'm hammering this now this is a tiny

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.870 
is I'm hammering this now this is a tiny
little<00:03:55.799> actually<00:03:56.250> making<00:03:56.489> memory

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
little actually making memory

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.840 
head and what I'm doing is I'm lightly
hammering<00:04:01.709> both<00:04:01.980> sides<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.400> hook<00:04:02.670> and

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
hammering both sides of that hook and

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.460 
hammering both sides of that hook and
that's<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.239> work<00:04:03.480> harden<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.049> so<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.380> it

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
that's to work harden it so that it

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.380 
that's to work harden it so that it
retains<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:05.070> shape<00:04:05.549> it<00:04:05.790> also<00:04:06.060> happens<00:04:06.330> to

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
retains that shape it also happens to

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.910 
retains that shape it also happens to
flatten<00:04:06.690> out<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.930> wire<00:04:07.230> which<00:04:07.530> is<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.680> look

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
flatten out the wire which is a look

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.860 
flatten out the wire which is a look
that<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.130> like<00:04:08.459> I'm<00:04:08.760> doing<00:04:09.239> a<00:04:09.329> little<00:04:09.570> bit<00:04:09.750> on

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
that I like I'm doing a little bit on

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.780 
that I like I'm doing a little bit on
the<00:04:09.959> triangle<00:04:10.380> area<00:04:10.680> I'm<00:04:11.010> being<00:04:11.190> very<00:04:11.220> careful

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
the triangle area I'm being very careful

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.580 
the triangle area I'm being very careful
not<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:12.120> hit<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.420> beads<00:04:12.810> because<00:04:13.350> they're

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
not to hit the beads because they're

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.310 
not to hit the beads because they're
glass<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.280> they'll<00:04:14.370> break<00:04:14.900> but<00:04:15.900> mostly<00:04:16.229> I

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
glass and they'll break but mostly I

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.870 
glass and they'll break but mostly I
just<00:04:16.380> want<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:16.799> hook<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.310> be<00:04:17.430> work<00:04:17.640> hard

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
just want that hook to be work hard

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.130 
just want that hook to be work hard
enough<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:18.299> that<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.479> doesn't<00:04:18.720> pull<00:04:18.930> out<00:04:19.049> of

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
enough so that it doesn't pull out of

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.449 
enough so that it doesn't pull out of
shape<00:04:19.320> because<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.620> can<00:04:19.769> see<00:04:19.919> how<00:04:20.010> easily<00:04:20.280> I

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
shape because you can see how easily I

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.850 
shape because you can see how easily I
can<00:04:20.519> pull<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.120> wire<00:04:21.330> with<00:04:21.660> my<00:04:21.810> fingers<00:04:22.320> so

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
can pull the wire with my fingers so

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.370 
can pull the wire with my fingers so
obviously<00:04:23.340> over<00:04:23.700> time<00:04:23.940> with<00:04:24.120> use<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.900> hook

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
obviously over time with use that hook

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.660 
obviously over time with use that hook
would<00:04:25.650> become<00:04:26.130> well

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
would become well

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.730 
would become well
unrecognizable<00:04:27.480> so<00:04:27.960> that's<00:04:28.140> just<00:04:28.290> how<00:04:28.560> I'm

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
unrecognizable so that's just how I'm

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.740 
unrecognizable so that's just how I'm
work<00:04:29.490> hardening<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.240> that's<00:04:30.450> what<00:04:30.630> it's

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
work hardening it that's what it's

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.170 
work hardening it that's what it's
called<00:04:30.900> when<00:04:31.140> you<00:04:31.200> hammer<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:32.670> now<00:04:32.880> I'm

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
called when you hammer it so now I'm

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.640 
called when you hammer it so now I'm
going<00:04:33.510> to<00:04:33.690> make<00:04:33.840> this<00:04:33.870> second<00:04:34.410> earring

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
going to make this second earring

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.230 
going to make this second earring
essentially<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.400> same<00:04:35.550> as<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.820> first<00:04:36.030> so

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
essentially the same as the first so

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.910 
essentially the same as the first so
that's<00:04:36.420> why<00:04:36.540> we're<00:04:36.720> going<00:04:36.870> into<00:04:37.140> fast<00:04:37.500> forward

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
that's why we're going into fast forward

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.290 
that's why we're going into fast forward
you<00:04:38.040> can<00:04:38.160> see<00:04:38.340> I'm<00:04:38.430> creating<00:04:38.730> that<00:04:38.850> little

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
you can see I'm creating that little

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.570 
you can see I'm creating that little
more<00:04:39.450> than<00:04:39.630> 90<00:04:39.870> degree<00:04:40.110> Bend<00:04:40.440> I'm<00:04:41.190> going<00:04:41.370> to<00:04:41.460> do

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
more than 90 degree Bend I'm going to do

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.120 
more than 90 degree Bend I'm going to do
it<00:04:41.700> again<00:04:41.760> on<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.060> other<00:04:42.150> side<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.680> am

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
it again on the other side and I am

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.490 
it again on the other side and I am
going<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:44.460> try<00:04:44.640> to<00:04:44.730> match<00:04:45.090> up<00:04:45.420> so<00:04:45.780> that<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.110> two

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
going to try to match up so that the two

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.440 
going to try to match up so that the two
earrings<00:04:46.890> have<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.160> same<00:04:47.520> size<00:04:47.880> triangle

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
earrings have the same size triangle

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.390 
earrings have the same size triangle
that's<00:04:48.630> why<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:48.780> keep<00:04:48.990> comparing<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.010> then

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
that's why I keep comparing it and then

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.070 
that's why I keep comparing it and then
I'm<00:04:50.520> going<00:04:50.670> to<00:04:50.700> bend<00:04:51.030> that<00:04:51.150> remember<00:04:51.900> last

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
I'm going to bend that remember last

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.720 
I'm going to bend that remember last
time<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.380> didn't<00:04:52.860> bend<00:04:53.040> it<00:04:53.190> but<00:04:53.370> I<00:04:53.400> mentioned

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
time I didn't bend it but I mentioned

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.790 
time I didn't bend it but I mentioned
that<00:04:53.760> you<00:04:53.910> could<00:04:54.240> if<00:04:54.390> you<00:04:54.420> wanted<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:55.230> and<00:04:55.590> so

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
that you could if you wanted to and so

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.230 
that you could if you wanted to and so
that<00:04:55.980> just<00:04:56.400> makes<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.730> so<00:04:56.820> that<00:04:56.910> you<00:04:57.060> don't

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
that just makes it so that you don't

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.640 
that just makes it so that you don't
have<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.450> straightening<00:04:58.020> on<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.320> other<00:04:58.440> end

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
have the straightening on the other end

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.790 
have the straightening on the other end
now<00:04:59.250> I<00:04:59.280> made<00:04:59.730> this<00:04:59.880> wire<00:05:00.150> too<00:05:00.510> short<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.200> my

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
now I made this wire too short and my

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.960 
now I made this wire too short and my
fingers<00:05:02.130> aren't<00:05:02.310> strong<00:05:02.550> enough<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:02.880> i'm

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
fingers aren't strong enough so i'm

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.430

the two hooks I'm going to sand it down
it's<00:05:24.450> the<00:05:24.540> same<00:05:24.750> process<00:05:25.260> over<00:05:25.380> and<00:05:25.560> over<00:05:25.650> once

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
it's the same process over and over once

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.320 
it's the same process over and over once
you<00:05:26.100> make<00:05:26.280> one<00:05:26.550> earring<00:05:26.910> you<00:05:27.030> can<00:05:27.180> make<00:05:27.300> a

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
you make one earring you can make a

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.720 
you make one earring you can make a
bajillion<00:05:27.720> of<00:05:28.080> them<00:05:28.260> hammering<00:05:28.800> it<00:05:29.010> etc<00:05:29.400> etc

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
bajillion of them hammering it etc etc

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.510 
bajillion of them hammering it etc etc
and<00:05:30.300> then<00:05:30.990> of<00:05:31.320> course<00:05:31.350> I<00:05:31.830> want<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.190> check<00:05:32.370> the

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
and then of course I want to check the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.250 
and then of course I want to check the
two<00:05:32.640> against<00:05:32.880> each<00:05:32.940> other<00:05:33.150> but<00:05:33.450> look<00:05:33.750> one<00:05:34.110> of

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
two against each other but look one of

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.990 
two against each other but look one of
my<00:05:34.350> hooks<00:05:34.590> is<00:05:34.770> actually<00:05:35.280> longer<00:05:35.520> than<00:05:35.760> the

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
my hooks is actually longer than the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.330 
my hooks is actually longer than the
other<00:05:36.150> so<00:05:36.600> I'm<00:05:36.780> going<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.110> go<00:05:37.380> ahead<00:05:37.410> and<00:05:37.770> i<00:05:38.160> am

to<00:05:42.570> go<00:05:42.690> through<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:42.960> sanding<00:05:43.440> process<00:05:43.620> one

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
to go through the sanding process one

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.330 
to go through the sanding process one
more<00:05:44.400> time<00:05:44.640> and<00:05:45.500> you<00:05:46.500> know<00:05:46.650> so<00:05:46.860> you<00:05:46.890> waste<00:05:47.220> a

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
more time and you know so you waste a

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.830 
more time and you know so you waste a
little<00:05:47.550> bit<00:05:47.700> of<00:05:47.790> wire<00:05:48.000> you're<00:05:48.390> going<00:05:48.540> to<00:05:48.600> live

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
little bit of wire you're going to live

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.930 
little bit of wire you're going to live
through<00:05:49.110> it<00:05:49.140> and<00:05:49.410> there<00:05:49.710> you<00:05:49.800> go<00:05:49.830> I<00:05:50.190> have<00:05:50.520> two

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
through it and there you go I have two
