their last whether the medal they were

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.580 
their last whether the medal they were
using<00:02:17.640> for<00:02:17.849> its<00:02:17.970> frame<00:02:18.440> would<00:02:19.440> be

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.280 
down
into<00:02:22.480> bullets<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:25.420> each<00:02:25.540> day<00:02:25.870> went<00:02:26.200> by

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
into bullets but each day went by

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.410 
into bullets but each day went by
without<00:02:27.190> any<00:02:27.550> orders<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.060> halt<00:02:28.240> construction

without any orders to halt construction

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.170 
without any orders to halt construction
and<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:29.260> they<00:02:29.410> kept<00:02:29.680> on<00:02:29.830> working<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.400> kept<00:02:31.000> on

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
and so they kept on working and kept on

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.140 
and so they kept on working and kept on
building<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:33.250> when<00:02:33.340> President<00:02:33.790> Lincoln<00:02:34.120> was

finally told of all the metal being used

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.900 
finally told of all the metal being used
here<00:02:37.590> his<00:02:38.590> response<00:02:39.130> was<00:02:39.730> short<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.240> clear

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
here his response was short and clear

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.830 
here his response was short and clear
that<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.120> as<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.600> should<00:02:43.630> be<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:46.480> American
