commentary<00:00:11.429> on<00:00:11.610> my<00:00:11.730> assault<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.509> made<00:00:13.500> one<00:00:13.679> of

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
commentary on my assault I made one of

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.160 
commentary on my assault I made one of
my<00:00:13.860> recon<00:00:14.309> but<00:00:14.700> my<00:00:14.910> KD<00:00:15.210> wasn't<00:00:15.690> up<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.809> par<00:00:15.960> so

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
my recon but my KD wasn't up to par so

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.960 
my recon but my KD wasn't up to par so
I'm<00:00:16.680> still<00:00:17.010> questioning<00:00:17.279> if<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.760> want<00:00:17.940> to

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
I'm still questioning if I want to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.910 
I'm still questioning if I want to
upload<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.330> might<00:00:19.230> not<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:19.410> jumped<00:00:19.800> into

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
upload it might not just jumped into

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.099 
upload it might not just jumped into
random<00:00:20.250> server<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.970> don't<00:00:21.570> think<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:21.930> all<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
random server I don't think it's all the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.509 
random server I don't think it's all the
way<00:00:22.140> full<00:00:22.439> right<00:00:22.650> now<00:00:22.800> because<00:00:23.130> it's<00:00:23.279> kind<00:00:23.369> of

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
way full right now because it's kind of

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.310 
way full right now because it's kind of
early<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.269> morning<00:00:24.660> maybe<00:00:25.019> like<00:00:25.170> around

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
early in the morning maybe like around

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.810 
early in the morning maybe like around
two<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.070> think<00:00:26.810> but<00:00:27.830> this<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.039> my<00:00:29.310> first<00:00:29.550> live

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
two I think but this is my first live

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.569 
two I think but this is my first live
commentary<00:00:30.390> i<00:00:30.510> decided<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.050> make<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.579> and

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
commentary i decided to make one and

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.470 
commentary i decided to make one and
again<00:00:32.820> i'll<00:00:32.940> be<00:00:33.120> using<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.719> odd<00:00:35.420> even<00:00:36.420> though

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
again i'll be using is odd even though

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.970 
again i'll be using is odd even though
this<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:36.960> sideways<00:00:37.440> recoil

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
this is going to have sideways recoil

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.069 
this is going to have sideways recoil
it's<00:00:38.309> still<00:00:38.550> manageable<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.270> my<00:00:39.420> opinion<00:00:39.780> i

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
it's still manageable in my opinion i

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.250 
it's still manageable in my opinion i
still<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.649> using<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.100> gun<00:00:41.329> i<00:00:42.329> preferred

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
over the AEK because like i don't like

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.799 
over the AEK because like i don't like

what<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:13.490> if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.640> want<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.939> attach<00:01:15.390> them<00:01:15.600> so

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
what it is if you want to attach them so

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.219 
what it is if you want to attach them so
I'm<00:01:15.750> using<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.229> gun<00:01:16.470> i'm<00:01:17.220> using<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.229> viper

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
I'm using on this gun i'm using a viper

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.950 
I'm using on this gun i'm using a viper
mags<00:01:19.590> predator<00:01:20.520> barrel<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.180> nemesis<00:01:21.720> stock

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
mags predator barrel and nemesis stock

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.590 
mags predator barrel and nemesis stock
and<00:01:22.799> i<00:01:22.920> find<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.460> makes<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.790> recoil<00:01:24.270> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
and i find that it makes a recoil it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.140 
and i find that it makes a recoil it
still<00:01:24.930> goes<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:25.909> at<00:01:26.909> close

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
still goes to the right but at close

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.380 
still goes to the right but at close
range<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:29.159> really<00:01:29.340> easy<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
range it's really it's really easy to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.630 
range it's really it's really easy to
control<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.320> longer<00:01:31.770> ranges<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.490> just

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
control and at longer ranges you just

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.700 
control and at longer ranges you just
have<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.820> take<00:01:32.970> first<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> opposite

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
have to take first in the opposite

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.580 
have to take first in the opposite
direction<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.520> little<00:01:35.640> bit<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.590> like

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
direction for a little bit and then like

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.429 
direction for a little bit and then like
your<00:01:37.890> shots<00:01:38.220> will<00:01:38.400> stand<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:39.079> but<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.259> stuff

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
your shots will stand for but for stuff

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.260 
your shots will stand for but for stuff
like<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.860> kind<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:42.119> the

tactical<00:05:14.190> would<00:05:14.280> help<00:05:14.430> for<00:05:14.610> it<00:05:14.640> because<00:05:14.760> if<00:05:14.970> it

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
tactical would help for it because if it

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.630 
tactical would help for it because if it
puts<00:05:15.660> stabilizing<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:16.470> like<00:05:16.980> it<00:05:17.340> would<00:05:17.460> have

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
puts stabilizing it like it would have

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.460 
puts stabilizing it like it would have
massive<00:05:18.330> vertical<00:05:18.480> recoil<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.260> if<00:05:19.380> you

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
massive vertical recoil and if you

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.290 
massive vertical recoil and if you
protect<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:19.950> going<00:05:20.160> it<00:05:20.370> would<00:05:20.490> have<00:05:20.700> it<00:05:21.240> would

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
protect it going it would have it would

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.910 
protect it going it would have it would
bounce<00:05:21.600> around<00:05:22.020> and<00:05:22.380> have<00:05:22.500> a<00:05:22.530> lot<00:05:22.860> of

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
bounce around and have a lot of

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.340 
bounce around and have a lot of
deviation<00:05:23.670> so<00:05:24.330> I<00:05:24.360> really<00:05:24.630> don't<00:05:24.750> know<00:05:24.900> what's

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
deviation so I really don't know what's

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.320 
deviation so I really don't know what's
the<00:05:25.440> best<00:05:25.470> bet<00:05:25.860> with<00:05:25.980> that<00:05:26.130> gun<00:05:26.340> that<00:05:27.120> guns

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
the best bet with that gun that guns

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
the best bet with that gun that guns
total<00:05:27.750> trash<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.440> regret<00:05:28.980> buying<00:05:29.640> it<00:05:29.940> I<00:05:30.350> totally

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
total trash I regret buying it I totally

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.490 
total trash I regret buying it I totally
regret<00:05:31.500> buying<00:05:31.890> it<00:05:32.780> but<00:05:33.780> just<00:05:34.200> in<00:05:34.470> case

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
regret buying it but just in case

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.620 
regret buying it but just in case
because<00:05:35.190> this<00:05:35.669> all<00:05:35.850> happened<00:05:36.150> today<00:05:36.270> that's

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
because this all happened today that's

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.090 
because this all happened today that's
why<00:05:36.780> I<00:05:36.810> like<00:05:36.900> it's<00:05:37.169> so<00:05:37.290> fresh<00:05:37.500> on<00:05:37.680> my<00:05:37.770> mind<00:05:37.800> and

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
why I like it's so fresh on my mind and

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.040 
why I like it's so fresh on my mind and
everything<00:05:38.580> so<00:05:39.360> just<00:05:39.390> in<00:05:39.630> case<00:05:39.750> y'all<00:05:39.990> are

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
everything so just in case y'all are

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.750 
everything so just in case y'all are
thinking<00:05:40.080> about<00:05:40.380> buying<00:05:40.500> it<00:05:40.890> don't<00:05:41.220> buy<00:05:41.400> it<00:05:41.460> so

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
thinking about buying it don't buy it so

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.940 
thinking about buying it don't buy it so
with<00:05:41.910> money<00:05:42.419> it's<00:05:43.200> a<00:05:43.260> waste<00:05:43.440> of<00:05:43.530> your<00:05:43.650> time

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950

with money it's a waste of your time
I've<00:05:44.910> even<00:05:45.270> considering<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.560> thought<00:05:46.770> of

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
I've even considering the thought of

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.700 
I've even considering the thought of
buying<00:05:47.130> that<00:05:47.280> gun<00:05:47.490> don't<00:05:47.730> do<00:05:47.940> it<00:05:48.440> don't<00:05:49.440> carry

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710
