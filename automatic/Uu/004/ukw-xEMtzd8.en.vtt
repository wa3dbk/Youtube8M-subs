00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.080
 welcome youtube eros 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:24.100
 to this tutorial 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.260
 next part of the guide that if what 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.070
 the only one I was looking for, so root your 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.039
 phone 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.039
 in this step you will have to stay 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.860
 yes it will follow the whole guide is not 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 It is necessary to take this step 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.450
 well first we'll look in the file 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:54.770
 that I put the link called root 210 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:58.710
 and then with that with this file what 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.130
 does it hit it to sd memory 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.120
 that your phone 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.920
 we activate the birth usb 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.430
 and we agreed to copy 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.050
 we stick it on the b sd 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.050
 at the root of the sd 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.299
 good we extract 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.180
 the phone is very careful at the time 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.780
 extra on your device because 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.110
 many ruin the sd card 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.110
 do not 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.670
 to assemble it as it should be 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.240
 good one time 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.360
 assembled we deactivate the storage 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.360
 usb 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.620
 and we will have the phone we will have the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.910
 phone 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.910
 the file d 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.500
 after 200 days yes no 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.500
 we leave it as they are alone 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.690
 if they open it they will see that it does not have to 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.590
 those folders but do not extract it 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.369
 leave it like this 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.369
 once 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.890
 the copied file we turn off our 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.810
 phone 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.390
 and we enter the normal mode 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.760
 recovery since I'm recording 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.970
 take advantage of that and I'll turn off and the ground 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.430
 will enter it 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.430
 as I explained before and it is connected 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.820
 to some electrical source either in the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:40.280
 computer or with the charger the 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.280
 program will start alone 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.580
 well we hope you start 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.990
 very good there we have 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.050
 the chrome screen 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.090
 no longer record the a 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.670
 the image with the camera because I have already 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.010
 shown in our video that what 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.180
 happens in this catcher is what is 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:14.240
 happening in physical we are not going to leave 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.610
 be with that impudence 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.490
 and there we will select yes 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.319
 sd card and we will look for the root file 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.920
 of 200 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.359
 of 210 points always remember that this 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.359
 is to surround him then 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.400
 I recommend that before this they have 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.190
 backed security as 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.040
 indicates the video of how to make copies 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.810
 and restore backup copies 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.989
 we select that if we want to install and 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.989
 yes 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:56.200
 you can start to open the package and 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:00.960
 when finished and say install sd card 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.960
 complete then we give something back 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:18.360
 good with this already has rooted your 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.709
 phone , all you have to do is 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.790
 so everything works well for you 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.760
 install 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.729
 since prehistory the application of 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:35.689
 we did it 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.689
 and update the root application 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.039
 we hope that our 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.039
 phones 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.050
 as you see them say as an annuity 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.479
 but there is a 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.080
 new thing that is the application of 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:04.380
 superuser superuser is the one 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.420
 will carry the logs 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.420
 and the configuration of 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:15.860
 of the permits for that has been all 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.120
 with this they have already flipped it the only thing 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.930
 what you have to do is enter the 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.420
 appstore 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.210
 do not give it to you because I do not have an account 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:32.100
 added at this time enter the face 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:34.590
 thor and write bus and box and install it and 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.990
 use it and use it as it says in the 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.480
 application 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.980
 bruce and box we're just going to 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.720
 install because some other application 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.030
 he asks for it 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.590
 otherwise you can leave 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.590
 as is 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.580
 the fruit another thing that you have to take in 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.630
 realize that many make them 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.840
 development option and without that option 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:04.400
 the fruit is not going to work 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.280
 Input the applications settings 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:11.960
 Applications 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:15.139
 the development and mark usb debugging 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.960
 usb population always has to be the 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.660
 to have it checked for root 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.800
 functions 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:29.340
 this has been all in this video remember
