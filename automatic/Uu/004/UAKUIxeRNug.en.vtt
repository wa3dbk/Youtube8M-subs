up or something like that so anything
can<00:03:40.620> happen<00:03:40.770> you<00:03:41.310> have<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.430> be<00:03:41.550> prepared<00:03:41.700> for

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
can happen you have to be prepared for

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.860 
can happen you have to be prepared for
that<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.240> have<00:03:42.270> to<00:03:42.390> be<00:03:42.480> able<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.660> think<00:03:42.810> on

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
that you have to be able to think on

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.860 
that you have to be able to think on
your<00:03:42.930> feet<00:03:43.050> as<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.350> team<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:44.520> have<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> way<00:03:45.630> that

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
your feet as a team you have a way that

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.540 
your feet as a team you have a way that
you<00:03:45.959> think<00:03:45.990> it<00:03:46.350> might<00:03:46.500> go<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:47.010> strategy<00:03:47.520> to

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
you think it might go and a strategy to

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.220 
you think it might go and a strategy to
try<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.000> oppose<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.450> opposition<00:03:48.840> strengths

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
try and oppose the opposition strengths

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.780 
try and oppose the opposition strengths
but<00:03:49.350> often<00:03:50.070> those<00:03:50.220> can<00:03:50.400> go<00:03:50.520> out<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.700> window

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
but often those can go out the window

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.970 
but often those can go out the window
very<00:03:51.180> quickly<00:03:51.390> so<00:03:51.720> it's<00:03:52.290> just<00:03:52.530> about<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.680> team

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
very quickly so it's just about the team

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.199 
very quickly so it's just about the team
who<00:03:53.100> can<00:03:53.250> handle<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.610> on<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.850> date<00:03:54.030> who

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
who can handle it on the date who

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.410 
who can handle it on the date who
performs<00:03:54.720> who's<00:03:55.500> resilient<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:57.090> can<00:03:57.240> think

performs who's resilient you can think

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.240 
performs who's resilient you can think
on<00:03:57.540> their<00:03:57.570> feet<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.990> find<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.320> way<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.470> win<00:03:58.680> we

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
on their feet and find a way to win we

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.590
