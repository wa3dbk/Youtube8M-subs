eyes of the drone these indicate that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
eyes of the drone these indicate that
battery<00:01:15.210> life<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.600> well<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:15.900> when<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> drone

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
battery life as well as when the drone

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.050 
battery life as well as when the drone
is<00:01:16.439> charging<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.310> fully<00:01:17.580> charged

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
is charging and when it is fully charged

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.760 
is charging and when it is fully charged
if<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.750> move<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> back<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.439> can't<00:01:19.619> see

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
if you move to the back you can't see

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.770 
if you move to the back you can't see
that<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> battery<00:01:20.790> input<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:21.360> well<00:01:21.390> as

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that there is a battery input as well as

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.690 
that there is a battery input as well as
the<00:01:22.020> charging<00:01:22.470> input<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.009> drone<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the charging input for this drone it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.280 
the charging input for this drone it
takes<00:01:23.939> about<00:01:24.060> an<00:01:24.270> hour<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.840> charge<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
takes about an hour to have to charge it

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.630 
takes about an hour to have to charge it
and<00:01:25.500> you're<00:01:25.650> gonna<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:25.950> eight<00:01:26.189> minutes<00:01:26.520> of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
and you're gonna get eight minutes of

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.920 
and you're gonna get eight minutes of
battery<00:01:26.790> life<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> battery<00:01:27.540> life<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.810> this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
battery life so the battery life on this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
battery life so the battery life on this
isn't<00:01:28.409> stellar<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.759> terrible<00:01:30.119> for

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
isn't stellar but it's not terrible for

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.359 
isn't stellar but it's not terrible for
drones<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.810> size<00:01:31.079> um<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.189> then<00:01:32.280> if

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
drones of this size um and then if

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.740 
drones of this size um and then if
you'll<00:01:32.490> head<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> bottom<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.240> are<00:01:33.390> going

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
you'll head to the bottom you are going

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.170 
you'll head to the bottom you are going
to<00:01:33.900> get<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> camera<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.920> well<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> stability

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
to get a camera as well as a stability

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.240 
to get a camera as well as a stability
thing<00:01:36.600> which<00:01:36.900> will<00:01:37.170> use<00:01:37.439> auto<00:01:37.680> pilot<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.100> kind

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
thing which will use auto pilot to kind

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.429 
thing which will use auto pilot to kind
of<00:01:38.280> keep<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.520> hovering<00:01:38.880> uses<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.960> three<00:01:40.170> action

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
of keep it hovering uses a three action

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.770 
of keep it hovering uses a three action
3-axis<00:01:41.340> gyroscope<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.240> three<00:01:42.390> axis

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
3-axis gyroscope and three axis

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.749 
3-axis gyroscope and three axis
accelerometer<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.799> keep<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> drone<00:01:44.250> stable

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
accelerometer to keep the drone stable

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.670 
accelerometer to keep the drone stable
so<00:01:45.149> will<00:01:45.390> stay<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.720> place<00:01:45.750> when<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> first<00:01:46.470> you

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
so will stay in place when you first you

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.260 
so will stay in place when you first you
know<00:01:46.770> take<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.040> off<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.430> won't<00:01:47.520> fly<00:01:47.850> away<00:01:48.030> like

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
know take it off it won't fly away like

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.490 
know take it off it won't fly away like
some<00:01:48.450> kind<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> cheap<00:01:48.899> little<00:01:49.079> drum<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.439> you

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
some kind of cheap little drum that you

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.830 
some kind of cheap little drum that you
get<00:01:49.649> from<00:01:49.680> walmart<00:01:50.070> or<00:01:50.399> something<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.759> that

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
get from walmart or something like that

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.870 
get from walmart or something like that
and<00:01:51.840> then<00:01:51.960> also<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:53.040> use<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.579> camera<00:01:53.759> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
and then also you can use the camera to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.880 
and then also you can use the camera to
take<00:01:54.119> drone<00:01:54.420> selfies<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.170> shoots<00:01:55.470> at<00:01:55.649> three

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
take drone selfies it shoots at three

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.440 
take drone selfies it shoots at three
hundred<00:01:56.130> thousand<00:01:56.430> pixels<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.210> fly

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
hundred thousand pixels and you can fly

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.030 
hundred thousand pixels and you can fly
the<00:01:57.509> drone<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:57.990> above<00:01:58.170> yourself<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.740> use<00:01:58.890> it

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
the drone up above yourself and use it

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.490 
the drone up above yourself and use it
to<00:01:59.100> take<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.430> drone<00:01:59.729> selfie<00:02:00.259> inside<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.380> their

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
to take a drone selfie inside of their

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.899 
to take a drone selfie inside of their
app<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.340> cool<00:02:02.460> thing<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.880> about

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.760 
app one really cool thing I like about
this<00:02:03.180> drone<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.140> does<00:02:04.290> actually<00:02:04.469> have

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
this drone is it does actually have

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.910

automatically do a flip you can have it
to<00:02:12.900> a

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
to a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.990 
to a
backflip<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.560> front<00:02:13.920> flip<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.220> right<00:02:14.460> roll<00:02:14.730> or<00:02:14.940> a

how<00:02:19.380> they<00:02:19.530> built<00:02:19.770> these<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.160> just<00:02:20.550> kind<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.730> as

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
how they built these in just kind of as

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.070 
how they built these in just kind of as
an<00:02:21.030> added<00:02:21.300> feature<00:02:21.330> because<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.960> average

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
an added feature because the average

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.050 
an added feature because the average
user<00:02:22.350> would<00:02:22.680> not<00:02:22.860> be<00:02:22.980> able<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.220> do<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.520> so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
user would not be able to do this so

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.550 
user would not be able to do this so
it's<00:02:24.270> neat<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.450> they<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:25.140> know<00:02:25.170> had<00:02:25.410> these

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
it's neat that they you know had these

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.260 
it's neat that they you know had these
in<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.860> app<00:02:26.040> or<00:02:26.280> you're<00:02:26.430> easily<00:02:26.610> able<00:02:26.910> to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
in the app or you're easily able to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.700 
in the app or you're easily able to
press<00:02:27.510> them<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.320> drone<00:02:28.560> will

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
press them and it the drone will

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.470 
press them and it the drone will
automatically<00:02:29.250> perform<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> trick<00:02:29.940> now<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
automatically perform the trick now the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.180 
automatically perform the trick now the
actual<00:02:30.840> performance<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.650> drone<00:02:31.980> is

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
actual performance of this drone is

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.040 
actual performance of this drone is
great<00:02:32.550> if<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:32.910> inside<00:02:33.150> if<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:33.870> inside

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
great if it's inside if it's inside

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.750 
great if it's inside if it's inside
there's<00:02:34.410> no<00:02:34.500> type<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.740> outside<00:02:35.010> elements<00:02:35.490> that

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
there's no type of outside elements that

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.640 
there's no type of outside elements that
are<00:02:35.820> affecting<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:37.200> pretty<00:02:37.320> easy<00:02:37.440> to

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
are affecting it so it's pretty easy to

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.830 
are affecting it so it's pretty easy to
fly<00:02:37.890> around<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.520> can<00:02:38.760> easily<00:02:39.270> navigate<00:02:39.420> it

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
fly around you can easily navigate it

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.449 
fly around you can easily navigate it
around<00:02:40.050> your<00:02:40.230> house<00:02:40.380> chase<00:02:40.830> your<00:02:41.010> dogs<00:02:41.190> for

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
around your house chase your dogs for

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.550 
around your house chase your dogs for
something<00:02:41.730> like<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.090> other<00:02:42.300> app<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.320> really

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
something like that other app is really

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.199 
something like that other app is really
great<00:02:43.709> for<00:02:43.770> flying<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.400> all<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> have<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.090> do

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
great for flying this all you have to do

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.760 
great for flying this all you have to do
is<00:02:45.300> bluetooth<00:02:45.630> connected<00:02:46.080> up<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.380> your<00:02:46.500> drone

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
is bluetooth connected up to your drone

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.530 
is bluetooth connected up to your drone
I<00:02:46.980> mean<00:02:47.340> you're<00:02:47.459> able<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.880> tilt<00:02:48.330> your<00:02:48.450> phone

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
I mean you're able to tilt your phone

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.530 
I mean you're able to tilt your phone
side<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.110> side<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.980> will<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.370> know<00:02:50.540> change

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
side to side and it will you know change

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.150 
side to side and it will you know change
how<00:02:51.870> where<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.230> drone<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.530> going<00:02:52.770> forward<00:02:53.100> or

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
how where the drone is going forward or

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.340 
how where the drone is going forward or
backward<00:02:53.550> or<00:02:53.670> side<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.970> side<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.110> really

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
backward or side to side so I really

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.110 
backward or side to side so I really
like<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.590> overall<00:02:56.040> their<00:02:56.190> app<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.670> very<00:02:56.760> very

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
like that overall their app is very very

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.640 
like that overall their app is very very
great<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.750> can<00:02:57.900> easily<00:02:58.230> adjust<00:02:58.320> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
great and you can easily adjust the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.960 
great and you can easily adjust the
height<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.040> can<00:02:59.220> make<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.520> automatically

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
height you can make it automatically

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.640 
height you can make it automatically
take<00:03:00.150> off<00:03:00.360> or<00:03:00.600> do<00:03:00.870> an<00:03:00.959> emergency<00:03:01.110> landing

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
take off or do an emergency landing

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.740 
take off or do an emergency landing
which<00:03:02.040> stops<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.520> drone<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:02.940> has<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.300> free

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
which stops the drone is has it free

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.420 
which stops the drone is has it free
fall<00:03:03.930> from<00:03:04.110> where<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:05.100> their<00:03:05.280> app

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
fall from where it is so their app

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.010 
fall from where it is so their app
overall<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.030> really<00:03:06.270> great<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.690> indoor

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
overall is really great in the indoor

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.270 
overall is really great in the indoor
performance<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.709> drone<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.070> really

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
performance of this drone is really

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.460 
performance of this drone is really
great<00:03:08.459> but<00:03:08.910> outside<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.690> drone<00:03:09.959> is<00:03:10.110> not<00:03:10.290> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
great but outside this drone is not the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.710 
great but outside this drone is not the
best<00:03:10.680> if<00:03:11.489> there's<00:03:11.700> any<00:03:11.910> type<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.180> wind<00:03:12.450> at<00:03:12.570> all

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
best if there's any type of wind at all

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.120 
best if there's any type of wind at all
it<00:03:12.900> will<00:03:12.989> take<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.320> drone<00:03:13.530> away<00:03:13.770> it's<00:03:13.980> not

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
it will take the drone away it's not

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.280 
it will take the drone away it's not
heavy<00:03:14.370> enough<00:03:14.459> for<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.239> be<00:03:15.720> stable<00:03:16.020> and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
heavy enough for it to be stable and

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.620 
heavy enough for it to be stable and
it's<00:03:16.380> very<00:03:16.620> very<00:03:16.709> hard<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.100> control<00:03:17.340> outside

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
it's very very hard to control outside

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.940 
it's very very hard to control outside
I've<00:03:18.630> tried<00:03:18.810> multiple<00:03:18.989> times<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.680> fly<00:03:19.890> this

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
I've tried multiple times to fly this

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.830 
I've tried multiple times to fly this
thing<00:03:20.130> outside<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.090> wind<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.420> just<00:03:21.660> such

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
thing outside and the wind is just such

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.900 
thing outside and the wind is just such
a<00:03:21.870> huge<00:03:22.170> factor<00:03:22.410> when<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.799> fly<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.760> in

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
a huge factor when you fly this that in

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.490 
a huge factor when you fly this that in
my<00:03:24.030> opinion<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.600> not<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.900> great<00:03:25.140> drone<00:03:25.410> to

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
my opinion this is not a great drone to

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.810 
my opinion this is not a great drone to
file<00:03:25.650> it's<00:03:25.830> not<00:03:25.920> it's<00:03:26.100> more<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.489> like<00:03:26.519> an

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
file it's not it's more of like an

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.780 
file it's not it's more of like an
indoor<00:03:27.209> one<00:03:27.510> um<00:03:27.980> because<00:03:28.980> there's<00:03:29.160> no<00:03:29.280> outside

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
indoor one um because there's no outside

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.060 
indoor one um because there's no outside
type<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.600> elements<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.140> affect<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:31.830> if<00:03:31.950> you

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
type of elements to affect it so if you

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.530 
type of elements to affect it so if you
do<00:03:32.220> want<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.489> fly<00:03:32.610> this<00:03:32.670> outside<00:03:33.120> i'm<00:03:33.390> not

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
do want to fly this outside i'm not

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.759 
do want to fly this outside i'm not
saying<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.019> best<00:03:34.260> room<00:03:34.500> for<00:03:34.650> that

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
saying this is the best room for that

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.770 
saying this is the best room for that
just<00:03:35.340> because<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.640> wind<00:03:36.000> blows<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.390> away<00:03:36.450> very

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
just because the wind blows it away very

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.479 
just because the wind blows it away very
easily<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.350> if<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.769> touches<00:03:38.010> any<00:03:38.280> type<00:03:38.459> of

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
easily and if it touches any type of

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.280 
easily and if it touches any type of
tree<00:03:38.820> branch<00:03:39.090> or<00:03:39.239> anything<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.600> done<00:03:39.870> for<00:03:40.110> it's

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
tree branch or anything is done for it's

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.320 
tree branch or anything is done for it's
definitely<00:03:40.620> going<00:03:40.769> down<00:03:41.100> whereas<00:03:41.820> indoors

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
definitely going down whereas indoors

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.630 
definitely going down whereas indoors
you're<00:03:42.660> able<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.680> easily<00:03:43.830> navigate<00:03:44.040> this

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
you're able to easily navigate this

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.580 
you're able to easily navigate this
because<00:03:44.970> there<00:03:45.090> isn't<00:03:45.360> type<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.630> any<00:03:46.320> type<00:03:46.560> of

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
because there isn't type of any type of

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.199 
because there isn't type of any type of
wind<00:03:46.950> or<00:03:47.070> something<00:03:47.220> affecting<00:03:47.820> its<00:03:47.970> flight

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
wind or something affecting its flight

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.490 
wind or something affecting its flight
with<00:03:48.570> this<00:03:48.720> shown<00:03:48.930> like<00:03:49.080> I<00:03:49.200> said<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.470> are

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
with this shown like I said you are

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.990 
with this shown like I said you are
actually<00:03:50.040> going<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.310> get<00:03:50.430> wheel<00:03:50.640> attachments

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
actually going to get wheel attachments

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.090 
actually going to get wheel attachments
and<00:03:51.390> these<00:03:51.540> are<00:03:51.690> really<00:03:52.140> easy<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.530> install<00:03:52.799> all

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
and these are really easy to install all

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.229

that you would if it's free flying
without<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.810> wheels<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:04.830> can<00:04:05.040> roll<00:04:05.280> around

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310

the<00:04:21.840> build<00:04:22.020> quality<00:04:22.169> isn't<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.710> best<00:04:22.770> in<00:04:23.099> my

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
the build quality isn't the best in my

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.920 
the build quality isn't the best in my
opinion<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.700> have<00:04:23.729> hit<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.360> on<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.479> wall<00:04:24.750> and

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
them actually bent I had to bend it back

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.120 
them actually bent I had to bend it back
in<00:04:29.180> place<00:04:29.240> to<00:04:29.630> get<00:04:29.720> it<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:29.960> work<00:04:30.169> so<00:04:30.740> overall

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
I'm not super impressed with the build

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.030 
I'm not super impressed with the build
quality<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:32.990> also<00:04:33.169> the<00:04:33.500> fact<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.889> only

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
quality and also the fact that it only

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.830 
quality and also the fact that it only
lasts<00:04:34.340> for<00:04:34.400> eight<00:04:34.669> minutes<00:04:35.000> it's<00:04:35.540> kind<00:04:35.720> of<00:04:35.750> a

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
lasts for eight minutes it's kind of a

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.960 
lasts for eight minutes it's kind of a
huge<00:04:35.990> factor<00:04:36.199> for<00:04:36.500> me<00:04:36.530> as<00:04:36.710> well<00:04:36.740> because<00:04:36.979> you

huge factor for me as well because you

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.490 
huge factor for me as well because you
have<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.180> continually<00:04:38.660> charge<00:04:39.020> a<00:04:39.080> thing<00:04:39.350> for

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
have to continually charge a thing for

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.629 
have to continually charge a thing for
an<00:04:39.560> hour<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.800> a<00:04:39.830> half<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:40.160> get<00:04:40.280> it<00:04:40.370> back<00:04:40.490> out

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
an hour and a half and get it back out

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.640 
an hour and a half and get it back out
for<00:04:40.880> six<00:04:41.120> minutes<00:04:41.330> like<00:04:41.690> just<00:04:42.229> me<00:04:42.410> personally

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
for six minutes like just me personally

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.890 
for six minutes like just me personally
that's<00:04:43.100> not<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.970> know<00:04:44.090> like<00:04:44.330> my<00:04:44.570> ideal

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
situation so I'm not a huge fan of the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.580 
situation so I'm not a huge fan of the
battery<00:04:47.510> time<00:04:47.720> or<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.050> build<00:04:48.229> quality<00:04:48.350> of

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
battery time or the build quality of

battery time or the build quality of
this<00:04:48.650> drone<00:04:48.919> it<00:04:49.310> is<00:04:49.550> really<00:04:49.820> fun<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.150> play<00:04:50.330> with
