should<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.660> probably<00:00:19.170> don't<00:00:19.410> need<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> be

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
should you probably don't need to be

should you probably don't need to be
working<00:00:20.250> much<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.029> tension<00:00:21.240> especially

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
working much with the tension especially

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.480 
working much with the tension especially
if<00:00:22.289> you're<00:00:22.440> using<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.830> same<00:00:23.039> thread<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.460> your

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
if you're using the same thread in your

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.849 
if you're using the same thread in your
needle<00:00:23.610> as<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> bobbin<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.740> we

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
needle as you do in the bobbin but we

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.500 
needle as you do in the bobbin but we
all<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:26.340> those<00:00:26.490> times<00:00:26.550> where<00:00:27.150> things<00:00:27.359> just

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
all have those times where things just

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.590 
all have those times where things just
don't<00:00:27.840> go<00:00:27.960> right<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:28.850> that<00:00:29.850> you<00:00:29.970> are<00:00:30.119> finding

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
don't go right or that you are finding

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.720 
don't go right or that you are finding
your<00:00:31.320> threads<00:00:32.039> that<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.550> selected

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
your threads that you have selected

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.520 
your threads that you have selected
maybe<00:00:33.239> one's<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.600> little<00:00:33.780> heavier<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.410> you're

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
maybe one's a little heavier that you're

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.870 
maybe one's a little heavier that you're
putting<00:00:34.800> through<00:00:34.950> your<00:00:35.130> needle<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.760> you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
putting through your needle and you

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.190 
putting through your needle and you
don't<00:00:36.059> need<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.360> decorative<00:00:36.720> thread<00:00:37.079> in

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
don't need that decorative thread in

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.479 
don't need that decorative thread in
your<00:00:37.230> bobbin<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> different

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
your bobbin so you have a different

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.729 
your bobbin so you have a different
weight<00:00:38.730> down<00:00:39.059> below<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:39.840> more<00:00:40.350> when<00:00:40.620> you

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
weight down below that's more when you

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
weight down below that's more when you
need<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.070> adjust<00:00:41.160> your<00:00:41.489> tension<00:00:41.790> when<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
need to adjust your tension when the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.049 
need to adjust your tension when the
balance<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.320> off<00:00:43.500> between<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> two<00:00:44.250> now<00:00:44.790> some

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
balance is off between the two now some

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.000 
balance is off between the two now some
people<00:00:45.200> remember<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:46.710> were<00:00:46.770> told

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
people remember that they were told

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.310 
people remember that they were told
never<00:00:47.280> touch<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:47.910> tension<00:00:48.390> well<00:00:48.629> guess<00:00:49.110> what

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
never touch your tension well guess what

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.590 
never touch your tension well guess what
you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.829> roll<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.190> little<00:00:50.579> dial<00:00:50.790> either<00:00:51.300> way

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
you can roll this little dial either way

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.420 
you can roll this little dial either way
it<00:00:51.960> doesn't<00:00:52.230> matter<00:00:52.410> once<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.039> comes<00:00:53.219> back<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
it doesn't matter once it comes back to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.250 
it doesn't matter once it comes back to
kind<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.820> four<00:00:54.180> that's<00:00:54.629> kind<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.930> default

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
kind of four that's kind of a default

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.740 
kind of four that's kind of a default
setting<00:00:55.590> here<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.460> will<00:00:56.789> go<00:00:56.969> back<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> where<00:00:57.629> it

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
setting here it will go back to where it

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.209 
setting here it will go back to where it
should<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.829> fingers<00:00:59.010> that

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
should be we have little fingers that

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.709 
should be we have little fingers that
visit<00:00:59.640> our<00:00:59.730> store<00:00:59.969> all<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> time<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.600> they

visit our store all the time and they

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.170 
visit our store all the time and they
love<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.260> turn<00:01:01.440> dials<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.190> buttons<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.730> they

love to turn dials and buttons and they
do<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.629> sometimes<00:01:04.350> all<00:01:04.649> we<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.189> is

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
do and sometimes all we have to do is

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.889 
do and sometimes all we have to do is
just<00:01:05.700> roll<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.060> back<00:01:06.209> to<00:01:06.389> where<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.600> needs<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
just roll that back to where it needs to

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.419 
just roll that back to where it needs to
be<00:01:07.109> and<00:01:07.289> it's<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.799> set<00:01:08.069> to<00:01:08.100> go

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:08.429 
be and it's all set to go

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:11.719 
be and it's all set to go
now<00:01:08.789> tension<00:01:09.479> sometimes<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.069> stitch<00:01:11.520> you

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
now tension sometimes as you stitch you

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
now tension sometimes as you stitch you
might<00:01:11.939> see<00:01:12.179> where<00:01:12.359> your<00:01:12.479> stitches<00:01:12.899> maybe<00:01:13.409> pull

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
might see where your stitches maybe pull

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.080 
might see where your stitches maybe pull
to<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.069> top<00:01:14.279> side<00:01:14.520> you're<00:01:14.700> seeing<00:01:14.729> your

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
to the top side you're seeing your

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.149 
to the top side you're seeing your
bobbin<00:01:15.659> thread<00:01:15.959> on<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.350> top<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.889> your<00:01:16.979> machine

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
bobbin thread on the top of your machine

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.679 
bobbin thread on the top of your machine
that<00:01:17.459> means<00:01:17.639> your<00:01:17.819> needle<00:01:18.149> threads<00:01:18.389> too

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that means your needle threads too

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.929 
that means your needle threads too
strong<00:01:19.109> so<00:01:19.649> that<00:01:19.679> would<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.069> reducing<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
strong so that would be reducing the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.230 
strong so that would be reducing the
tension<00:01:21.479> now<00:01:21.959> I<00:01:22.170> go<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.799> least<00:01:23.279> a<00:01:23.579> number<00:01:24.029> or<00:01:24.209> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
tension now I go at least a number or a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.719 
tension now I go at least a number or a
number<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.749> a<00:01:24.810> half<00:01:25.020> worth<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.409> change<00:01:26.069> one

good turn guess what if you don't

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.449 
good turn guess what if you don't
remember<00:01:33.659> which<00:01:33.959> way<00:01:34.109> to<00:01:34.169> go<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.829> go<00:01:35.130> ahead<00:01:35.249> and

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
remember which way to go it go ahead and

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.429 
remember which way to go it go ahead and
go<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.119> number<00:01:36.539> number<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.929> a<00:01:36.959> half<00:01:37.139> and<00:01:37.380> if

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
go that number number and a half and if

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.809 
go that number number and a half and if
it<00:01:37.529> gets<00:01:37.649> worse<00:01:37.799> we'll<00:01:38.159> call<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> other<00:01:38.639> way

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
it gets worse we'll call the other way

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.999 
it gets worse we'll call the other way
that's<00:01:39.179> how<00:01:39.389> easy<00:01:39.419> it<00:01:39.779> is<00:01:39.929> to<00:01:40.139> go<00:01:40.289> so<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.889> you've

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
that's how easy it is to go so if you've

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.919 
that's how easy it is to go so if you've
seen<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.490> top<00:01:41.729> we're<00:01:41.969> loosening<00:01:42.359> it<00:01:42.630> if

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
seen it on the top we're loosening it if

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.510 
seen it on the top we're loosening it if
you<00:01:43.049> see<00:01:43.259> your<00:01:43.380> threads<00:01:43.709> on<00:01:43.889> the<00:01:44.009> back<00:01:44.219> side

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
you see your threads on the back side

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.370 
you see your threads on the back side
and<00:01:44.819> you<00:01:44.880> don't<00:01:45.630> want<00:01:45.840> them<00:01:45.899> there<00:01:46.109> you<00:01:46.229> want

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and you don't want them there you want

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.419 
and you don't want them there you want
them<00:01:46.469> a<00:01:46.499> little<00:01:46.679> bit<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:46.889> balanced<00:01:47.279> you're

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
them a little bit more balanced you're

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.580 
them a little bit more balanced you're
tightening<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.090> top<00:01:48.509> thread<00:01:48.929> and<00:01:49.200> that

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
tightening up your top thread and that

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.739 
tightening up your top thread and that
will<00:01:49.799> fix<00:01:50.069> it<00:01:50.279> there<00:01:50.459> now<00:01:50.819> there's<00:01:51.149> also<00:01:51.329> this

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
will fix it there now there's also this

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:54.139 
will fix it there now there's also this
problem<00:01:52.349> who<00:01:52.560> has<00:01:52.950> had<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.369> happen<00:01:53.429> before

with this issue here here's the thing a

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.179 
with this issue here here's the thing a
lot<00:02:27.629> of<00:02:27.780> people<00:02:27.989> turn<00:02:28.379> it<00:02:28.560> over<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.829> realize

lot of people turn it over and realize

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.490 
lot of people turn it over and realize
oh<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.700> bobbin<00:02:30.299> is<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.689> awful<00:02:31.109> and<00:02:31.290> they<00:02:31.379> go

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
oh that bobbin is just awful and they go

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.500 
oh that bobbin is just awful and they go
digging<00:02:31.829> down<00:02:31.859> here<00:02:32.310> guess<00:02:32.730> what<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> bobbins

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
digging down here guess what the bobbins

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.990 
digging down here guess what the bobbins
probably<00:02:34.079> just<00:02:34.349> fine<00:02:34.620> don't<00:02:35.280> look<00:02:35.609> at<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.819> Bob

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
probably just fine don't look at the Bob

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.369 
probably just fine don't look at the Bob
and<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.269> reason<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.659> sewed<00:02:36.930> with<00:02:36.959> two

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
and the reason I sewed with two

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.720 
and the reason I sewed with two
different<00:02:37.680> colors<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.010> thread<00:02:38.250> right<00:02:38.549> now

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
different colors of thread right now

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.789 
different colors of thread right now
I've<00:02:39.180> got<00:02:39.390> kind<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.629> a<00:02:39.750> blue<00:02:39.959> in<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.290> needle

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
I've got kind of a blue in the needle

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.440 
I've got kind of a blue in the needle
and<00:02:40.980> I've<00:02:41.069> got<00:02:41.250> pink<00:02:41.579> in<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.849> bobbin<00:02:42.239> that's

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
and I've got pink in the bobbin that's

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.170 
and I've got pink in the bobbin that's
what<00:02:42.599> colors<00:02:42.900> showing<00:02:43.470> down<00:02:43.769> here<00:02:44.069> blue<00:02:44.819> that

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
what colors showing down here blue that

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.330 
what colors showing down here blue that
means<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.569> problem<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.590> blue<00:02:46.950> thread

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
means the problem is the blue thread

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.890 
means the problem is the blue thread
it's<00:02:47.730> all<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:47.939> need<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.269> is<00:02:48.389> rethread<00:02:48.870> your

it's all you need to do is rethread your

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.140 
it's all you need to do is rethread your
machine<00:02:49.319> sew<00:02:49.889> on<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.519> should<00:02:50.730> be<00:02:50.849> good<00:02:51.000> to

machine sew on it you should be good to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.610 
machine sew on it you should be good to
go<00:02:51.180> or<00:02:51.480> do<00:02:51.599> that<00:02:51.750> little<00:02:51.930> test<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.409> I<00:02:52.470> did

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
go or do that little test that I did

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.520 
go or do that little test that I did
earlier<00:02:52.799> where<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.609> are<00:02:54.000> testing<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.139> as

earlier where you are testing that as
