body and overall we typically just feel

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.370 
body and overall we typically just feel
better<00:00:25.849> than<00:00:26.119> more<00:00:26.239> flexible<00:00:26.749> our<00:00:26.899> body<00:00:27.140> as

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
better than more flexible our body as

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.989 
better than more flexible our body as
and<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:27.619> more<00:00:27.800> freely<00:00:28.279> we<00:00:28.429> can<00:00:28.579> move<00:00:28.789> through

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:28.999 
and the more freely we can move through

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:30.849 
and the more freely we can move through
our<00:00:29.149> day<00:00:29.300> so<00:00:30.109> what<00:00:30.259> we'll<00:00:30.380> start<00:00:30.619> with<00:00:30.739> this
