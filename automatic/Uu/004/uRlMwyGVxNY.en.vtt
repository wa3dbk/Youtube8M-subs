I know a lot of people have had while
some<00:00:06.890> people<00:00:07.100> had<00:00:07.220> trouble<00:00:07.339> getting<00:00:07.700> that

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.200 
some people had trouble getting that

some people had trouble getting that
k20a<00:00:09.200> to<00:00:09.320> crank<00:00:10.250> pulley<00:00:10.490> off<00:00:11.769> it<00:00:12.769> does<00:00:13.099> take<00:00:13.309> a

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:13.339 
k20a to crank pulley off it does take a

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.000 
k20a to crank pulley off it does take a
lot<00:00:13.490> of<00:00:13.549> effort<00:00:13.910> and<00:00:14.030> is<00:00:14.660> really<00:00:15.379> dangerous<00:00:15.559> so

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
lot of effort and is really dangerous so

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.620 
lot of effort and is really dangerous so
this<00:00:16.730> is<00:00:16.850> how<00:00:17.000> I<00:00:17.090> do<00:00:17.240> it

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
this is how I do it

this made my third one that I've ever
done<00:00:20.439> I<00:00:21.580> paid<00:00:22.580> the<00:00:22.699> money<00:00:22.849> by<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:23.150> tool<00:00:23.859> this

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
done I paid the money by the tool this

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.120 
done I paid the money by the tool this
is<00:00:25.189> a<00:00:25.279> 19<00:00:26.150> millimeter<00:00:26.269> socket<00:00:26.929> half<00:00:27.710> is<00:00:27.859> drive

number kilo Delta 397 zero
you<00:00:44.150> see<00:00:44.420> it's<00:00:44.540> basically<00:00:44.780> just<00:00:45.020> a<00:00:45.140> big<00:00:47.710> EPS

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
you see it's basically just a big EPS

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.500 
you see it's basically just a big EPS
shaped<00:00:50.020> piece<00:00:51.020> of<00:00:51.200> steel<00:00:51.880> now<00:00:52.880> I<00:00:52.940> like<00:00:53.150> to<00:00:53.300> put

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
shaped piece of steel now I like to put

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.470 
shaped piece of steel now I like to put
my<00:00:54.290> baker-bots<00:00:54.800> on<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.070> inside<00:00:55.370> here<00:00:55.640> keeps

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
my baker-bots on the inside here keeps

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.900 
my baker-bots on the inside here keeps
it<00:00:56.600> closer<00:00:56.810> to<00:00:57.170> that<00:00:57.370> keeps<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.460> closer<00:00:58.640> to<00:00:58.820> the

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
it closer to that keeps it closer to the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.700 
it closer to that keeps it closer to the
center<00:00:59.150> access<00:00:59.480> where<00:00:59.660> I'm<00:00:59.750> putting<00:00:59.930> torque

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
center access where I'm putting torque

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.640 
center access where I'm putting torque
and<00:01:01.660> then<00:01:02.660> basically<00:01:03.080> just<00:01:03.320> stick<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:03.620> in

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
and then basically just stick it in

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.130 
and then basically just stick it in
there<00:01:03.879> like<00:01:04.879> that<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.420> can<00:01:05.570> still<00:01:05.690> get<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.050> the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
there like that you can still get to the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.220 
there like that you can still get to the
inside<00:01:06.440> there<00:01:06.880> this<00:01:07.880> bolt<00:01:08.180> here<00:01:08.450> that's<00:01:08.990> where

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
inside there this bolt here that's where

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.220 
inside there this bolt here that's where
your<00:01:09.350> 19<00:01:09.680> mil<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:10.040> going<00:01:10.190> to<00:01:10.250> go<00:01:11.110> so<00:01:12.110> basically

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
your 19 mil is going to go so basically

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.110 
your 19 mil is going to go so basically
just<00:01:12.500> looks<00:01:12.770> like<00:01:12.890> this<00:01:13.190> this<00:01:13.670> goes<00:01:13.910> through

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
just looks like this this goes through

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.550 
just looks like this this goes through
here<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:15.710> goes<00:01:15.950> on<00:01:16.130> there<00:01:17.140> this<00:01:18.140> goes<00:01:18.350> in

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
here that goes on there this goes in

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.970 
here that goes on there this goes in
here

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
here

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.680 
here
this<00:01:19.370> thing's<00:01:19.640> job<00:01:19.880> is<00:01:20.090> to<00:01:20.180> hold<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.450> crank

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
this thing's job is to hold the crank

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.210 
this thing's job is to hold the crank
pulley<00:01:20.900> while<00:01:21.620> you're<00:01:21.710> putting<00:01:21.920> all<00:01:22.040> that

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
pulley while you're putting all that

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.720 
pulley while you're putting all that
force<00:01:22.490> on<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:22.940> on<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.750> bolt<00:01:23.960> head<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.100> what

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
force on the on the bolt head so what

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.750 
force on the on the bolt head so what
I'd<00:01:25.820> like<00:01:25.940> to<00:01:26.000> do<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:27.250> I'll<00:01:28.250> hold<00:01:28.400> this<00:01:28.580> sucker

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
I'd like to do is I'll hold this sucker

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.220 
I'd like to do is I'll hold this sucker
in<00:01:28.940> there<00:01:29.120> make<00:01:29.600> sure<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.870> get<00:01:29.930> this

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
in there make sure that I get this

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.850 
in there make sure that I get this
breaker<00:01:30.950> bar<00:01:31.190> lined<00:01:31.460> up<00:01:31.640> very<00:01:32.030> very<00:01:32.150> well

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
breaker bar lined up very very well

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.430 
breaker bar lined up very very well
straight<00:01:33.860> straight<00:01:34.040> as<00:01:34.280> I<00:01:34.370> can<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:35.050> I<00:01:36.050> kind<00:01:36.409> of

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
straight straight as I can and I kind of

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.010 
straight straight as I can and I kind of
hold<00:01:36.620> it<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:36.800> place<00:01:37.070> there<00:01:37.600> until<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:38.720> get<00:01:38.870> some

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
hold it in place there until I get some

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.750 
hold it in place there until I get some
friction<00:01:39.380> on<00:01:39.500> it<00:01:39.620> and<00:01:39.830> I<00:01:40.040> kind<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.280> chalk<00:01:40.520> up<00:01:40.550> a

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
friction on it and I kind of chalk up a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.149 
friction on it and I kind of chalk up a
little<00:01:40.880> bit<00:01:41.000> high<00:01:41.290> because<00:01:42.290> there's<00:01:42.560> always<00:01:42.770> a

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
little bit high because there's always a

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.020 
little bit high because there's always a
lot<00:01:43.550> of<00:01:43.640> play<00:01:44.409> take-up<00:01:45.409> now<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:46.370> got<00:01:46.909> a<00:01:46.940> little

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
lot of play take-up now I got a little

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.790 
lot of play take-up now I got a little
bit<00:01:47.180> of<00:01:47.240> force<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.570> this<00:01:47.690> thing<00:01:47.900> everything's

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
bit of force of this thing everything's

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.960 
bit of force of this thing everything's
pretty<00:01:49.010> straight<00:01:50.560> these<00:01:51.560> heads<00:01:52.430> here<00:01:52.790> and

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
pretty straight these heads here and

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.270
