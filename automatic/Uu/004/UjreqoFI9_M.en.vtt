00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.059 

the<00:00:06.720> last<00:00:06.930> thing<00:00:07.109> I'd<00:00:07.200> like<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.500> cover<00:00:07.740> for<00:00:08.010> you

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
the last thing I'd like to cover for you

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.459 
the last thing I'd like to cover for you
in<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.189> demonstration<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.630> micro<00:00:10.050> adjust

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
in the demonstration is the micro adjust

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.259 
in the demonstration is the micro adjust
it<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:11.040> intentionally<00:00:11.400> leave<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.030> for

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
it and I intentionally leave this for

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.209 
it and I intentionally leave this for
the<00:00:12.300> very<00:00:12.719> end<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.259> demo<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.950> kind<00:00:14.160> of

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
the very end of the demo just to kind of

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.310 
the very end of the demo just to kind of
illustrate<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.360> last<00:00:15.630> thing<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.170> this

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
illustrate that the last thing that this

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.830 
illustrate that the last thing that this
needs<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.890> any<00:00:17.279> kind<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.670> fine-tuning<00:00:18.390> that's

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
needs is any kind of fine-tuning that's

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.470 
needs is any kind of fine-tuning that's
not<00:00:19.080> why<00:00:19.260> that's<00:00:19.529> there<00:00:19.800> at<00:00:19.920> all<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.699> micro

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
not why that's there at all that micro

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.870 
not why that's there at all that micro
just<00:00:21.810> allows<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.500> move<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.949> fence<00:00:23.160> off<00:00:23.430> of

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
just allows you to move the fence off of

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.210 
just allows you to move the fence off of
those<00:00:24.090> perfect<00:00:24.480> 32nd<00:00:25.320> inch<00:00:25.470> increments<00:00:26.070> in

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
those perfect 32nd inch increments in

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.939 
those perfect 32nd inch increments in
very<00:00:26.760> precise<00:00:27.300> amounts<00:00:27.930> very<00:00:28.439> controlled

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
very precise amounts very controlled

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.490 
very precise amounts very controlled
amounts<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.519> need<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:30.060> full<00:00:30.750> turn<00:00:31.199> on

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.069 
knob you've seen on rip fences in the
past<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.940> best<00:00:51.180> way<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> illustrate<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.930> is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
past the best way to illustrate that is

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.900 
past the best way to illustrate that is
with<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.530> last<00:00:52.770> set<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> cuts<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.760> is

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
with one last set of cuts and this is

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.889 
with one last set of cuts and this is
kind<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.270> fun<00:00:54.510> one<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.730> wrap<00:00:56.730> things<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.329> what

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.499 
make the next seven cuts get them all
perfect<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.570> first<00:01:18.600> drive<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:21.299> first

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
that we have to overcome first off they

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.520 
that we have to overcome first off they
have<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.390> cut<00:01:57.600> perfectly<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:58.290> they<00:01:58.409> don't

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
have to be cut perfectly or they don't

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.170 
have to be cut perfectly or they don't
work<00:01:58.799> there's<00:01:59.219> really<00:01:59.399> no<00:01:59.579> margin<00:01:59.880> for<00:02:00.000> error

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
work there's really no margin for error

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.600 
work there's really no margin for error
the<00:02:00.689> second<00:02:01.110> thing<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.860> first<00:02:02.070> piece<00:02:02.399> is

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the second thing is the first piece is

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.090 
the second thing is the first piece is
only<00:02:02.790> an<00:02:03.000> eighth<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.360> an<00:02:03.509> inch<00:02:03.600> wide<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.710> don't

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
only an eighth of an inch wide I don't

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.249 
only an eighth of an inch wide I don't
have<00:02:05.310> any<00:02:05.460> hold<00:02:05.759> downs<00:02:06.000> or<00:02:06.270> push<00:02:06.479> sticks<00:02:06.810> handy

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
have any hold downs or push sticks handy

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.990 
have any hold downs or push sticks handy
so<00:02:07.500> we're<00:02:07.860> definitely<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> put<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
so we're definitely not going to put the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.400 
so we're definitely not going to put the
fence<00:02:09.239> right<00:02:09.360> up<00:02:09.780> there<00:02:09.959> an<00:02:10.020> eighth<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.170> an

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
fence right up there an eighth of an

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.260 
fence right up there an eighth of an
inch<00:02:10.500> away<00:02:10.679> from<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.039> blade<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.910> we're<00:02:12.090> going

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
inch away from the blade and we're going

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.460 
inch away from the blade and we're going
to<00:02:12.360> take<00:02:12.569> advantage<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
to take advantage of the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.090 
to take advantage of the
fact<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.400> tes<00:02:15.120> systems<00:02:15.920> because<00:02:16.920> of

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
fact that the tes systems because of

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.970 
fact that the tes systems because of
their<00:02:17.220> mechanical<00:02:17.910> nature<00:02:18.360> let<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.410> cut<00:02:19.710> any

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
their mechanical nature let you cut any

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.430 
their mechanical nature let you cut any
dimension<00:02:20.910> parts<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.570> need<00:02:21.600> right<00:02:22.230> off

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
dimension parts that you need right off

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.260 
dimension parts that you need right off
the<00:02:22.650> outside<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.610> blade<00:02:23.910> where<00:02:24.150> it's

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
the outside of the blade where it's

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.540 
the outside of the blade where it's
safer<00:02:24.630> when<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.840> parts<00:02:25.110> get<00:02:25.290> small<00:02:25.650> start

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
safer when the parts get small start

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.160 
safer when the parts get small start
with<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> clean<00:02:27.000> up<00:02:27.180> cut<00:02:27.390> first<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:27.990> have<00:02:28.110> a

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
with a clean up cut first so I have a

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.710 
with a clean up cut first so I have a
nice<00:02:28.350> fresh<00:02:28.650> edge<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.280> work<00:02:29.460> from<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.970> quarter

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
nice fresh edge to work from a quarter

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.350 
nice fresh edge to work from a quarter
of<00:02:30.840> an<00:02:30.930> inch<00:02:31.020> this<00:02:31.410> way<00:02:31.680> with<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.340> fence<00:02:32.580> let's

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
of an inch this way with the fence let's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.300 
of an inch this way with the fence let's
the<00:02:33.510> saw<00:02:33.720> blade<00:02:34.020> take<00:02:34.320> an<00:02:34.500> eighth<00:02:34.710> inch<00:02:34.740> for

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the saw blade take an eighth inch for

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.670 
the saw blade take an eighth inch for
itself<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:36.240> gives<00:02:36.450> us<00:02:36.600> exactly<00:02:37.290> an<00:02:37.500> eighth

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
itself it gives us exactly an eighth

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.950 
itself it gives us exactly an eighth
inch<00:02:37.710> leftover<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.850> glue<00:02:39.150> into<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.660> first

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
inch leftover to glue into that first

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.040 
inch leftover to glue into that first
slot<00:02:40.550> we<00:02:41.550> don't<00:02:41.730> have<00:02:41.910> time<00:02:42.120> for<00:02:42.180> glue<00:02:42.660> you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
slot we don't have time for glue you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.390 
slot we don't have time for glue you
know<00:02:43.140> during<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.500> demonstration<00:02:44.250> we're

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
know during the demonstration we're

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.250 
know during the demonstration we're
going<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.580> press<00:02:44.940> fit<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.110> make

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
going to press fit this we have to make

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.040 
going to press fit this we have to make
that<00:02:46.470> piece<00:02:46.740> just<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.459> hair<00:02:47.730> bigger<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.420> snug<00:02:48.780> up

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
that piece just a hair bigger to snug up

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.440 
that piece just a hair bigger to snug up
how<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.530> fits<00:02:49.800> into<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.130> walnut<00:02:50.580> that's<00:02:51.270> where

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
how it fits into the walnut that's where

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.150 
how it fits into the walnut that's where
the<00:02:51.570> micro<00:02:51.930> adjust<00:02:52.200> gets<00:02:52.380> really<00:02:52.680> handy<00:02:52.980> and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
the micro adjust gets really handy and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.400 
the micro adjust gets really handy and
of<00:02:53.430> course<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.240> reads<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.840> thousandths

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
of course this it reads in thousandths

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.040 
of course this it reads in thousandths
of<00:02:55.500> an<00:02:55.620> inch<00:02:55.709> directly<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.940> without<00:02:57.510> guessing

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
of an inch directly so without guessing

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.360 
of an inch directly so without guessing
or<00:02:58.530> test<00:02:59.160> cutting<00:03:00.709> we<00:03:01.709> can<00:03:01.890> make<00:03:02.100> that<00:03:02.310> a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
or test cutting we can make that a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.960 
or test cutting we can make that a
finished<00:03:02.880> piece<00:03:03.120> bigger<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.050> go<00:03:04.980> directly<00:03:05.640> to

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
finished piece bigger and go directly to

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.810 
finished piece bigger and go directly to
the<00:03:06.120> one<00:03:06.360> size<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.470> just<00:03:07.740> barely<00:03:08.100> fits<00:03:08.550> into

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
the one size that just barely fits into

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.330 
the one size that just barely fits into
that<00:03:08.970> slot<00:03:09.330> but<00:03:10.170> then<00:03:10.350> doesn't<00:03:10.800> easily<00:03:10.950> come

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
that slot but then doesn't easily come

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.160 
that slot but then doesn't easily come
back<00:03:11.580> out<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.060> even<00:03:12.570> if<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.810> don't<00:03:12.990> really

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
back out and even if you don't really

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.900 
back out and even if you don't really
care<00:03:13.320> what<00:03:13.740> thousandth<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.400> an<00:03:14.520> inch<00:03:14.640> look

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
care what thousandth of an inch look

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.760 
care what thousandth of an inch look
like<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:15.390> not<00:03:15.480> hard<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.110> imagine<00:03:16.140> how<00:03:16.740> that

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
like it's not hard to imagine how that

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.440 
like it's not hard to imagine how that
can<00:03:17.100> improve<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.580> quality<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.239> work<00:03:18.420> that

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
can improve the quality of the work that

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.080 
can improve the quality of the work that
you<00:03:18.750> turn<00:03:18.959> out<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.200> your<00:03:19.440> shop<00:03:19.670> we'll<00:03:20.670> use<00:03:20.880> that

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
you turn out of your shop we'll use that

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.250 
you turn out of your shop we'll use that
same<00:03:21.980> technique<00:03:22.980> one<00:03:23.250> more<00:03:23.519> time<00:03:23.989> cut<00:03:24.989> another

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
same technique one more time cut another

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.479 
same technique one more time cut another
piece<00:03:28.730> just<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:30.000> hair<00:03:30.300> bigger<00:03:30.720> than<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.590> 3/16

piece just a hair bigger than that 3/16

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.699 
piece just a hair bigger than that 3/16
slot<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.120> as<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.840> promised<00:03:34.260> we're<00:03:34.440> not<00:03:34.560> going

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
slot and as I promised we're not going

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.320 
slot and as I promised we're not going
to<00:03:34.769> wait<00:03:34.920> for<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.220> glue<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.459> dry<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.820> assemble

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
to wait for the glue to dry to assemble

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.370 
to wait for the glue to dry to assemble
all<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.720> we've<00:03:37.440> got<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.650> little<00:03:37.860> bit<00:03:38.100> more

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
all this we've got a little bit more

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.509 
all this we've got a little bit more
efficient<00:03:40.380> method<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:40.830> we<00:03:40.950> use<00:03:41.130> during<00:03:41.489> the

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
efficient method that we use during the

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:49.610
