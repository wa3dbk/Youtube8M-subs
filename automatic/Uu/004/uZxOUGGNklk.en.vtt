00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.280 

this<00:00:05.589> is<00:00:05.709> the<00:00:05.799> front<00:00:06.040> brake<00:00:06.339> and<00:00:06.419> rotor<00:00:07.419> axle

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290 
this is the front brake and rotor axle

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.289 
this is the front brake and rotor axle
set<00:00:08.530> up<00:00:08.680> on<00:00:08.830> my<00:00:08.860> 82<00:00:09.570> one-ton<00:00:10.570> GMC<00:00:11.549> I<00:00:12.549> just

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:13.299 
set up on my 82 one-ton GMC I just

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.460 
set up on my 82 one-ton GMC I just
finished<00:00:13.809> putting<00:00:13.959> the<00:00:14.230> the<00:00:14.859> new<00:00:15.609> rotor<00:00:15.939> and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
finished putting the the new rotor and

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.840 
finished putting the the new rotor and
rebuilt<00:00:17.470> hub<00:00:17.980> on<00:00:18.400> here<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.900> old<00:00:20.199> rotors<00:00:20.890> were

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
rebuilt hub on here the old rotors were

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.720 
rebuilt hub on here the old rotors were
worn<00:00:22.360> very<00:00:22.890> unevenly<00:00:23.890> so<00:00:24.280> there<00:00:24.400> was<00:00:24.520> some

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
worn very unevenly so there was some

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.760 
worn very unevenly so there was some
speculation<00:00:25.420> that<00:00:25.449> either<00:00:25.960> my<00:00:26.170> caliper<00:00:26.619> was

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
speculation that either my caliper was

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.510 
speculation that either my caliper was
not<00:00:26.949> sliding<00:00:27.310> or<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:29.080> brake<00:00:29.710> line<00:00:30.039> had

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
not sliding or the brake line had

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.720 
not sliding or the brake line had
collapsed<00:00:31.090> internally<00:00:32.039> these<00:00:33.039> brake<00:00:33.309> lines

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
collapsed internally these brake lines

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.520 
collapsed internally these brake lines
who<00:00:34.059> knows<00:00:34.300> when<00:00:34.570> they<00:00:34.719> were<00:00:34.780> replaced<00:00:35.050> last

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
who knows when they were replaced last

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.410 
who knows when they were replaced last
so<00:00:36.039> I<00:00:36.280> need<00:00:36.969> to<00:00:37.199> get<00:00:38.199> them<00:00:38.409> gone<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:39.579> get

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
so I need to get them gone and get

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.719 
so I need to get them gone and get
something<00:00:41.109> reliable<00:00:41.589> on<00:00:41.739> there<00:00:41.920> what<00:00:42.639> I've

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:42.729 
something reliable on there what I've

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:44.819 
something reliable on there what I've
already<00:00:42.850> done<00:00:43.120> is<00:00:43.389> disconnected<00:00:44.199> the<00:00:44.350> the

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
already done is disconnected the the

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.790 
already done is disconnected the the
brake<00:00:45.219> hose<00:00:45.429> at<00:00:45.909> the<00:00:45.969> caliper<00:00:46.809> and<00:00:46.960> let<00:00:47.649> that

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
brake hose at the caliper and let that

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.479 
brake hose at the caliper and let that
drain<00:00:48.100> into<00:00:48.429> a<00:00:48.460> bucket<00:00:48.870> rather<00:00:49.870> than<00:00:50.339> if<00:00:51.339> you

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
drain into a bucket rather than if you

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.910 
drain into a bucket rather than if you
disconnect<00:00:51.789> it<00:00:52.059> up<00:00:52.179> here<00:00:52.690> with<00:00:53.199> fluid<00:00:53.739> in<00:00:53.829> the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
disconnect it up here with fluid in the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.619 
disconnect it up here with fluid in the
line<00:00:54.100> I<00:00:54.460> think<00:00:54.519> it'll<00:00:54.879> just<00:00:54.969> run<00:00:55.329> down<00:00:55.479> the

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
line I think it'll just run down the

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.029 
line I think it'll just run down the
frame<00:00:55.899> rail<00:00:56.109> so<00:00:56.379> this<00:00:56.530> was<00:00:56.709> a<00:00:56.739> little<00:00:56.920> bit

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
frame rail so this was a little bit

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.789 
frame rail so this was a little bit
cleaner<00:00:57.370> disconnect<00:00:58.359> the<00:00:58.600> caliper<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.559> let

00:00:59.789 --> 00:00:59.799 
cleaner disconnect the caliper and let

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.489 
cleaner disconnect the caliper and let
that<00:00:59.949> let<00:01:00.280> that<00:01:00.399> drain<00:01:00.639> first<00:01:00.969> on<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:02.109> outside

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
that let that drain first on the outside

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.680 
that let that drain first on the outside
of<00:01:02.619> the<00:01:02.709> frame<00:01:02.979> and<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.309> wheel<00:01:03.459> well<00:01:03.699> you<00:01:04.510> see

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
of the frame and the wheel well you see

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.820 
of the frame and the wheel well you see
the<00:01:04.809> hose<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:06.369> clip<00:01:06.820> comes<00:01:07.750> between<00:01:08.200> comes

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
the hose this clip comes between comes

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.160 
the hose this clip comes between comes
from<00:01:09.040> between<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.700> frame<00:01:10.120> and<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.810> fitting

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
from between the frame and the fitting

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.830 
from between the frame and the fitting
this<00:01:11.740> clip<00:01:12.070> holds<00:01:12.460> holds<00:01:12.940> this<00:01:13.180> hose<00:01:13.420> so<00:01:13.810> it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
this clip holds holds this hose so it

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.060 
this clip holds holds this hose so it
doesn't<00:01:14.230> slide<00:01:14.470> in<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:15.670> hex<00:01:16.180> fitting<00:01:16.870> on<00:01:17.290> the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
doesn't slide in the hex fitting on the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.030 
doesn't slide in the hex fitting on the
hose<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.870> matches<00:01:19.870> a<00:01:19.900> hex<00:01:20.230> cutout<00:01:20.710> in<00:01:20.980> the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
hose and matches a hex cutout in the

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.150 
hose and matches a hex cutout in the
frame<00:01:21.730> so<00:01:22.030> that<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.300> hose<00:01:22.480> can't<00:01:22.840> turn<00:01:23.160> here's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
frame so that the hose can't turn here's

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.650 
frame so that the hose can't turn here's
what<00:01:24.340> it<00:01:24.430> looks<00:01:24.580> like<00:01:24.730> on<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.030> inside<00:01:25.120> of<00:01:25.510> the

what it looks like on the inside of the
frame<00:01:25.930> rail<00:01:26.110> you<00:01:26.800> can<00:01:26.890> see<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.160> hard<00:01:27.370> line

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
frame rail you can see the hard line

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.890 
frame rail you can see the hard line
here<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.990> is<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:30.250> here<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.270> inside<00:01:31.630> part

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
here this is right here the inside part

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.080 
here this is right here the inside part
is<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.260> hose<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.920> coming<00:01:33.550> through<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.820> frame

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090

these<00:01:44.590> connections<00:01:45.490> can<00:01:45.670> be<00:01:45.730> extremely

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
these connections can be extremely

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.470 
these connections can be extremely

difficult to get off on these old trucks
this<00:01:49.480> one's<00:01:49.690> given<00:01:49.990> me<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.110> little<00:01:50.320> bit<00:01:50.500> of

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
this one's given me a little bit of

this one's given me a little bit of
trouble<00:01:50.980> but<00:01:51.750> we're<00:01:52.750> getting<00:01:52.960> it<00:01:52.990> out<00:01:54.180> between

the frame is a metal clip that I've
already<00:02:01.570> taken<00:02:01.870> out<00:02:02.020> I'll<00:02:02.440> show<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:02.740> that<00:02:02.890> in

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
already taken out I'll show you that in

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.060 
already taken out I'll show you that in
a<00:02:03.130> minute<00:02:03.300> but<00:02:04.300> that<00:02:04.479> that<00:02:04.840> keeps<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.409> O's

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
a minute but that that keeps the O's

was<00:02:55.790> using<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.170> wrench<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.890> outside<00:02:58.310> and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
was using the wrench on the outside and

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.610 
was using the wrench on the outside and
then<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:58.970> vise<00:02:59.600> grip<00:02:59.630> on<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.530> inside<00:03:01.510> flare<00:03:02.510> nut

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
then a vise grip on the inside flare nut

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.770 
then a vise grip on the inside flare nut
I<00:03:03.650> used<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.519> line<00:03:04.820> wrench<00:03:05.060> on<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.300> inside<00:03:05.570> and

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
I used a line wrench on the inside and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.300 
I used a line wrench on the inside and
that<00:03:05.870> did<00:03:06.080> not<00:03:06.200> work<00:03:06.470> for<00:03:06.709> me<00:03:06.769> since<00:03:07.130> they're

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
that did not work for me since they're

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.580 
that did not work for me since they're

so tight you can see I've got to cut the
hose<00:03:09.739> end<00:03:10.130> off<00:03:10.610> finally<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.810> fought<00:03:12.140> me<00:03:12.350> but

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
hose end off finally it fought me but

shaped hole in the frame and it just

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.470 
shaped hole in the frame and it just
grips<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.600> hex<00:03:20.870> part<00:03:21.260> of<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.440> hose<00:03:22.420> this<00:03:23.420> is

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
a closed-ended wrench around it I could

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.809 
a closed-ended wrench around it I could
tell<00:04:48.439> that<00:04:48.469> this<00:04:48.680> was<00:04:48.889> going<00:04:49.039> to<00:04:49.099> start

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819

rounding<00:04:50.180> it<00:04:50.270> off<00:04:51.189> didn't<00:04:52.189> work<00:04:52.430> so<00:04:52.669> I

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:52.909 
rounding it off didn't work so I

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.809 
rounding it off didn't work so I
progressed<00:04:53.629> on<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:53.930> some<00:04:54.379> vice<00:04:54.889> grips<00:04:54.919> this

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
progressed on to some vice grips this

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.610 
progressed on to some vice grips this
was<00:04:56.030> recommended<00:04:56.569> on<00:04:56.689> the<00:04:56.719> Internet<00:04:57.199> this

like<00:05:10.340> I<00:05:10.370> said<00:05:10.490> before<00:05:10.879> I<00:05:10.909> used<00:05:11.270> a<00:05:11.779> 12-point<00:05:12.560> or

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
like I said before I used a 12-point or

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.339 
like I said before I used a 12-point or
six-point<00:05:13.960> wrench<00:05:15.219> but<00:05:16.870> another<00:05:17.870> thing<00:05:18.110> is

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
six-point wrench but another thing is

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.179 
six-point wrench but another thing is
you<00:05:18.830> should<00:05:19.039> definitely<00:05:19.939> soak<00:05:20.779> these<00:05:21.189> brake

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:22.189 
you should definitely soak these brake
