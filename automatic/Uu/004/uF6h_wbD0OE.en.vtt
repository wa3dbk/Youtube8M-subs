I<00:00:21.449> realized<00:00:21.900> they<00:00:22.680> weren't<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:23.010> thrown

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
I realized they weren't just thrown

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.910 
I realized they weren't just thrown
there<00:00:23.550> was<00:00:23.640> an<00:00:23.730> actual<00:00:23.850> order<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.920> and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
there was an actual order to it and

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.650 
there was an actual order to it and
there<00:00:26.070> was<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.250> beautiful<00:00:26.460> curve<00:00:27.269> when<00:00:27.570> I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
there was this beautiful curve when I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.480 
there was this beautiful curve when I
did<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.320> followed<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.890> while<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> was

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
did this I followed it while I was

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.849 
did this I followed it while I was
actually<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> room<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> Victor<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
actually in the room in the Victor and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.850 
actually in the room in the Victor and
Albert<00:00:32.130> Museum<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.820> worked<00:00:33.030> out<00:00:33.320> it<00:00:34.320> spirals

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
Albert Museum and worked out it spirals

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.660 
Albert Museum and worked out it spirals
around<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.700> then<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.829> noble<00:00:37.829> eyes<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.309> all<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
around and then it noble eyes is all the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.880 
around and then it noble eyes is all the
way<00:00:38.820> back<00:00:39.829> like<00:00:41.090> these<00:00:42.090> little<00:00:42.270> dots<00:00:42.739> yes<00:00:43.739> I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
way back like these little dots yes I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.290 
way back like these little dots yes I
think<00:00:44.100> they<00:00:44.190> were<00:00:44.309> dots<00:00:44.550> I'm<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:44.879> sure<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.210> I

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
think they were dots I'm not sure that I

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.500 
think they were dots I'm not sure that I
didn't<00:00:45.600> imagine<00:00:46.289> those<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> thought

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
didn't imagine those and then I thought

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.330 
didn't imagine those and then I thought
about<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.260> did<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.469> again<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.160> thought

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
about it I did it again and I thought

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.959

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
you could put the dots on the outside

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.069 
you could put the dots on the outside
there<00:00:53.969> were<00:00:54.059> lots<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.390> lovely<00:00:54.570> things<00:00:54.899> there

well<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.110> wanted<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.470> animate<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.190> growth<00:02:29.550> of

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
well I wanted to animate the growth of

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.720 
well I wanted to animate the growth of
this<00:02:30.570> plant<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.190> did<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.550> all<00:02:32.700> in

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
this plant and so I did that all in

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.140 
this plant and so I did that all in
pencil<00:02:33.270> drawing<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.990> then<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.710> traced<00:02:35.580> over<00:02:35.820> in

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
pencil drawing and then I traced over in

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.110 
pencil drawing and then I traced over in
ink<00:02:36.650> because<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.370> ink<00:02:38.550> is<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.760> kind<00:02:39.030> of

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
ink because the the ink is the kind of

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.840 
ink because the the ink is the kind of
the<00:02:39.180> shoe<00:02:39.360> ie<00:02:39.570> style<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.410> want<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:40.920> develop

the shoe ie style that I want to develop

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.440 
the shoe ie style that I want to develop
and<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.490> have<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.730> trace

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
and and you have to trace

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.300 
and and you have to trace
I'm<00:02:45.750> not<00:02:45.960> did<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> lot<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.320> tracing<00:02:46.890> when<00:02:47.190> you're

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
I'm not did a lot of tracing when you're

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.370 
I'm not did a lot of tracing when you're
doing<00:02:47.720> animation<00:02:48.720> because<00:02:49.020> you've<00:02:49.140> got<00:02:49.260> to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
doing animation because you've got to

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.330 
doing animation because you've got to
know<00:02:49.410> what<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.830> frame<00:02:50.070> was<00:02:50.310> before<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.850> after

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.250 
know what the frame was before and after
and<00:02:53.340> then<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.970> went<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.300> painted<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.870> with<00:02:55.200> a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
and then I went and painted it with a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.530 
and then I went and painted it with a
whole<00:02:55.620> lot<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.830> chat<00:02:56.130> about<00:02:56.400> how<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.790> painted<00:02:57.360> it
