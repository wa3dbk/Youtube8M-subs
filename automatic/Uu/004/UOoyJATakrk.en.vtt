00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello I am lÃ©o paul sartre au vice 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.170
 president of the national federation 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.960
 for fishing in France can we or 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.690
 should we release these fish that we have 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.449
 captured there are two assumptions a 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.699
 first hypothesis we captured a 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.230
 fish of insufficient size 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.740
 in relation to the regulations 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.900
 this is a duty and an obligation 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.300
 in a lot of other cases the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.320
 fishermen release even the fish 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.170
 they captured 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.370
 because they are species that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.410
 do not really want to eat 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.390
 simply because they have 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.850
 a form of consideration for these 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.100
 same fish and wish he could 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.160
 continue to grow and big customers 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.950
 what happens to these fish if the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.850
 fisherman who captured them took a 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.320
 number of precautions 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.360
 elementary but I believe that the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.149
 most know them well enough in 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.219
 the vast majority of cases this is happening 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.129
 not too bad for the fish this one 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.400
 leave normally and will continue 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.979
 quietly his life until 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.880
 maybe he's captured to us so 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.189
 more and more fishermen want 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.490
 releasing their fish often gives him 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.060
 a denomination that is said no kill or 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.310
 in French we speak of graciation there 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.920
 also has fishing courses where this 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.960
 is mandatory in order to preserve 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.729
 maximum species that are present 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.350
 it's something we find 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.659
 especially on the courses of 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.090
 fly trout fishing in 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.729
 particular let's say that the fisherman and is going 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.979
 experience the sporty pleasure of capturing 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.320
 fish and want to prove or if a 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.500
 second pleasure that is to see a 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.140
 very beautiful fish to take it 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.750
 gently and release him from seeing him 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.480
 go back to the water 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.050
 to the pleasure of capture he added 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.390
 that is good to pardon that same 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.360
 fish and well now you know 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.729
 that firstly it is possible to 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.750
 release fish without damage to 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.369
 these same fish 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.200
 secondly that in some 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.840
 conditions it's something that is 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.650
 obligatory thirdly capture the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:21.000
 fish after a sporting gesture it's 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.840
 also allow him to continue to live 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.840
 his life in the river
