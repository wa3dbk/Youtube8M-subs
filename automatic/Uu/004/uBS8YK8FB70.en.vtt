00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.620
 and welcome to my new one 

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:08.400
 youtube-channel technology trends germany course 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.920
 ttg we test many electronic here 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.269
 Devices of every kind today and now 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.570
 comes first, we have a so-hr s8530 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.640
 cheaper sat receiver the one at 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.769
 cyberport for under 45 euros gets that 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.199
 device is around to the general 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.149
 technical data has to come many 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.149
 functions 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:34.469
 it has a usb 2.0 port where you have one 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.480
 connect hard disk or usb-stick 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.350
 we can see and record things 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:45.320
 Like everyone else, everyone had new ones here 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.920
 sat receiver a hdmi connection 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.539
 besides, what's newer is 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.640
 Aggressive rather untypical is very 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.539
 good is the thing about older televisions 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.870
 to join 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:05.940
 because it has a scart connection as well 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.800
 a wm and an lnb on the 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.000
 installation 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.200
 if you do that for the first time 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.090
 turned on then there is a 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.980
 predefined station list with a 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.190
 not working the first hd 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.870
 a working zdf hd and after that 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.510
 comes super rtl a few others 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.540
 transmitter 1 7 zloty ments a bit out of round 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.580
 but still in good condition then 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.140
 all the stations you need 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.700
 a point after the installation can 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.510
 you look at the station list, of course 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.550
 to edit 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.650
 that is not very good 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.300
 as I will show you soon 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.040
 first we are going to do it 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.320
 namely to get the surface 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.120
 that's what we were in this beautiful 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.050
 Remote one man with one hand 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.490
 can serve 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.650
 like when we then on the institutions 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.620
 Press on the device 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.560
 where before is only time 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.760
 and the drive is on to the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.860
 TV seems clear to me 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.120
 symbols or over the rose ball stands 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.510
 cemetery in which camera advertising slogan 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:14.360
 the input signal stayed at 720p 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:16.610
 the device has dvb s2 means you can 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.830
 sender such as zdf hd or that 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.680
 first hd synonymous in hd watch 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.550
 We do not see that now that we are 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.680
 long time dvd 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.090
 The picture is good and I will first 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.360
 look like the switch 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.970
 speed at the summer it's 850 like this 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.730
 looks for the first time from hd sender 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:43.970
 the transmitter does not stop switching 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.550
 speed is okay from not hd 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:52.460
 on the picture of the two are then up 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.480
 In any case he comes now to epg 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.120
 how can you call with the epg key 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.150
 if you do that , it will do anything to you 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.590
 in the next time will run and 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.780
 experience a little description what that 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.580
 because now is something again - record 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.860
 would like to press the button and man 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.200
 see an overview here 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.800
 However, you only see the time and 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.200
 not the sender name and the sender 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.459
 do not have the name of the consignment 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.000
 moment is just up and so this 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:26.300
 If the sts then you see here in the 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.190
 list rtl but again not the 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.940
 sender have 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:34.810
 but if you then about the 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.959
 menu button on only a few players goes 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.580
 you can see a station name though 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.560
 the wrong ones namely those of the 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.880
 respective previous shipments as to 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.360
 to summarize that again first 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.550
 no sender took the first to send 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.720
 pwg then no sender name after that 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.650
 times no sense of the name and then 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.040
 just change 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.200
 I would say something overgrown 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.060
 this can connect via this usb 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.720
 you also play other things 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.720
 movies photos and music here are the movies 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.970
 can be in many formats as for 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:12.290
 format formats again either 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:15.170
 four mkv avi and a few others 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.829
 also videos that you source from others 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.660
 and not from the tv 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.660
 Also as I said music and photos 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.030
 So on the menu button 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.430
 so if you as the fight minute 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.010
 on top of that one has an overview 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.639
 all functions that the device 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.830
 controlled 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.020
 you can edit the sender list what 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.699
 Something hard on it I will now 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.530
 go into detail if we have the 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.110
 want to edit senderliste and to 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.360
 example deluxe music was 4.500 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.690
 Lying on 43 you want to get one 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.520
 all 1390 stations by clicking around that 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.770
 is to lay there with other devices 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.990
 to solve it much smarter 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.120
 Just give the numbers where you can get that 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.099
 the program wants to have the program 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.900
 star are 4,000 program places for 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.090
 disposal how to then send to its senders 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.919
 can lie 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:15.050
 there is no ci-slot in surfing at 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.090
 the size is not necessarily 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.039
 it is amazing that you can 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.050
 for example, no sky card or hd + 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.270
 map 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.710
 that is a pity in itself but at one 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.190
 just the price range of five volts 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.750
 to EUR my absolutely normal of 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.660
 page relations here a piece man 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.870
 looks and you can transport once the 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.490
 Satellites are also looking for the 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.950
 transport and one I can only to a 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.440
 transponder and say that you have him 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.020
 will search that saves an eternally 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:50.240
 long search through the whole page 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:52.610
 we have again put together the 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.980
 device is for his price will be very 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:06:01.180
 many good equipment very many 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:01.180
 good features 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.240
 but card guard card guard camera 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.240
 cut off 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.100
 So as I said the device with many 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.600
 good features have been stocked like 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.700
 example is like maybe 0 connection 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.860
 In Berlin you can do things in many formats 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.970
 can reflect on considered 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.040
 that has many connections about the man 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.750
 whatever that one gets in too 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.800
 older television movies for example 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.500
 can connect 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.350
 the state does not influence the hdmi 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.000
 technology, the device has a very 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.120
 beautiful her eg with one 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.550
 less nice timer list and one 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:46.280
 a neither less beautiful recording 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:47.690
 view the sorting of the transmitter is on 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.730
 the beginning a bit strange, however 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:53.290
 by this in turn badly constructed 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:55.220
 transmitter government can be changed 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.800
 that's now actually first 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.450
 family on my part in the description 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.110
 are more information about this 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:04.550
 it will open up a link like the width 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.890
 a shop where you can buy the device 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:10.460
 so far so good that was the cormorant 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:12.140
 s8530 I hope they will be others too 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.690
 watch videos of me and I'm happy 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.520
 I would be glad if you have others 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.440
 things on technology trends germany 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.000
 clicking would guide me and also 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.390
 do the same and so is not 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.390
 ending
