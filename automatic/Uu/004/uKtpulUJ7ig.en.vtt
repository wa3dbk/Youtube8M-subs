00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 Let us then take our first analysis of the practical use of the process 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.059
 in this position in some tents and bars 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.070
 as long as you do not make a mistake relaunch your share 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.490
 estate agent the manager 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.849
 therefore 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.989
 it's the situation the whites can not move forward 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.650
 7 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.699
 to the basis of rip curl there are no cases available for purchase 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:30.159
 in the arms 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.159
 day 7 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.129
 restless but simply the place until day 8 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.290
 draw 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.030
 Do you have to in this position? 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.520
 if white 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.320
 with few smiles 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.470
 6th 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.480
 tie for drowning in the dam that did not again become available 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.350
 to boot 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.230
 and if 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.590
 the white ones move away from this plane playing for ect 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.960
 the black ones simply 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.700
 to everything that is a white 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.830
 in part 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.790
 to get the victory then the white idea in mind the playing position with 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.940
 your king 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.600
 st 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.910
 the situation 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.910
 the reinforced pitas throw 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.780
 again the works must have attention 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.900
 because they can not go forward said the pawn 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.650
 agencies 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.470
 with that again they would turn 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.470
 the tie for drowning in the black river 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.280
 then played the white ones 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.650
 on day 6 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.770
 in this situation 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.180
 The only thing I repeat can do 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.180
 I do not know mcgee 8 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.220
 and some works 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.220
 giving way to its worst 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.240
 and with that pitch the white people end consolation on Twitter 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.440
 who can not again 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.650
 the treatment 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.650
 with some pews 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.059
 no position 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.319
 we then in the second half 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.959
 in relation to the time we will first have redressed square 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:30.049
 in the situation and the grass probably the white ones would lose time that revealed 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.099
 calculating b3 pawn arrives there and gave eight before I repeat 17 coming 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.019
 in this situation we will use a technique known as quadratic rule 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.259
 which consists of observing a disk framed pilad rebuá teaching 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:48.919
 the number of cases the worst happens in the house of formation 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.009
 in this case 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.489
 framed 606 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.290
 according 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.249
 we could 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.019
 to view 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.489
 6% in September due to 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.599
 What is a white 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.870
 the mother excessive resort in the house promotion 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:09.090
 you have to face 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.929
 is inside the square 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:14.379
 and in this situation he will always be able to bike 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:15.259
 the pawn 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.259
 to capture it soon after its promotion 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.640
 we are in this situation 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.729
 the white house believe that you will get abel 8 with this 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.089
 I interrupted 4 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:31.089
 we observed only with advancement of the outbreak 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:35.540
 of course 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.040
 what aspects should be attentive but with each advance than a white 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.209
 framing decreases 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.889
 He must keep his father. 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.889
 always within the area of ​​culture 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:04.869
 the whites act our first goal 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.239
 corruption 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.789
 so the damage is here 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.479
 therefore 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.479
 that simply 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.479
 We will now return to the grass to demonstrate how white and should 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.460
 proceed to victory 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.919
 the first pass to verify that the team 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.620
 is within court 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.760
 logo me 4 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.680
 no laughs 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.120
 the second step would be to find out where you rule alone 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.210
 and how we saw how to prevent the opponent 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.550
 little for a place that we have here 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.689
 rejecting Paulista 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.939
 we will use home for demonstration of this event in order to 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.939
 make it magina 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.290
 as we had read 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.290
 only with the opposition but braga asensi 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.139
 25 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.139
 is the only bid tibet curtis 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.509
 companies will keep the opposition wanted 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.509
 until the people here 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:29.509
 moment this who then assumes the opposition 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:44.779
 the black tried to obtain the position but the advance of the pawn prevented them from having 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.779
 success 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.919
 at this moment the criticism has no position 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.960
 but as we have seen in the 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.960
 in this position the chips and no more chances 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:07.749
 draw 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.970
 and white
