there's a sense when you bite into it

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.420 
there's a sense when you bite into it
much<00:02:30.370> like<00:02:30.670> those<00:02:30.940> Katy<00:02:31.660> Perry<00:02:32.200> pop<00:02:32.650> chips<00:02:33.010> are

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
much like those Katy Perry pop chips are

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.180 
much like those Katy Perry pop chips are
reviewed<00:02:33.879> earlier<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.629> year<00:02:35.069> there's<00:02:36.069> a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
reviewed earlier this year there's a

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.650 
reviewed earlier this year there's a
very<00:02:36.579> premium<00:02:38.430> quality<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.120> chip<00:02:40.420> when

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
very premium quality that the chip when

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.039 
very premium quality that the chip when
you<00:02:40.810> bite<00:02:41.079> into<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:42.329> was<00:02:43.329> looking<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:44.019> the

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
you bite into it I was looking on the

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.830 
you bite into it I was looking on the
ingredients<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.400> can<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.269> notice<00:02:46.660> it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
ingredients on the can and I notice it

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.589 
ingredients on the can and I notice it
said<00:02:47.140> dried<00:02:47.560> black<00:02:48.099> beans<00:02:48.549> which<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.420> don't

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
said dried black beans which you don't

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.869 
said dried black beans which you don't
really<00:02:49.900> taste<00:02:50.349> any<00:02:50.739> black<00:02:51.099> bean<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.489> the

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
really taste any black bean and the

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.630 
really taste any black bean and the
flavor<00:02:52.260> but<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.290> wonder<00:02:53.769> if<00:02:53.920> that's<00:02:54.160> part<00:02:54.549> of

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
flavor but I wonder if that's part of

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.089 
flavor but I wonder if that's part of
the<00:02:54.760> secret<00:02:55.060> for<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.690> texture<00:02:56.319> these<00:02:56.620> chips

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
the secret for the texture these chips

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.449 
the secret for the texture these chips
which<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.670> very<00:02:57.940> good<00:02:58.500> if<00:02:59.500> you're<00:02:59.829> buying<00:03:00.099> a

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
which is very good if you're buying a

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.059 
which is very good if you're buying a
dip<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:01.000> go<00:03:01.030> with<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:02.170> seems<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:02.860> it

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
dip to go with this it seems like it

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.400 
dip to go with this it seems like it
would<00:03:03.190> go<00:03:03.400> best<00:03:03.730> with<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.120> ranch<00:03:04.540> or<00:03:04.989> cheese

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
would go best with a ranch or cheese

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.349 
would go best with a ranch or cheese
type<00:03:06.129> of<00:03:06.160> dip<00:03:06.640> as<00:03:06.970> opposed<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.750> salsa<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.940> the

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
type of dip as opposed to salsa and the

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.530 
type of dip as opposed to salsa and the
overall<00:03:10.750> corn<00:03:11.470> flavor<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.250> would<00:03:12.489> say<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:13.060> much

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
overall corn flavor I would say is much

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.030 
overall corn flavor I would say is much
closer<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.530> freedom<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.639> to<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:15.940> Dorito<00:03:17.040> or

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
closer to a freedom and to a Dorito or

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.599 
closer to a freedom and to a Dorito or
your<00:03:18.220> ordinary<00:03:18.760> tortilla<00:03:19.480> chip<00:03:20.130> which<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:21.370> like

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
your ordinary tortilla chip which I like

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.509 
your ordinary tortilla chip which I like
Fritos<00:03:22.239> so<00:03:22.569> that's<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.989> good<00:03:23.200> thing<00:03:23.519> just

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
Fritos so that's a good thing just

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.720 
Fritos so that's a good thing just
taking<00:03:25.060> this<00:03:25.269> as<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:25.599> plane<00:03:26.139> corn<00:03:26.739> chip<00:03:26.859> against

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
taking this as a plane corn chip against

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.390 
taking this as a plane corn chip against
