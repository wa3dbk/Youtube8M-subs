00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
is mounted in dashboard so that while

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.050 
is mounted in dashboard so that while
you're<00:04:27.440> driving<00:04:27.920> is<00:04:28.280> right<00:04:28.580> in<00:04:28.700> your<00:04:28.730> line<00:04:29.030> of

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
you're driving is right in your line of

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.210 
you're driving is right in your line of
view<00:04:29.450> you're<00:04:29.930> not<00:04:30.080> looking<00:04:30.380> down<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:30.890> back<00:04:31.040> up

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
view you're not looking down and back up

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.940 
view you're not looking down and back up
again<00:04:31.600> it's<00:04:32.600> great<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:33.380> can<00:04:33.590> be<00:04:33.710> neat

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
again it's great that you can be neat

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.670 
again it's great that you can be neat
and<00:04:34.250> it's<00:04:34.670> easy<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:35.000> use

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
and it's easy to use

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.029 
and it's easy to use
also<00:04:36.490> all<00:04:37.030> of<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.360> dials<00:04:37.750> in<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.080> car<00:04:38.350> clearly

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
also all of the dials in the car clearly

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.399 
also all of the dials in the car clearly
marked<00:04:39.430> really

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
marked really

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.949 
marked really
to<00:04:41.499> identify<00:04:41.709> and<00:04:42.489> easy<00:04:42.729> to<00:04:43.059> use<00:04:43.089> especially

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:43.959 
to identify and easy to use especially

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:47.760 
to identify and easy to use especially
the<00:04:44.289> ones

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.850 

go<00:04:48.160> on<00:04:48.340> three<00:04:48.639> years<00:04:48.879> running

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.010 

as<00:04:52.370> I<00:04:52.550> mentioned<00:04:52.580> before<00:04:52.969> one<00:04:53.509> of<00:04:53.629> the<00:04:53.780> core

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
as I mentioned before one of the core

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.619 
as I mentioned before one of the core
values<00:04:54.379> for<00:04:54.620> Volvo<00:04:54.979> is<00:04:55.189> safety<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.969> one<00:04:56.509> way

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:56.629 
values for Volvo is safety and one way

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.179 
values for Volvo is safety and one way
that<00:04:56.659> they<00:04:56.960> implement<00:04:57.409> this<00:04:57.560> is<00:04:57.860> by<00:04:58.009> having

00:04:58.179 --> 00:04:58.189 
that they implement this is by having

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:00.790 
that they implement this is by having
the<00:04:58.550> engine<00:04:58.909> transversely<00:04:59.569> mounted<00:04:59.800> this

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
the engine transversely mounted this

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.309 
the engine transversely mounted this
allows<00:05:01.129> for<00:05:01.159> extra<00:05:01.909> crush<00:05:02.180> space<00:05:02.509> between<00:05:03.020> the

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
allows for extra crush space between the

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.619 
allows for extra crush space between the
engine<00:05:03.469> and<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:03.979> cabin<00:05:04.580> in<00:05:04.789> the<00:05:04.969> event<00:05:05.270> of<00:05:05.479> a

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:05.629 
engine and the cabin in the event of a

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:08.409 
engine and the cabin in the event of a
front-end<00:05:06.229> collision
