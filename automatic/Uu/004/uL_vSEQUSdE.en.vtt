 I do each of these exercises three times 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.470
 Ten are the right exercises and 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.880
 set my goal as a beginner for me 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.630
 is to build up the people's muscle mass 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.640

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.299
 so good he let us stand so first 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.560

 would you advise me to take some? 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.430
 while it already if you simply 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.600
 Wholesale is yes philippines first respectful 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.680
 you did you manage to get started you did 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.780
 managed to start 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.729
 now only that important is intelligent 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.579
 so start my tips here 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.369
 you, and that's what I'm doing 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.259
 again, so you read through you train two 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.939
 every other day and then the second 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.890
 all exercises means you do everybody 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.510
 second day 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.340
 a whole body workout, so to speak 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.180
 basic exercises I recommend you in the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.330
 very clear 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.220
 It offers an exercise a day 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.659
 putsch training a day pool training 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.110
 and the third day of training that 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.200
 means you have bush every Monday mornings 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.590
 so purely exemplary day 1 bush the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:19.739
 means you press you press chest you 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:21.690
 press shoulder and then with tips 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.350
 then you have a push, unity check 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.160
 then a day break day 20 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.190
 that means you train your deadlift 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:36.570
 your pull ups your loud pulse or something 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.250
 you do and your biceps 0 chopped off 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.650
 let day then train your legs 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.660
 squat failure steps, etc. I may 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.610
 already made video too six times 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.080
 out my lag day 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.370
 that is, you must you must start the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.620
 I expect too much you have yours 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.140
 Training intelligence slid next to the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.680
 he knows the time that such a grid 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.769
 cast push pull legs 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.390
 then it goes on these are the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.000
 correct exercises and sat for me 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.380
 as a beginner so clearly so completely 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.850
 important and very correct what you 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.739
 already doing basic exercises 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.880
 lead at the beginning and generally always 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.290
 to succeed is really essential 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.200
 important that you do your basic exercises 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.720
 complete the basic exercises so does 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.489
 really good on the spot 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.989
 and from the sentence and repetition 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.250
 number is really okay too one says 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.870
 is always so that this hypo trophy 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.730
 range back between eight and twelve 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.079
 repetition lies that means there you are 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.340
 really good too the whole way 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.640
 actually because keep 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.049
 The goal is to build muscle mass 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.489
 then I advise you clearly track yours 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.500
 calorie-conscious know how much 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.239
 consumed and you also have to know how 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.769
 many can rejoin the svlo so much 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.420
 to take you and that was for example 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.519
 my mistake started after 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.750
 at 16 also in the cellar too 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.890
 I train, I have simple and 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.920
 eagerly eaten too little 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.730
 That means wearing a calorie and holding 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.470
 take to yourself and see that you are always in the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.660
 caloric surplus is so three 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.750
 up to 500 kilocalories a day more to you 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.950
 take as too much supplements 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.400
 namely, none would you advise me 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.739
 which to take 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.379
 yes at the moment a very clear no 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.849
 I definitely recommend that you first 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.140
 time your training properly in check 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.640
 you get that right yours 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.470
 training plan come in that you learn 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.150
 you really have to go for it 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.829
 to be able to complete a good training 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.389
 and then I would say you can 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.549
 think about losing weight 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.989
 yes that means right now makes you for 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.780
 for example still no meaningful something like 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.030
 to accept creatine or other 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.070
 supplements of the keepers or something like that 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.419
 means he was trying to get a protein 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.190
 cover his food like I already do 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.510
 said trek your calories are wearing one 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.919
 macro nutrients look like many 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.020
 I take you proteins to you 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:40.229
 guess at the beginning 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.729
 between 15 and 20 grams of protein per 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.710
 kilogram body weight was on the 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.479
 Libra brings to take you and if 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.590
 you can not do that if you have it 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.210
 you can not get a protein too 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.950
 to cover through your normal food 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.720
 what you can do in the daytime between then 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.060
 you, of course, a good wayward protein 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.650
 So order whey protein and thus 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.030
 Just add that your daily goal 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.950
 almost reached in protein 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.720
 again summarized and easy 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.250
 with splinter your training does not work 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.560
 all basic exercises in one day but 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.590
 it really flashes in push westpol 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.120
 rest and legs then you look yours 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.710
 food in the war so you know how 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.110
 many calories you to you take up 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.919
 your protein shake and maybe 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.560
 do you think about it even if 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.720
 maybe boca scolas for that in wake 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.030
 However , it is absolutely impossible to gain protein 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.440
 Duty to build muscle 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.729
 yes i hope i could you and me 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.960
 I hope I could give you a little 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.669
 a little help those said if you 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.470
