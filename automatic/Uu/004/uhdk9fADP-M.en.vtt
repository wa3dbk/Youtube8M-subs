00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
lay on the table design let's see here's

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.800 
lay on the table design let's see here's
rail<00:05:59.150> we<00:05:59.300> have<00:06:00.940> the<00:06:02.260> bracket<00:06:03.260> into<00:06:03.500> 350<00:06:04.370> degree

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
rail we have the bracket into 350 degree

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.020 
rail we have the bracket into 350 degree
and<00:06:05.810> belt<00:06:06.290> clip<00:06:08.020> so<00:06:09.020> it<00:06:09.890> can<00:06:10.130> use<00:06:10.460> it<00:06:10.610> as<00:06:10.700> movie

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
and belt clip so it can use it as movie

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.010 
and belt clip so it can use it as movie
stand<00:06:11.300> book<00:06:11.680> hello<00:06:12.940> and<00:06:13.940> apparently<00:06:14.270> you

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
stand book hello and apparently you

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.890 
stand book hello and apparently you
place<00:06:15.440> the<00:06:15.620> case<00:06:15.800> in<00:06:16.010> like<00:06:16.370> so<00:06:16.700> and<00:06:16.940> on<00:06:17.810> the

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
place the case in like so and on the

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.040 
place the case in like so and on the
sides<00:06:18.140> here<00:06:18.700> you<00:06:19.700> have<00:06:19.940> an<00:06:20.150> indentation<00:06:20.630> on

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
sides here you have an indentation on

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.720 
sides here you have an indentation on
both<00:06:21.860> sides<00:06:22.630> which<00:06:23.630> allows<00:06:24.230> you<00:06:24.410> to<00:06:24.610> snap<00:06:25.610> the

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
both sides which allows you to snap the

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.590 
both sides which allows you to snap the
case<00:06:25.910> in<00:06:26.090> place<00:06:26.470> so<00:06:27.470> it<00:06:27.650> doesn't<00:06:27.680> fall<00:06:28.190> out<00:06:28.600> and

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
case in place so it doesn't fall out and
