00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
the back it's supported by a ring stand

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.219 
the back it's supported by a ring stand
and<00:00:45.920> I<00:00:46.579> have<00:00:46.789> it<00:00:46.969> here<00:00:46.999> so<00:00:47.510> you<00:00:47.600> can<00:00:47.809> see<00:00:48.079> it

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
like in action I'm not going to like to

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.049 
like in action I'm not going to like to
put<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.030> on<00:00:50.179> my<00:00:50.300> bed<00:00:50.539> or<00:00:50.899> anything<00:00:51.670> but<00:00:52.670> this<00:00:52.819> is

put it on my bed or anything but this is

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.559 
put it on my bed or anything but this is
how<00:00:53.420> it<00:00:53.629> looks<00:00:53.870> on<00:00:54.050> a<00:00:54.699> regular<00:00:55.699> desk<00:00:55.969> just<00:00:56.479> so

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:56.569 
how it looks on a regular desk just so

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:58.959 
how it looks on a regular desk just so
you<00:00:56.659> get<00:00:56.839> some<00:00:57.019> size<00:00:57.199> comparison<00:00:57.969> it's

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
you get some size comparison it's

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.229 
you get some size comparison it's
supported<00:00:59.449> by<00:00:59.479> this<00:00:59.629> ring<00:01:00.049> and<00:01:01.960> it<00:01:02.960> has<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:03.530> tilt

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
supported by this ring and it has a tilt

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.399 
supported by this ring and it has a tilt
functionality<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:08.360> took<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:08.900> big<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.290> it

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
functionality so I took that big and it

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.679 
functionality so I took that big and it
tilts<00:01:09.710> up<00:01:09.829> very<00:01:10.130> nice<00:01:10.310> it<00:01:10.490> has<00:01:10.640> a<00:01:10.689> resistance

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
tilts up very nice it has a resistance

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.800 
tilts up very nice it has a resistance
so<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.680> comes<00:01:12.890> up<00:01:13.100> very<00:01:13.570> nicely

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
so it comes up very nicely

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.810 
so it comes up very nicely
I'll<00:01:15.530> make<00:01:15.710> currently<00:01:16.250> haven't<00:01:16.520> hooked<00:01:16.579> up<00:01:16.729> to

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
I'll make currently haven't hooked up to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.810 
I'll make currently haven't hooked up to
that<00:01:16.850> laptop<00:01:17.530> but<00:01:18.530> um<00:01:18.740> since<00:01:19.250> this<00:01:19.520> screen

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
that laptop but um since this screen

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.660 
that laptop but um since this screen
obviously<00:01:20.180> overpowered<00:01:21.109> that<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.039> I<00:01:22.250> just<00:01:22.280> use

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
obviously overpowered that so I just use

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.910 
obviously overpowered that so I just use
this<00:01:23.500> it's<00:01:24.500> huge

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
this it's huge

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.160 
this it's huge
so<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.640> don't<00:01:26.509> need<00:01:26.780> my<00:01:27.140> dual<00:01:27.530> monitor<00:01:28.009> setup

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.480 

that<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:33.229> I<00:01:33.850> mean<00:01:35.380> my<00:01:36.380> thumb<00:01:36.710> is<00:01:36.950> just<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.250> bit

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
that is I mean my thumb is just a bit

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.560 
that is I mean my thumb is just a bit
thicker<00:01:37.780> it's<00:01:38.780> it's<00:01:39.619> crazy<00:01:40.329> so<00:01:41.329> I'm<00:01:41.420> gonna

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
thicker it's it's crazy so I'm gonna

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.399 
thicker it's it's crazy so I'm gonna
turn<00:01:41.719> it<00:01:41.869> on<00:01:43.030> um<00:01:44.030> we<00:01:44.359> have<00:01:44.479> top<00:01:44.869> sensitive

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
turn it on um we have top sensitive

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.080 
turn it on um we have top sensitive
buttons<00:01:45.590> over<00:01:45.829> here<00:01:46.100> with<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.310> nice<00:01:46.609> LED

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
buttons over here with a nice LED

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.959 
buttons over here with a nice LED
backlit<00:01:47.570> on<00:01:48.289> each<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.679> them<00:01:48.829> they'll<00:01:49.579> go<00:01:49.789> away

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
backlit on each of them they'll go away

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:57.070 
backlit on each of them they'll go away
in<00:01:50.329> a<00:01:50.420> little<00:01:50.630> bit<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:52.030> nice<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.210> dim

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.610 

so<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> 23-inch<00:01:59.460> I<00:02:00.200> mean<00:02:01.200> let<00:02:01.530> me<00:02:01.560> just
