00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.289
 We are very good, we are all here 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.930
 with another new bots for the collection 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.029
 this time I bring the holographic 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.160
 mods and what it does mainly is 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.650
 to be able to visualize all objects as 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.070
 you are looking here from the chest or from this 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.070
 another chest without the need to open it 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.350
 this is very comfortable for people who are 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.360
 total pigeons like me and good of this 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.480
 so we can see it until it is very 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.460
 cool the truth and good the only thing 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.730
 It is clear that as you well know 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.590
 minecraft groups the chests worth 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.050
 every three rows ie it is 3 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.149
 these three rows would be a part of the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.879
 chest and the other three rows would be the 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.310
 another part of the chest yes you look 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.550
 the cubes are worth the group in a way 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.280
 somewhat rare is not the same as 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.830
 example here the diamond or the gold that what 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.899
 It groups very well in very beautiful rows but 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.450
 however the cubes group them 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.810
 randomly as we drag the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.390
 Minecraft 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.670
 you already know this this because of a 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.790
 randomly picks them up and leaves them 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.380
 this form is worth while I loose two veis 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.750
 as randomly this does as 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.490
 good ways would stay this way 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.399
 that's why he misses us and if you see him a little 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.369
 weird is something normal, it's good and not just 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.890
 groups what would be objects in chests 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.250
 but anything that is in a 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.979
 oven or as you can see here is worth a 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.140
 funnel or in a soldering iron is worth it 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.340
 show everything 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.710
 or even if we put a music disc 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.979
 How can this be as you can see us? 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.170
 it says it instantly what we have without the 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.630
 need after that to have to 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.850
 take it out then it's a very comfortable way 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.259
 to see all the objects perfectly 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.840
 it's a very simple way but at the same time 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.300
 very effective and you have it in the description 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.640
 If you want to install it, you need the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.080
 forge and the version and good here in the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.040
 oven I want you to see also because 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.860
 I'm going to put fir wood and 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.320
 as you well know if we put any 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.100
 type of wood with coal is going to 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.410
 transform into charcoal as a 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.760
 that vegetable charcoal is 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.239
 you can see here shows us 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.269
 absolutely worth going to reaction of the 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.920
 time then it's super epic this mod 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.200
 the truth very simple and very epic 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.900
 I hope you have never liked any 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.030
