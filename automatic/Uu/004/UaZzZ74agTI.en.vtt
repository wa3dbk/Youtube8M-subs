one<00:00:10.269> of<00:00:10.389> the<00:00:10.450> main<00:00:10.719> things<00:00:11.679> that<00:00:11.799> I<00:00:11.949> truly

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
one of the main things that I truly

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.819 
one of the main things that I truly
truly<00:00:12.639> want<00:00:12.940> to<00:00:12.969> get<00:00:13.119> done<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:15.190> winter<00:00:15.609> is

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:16.829 
truly want to get done this winter is

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:21.529 
truly want to get done this winter is
sorting<00:00:17.829> to<00:00:17.890> throw<00:00:18.160> on<00:00:18.730> this<00:00:19.110> chip<00:00:20.110> because<00:00:20.710> I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
sorting to throw on this chip because I

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.540 
sorting to throw on this chip because I
don't<00:00:22.539> know<00:00:22.599> if<00:00:22.689> you<00:00:22.779> can<00:00:22.930> see<00:00:23.169> how<00:00:23.380> I<00:00:23.710> can<00:00:24.279> keep

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
don't know if you can see how I can keep

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:36.900 
don't know if you can see how I can keep
it<00:00:24.730> in<00:00:24.759> frame<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:27.550> it<00:00:27.790> moves<00:00:35.219> almost<00:00:36.219> two<00:00:36.640> feet

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
it in frame but it moves almost two feet

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.120 
it in frame but it moves almost two feet
I<00:00:37.120> guess<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:39.129> it<00:00:39.940> hits<00:00:40.780> a<00:00:40.960> passenger<00:00:41.620> right<00:00:42.010> in

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
I guess and it hits a passenger right in

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.750 
I guess and it hits a passenger right in
the<00:00:42.190> face

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
the face

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.870 
the face
when<00:00:43.720> you<00:00:43.810> go<00:00:43.960> into<00:00:44.110> reverse<00:00:44.350> on<00:00:44.800> that<00:00:44.829> t5<00:00:45.430> and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
when you go into reverse on that t5 and

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.270 
when you go into reverse on that t5 and
I<00:00:46.030> want<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.380> want<00:00:47.380> to<00:00:47.500> shorten<00:00:47.770> the<00:00:47.860> throw<00:00:48.070> on

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
I want to want to shorten the throw on

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.620 
I want to want to shorten the throw on
that<00:00:48.460> I<00:00:48.489> don't<00:00:48.640> really<00:00:48.970> want<00:00:49.210> to<00:00:49.239> shorten<00:00:49.570> the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
that I don't really want to shorten the

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.900 
that I don't really want to shorten the
stick<00:00:49.960> I<00:00:50.290> kind<00:00:50.770> of<00:00:50.800> like<00:00:50.980> that<00:00:51.220> stick<00:00:51.489> being<00:00:51.760> up

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
stick I kind of like that stick being up

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.940 
stick I kind of like that stick being up
there<00:00:52.149> then<00:00:53.079> I<00:00:53.110> want<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.380> shorten<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.710> throw

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
there then I want to shorten the throw

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.340 
there then I want to shorten the throw
so<00:00:54.460> that<00:00:54.640> when<00:00:54.790> you<00:00:54.910> shift<00:00:55.180> it<00:00:55.390> it<00:00:55.899> only<00:00:56.050> goes

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
so that when you shift it it only goes

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:56.020 
so that when you shift it it only goes
about<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.960> far<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:03.600> so

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.859 

I<00:01:59.860> set<00:02:00.860> up<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.159> drill<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.729> bit<00:02:02.090> in<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.659> other

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
I set up a drill a bit in that other

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.499 
I set up a drill a bit in that other
hole<00:02:03.110> back<00:02:04.070> there<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:06.100> can<00:02:07.149> line<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.179> up

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
hole back there so that I can line it up

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.320 
hole back there so that I can line it up
and<00:02:08.810> know<00:02:08.959> that<00:02:09.170> I'm<00:02:09.350> getting<00:02:10.030> getting<00:02:11.030> the

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
and know that I'm getting getting the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.140 
and know that I'm getting getting the
new<00:02:11.480> hole<00:02:11.720> straight<00:02:12.470> or<00:02:12.800> at<00:02:12.950> least<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.880> same

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
new hole straight or at least the same

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.800 
new hole straight or at least the same
angle<00:02:14.780> as<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.580> previous<00:02:16.580> hole<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.360> original

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
angle as the previous hole the original

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.940 
angle as the previous hole the original
so<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:19.330> don't<00:02:20.330> know<00:02:20.420> maybe<00:02:21.350> you're<00:02:21.530> all<00:02:21.620> but

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
so I don't know maybe you're all but

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.620 
so I don't know maybe you're all but
looks<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.700> me<00:02:22.850> like<00:02:22.880> it's<00:02:23.150> working

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
looks to me like it's working

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:32.929 
looks to me like it's working
we'll<00:02:23.989> see

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.640 

well<00:02:33.939> there<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.269> is<00:02:34.359> well<00:02:35.079> you<00:02:35.170> think<00:02:35.290> George

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
well there it is well you think George

00:02:35.650 --> 00:05:04.189 
well there it is well you think George
did<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.099> drill<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:36.400> hole<00:02:36.579> roll

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:12.869 

appears<00:05:05.199> work<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:07.330> peers<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:10.870> work<00:05:11.050> well<00:05:11.879> the

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
appears work and peers to work well the

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.969 
appears work and peers to work well the
beef<00:05:13.090> jet<00:05:13.360> my<00:05:13.599> stick<00:05:13.990> here<00:05:14.229> a<00:05:14.259> little<00:05:14.409> bit<00:05:14.590> is

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
beef jet my stick here a little bit is

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.519 
beef jet my stick here a little bit is
getting<00:05:15.249> a<00:05:15.279> little<00:05:15.370> flimsy<00:05:18.689> now<00:05:19.689> she<00:05:19.779> beats<00:05:20.259> up

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:20.529 
getting a little flimsy now she beats up

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.619 
getting a little flimsy now she beats up
ready<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.860> go<00:05:21.009> all<00:05:21.520> right<00:05:21.550> I<00:05:21.939> think<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:22.419> want<00:05:22.569> to

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
ready to go all right I think I want to

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.140 
ready to go all right I think I want to
take<00:05:23.169> a<00:05:23.199> spark<00:05:23.650> now<00:05:23.889> put<00:05:24.219> the<00:05:24.310> boot<00:05:24.490> on<00:05:24.669> and

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
take a spark now put the boot on and

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.909 
take a spark now put the boot on and
they<00:05:25.930> want<00:05:26.139> to<00:05:26.199> put<00:05:26.319> it<00:05:26.409> all<00:05:26.499> together<00:05:26.620> until

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
they want to put it all together until

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.469 
they want to put it all together until
it<00:05:27.129> make<00:05:27.249> sure<00:05:27.279> it's<00:05:27.639> all<00:05:27.789> working<00:05:27.819> right<00:05:28.270> this

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
it make sure it's all working right this

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:50.629 
it make sure it's all working right this
pure<00:05:28.749> speed<00:05:29.669> so<00:05:30.669> I<00:05:31.469> think<00:05:32.469> we're<00:05:32.680> good

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.999 

tune<00:05:51.639> in<00:05:51.789> next<00:05:51.969> time<00:05:52.300> in<00:05:52.539> here<00:05:52.719> 63<00:05:53.439> and<00:05:53.620> powders

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:54.009 
tune in next time in here 63 and powders

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.979 
tune in next time in here 63 and powders
say<00:05:55.680> it's<00:05:56.680> good
