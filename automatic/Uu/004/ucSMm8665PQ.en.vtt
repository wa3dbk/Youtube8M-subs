when<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.560> was<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.740> your<00:01:55.830> again<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.250> quite<00:01:56.700> liked

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
when I was at your again I quite liked

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.130 
when I was at your again I quite liked
it<00:01:57.120> was<00:01:57.210> quite<00:01:57.360> nice<00:01:57.480> but<00:01:57.660> not<00:01:57.780> many<00:01:57.990> other

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
it was quite nice but not many other

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.870 
it was quite nice but not many other
people<00:01:58.410> did<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.160> think<00:01:59.400> these<00:01:59.610> things<00:01:59.670> are

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
people did so I think these things are

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.800 
people did so I think these things are
going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.150> something<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:00.480> want<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.660> know

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
going to be something you want to know

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.000 
going to be something you want to know
you're<00:02:01.110> definitely<00:02:01.260> going<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.590> want<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.800> try

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
you're definitely going to want to try

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.380 
you're definitely going to want to try
out<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.580> are<00:02:02.700> gonna<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:03.030> some<00:02:03.180> favorite

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
out and you are gonna have some favorite

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.060 
out and you are gonna have some favorite
flavors<00:02:03.870> and<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:04.050> think<00:02:04.290> lemonade<00:02:04.620> one<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.830> also

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
flavors and I think lemonade one is also

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.160 
flavors and I think lemonade one is also
quantized<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.730> I<00:02:05.760> don't<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> blue<00:02:06.390> ice<00:02:06.570> p

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
quantized so I don't on the blue ice p

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.809 
quantized so I don't on the blue ice p
lemonade<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.620> nice<00:02:07.770> lemon<00:02:08.129> lime<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.429> very<00:02:08.670> nice

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
lemonade is nice lemon lime is very nice

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.150 
lemonade is nice lemon lime is very nice
the<00:02:09.209> fruit<00:02:09.479> punch<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.259> killer<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
the fruit punch is the killer it is the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.550 
the fruit punch is the killer it is the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
energy i'm gonna read some stuff off the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.979 
energy i'm gonna read some stuff off the
back<00:02:25.010> basically<00:02:26.010> each<00:02:26.159> sashay<00:02:27.120> only<00:02:27.420> has<00:02:27.599> 10

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
back basically each sashay only has 10

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.619 
back basically each sashay only has 10
10<00:02:28.590> calories<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.489> i<00:02:30.060> believe<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.569> or

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
10 calories in it and i believe it or

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.750 
10 calories in it and i believe it or
not<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.750> feel<00:02:30.989> miss<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.260> sugar<00:02:31.590> free<00:02:31.769> so<00:02:32.159> I<00:02:32.400> don't

what they mean but basically it's got
energy<00:02:43.769> complex<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.700> its<00:02:45.000> focus<00:02:45.390> complex<00:02:45.870> and

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
energy complex in its focus complex and

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.140 
energy complex in its focus complex and
antioxidant<00:02:46.709> complex<00:02:47.069> basically<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.090> is

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
antioxidant complex basically this is

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.940 
antioxidant complex basically this is
the<00:02:48.480> other<00:02:48.750> ingredients<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.500> God<00:02:49.680> knows<00:02:49.709> what
