00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.030 
okay that's good enough and see the
entire<00:00:53.860> queue<00:00:54.430> -<00:00:54.580> scrambled<00:00:56.760> fairly<00:00:57.760> well

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
entire queue - scrambled fairly well

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.240 
entire queue - scrambled fairly well
okay

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
okay

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.560 
okay
still<00:01:00.910> zero<00:01:01.180> zero<00:01:02.129> now

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
still zero zero now

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.560 
still zero zero now
i'ma<00:01:05.080> start<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.470> timer

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
i'ma start the timer

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.590 
i'ma start the timer
there<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:08.689> go<00:01:09.820> got<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.850> five-second<00:01:11.720> start<00:01:12.710> so

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
there you go got a five-second start so

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.200 
there you go got a five-second start so
turn<00:01:14.600> up<00:01:14.630> them<00:01:14.899> like<00:01:15.049> a<00:01:15.200> little<00:01:15.439> bit<00:01:16.149> here<00:01:17.149> we

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
turn up them like a little bit here we

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.960 
turn up them like a little bit here we
go<00:01:18.070> right<00:01:19.070> now<00:01:20.680> five<00:01:21.680> four<00:01:22.610> three<00:01:23.470> two<00:01:24.470> one

zero one two three four right there just

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.309 
zero one two three four right there just
an<00:01:37.789> entire<00:01:38.179> queue<00:01:38.560> mmm<00:01:39.619> solved<00:01:40.069> right<00:01:40.220> there

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
an entire queue mmm solved right there

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:48.039 
an entire queue mmm solved right there
you<00:01:42.319> see<00:01:42.590> my<00:01:42.740> time<00:01:43.179> 571<00:01:45.250> okay<00:01:46.869> well<00:01:47.869> as<00:01:47.959> you

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
you see my time 571 okay well as you

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.870 
you see my time 571 okay well as you
know<00:01:48.200> that<00:01:48.350> was<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:48.530> trick<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.729> know<00:01:49.819> I'm

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.359 
know that was the trick so you know I'm
gonna<00:01:49.970> teach<00:01:50.179> you<00:01:50.270> a<00:01:50.330> solvent<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:51.890> start<00:01:52.220> out

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
gonna teach you a solvent so I start out

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.850 
gonna teach you a solvent so I start out
you<00:01:53.240> have<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.479> have<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.780> salt<00:01:54.049> cube<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:54.649> I

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
you have to have it a salt cube so I

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.010 
you have to have it a salt cube so I
have<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.759> green<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.330> orange<00:01:56.360> on<00:01:56.959> the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
have the green and the orange on the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.580 
have the green and the orange on the
right<00:01:57.939> beretta<00:01:58.939> Molla<00:01:59.119> yo<00:02:00.110> boy<00:02:00.709> okay<00:02:01.580> so

di<00:02:35.750> UI<00:02:39.470> alright

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
di UI alright

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:54.770 
di UI alright
di<00:02:42.300> oh<00:02:43.790> no<00:02:44.790> be<00:02:45.470> my<00:02:46.470> dad<00:02:46.680> not<00:02:47.010> be<00:02:47.250> ID<00:02:47.780> f<00:02:50.120> li<00:02:52.160> d<00:02:53.780> are

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
di oh no be my dad not be ID f li d are

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.850 
di oh no be my dad not be ID f li d are
too<00:02:55.790> soon<00:02:56.790> your<00:02:57.030> Q<00:02:57.300> all<00:02:57.480> clicked<00:02:57.780> SP<00:02:58.260> father<00:02:58.560> me

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
too soon your Q all clicked SP father me

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.620 
too soon your Q all clicked SP father me
and<00:02:59.720> then<00:03:00.720> solve<00:03:01.200> it

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
and then solve it

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.560 
and then solve it
that<00:03:03.630> was<00:03:03.780> like<00:03:04.040> 17<00:03:05.040> step<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:06.150> was<00:03:06.240> actually

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
that was like 17 step it was actually

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.920 
that was like 17 step it was actually
like<00:03:06.630> 36<00:03:07.580> you<00:03:08.580> divided<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.060> by<00:03:09.210> 2<00:03:09.240> from<00:03:09.630> all<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
like 36 you divided it by 2 from all the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.290 
like 36 you divided it by 2 from all the
are<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.320> be<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.890> all<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.250> artists<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
are to be to all the artists and the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.010 
are to be to all the artists and the
twos<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:13.410> here's<00:03:14.220> how<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.370> solve<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:15.870> act

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
twos so here's how to solve it you act

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.560 
twos so here's how to solve it you act
like<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.380> scramble<00:03:16.830> but<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.220> really<00:03:17.850> you

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
like is scramble but it's really you

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.400 
like is scramble but it's really you
know<00:03:18.750> what<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.990> do

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
know what to do

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:27.040 
know what to do
it's<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.800> 7<00:03:20.160> softstep<00:03:20.670> thing<00:03:21.600> say<00:03:22.470> yeah<00:03:23.210> are<00:03:24.210> to

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
it's a 7 softstep thing say yeah are to

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:36.210 
it's a 7 softstep thing say yeah are to
di<00:03:28.700> Li<00:03:30.320> fi<00:03:31.730> di<00:03:33.710> alright
