framerate tests for thief and i can tell
you<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.729> yeah<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> game<00:01:30.329> definitely<00:01:30.689> does

tank<00:01:31.409> down<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.579> mid<00:01:32.850> 20<00:01:33.210> frames<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.630> second

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
tank down to the mid 20 frames a second

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.749 
tank down to the mid 20 frames a second
on<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.829> ps4<00:01:35.549> that's<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.570> given<00:01:37.640> but<00:01:38.640> even

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
on the ps4 that's just a given but even

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.510 
on the ps4 that's just a given but even
so<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.270> machine<00:01:39.600> typically<00:01:40.560> runs<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.070> 1080p

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
so the machine typically runs a 1080p

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.730 
so the machine typically runs a 1080p
and<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> xbox<00:01:42.390> one<00:01:42.570> seems<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> lag<00:01:43.110> behind<00:01:43.140> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and the xbox one seems to lag behind and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.130 
and the xbox one seems to lag behind and
then<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.189> that's<00:01:44.520> based<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.240> question<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.930> what

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
then so that's based on question of what

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.910 
then so that's based on question of what
exactly<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.619> going<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.009> here<00:01:47.750> unfortunately

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
exactly is going on here unfortunately

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.139 
exactly is going on here unfortunately
there's<00:01:49.920> not<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.250> whole<00:01:50.610> lot<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.939> information

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
there's not a whole lot of information

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.120 
there's not a whole lot of information
that<00:01:51.689> that's<00:01:52.049> being<00:01:52.290> brought<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> table

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
that that's being brought to the table

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.719 
that that's being brought to the table
as<00:01:53.490> yet<00:01:54.049> because<00:01:55.130> we<00:01:56.130> start<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
as yet because we start with the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.300 
as yet because we start with the
framerate<00:01:57.170> there's<00:01:58.170> always<00:01:58.500> their<00:01:58.740> question

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
framerate there's always their question

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.819 
framerate there's always their question
of<00:01:59.549> exactly<00:01:59.790> how<00:02:00.360> stable<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.380> frame<00:02:01.590> rates

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
of exactly how stable the frame rates

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.859 
of exactly how stable the frame rates
are<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.640> by<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:02.969> way<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.240> same<00:02:03.630> for

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
are and this is by the way the same for

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.410 
are and this is by the way the same for
both<00:02:03.899> versions<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.950> would<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.909> point<00:02:06.210> out

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
both versions I would like to point out

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.169 
both versions I would like to point out
that<00:02:06.689> just<00:02:06.840> because<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.369> xbox<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.729> they've

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
that just because the xbox one they've

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.300 
that just because the xbox one they've
run<00:02:09.750> low<00:02:10.020> resolutions<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.979> doesn't

do drop a little bit there's also of
course<00:02:34.670> some<00:02:35.239> questions<00:02:35.750> regarding<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:36.440> how

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
course some questions regarding just how

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.610 
course some questions regarding just how
much<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.250> visual<00:02:37.459> parity<00:02:38.270> there<00:02:38.900> are<00:02:39.110> in

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
much of a visual parity there are in

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.199 
much of a visual parity there are in
other<00:02:39.800> words<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.340> going<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.730> be<00:02:40.819> exactly

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
other words is it going to be exactly

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.809 
other words is it going to be exactly
the<00:02:41.390> same<00:02:41.420> levels<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.989> anti-aliasing<00:02:42.819> texture

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650

both<00:02:48.650> xbox<00:02:49.190> one<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.459> ps4<00:02:49.970> was<00:02:50.390> said<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.690> have

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
both xbox one and ps4 was said to have

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.840 
both xbox one and ps4 was said to have
pretty<00:02:51.080> much<00:02:51.170> visual<00:02:51.560> parity<00:02:52.190> in<00:02:52.370> reality

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
pretty much visual parity in reality

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.550 
pretty much visual parity in reality
that's<00:02:53.030> not<00:02:53.269> quite<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.600> case<00:02:53.750> there<00:02:54.200> are<00:02:54.380> some

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
that's not quite the case there are some

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.100 
that's not quite the case there are some
definite<00:02:54.920> differences<00:02:55.670> so<00:02:56.480> you've<00:02:56.660> got<00:02:56.690> that

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
definite differences so you've got that

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.009 
definite differences so you've got that
and<00:02:57.700> finally<00:02:58.700> there's<00:02:59.060> other<00:02:59.330> questions<00:02:59.840> as

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
and finally there's other questions as

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.680 
and finally there's other questions as
well<00:03:00.260> for<00:03:00.709> example<00:03:01.100> how<00:03:01.340> did<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.420> team

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
well for example how did the team

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.120 
well for example how did the team
managed<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.410> do<00:03:03.590> this<00:03:03.830> it's<00:03:04.720> possible<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.890> one

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
managed to do this it's possible and one

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.390 
managed to do this it's possible and one
theory<00:03:07.459> is<00:03:07.610> that<00:03:07.790> they<00:03:08.180> are<00:03:08.350> utilizing

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
theory is that they are utilizing

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.550 
theory is that they are utilizing
deferred<00:03:10.400> rendering<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.319> addition<00:03:12.319> to<00:03:12.410> that

they<00:03:12.980> are<00:03:13.130> most<00:03:13.519> likely<00:03:13.819> using<00:03:14.209> medic<00:03:14.690> mega

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
they are most likely using medic mega

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
theory that I'm hearing banded about is

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.840 
theory that I'm hearing banded about is
that<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.019> game<00:03:21.230> really<00:03:21.709> isn't<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.400> tact

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
that the game really isn't that tact

the way when this was first announced
there<00:04:50.599> was<00:04:50.719> a<00:04:50.750> lot<00:04:51.020> of<00:04:51.050> discussion<00:04:51.770> that

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
there was a lot of discussion that

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.760 
there was a lot of discussion that
because<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.270> web<00:04:53.419> native<00:04:54.050> wasn't<00:04:54.469> included

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
because the web native wasn't included

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.969 
because the web native wasn't included
you<00:04:55.520> know<00:04:55.639> for<00:04:55.969> we<00:04:56.180> know<00:04:56.389> the<00:04:56.930> both<00:04:57.710> versions

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
you know for we know the both versions

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.800 
you know for we know the both versions
could<00:04:58.400> be<00:04:58.490> running<00:04:58.759> a<00:04:58.849> 600<00:04:59.449> pain<00:04:59.629> then

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
could be running a 600 pain then

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.930 
could be running a 600 pain then
upscaled<00:05:00.379> because<00:05:00.830> once<00:05:01.009> again<00:05:01.129> that<00:05:01.490> native

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940

course it was later added that the title

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.189 
course it was later added that the title

that it is 1080p and hopefully and more

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.700 
that it is 1080p and hopefully and more
to<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.180> point<00:06:05.300> at<00:06:05.810> least<00:06:06.020> in<00:06:06.199> my<00:06:06.379> honest

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
to the point at least in my honest

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.869 
to the point at least in my honest
opinion<00:06:07.129> it's<00:06:07.520> a<00:06:07.669> good<00:06:07.819> game<00:06:08.409> and<00:06:09.639> yeah<00:06:10.639> it's

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:10.879 
opinion it's a good game and yeah it's

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:13.119 
opinion it's a good game and yeah it's
very<00:06:11.120> easy<00:06:11.330> to<00:06:11.659> get<00:06:11.779> really<00:06:12.110> caught<00:06:12.349> up<00:06:12.379> in<00:06:12.830> the

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:13.129 
very easy to get really caught up in the

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:15.339 
very easy to get really caught up in the
resolution<00:06:13.849> and<00:06:14.029> saying<00:06:14.240> it's<00:06:14.900> not<00:06:15.110> running

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349 
resolution and saying it's not running

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.899 
resolution and saying it's not running
1080p<00:06:16.069> 60<00:06:16.819> or<00:06:16.940> whatever<00:06:17.360> and<00:06:18.610> then<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:19.789> game

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
1080p 60 or whatever and then the game

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:21.640 
1080p 60 or whatever and then the game
drops<00:06:20.360> and<00:06:20.629> it's<00:06:20.750> like<00:06:20.900> well<00:06:21.080> it's<00:06:21.289> the<00:06:21.469> game

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
drops and it's like well it's the game

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.860 
drops and it's like well it's the game
in<00:06:21.889> good<00:06:22.219> because<00:06:22.550> ultimately<00:06:22.849> can<00:06:23.479> run<00:06:23.690> at

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
in good because ultimately can run at

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.129 
in good because ultimately can run at
500<00:06:24.529> frames<00:06:24.710> a<00:06:24.919> second<00:06:25.400> and<00:06:25.550> 1<00:06:26.120> million<00:06:26.539> p<00:06:26.810> but

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
500 frames a second and 1 million p but

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.610 
500 frames a second and 1 million p but
