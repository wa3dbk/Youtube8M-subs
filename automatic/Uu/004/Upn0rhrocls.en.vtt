at<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.649> side<00:02:07.920> that's<00:02:08.459> actually<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.910> button<00:02:09.330> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
at the side that's actually a button to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.770 
at the side that's actually a button to
dim<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.319> light<00:02:10.619> up<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.979> display<00:02:11.420> but<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
dim and light up the display but it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.580 
dim and light up the display but it
looks

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
looks

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.960 
looks
if<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:13.890> an<00:02:14.010> ordinary<00:02:14.400> watch<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.849> for

someone who doesn't know too much about
smart<00:02:16.590> watches<00:02:17.150> they<00:02:18.150> would<00:02:18.300> honestly<00:02:18.420> think

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
smart watches they would honestly think

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.100 
smart watches they would honestly think
your<00:02:19.080> watch<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:20.129> ordinary<00:02:21.090> watch<00:02:21.450> until<00:02:21.840> you

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
kind of power it on so moving beyond the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.479 
kind of power it on so moving beyond the
watch<00:02:24.900> you'll<00:02:25.170> actually<00:02:25.349> find<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:26.220> power

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489
