00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.810> there's<00:00:00.960> only<00:00:01.110> one<00:00:01.439> question<00:00:01.709> that

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
I think there's only one question that

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.949 
I think there's only one question that
can<00:00:02.250> be<00:00:02.399> asked<00:00:02.760> as<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.000> game<00:00:03.179> comes<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.689> an<00:00:03.810> end

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
can be asked as the game comes to an end

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.260 
can be asked as the game comes to an end
here<00:00:04.259> there's<00:00:04.770> about<00:00:05.009> 30<00:00:05.520> seconds<00:00:05.940> left<00:00:06.120> until

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
here there's about 30 seconds left until

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.179 
here there's about 30 seconds left until
we<00:00:06.540> hit<00:00:06.690> stoppage<00:00:07.170> time<00:00:07.200> at<00:00:07.620> six<00:00:07.919> nil<00:00:08.160> to

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
we hit stoppage time at six nil to

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.100 
we hit stoppage time at six nil to
Liverpool<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.910> think<00:00:09.540> there's<00:00:09.690> only<00:00:09.870> one

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
Liverpool I think there's only one

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.020 
Liverpool I think there's only one
question<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.530> can<00:00:10.769> be<00:00:10.800> asked<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.820> is

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
question that can be asked and that is

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.049 
question that can be asked and that is
can<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.599> get<00:00:12.780> away<00:00:13.019> with<00:00:13.410> selling<00:00:13.799> Luis<00:00:14.580> Suarez

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
consistency and we have actually seen a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.080 
consistency and we have actually seen a
very<00:01:45.270> good<00:01:45.750> consistency<00:01:46.560> when<00:01:47.189> Suarez<00:01:47.670> has

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
very good consistency when Suarez has

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.270 
very good consistency when Suarez has
been<00:01:48.360> out<00:01:48.540> now<00:01:49.409> he<00:01:49.470> hasn't<00:01:49.860> been<00:01:49.920> out<00:01:49.979> much

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
been out now he hasn't been out much

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.219 
been out now he hasn't been out much
this<00:01:50.520> season<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:51.210> i'm<00:01:51.329> telling<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.720> i<00:01:51.869> think

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
this season but i'm telling you i think

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.649 
this season but i'm telling you i think
if<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.439> went<00:01:52.740> into<00:01:52.950> next<00:01:53.250> season<00:01:53.490> let's<00:01:54.270> say<00:01:54.420> in
