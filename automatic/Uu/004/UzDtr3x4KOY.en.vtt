00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.280
 hello beautiful welcome to del carmen 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.690
 my name is iris and they are 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.820
 seeing on screen what we are going to 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.029
 need to make these stickers 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.390
 home that is the second option what 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:30.080
 come is a piece of tetra brik of milk 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.390
 it can be juice and a shine a glaze 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.750
 transparent what they have to do is 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.780
 more or less measure the size of your nail or 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.870
 make it a little bit bigger and do 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.290
 as they see on the screen is that figure in 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.320
 nail shape with brightness this is going to 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.839
 let it dry and now we can start 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.790
 create the design here in this I am 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.100
 showing how easy it is to make a heart 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.370
 just making two points and joining them in 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.290
 the center we are going to make a design of 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.370
 little hearts ideal for this time of 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.370
 Valentine's Day 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.770
 I made this design in a white tone 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.810
 I am using as the previous one a 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.660
 brush for nail are but they can 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.660
 do with a toothpick and common enamel 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.290
 here I am using a permanent marker 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.480
 to make the silhouette of a palm tree 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.720
 also it is that you tere 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.240
 the designs are going to be inventing 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.560
 taste and need I am 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.560
 showing different designs 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.720
 in this memory how a rose is made 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.600
 with two tones one is white and the other 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.550
 color from the rose the color you want 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.550
 who want it to be in the rose 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.560
 All these designs can be done in 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.819
 the colors that you want can 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.130
 make one for each nail can do the 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.340
 same design on all nails what yes 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.069
 remember that this has to be left 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.260
 dry and then up on the design 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.920
 they have to apply a coat of enamel 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.170
 either brightness or it can be in colors 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.709
 the color that you want in the background 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.019
 always think that the design that is going 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.170
 to see is going to be the first one that you 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.170
 make 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.860
 Y 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.200
 yes 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.340
 here we see then the different funds 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.400
 that always apply if they have to 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.070
 apply another layer on the design as well 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.190
 while thicker than the sticker partner 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.900
 I say it from experience there is much more 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.270
 easy to take it off is not going to 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.940
 break even with the grabÃ© system 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.860
 with the sponge because to me what I 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.560
 annoyed I love how is this 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.860
 I design with the sponge but it bothers me 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.080
 the issue of messing up a bit and if well 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.510
 There are products now for easy removal 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.660
 with this we are going to save the subject of 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.850
 that we dirty our fingers because 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.780
 we're just going to cut out the sticker and 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.780
 that is all 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.380
 i 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.709
 Y 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.709
 i 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.290
 Y 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.540
 Y 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.700
 attentive history the designs that I made 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.760
 so that they see not all will be well 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.800
 I was just practicing together 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.210
 you do not know to what extent I went 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.340
 they record making the designs I was recording 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.050
 and I got the same surprise from you 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.750
 that some were good and others more or 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.180
 less in some case some got up 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.060
 but good is a matter of practice is the 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.420
 first or the second time I do this and 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.490
 I think it's not very good to have 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.220
 stickers prepared when one wants 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.170
 make a quick manicure with the design 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.050
 that we did with peace of mind 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.670
 and we leave them ready for 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.290
 use 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:38.500
 next I show what I give them 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:41.170
 said the sticker or the applique has a 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.760
 side one right and one side upside down in 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.710
 the photos below I'm going to 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.420
 show even I'm also going to 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.670
 show the ones that I liked the most and 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.640
 that I liked the least I also wanted 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.060
 share a little picture I do not know if you guys 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.720
 they watched the video 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.970
 says a homemade glaze with shadows but 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.680
 away the link both on screen and in 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.690
 Little information if you are interested 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.300
 go to see it is with a glaze 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.910
 transparent and shadow I came up with the 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.350
 idea to go adding enamels while 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.800
 I tell them I'm showing you the photos 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.990
 and so they were soon as it was 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.790
 changing as always, I also say 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.230
 I hope these ideas serve you 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.080
 so that wide 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.750
 I share both my successes and my 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.810
 mistakes so that you can from there 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:29.810
 this already have a base and do their 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.720
 own experiences I leave a kiss 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.800
 huge huge and I hope you in the next 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.800
 video dance
