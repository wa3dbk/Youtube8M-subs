00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.490
 the models are small, not much 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.790
 people who have spider a lot of noise and is 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.250
 it has small everything we have six modules 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.040
 that we've been six or seven years and have 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.450
 lost the account then in some 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.420
 conditions a bit harsh hard and a lot 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.060
 moisture low light of natural 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.840
 and those little things, that urgently 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.840
 we need 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.189
 Oh 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.730

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.410
 yes 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.160

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.160
 here 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.720
 that this 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.550
 and change from before and now I think this 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.500
 what we are doing today is going to create a 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.080
 link between us and I think we're going 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.959
 to proceed we will say a part of the 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.240
 budget item we want it for 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.240
 our school and we want it already 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.849
 now 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.910
 we have to come here many times 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.260
 these children I'm really sorry but 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.750
 you have to come a service from the square 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.910
 here that you see the town hall to give 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.560
 classes even in a chair in about 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.139
 banks here if they're not going to do anything to us 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.240
 not because we had it 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.249
 and then they did but if not, what 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.810
 they will do if you want there still not 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:27.249
 they do not do anything good that you think 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.219
 response from the people we've had 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:32.229
 this afternoon because the truth is that I do not know 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.310
 that is, if we wait more or less 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.570
 the truth yes I think it has been very 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.870
 important that as you said before the 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:44.449
 to the sale of the underworld that I think this 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.260
 is the beginning and I hope that good 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.020
 yes we have to keep giving war 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.460
 we will continue giving and that really 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.780
 let's hope they make us a new building 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.850
 that we have many and many years 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.770
 waiting for everyone so much 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.479
 teachers as students as parents and 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.370
 mothers and we deserve 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.460
 in the bizkotxalde school a building 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.460

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.650

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.840
