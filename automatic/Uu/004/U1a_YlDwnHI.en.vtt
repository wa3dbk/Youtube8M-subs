00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
longer and I'll just show you some of

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.409 
longer and I'll just show you some of
the<00:00:24.000> steps<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.800> when<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.919> play<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.250> game<00:00:26.419> so

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
the steps and when you play the game so

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.479 
the steps and when you play the game so
the<00:00:27.750> game<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.110> two-player<00:00:28.649> game<00:00:28.739> and<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
the game is a two-player game and the

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.540 
the game is a two-player game and the
players<00:00:29.730> take<00:00:29.970> turns<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.739> in<00:00:31.739> each<00:00:32.009> turn<00:00:32.369> you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
players take turns and in each turn you

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.200 
players take turns and in each turn you
can<00:00:32.910> basically<00:00:33.649> draw<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:35.130> resource<00:00:35.610> card<00:00:35.970> you

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
can basically draw one resource card you

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.620 
can basically draw one resource card you
can<00:00:36.420> drop<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.960> resource<00:00:37.410> card<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.160> can

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
can drop one resource card and you can

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.170 
can drop one resource card and you can
craft<00:00:39.630> one<00:00:39.930> item<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.440> drop<00:00:40.739> one<00:00:40.980> crafted<00:00:41.880> item

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
craft one item and drop one crafted item

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.840 
craft one item and drop one crafted item
the<00:00:43.140> reason<00:00:43.470> you'd<00:00:43.650> want<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.010> drop<00:00:44.190> cards<00:00:44.610> is

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the reason you'd want to drop cards is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.300 
the reason you'd want to drop cards is
because<00:00:45.020> you're<00:00:46.020> limited<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.830> basically

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
because you're limited to basically

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.570 
because you're limited to basically
seven<00:00:47.880> crafting<00:00:48.360> items<00:00:48.630> and<00:00:49.160> seven<00:00:50.160> resource

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
seven crafting items and seven resource

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.270 
seven crafting items and seven resource
items<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.840> can't<00:00:52.290> really<00:00:52.560> just<00:00:52.860> hold<00:00:53.100> on

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
items so you can't really just hold on

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.580 
items so you can't really just hold on
to<00:00:53.490> all<00:00:53.700> the<00:00:53.850> resources<00:00:54.210> or<00:00:54.960> else<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.320> game

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
to all the resources or else the game

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.180 
to all the resources or else the game
won't<00:00:55.740> be<00:00:55.860> able<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> function<00:00:57.260> so<00:00:58.260> let's<00:00:58.620> say<00:00:58.770> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
won't be able to function so let's say I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.140 
won't be able to function so let's say I
started<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.060> game<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.750> cave<00:01:01.200> cards<00:01:01.650> and<00:01:02.150> the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
started the game the cave cards and the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.119 
started the game the cave cards and the
outside<00:01:03.630> cards<00:01:04.079> will<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.320> flipped<00:01:04.589> over<00:01:04.769> so

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
outside cards will be flipped over so

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.980 
outside cards will be flipped over so
you<00:01:05.250> don't<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:06.030> are<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
you don't know what they are and the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.840 
you don't know what they are and the
crafting<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.710> Achievement<00:01:08.220> parts<00:01:08.490> are<00:01:08.640> set

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
crafting and Achievement parts are set

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
crafting and Achievement parts are set
aside<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.960> oh<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.450> could<00:01:15.659> tell<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.140> you're

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
aside so oh and you could tell if you're

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.460 
aside so oh and you could tell if you're
out<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:17.190> it's<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.580> cave<00:01:17.820> card<00:01:18.150> or<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.470> outside

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
out if it's a cave card or a outside

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.500 
out if it's a cave card or a outside
card<00:01:19.830> by<00:01:20.010> looking<00:01:20.400> at<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.700> background<00:01:20.909> so

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
card by looking at the background so

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.969 
card by looking at the background so

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
like if you look here you could tell

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.399 
like if you look here you could tell
clearly<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:24.060> outside<00:01:26.510> the<00:01:27.510> only<00:01:27.810> cards<00:01:28.200> that

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
clearly it's outside the only cards that

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.030 
clearly it's outside the only cards that
are<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.770> both<00:01:29.070> ducks<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:30.530> creepers<00:01:31.530> there<00:01:31.950> are

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
are in both ducks are creepers there are

two creepers there's one creeper outside

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.800 
two creepers there's one creeper outside
one<00:01:34.320> creeper<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> cave<00:01:35.370> and<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.540> for

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
one creeper in the cave and this is for

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.920 
one creeper in the cave and this is for
gameplay<00:01:37.760> like<00:01:38.760> balancing<00:01:39.299> issues<00:01:39.659> and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
gameplay like balancing issues and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.740 
gameplay like balancing issues and
there's<00:01:40.710> also<00:01:40.940> cobblestone<00:01:41.940> found<00:01:42.450> both

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
there's also cobblestone found both

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.130 
there's also cobblestone found both
outside<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> cave<00:01:44.600> some<00:01:45.600> resources

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
outside and in the cave some resources

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.219 
outside and in the cave some resources
are<00:01:46.470> found<00:01:46.860> more<00:01:47.159> often<00:01:47.400> like<00:01:48.030> wood<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:49.080> is

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
are found more often like wood what is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.080 
are found more often like wood what is
pretty<00:01:49.500> common<00:01:50.010> and<00:01:50.130> that's<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
pretty common and that's because it's a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.039 
pretty common and that's because it's a
really<00:01:51.720> vital<00:01:51.930> resource<00:01:53.299> so<00:01:54.299> let's<00:01:54.630> say<00:01:54.810> it

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
really vital resource so let's say it

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.480 
really vital resource so let's say it
was<00:01:55.170> my<00:01:55.380> turn

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
was my turn

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.020 
was my turn
oh<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:58.020> could<00:01:58.619> choose<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.220> draw<00:01:59.460> from<00:01:59.790> either

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
oh I could choose to draw from either

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.760 
oh I could choose to draw from either
deck<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.630> doesn't<00:02:00.930> really<00:02:01.049> matter<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.740> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
deck it doesn't really matter but I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.570 
deck it doesn't really matter but I
could<00:02:02.040> only<00:02:02.189> pick<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.820> one<00:02:03.090> resource<00:02:03.600> card<00:02:04.580> so

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
could only pick up one resource card so

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.789 
could only pick up one resource card so
let's<00:02:05.880> say<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> pick<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.840> card<00:02:07.110> from<00:02:07.320> outside

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
let's say I pick up a card from outside

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.270 
let's say I pick up a card from outside
it's<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.729> wood<00:02:09.030> card<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.470> allows<00:02:10.830> me<00:02:11.099> to

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
it's a wood card so that allows me to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.690 
it's a wood card so that allows me to
craft<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> crafting<00:02:12.420> table<00:02:12.950> once<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.129> make<00:02:14.670> a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
craft the crafting table once I make a

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.119 
craft the crafting table once I make a
crafting<00:02:15.239> table<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.870> could<00:02:16.290> make<00:02:16.500> any<00:02:16.799> other

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
crafting table I could make any other

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.259 
crafting table I could make any other
crafting<00:02:17.669> item<00:02:17.999> once<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.689> have<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.079> resources

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
crafting item once I have the resources

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.200 
crafting item once I have the resources
but<00:02:21.269> even<00:02:21.599> if<00:02:21.719> you<00:02:21.840> don't
