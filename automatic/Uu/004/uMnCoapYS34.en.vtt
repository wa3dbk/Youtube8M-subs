00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.450
 with friends from youtube here a gamer 98 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.950
 bringing you this new video in this 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.680
 new video I bring you what is the 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.369
 review of a seed for what would be 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.869
 the version of minecraft 0.12 point 1 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.000
 this this seed I think will continue 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.610
 running in all the buts because 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.189
 they want to try then here we go 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.090
 such as the seed is the seeds 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.850
 it is final all in capital letters 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.160
 final 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.809
 as you can see on the screen and then 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.560
 obviously the world has to be in 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:49.210
 the infinite so that it can be generated 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.629
 then what is in this seed 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.079
 what is a village and which include the 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:59.750
 blacksmith's house and then there is a union 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.860
 below or is jobs communicated 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.870
 then let's hope that it loads the world 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.330
 as they come we appeared front of the 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.580
 village then well as you see it has 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.760
 crops has what is the house of the 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.060
 blacksmith who is there the background 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.410
 this is all that a village has 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.250
 so then let's see what it is that 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.370
 has the blacksmith's house 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.350
 and there I say that they forgive me the move but 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.530
 I still do not get used to the new ones 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.340
 controls that are not complicated but 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.180
 well 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.080
 I think we get used to the old 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.940
 then how do you see there 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.100
 you have to break the chest because 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.620
 excel in creative as you see you have two 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.690
 helmets of iron a few pants three 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.330
 bags of dyes and two apples that 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.260
 you can go with the rise in your rival to 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.520
 just start then it's pretty good 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.259
 so 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.310
 Now I'm going to teach you to answer the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:05.219
 trunk that is the structure of this in 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.099
 the font with here in the bottom box 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.910
 right to the left that we have to 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.739
 break in the one below is that of the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.440
 left and we have to break in which 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.200
 is down or in that same then you 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.540
 we give up until we see what 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.390
 which is why the blocks that are in the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.150
 Union 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.340
 then we break and break like a vein and 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.010
 we arrived 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.099
 we come to some stairs 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.650
 What I could not find was the 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:41.599
 portal of the entity because it can be very 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.599
 big this but what I did find but 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:48.319
 I did not want to show it in the video 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:51.680
 that there are many spanair there are I think 21 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.560
 of zombies and the other of skeletons that 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.650
 Well, if you do it in survival and you like it 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.540
 make them the mobile traps pauner and 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.319
 all that because the truth is quite 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.500
 great then this the seed goes to 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.840
 be on the screen then, well, it's going to 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.940
 be in the description so that you 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.790
 nothing else the cope nor the and sticks in the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.069
 shoemaker then it would be all for 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.640
 today's video do not forget to like 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.660
 to subscribe 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.880
 and if there is another point other content 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.450
 interesting about this version because it 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.450
 I will bring them
