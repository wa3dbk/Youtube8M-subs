00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.660 

in<00:00:10.059> this<00:00:10.269> video<00:00:10.540> I<00:00:11.049> want<00:00:11.500> to<00:00:11.679> introduce<00:00:11.950> you<00:00:12.339> to

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
in this video I want to introduce you to

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.320 
in this video I want to introduce you to
the<00:00:12.940> concept<00:00:13.120> of<00:00:13.690> tags<00:00:14.250> which<00:00:15.250> can<00:00:15.490> save<00:00:15.910> you

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
the concept of tags which can save you

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.679 
the concept of tags which can save you
considerable<00:00:16.810> amount<00:00:17.620> of<00:00:17.680> time<00:00:18.029> when<00:00:19.029> coding

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
considerable amount of time when coding

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.599 
considerable amount of time when coding
so<00:00:20.849> for<00:00:21.849> example<00:00:21.970> in<00:00:22.570> this<00:00:22.810> case<00:00:23.140> we<00:00:23.710> have<00:00:23.980> two

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:24.609 
so for example in this case we have two

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.640 
so for example in this case we have two
collision<00:00:26.880> behaviors<00:00:27.880> here<00:00:28.449> with<00:00:29.259> there's<00:00:29.560> a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
collision behaviors here with there's a

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.640 
collision behaviors here with there's a
left<00:00:29.920> wall<00:00:30.220> and<00:00:30.519> the<00:00:30.820> right<00:00:31.210> wall<00:00:31.539> so<00:00:32.290> we<00:00:32.470> can

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
left wall and the right wall so we can

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.680 
left wall and the right wall so we can
cut<00:00:32.980> this<00:00:33.250> there's<00:00:33.580> a<00:00:33.640> way<00:00:33.760> to<00:00:33.790> cut<00:00:34.210> this<00:00:34.420> in

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
cut this there's a way to cut this in

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.750 
cut this there's a way to cut this in
half<00:00:34.719> because<00:00:35.079> if<00:00:35.590> you<00:00:35.710> look<00:00:35.890> here<00:00:36.070> this<00:00:36.250> actor

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
half because if you look here this actor

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.880 
half because if you look here this actor
of<00:00:36.969> type<00:00:37.270> you<00:00:37.840> know<00:00:37.960> want<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.379> ship<00:00:38.649> to

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
of type you know want the ship to

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.819 
of type you know want the ship to
balance<00:00:39.430> when<00:00:39.579> when<00:00:40.210> I'm<00:00:41.050> colliding<00:00:41.710> with

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
balance when when I'm colliding with

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.090 
balance when when I'm colliding with
actor<00:00:42.309> of<00:00:42.460> type<00:00:43.110> left<00:00:44.110> wall<00:00:44.410> but<00:00:44.710> there's<00:00:44.890> also

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
actor of type left wall but there's also

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.760 
actor of type left wall but there's also
another<00:00:45.340> option<00:00:46.000> here<00:00:46.270> we<00:00:46.899> can<00:00:47.050> sue<00:00:47.260> you<00:00:47.530> know

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
another option here we can sue you know

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.630 
another option here we can sue you know
with<00:00:48.309> actor<00:00:48.850> of<00:00:49.030> with<00:00:49.899> tag<00:00:50.440> but<00:00:51.190> right<00:00:51.370> now<00:00:51.579> we

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
with actor of with tag but right now we

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.170 
with actor of with tag but right now we
don't<00:00:51.879> have<00:00:52.000> any<00:00:52.239> tags<00:00:52.629> in<00:00:52.989> here<00:00:53.350> so<00:00:53.680> if<00:00:53.980> we<00:00:54.910> go

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
don't have any tags in here so if we go

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.990 
don't have any tags in here so if we go
ahead<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:55.449> create<00:00:55.989> some<00:00:56.350> tags<00:00:56.770> we<00:00:57.219> can<00:00:57.430> cut

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
ahead and create some tags we can cut

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.389 
ahead and create some tags we can cut
this<00:00:58.180> down<00:00:58.420> by<00:00:58.629> 50%<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.590> amount<00:00:59.890> of<00:00:59.980> coding

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
this down by 50% the amount of coding

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.890 
this down by 50% the amount of coding
here<00:01:00.640> so<00:01:01.390> how<00:01:01.989> do<00:01:02.050> you<00:01:02.199> create<00:01:02.350> a<00:01:02.500> tag<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.870> go

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
here so how do you create a tag you go

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.420 
here so how do you create a tag you go
unto<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:06.060> actors<00:01:07.060> section<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:08.280> under<00:01:09.280> your

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
unto the actors section and under your

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.760 
unto the actors section and under your
actors<00:01:09.820> you<00:01:09.940> right<00:01:10.150> now<00:01:10.330> you<00:01:10.360> should<00:01:10.720> have

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
actors you right now you should have

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.170 
actors you right now you should have
these<00:01:11.770> three<00:01:12.130> actors<00:01:12.550> if<00:01:12.910> you've<00:01:13.060> been

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
these three actors if you've been

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.210 
these three actors if you've been
following<00:01:13.240> along<00:01:13.750> player<00:01:14.380> ship<00:01:14.770> left<00:01:14.980> wall

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
following along player ship left wall

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.130 
following along player ship left wall
right<00:01:15.490> wall<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.090> then<00:01:16.660> you<00:01:16.810> want<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.080> click

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
right wall and then you want to click

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.830 
right wall and then you want to click
here<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.740> add<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.890> new<00:01:18.070> tag<00:01:18.760> so<00:01:19.210> let's<00:01:19.420> just<00:01:19.600> call

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
here to add a new tag so let's just call

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.950 
here to add a new tag so let's just call
this<00:01:20.050> up<00:01:20.350> walls<00:01:22.560> okay<00:01:24.570> comate<00:01:25.570> could<00:01:25.900> be

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
this up walls okay comate could be

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.420 
this up walls okay comate could be
whatever<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.320> want<00:01:26.650> just<00:01:26.740> as<00:01:27.010> long<00:01:27.040> as<00:01:27.190> you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
whatever you want just as long as you

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.400 
whatever you want just as long as you
know<00:01:27.670> how<00:01:28.270> you're<00:01:28.450> going<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:28.660> group<00:01:28.870> so<00:01:29.080> just

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
know how you're going to group so just

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.710 
know how you're going to group so just
kind<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.740> it's<00:01:29.890> like<00:01:29.980> a<00:01:30.010> keyword<00:01:30.370> that<00:01:30.910> allows

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
kind of it's like a keyword that allows

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.010 
kind of it's like a keyword that allows
you<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:31.960> group<00:01:32.350> your<00:01:33.210> tags<00:01:34.210> by<00:01:35.110> your<00:01:36.180> actors<00:01:37.180> by

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
you to group your tags by your actors by

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.320 
you to group your tags by your actors by
tags<00:01:38.650> make<00:01:39.280> some<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.670> programming<00:01:40.090> easier

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
tags make some of the programming easier

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.570 
tags make some of the programming easier
if<00:01:40.600> there's<00:01:40.840> several<00:01:41.050> types<00:01:41.440> alright<00:01:42.340> so<00:01:42.460> then

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
if there's several types alright so then

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.150 
if there's several types alright so then
we're<00:01:42.670> going<00:01:42.760> to<00:01:42.850> just<00:01:42.970> take<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.270> left<00:01:43.510> wall

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
we're going to just take the left wall

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.800 
we're going to just take the left wall
take<00:01:45.160> it<00:01:45.310> click<00:01:45.550> it<00:01:45.580> drag<00:01:45.730> it<00:01:46.000> right<00:01:46.240> on<00:01:46.540> top

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
take it click it drag it right on top

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.540 
take it click it drag it right on top
there<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:47.350> notice<00:01:47.620> it<00:01:47.740> comes<00:01:48.040> right<00:01:48.280> there

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
there and notice it comes right there

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.750 
there and notice it comes right there
also<00:01:49.000> so<00:01:49.330> then<00:01:49.510> take<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.440> one<00:01:50.740> drag<00:01:51.370> it<00:01:51.520> drop

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
also so then take that one drag it drop

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.520 
also so then take that one drag it drop
it<00:01:51.910> right<00:01:52.030> on<00:01:52.180> top<00:01:52.390> of<00:01:52.420> walls<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:52.960> there<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:53.470> is

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
it right on top of walls and there it is

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it right on top of walls and there it is
so<00:01:53.800> not<00:01:53.950> under<00:01:54.400> wall<00:01:54.700> my<00:01:55.090> wall<00:01:55.390> tag<00:01:56.100> I've<00:01:57.100> got

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
so not under wall my wall tag I've got

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.160 
so not under wall my wall tag I've got
these<00:01:58.270> two<00:01:58.920> actors<00:01:59.920> okay<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:01.480> now<00:02:01.750> if<00:02:02.020> I<00:02:02.140> go

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
these two actors okay so now if I go

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.920 
these two actors okay so now if I go
back<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.830> player<00:02:03.070> ship<00:02:03.520> actor<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.450> program

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
back to the player ship actor to program

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.450 
back to the player ship actor to program
that<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.200> see<00:02:05.380> we<00:02:05.500> have<00:02:05.650> all<00:02:05.830> our<00:02:05.860> stuff<00:02:06.310> here

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
that you see we have all our stuff here

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.060 
that you see we have all our stuff here
our<00:02:06.610> notes<00:02:06.820> so<00:02:07.690> instead<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.369> having<00:02:10.800> two<00:02:11.800> of

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
our notes so instead of having two of

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.380 
our notes so instead of having two of
these<00:02:12.250> collision<00:02:13.000> behaviors<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.630> can<00:02:13.840> say

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
these collision behaviors I can say

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.750 
these collision behaviors I can say
actor<00:02:16.390> with<00:02:16.810> tag<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.740> then<00:02:17.950> now<00:02:18.250> click<00:02:18.730> here

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
actor with tag and then now click here

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.640 
actor with tag and then now click here
and<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.240> notice<00:02:19.540> there's<00:02:19.720> walls<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.500> now
