00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.220
 I do not like to sit still and always 

00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:04.630
 try something new 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.490
 if you decide with me 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.530
 experiment then you need a game and 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.179
 preferably original so go 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.369
 to shops proud gamma where you are waiting 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:16.019
 discounts and promotions on different games link to 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.019
 the store you will find in the description of the video 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.750
 Hello everyone, I called and how am I 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.690

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.450
 and neko 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.980
 and this is another edition of easter eggs gta 5 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.970
 so today i will show you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.910
 internet cafe tva or tv this dog 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.220
 the internet club was still gta 4 even in gta 3 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.140
 and in gta 3 there was Easter eggs there on 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.510
 monitors had an image from gta 2 gt1 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.850
 further travels in los santos ya 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.550
 I found this funny Mexican in 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.860
 sombrero and he says a lot of all 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.320
 flexibility for example what he would do 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.230
 crocs vulgar things to any person 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.330
 which is associated with cinema and know 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.059
 michael landing just yet due to the 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.640
 the cinema I the old fashioned hit him 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.440
 and sent deep to whom also 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.840
 rockstar never ceases to please their 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.990
 vulgar easter for example this 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.540
 the building is called 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.550
 strangely called really don't know 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.350
 it may be a coincidence may be 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.840
 so that's really intended 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.150
 after that I went to the rich 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.000
 areas and even here could not detect 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.490
 feyspalm cosmetic your slept in it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.010
 common internet memes are understandable 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.690
 The thing is that rockstar is fucked up and continues 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.070
 they have a lot of jokes 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.920
 like jokes 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.570
 and then we have the most juicy Easter eggs from 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.090
 for which I by the way began to do this 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.760
 issue here i could find on dachshund 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.830
 background sticker gender position strip club 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.690
 which is in and networked you could 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.000
 see gta wai city respectively and 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.550
 The first acquaintance with this club was in 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.950
 one of the missions when we 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.660
 for mercedes cortes in this very club 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.970
 by the way then tommy versetti could buy 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.070
 him and receive income from him and no doubt 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.230
 accordingly look at the whole show a 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.420
 this easter egg still all refers 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.060
 on wai city this manufacturing company 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.690
 ice cream you could and meet wai 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.870
 City 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.000
 firstly the motto you always remember 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.280
 his first time again this went 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.900
 girls 5 same these cherries understandable to that 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.720
 hint yes it is rockstar 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.610
 they use it constantly and this one 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.010
 poster in the subway is not the only 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.440
 poster of the skull lane second same poster 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.690

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.140
 in the center is in the shop straight skull 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.210
 pore on this perhaps all and I understood one 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.280
 it’s better not to dare everyone because 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.130
 time when i go into gta5 i find 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.290
 some new little reference 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.150
 Easter eggs or and even buy this little thing 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.340
 the game is literally crammed with various 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.470
 content and here you can not predict here 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.750
 I ran and found Easter eggs 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.510
 therefore, there will still be a release 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.590
 may be something else so 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.090
