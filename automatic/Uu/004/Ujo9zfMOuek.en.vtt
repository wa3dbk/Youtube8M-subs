00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
remove the valves you know pop the tire

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.319 
remove the valves you know pop the tire
you<00:01:24.200> know<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:24.590> seals<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:25.729> know<00:01:25.850> inflate<00:01:26.180> it

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
you know so it seals you know inflate it

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.870 
you know so it seals you know inflate it
so<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.570> pops<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.200> once<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.100> sealed<00:01:28.310> then<00:01:28.759> you

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
so it pops and once it's sealed then you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.840 
so it pops and once it's sealed then you
can<00:01:29.000> remove<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.420> valve<00:01:29.570> stem<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:31.250> insert<00:01:31.670> the

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
can remove the valve stem and insert the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.969 
can remove the valve stem and insert the
dynabeads<00:01:32.450> for<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.899> size<00:01:33.079> tire<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.590> think<00:01:33.860> you

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
dynabeads for the size tire I think you

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:41.170

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
need to lounge bag for up to 130 to 200

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.179 
need to lounge bag for up to 130 to 200
millimeter<00:01:41.540> tire<00:01:41.810> over<00:01:42.259> 200<00:01:42.740> millimeter<00:01:43.070> I

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
shift rod linkage right there hooks into

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:05.619 
shift rod linkage right there hooks into
right<00:04:04.849> there<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.090> that<00:04:05.180> goes<00:04:05.329> into<00:04:05.509> the

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
right there and that goes into the

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.289 
right there and that goes into the

like inside if you look at my older

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.240 
like inside if you look at my older
videos<00:04:17.539> you'll<00:04:17.659> see<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.870> star<00:04:18.079> cluster<00:04:18.440> and

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
videos you'll see the star cluster and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.710 
videos you'll see the star cluster and
it<00:04:19.459> looks<00:04:19.669> like<00:04:19.789> everything<00:04:20.239> else<00:04:20.299> looks<00:04:20.479> fine

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
it looks like everything else looks fine

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.860 
it looks like everything else looks fine
and<00:04:21.759> if<00:04:22.759> it<00:04:22.909> ain't<00:04:23.060> broke<00:04:23.300> it's<00:04:23.509> broke<00:04:23.570> now

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
and if it ain't broke it's broke now

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.600 
and if it ain't broke it's broke now
alright<00:04:24.259> it's<00:04:24.680> all<00:04:24.830> greased<00:04:25.159> up<00:04:25.310> here<00:04:25.490> with

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
alright it's all greased up here with

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.330 
alright it's all greased up here with
motor<00:04:25.820> oil<00:04:26.320> anyway<00:04:27.320> but<00:04:27.770> apparently<00:04:28.190> this

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
motor oil anyway but apparently this

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.719 
motor oil anyway but apparently this
spring<00:04:28.729> right<00:04:28.880> here<00:04:28.940> where<00:04:29.599> my<00:04:29.719> thumb<00:04:29.750> is<00:04:30.139> and

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
spring right here where my thumb is and

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.159 
spring right here where my thumb is and
I<00:04:31.729> think<00:04:31.789> right<00:04:32.120> here<00:04:32.150> this<00:04:32.419> rivet<00:04:32.870> I<00:04:32.960> think

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
I think right here this rivet I think

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.690 
I think right here this rivet I think
they<00:04:33.260> were<00:04:33.320> both<00:04:33.409> worn<00:04:33.860> if<00:04:34.010> you<00:04:34.099> look<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:34.460> can

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
they were both worn if you look you can

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.800 
they were both worn if you look you can
somewhere<00:04:35.090> but<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.810> spring<00:04:36.200> wasn't<00:04:37.810> going

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
somewhere but the spring wasn't going

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.570 
somewhere but the spring wasn't going
back<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:39.170> positioners<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.400> wasn't

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
back to positioners and it wasn't

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.000 
back to positioners and it wasn't
allowing<00:04:41.090> me<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.300> upshift<00:04:41.590> down<00:04:42.590> ship<00:04:42.830> was

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
allowing me to upshift down ship was

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.650 
allowing me to upshift down ship was
fine<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:43.250> replacing<00:04:44.000> with<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:44.150> new<00:04:44.300> one<00:04:44.420> you<00:04:44.540> I

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040 
there's better ways to do it but my

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.189 
there's better ways to do it but my
point<00:06:46.850> is<00:06:47.030> if<00:06:47.240> you<00:06:47.330> have<00:06:47.420> some<00:06:47.600> kind<00:06:47.750> of<00:06:47.780> app<00:06:47.870> to

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
point is if you have some kind of app to

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.420 
point is if you have some kind of app to
with<00:06:48.379> tolls<00:06:48.620> and<00:06:48.770> that<00:06:48.889> you<00:06:48.979> can<00:06:49.129> figure<00:06:49.310> this

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
with tolls and that you can figure this

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.879 
with tolls and that you can figure this
stuff<00:06:49.550> out<00:06:49.819> and<00:06:50.029> by<00:06:51.020> doing<00:06:51.259> it<00:06:51.409> you<00:06:51.529> learn<00:06:51.650> more

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 
stuff out and by doing it you learn more

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.339 
stuff out and by doing it you learn more
about<00:06:51.949> your<00:06:52.340> motorcycle<00:06:52.870> and<00:06:53.870> you<00:06:54.139> save<00:06:54.319> a

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:54.349 
about your motorcycle and you save a

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:56.739 
about your motorcycle and you save a
shitload<00:06:54.590> of<00:06:54.800> money<00:06:54.999> and<00:06:55.999> nothing<00:06:56.449> against

00:06:56.739 --> 00:06:56.749 
shitload of money and nothing against

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.149 
shitload of money and nothing against
the<00:06:56.870> service<00:06:57.199> shops<00:06:57.409> in<00:06:57.590> the<00:06:57.650> bike<00:06:57.770> shops<00:06:58.039> they
