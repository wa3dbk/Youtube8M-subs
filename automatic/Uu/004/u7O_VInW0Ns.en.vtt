00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.509
 and 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.520
 very good girls very good guys that 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.030
 such are you I hope you are all very 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.510
 all right 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.459
 today I tell you a story about 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.609
 the international space station and it's 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.980
 people who uses it knows there 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.570
 many people who know very well the 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.539
 international space station that is 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.769
 the conformation just as I know myself 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.109
 very well the structure of uss 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.089
 enterprise because there are many people who 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.070
 knows very well the structure of the 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.010
 international space station and there 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.370
 an area in which there is a 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.500
 a little thing that sticks out of one of the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.320
 modules of the station and it looks like a weapon 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.699
 or even a small cannon but this that 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.469
 it's really the space station 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.750
 international is armed 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.969
 well I tell you the name of this 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.390
 device that you see on the screen is the 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:59.500
 js that or of and is connected to the module 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.049
 Japanese kibo el j ss o de means 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.690
 small satellite orbital launcher 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:07.149
 according to the Japanese space agency 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.270
 it's about a mechanism for putting 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.159
 orbit of small satellites designed 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.890
 according to the specifications of the 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.050
 club sat that are 10 centimeters by 10 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.479
 centimeters by 10 centimeters that 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.580
 transfer the satellites from the lock 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.799
 of the Japanese module for experiments 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.799
 dodged the space environment and the 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.170
 placed in orbit according to nasa 3 nano 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.190
 known satellites known as club 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.990
 schatz 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.450
 have been launched from the little 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.659
 orbital launcher attached to the arm 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.260
 robotic lab kibo on 19 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.470
 November 2000 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.360
 the cubs arts were transported to the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.480
 international space station in the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.010
 fourth ship of the Japanese cargo the q1 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.770
 tory 4 as commented on the statement 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:59.390
 so this news I also do 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.100
 so you can see all one of the functions 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.630
 most important of the space station 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.520
 international that is see what there is 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.920
 around is to say they get us up there 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.710
 up to contemplate the wonderful 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.160
 landscape that is to see the earth from 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:17.230
 above but to do their missions and 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.260
 one of them is that catch things that are 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.890
 nanosatellites is worth and what they are doing 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.220
 is 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.740
 measure the space environment and power 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.140
 experiment with space look at the 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.520
 severity of the crc 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.380
 so nothing guys I hope that I have 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.480
 interested the news a little kiss to all 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.800
 and see you in another video more of this 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.800
 channel until next time
