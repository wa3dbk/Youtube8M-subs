00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.260 
a pretty big deal because you couldn't
obtain<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.290> home<00:02:38.530> release<00:02:38.890> for<00:02:39.610> DVDs<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
obtain like a home release for DVDs and

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.290 
obtain like a home release for DVDs and
Japan<00:02:41.140> at<00:02:41.590> least<00:02:41.800> for<00:02:41.950> Dragonball<00:02:42.340> Z<00:02:42.520> for<00:02:43.270> a

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
Japan at least for Dragonball Z for a

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.789 
Japan at least for Dragonball Z for a
long<00:02:43.570> time<00:02:44.190> well<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.340> think<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:50.470> Japan

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
long time well I think that in Japan

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.470 
long time well I think that in Japan
they<00:02:50.950> only<00:02:51.100> released<00:02:51.310> movies<00:02:51.970> on<00:02:52.090> laser<00:02:52.330> disc

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
they only released movies on laser disc

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.130 
they only released movies on laser disc
and<00:02:53.019> VHS<00:02:53.370> reel<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.700> these<00:02:55.420> do<00:02:55.540> these<00:02:55.750> are<00:02:55.930> kind

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
and VHS reel and these do these are kind

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.250 
and VHS reel and these do these are kind
of<00:02:56.200> old<00:02:56.350> -<00:02:56.590> um<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.820> is<00:02:57.880> released<00:02:58.239> in<00:02:58.420> 2000<00:02:59.080> and

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
of old - um this is released in 2000 and

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.910 
of old - um this is released in 2000 and
I<00:02:59.320> think<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.799> previous<00:03:00.250> DVD<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.640> just<00:03:00.940> showed

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
I think the previous DVD I just showed

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:10.620 
I think the previous DVD I just showed
was<00:03:02.920> released<00:03:03.430> in<00:03:05.519> 1998<00:03:06.540> free<00:03:07.540> long<00:03:07.720> time<00:03:09.630> okay

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
was released in 1998 free long time okay

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.420 
was released in 1998 free long time okay
so<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.959> good<00:03:11.110> thing<00:03:11.140> about<00:03:11.440> this<00:03:11.739> was<00:03:12.160> it's

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
so the good thing about this was it's

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.759 
so the good thing about this was it's
uncut<00:03:15.360> not<00:03:16.360> so<00:03:16.690> heavily<00:03:16.959> edited<00:03:17.230> that's

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
uncut not so heavily edited that's

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.190 
uncut not so heavily edited that's
obviously<00:03:18.280> cuz<00:03:18.489> it's<00:03:18.610> uncut<00:03:19.000> but<00:03:20.010> yeah<00:03:22.200> and

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
DVD which at the time I thought it was

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.350 
DVD which at the time I thought it was
really<00:03:40.989> cool<00:03:41.880> yeah<00:03:42.880> it's<00:03:43.150> still<00:03:43.329> cool<00:03:43.660> but

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
really cool yeah it's still cool but

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.270 
really cool yeah it's still cool but
the<00:03:45.960> thing<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.230> don't<00:03:46.290> like<00:03:46.440> about<00:03:46.530> these<00:03:46.860> DVDs

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280

the thing I don't like about these DVDs
is<00:03:47.460> that<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.870> cover<00:03:49.110> art<00:03:50.060> now<00:03:51.060> it's<00:03:51.450> just<00:03:51.570> a

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
is that the cover art now it's just a

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.990 
is that the cover art now it's just a
screenshot<00:03:52.050> from<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.920> series<00:03:53.460> and<00:03:53.880> that's

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000
