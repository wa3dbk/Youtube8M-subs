00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
I've get the chocolate test and just a

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.679 
I've get the chocolate test and just a
little<00:00:02.190> dessert<00:00:02.550> tip<00:00:02.879> I<00:00:03.060> mean<00:00:03.240> on<00:00:03.510> this

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
little dessert tip I mean on this

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.690 
little dessert tip I mean on this
griddle<00:00:03.990> you<00:00:04.140> can<00:00:04.259> do<00:00:04.410> it<00:00:04.589> because<00:00:04.980> you<00:00:05.220> don't

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
griddle you can do it because you don't

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.629 
griddle you can do it because you don't
have<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.910> open<00:00:06.450> flame<00:00:06.690> all<00:00:07.589> infrared<00:00:08.160> energy

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
have the open flame all infrared energy

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.070 
have the open flame all infrared energy
I<00:00:08.760> mean<00:00:08.910> eventually<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.480> think<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.960> would

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
I mean eventually I think it would

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.419

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
probably burn up we left it on there for

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.279 
probably burn up we left it on there for
about<00:00:14.549> 10<00:00:14.910> minutes<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.719> didn't<00:00:16.049> do<00:00:16.139> it

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
about 10 minutes and you didn't do it

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.560 
about 10 minutes and you didn't do it
and<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:16.920> hot<00:00:17.160> out<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.400> today<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:18.270> want<00:00:18.480> to
