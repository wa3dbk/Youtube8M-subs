00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.220
 year and even since 16 matches 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.660
 the longer the series lasts and the more chances 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.130
 doctors to stay in league 1 that's me 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.900
 night zle late on the first no 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.250
 Relegable is now nine times 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.920
 Saint-Etienne points from his side wants 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.590
 confirm his success against Lorient and 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.500
 stay in the running for europe 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.170
 doctors are trying their luck the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.180
 first through the foot 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.370
 left of Kevin the younger but this is 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.290
 not framed 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 they new opportunities on shots 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.190
 foot arrested with the former Etienne 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.290
 sylvain marchal 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.059
 no more success for the defender 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.469
 central garnet after passing 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.930
 the storm the St Etienne will accelerate 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.030
 with romain hamouma in his works in 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.890
 in the penalty area the withdrawal 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.379
 for max alain gradel 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.899
 the St Etienne had not shown 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.989
 dangerous until then an opportunity 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.810
 just happiness and greens the very 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.270
 good job of hamouma for gradel 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.670
 eighth goal for the Ivorian sa 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.340
 fourth consecutive achievement him 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.250
 already scorer in the first leg where the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.830
 Etienne had won 1 goal to 0 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.510
 in pain 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.659
 the greens made the hardest hamouma 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.990
 once again finds his friend 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.630
 attacked mevlut erding 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.119
 42nd minute the sso did the hardest and 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.119
 leads 2 goals to 0 now the goal of 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.970
 break registered by the Turkish mevlut erding 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.180
 sixth achievement for him that wipes out 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.620
 anthony and mfa m faty tuller en 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.560
 the absence of injured johan carrasso 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.180
 and so the choice of christophe galtier 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.320
 to align erding gradel and hamouma for 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.640
 an offensive book is showing itself 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.200
 judicious and at the break saint-etienne 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.300
 leads 2 to 0 while the greens had 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.990
 scored only one goal in the four 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.600
 last moves 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.790
 the greens are dominating the return of 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.090
 changing rooms with this half-volley 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:17.460
 overpowered on which anthony m'fa 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.680
 interpose but it will react and of 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.340
 what way other than this foot strikes 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.210
 left full skylight 2 kévin lejeune 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.760
 Stephane Ruffier is beaten 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.200
 stéphane ruffier can do nothing to 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.700
 the origin a bad raise 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.610
 stéphanoise also lacks success 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.830
 for tabanou who gives back the old 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.750
 auxerrois kevin lejeune in very 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.280
 good arrangements to make the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.600
 power and precision of his paw 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:47.150
 left but it comes down to a2 busin 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:51.720
 and will have the opportunity and maybe 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.630
 to equalize with this good free kick and 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.420
 stéphane ruffier unfolds relaxes 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.150
 well on his line to push back the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.590
 messina attempt with this free kick 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.470
 wound of bouna sarr saint-etienne done 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.080
 the back round and spicy against and goes 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.540
 to secure a greater advantage 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.770
 through yohan mollo to ten 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.660
 minutes from the end 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.250
 fourth achievement for yohan mollo 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.600
 his four goals were scored in 2015 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.970
 he who had already unlocked the situation 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.840
 last week facing Lorient at 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.440
 geoffroy guichard 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.560
 he is successful on this one with 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.720
 this balloon diverted by the defender 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.670
 messin is a new rebound in 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.320
 end of the game and the 91st minute sir 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.709
 rainville means the penalty spot 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.860
 for this hand some volunteers from 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.110
 benjamin corgnet but maybe real he 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.750
 y bakotto facing ruffier 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.910
