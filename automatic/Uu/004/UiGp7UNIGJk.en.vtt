00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.450 

yeah<00:00:00.230> I<00:00:01.230> think<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.500> Audrina<00:00:01.979> Han<00:00:02.129> kind<00:00:02.370> of

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
yeah I think the Audrina Han kind of

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.160 
yeah I think the Audrina Han kind of
sealed<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.730> deal<00:00:02.790> with<00:00:03.090> that<00:00:03.240> you<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.929> got<00:00:04.140> it

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
sealed the deal with that you you got it

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.950 
sealed the deal with that you you got it
that's<00:00:04.710> exactly<00:00:04.920> what<00:00:05.339> happened<00:00:05.670> but<00:00:06.180> he<00:00:06.210> you

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
that's exactly what happened but he you

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.540 
that's exactly what happened but he you
know<00:00:07.080> he's<00:00:07.319> stuck<00:00:07.589> with<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.799> character<00:00:08.189> and

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
know he's stuck with the character and

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.009 
know he's stuck with the character and
not<00:00:08.670> not<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.000> say<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.360> character<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.840> bad

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
not not to say that the character is bad

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.049 
not not to say that the character is bad
but<00:00:10.980> he<00:00:11.130> just<00:00:11.309> had<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.519> play<00:00:11.700> him<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.820> little<00:00:11.969> bit

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
but he just had to play him a little bit

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.370 
but he just had to play him a little bit
differently<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.660> used<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.019> be<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> matchup

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
differently this used to be a matchup

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.660 
differently this used to be a matchup
that<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.679> thought<00:00:13.950> he<00:00:14.040> did<00:00:14.190> really<00:00:14.340> well<00:00:14.519> and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
that I thought he did really well and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.460 
that I thought he did really well and
when<00:00:14.790> he<00:00:14.910> had<00:00:15.089> knocked<00:00:15.299> down<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.599> X<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.960> now

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
when he had knocked down the X and now

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.630 
when he had knocked down the X and now
that<00:00:16.680> he<00:00:16.740> doesn't<00:00:16.949> get<00:00:17.100> knocked<00:00:17.250> down<00:00:17.400> so

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
that he doesn't get knocked down so

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.510 
that he doesn't get knocked down so
often<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.119> he<00:00:18.359> can't<00:00:18.570> abuse<00:00:18.960> CODIS<00:00:19.740> poor<00:00:20.340> wake

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
often and he can't abuse CODIS poor wake

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.609 
often and he can't abuse CODIS poor wake
up<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:20.880> often<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.390> think<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:21.990> pretty<00:00:22.170> even<00:00:22.500> or

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
up so often I think it's pretty even or

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.800 
up so often I think it's pretty even or
even<00:00:22.650> even<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.369> win<00:00:23.609> for<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.150> Cody<00:00:24.330> Cody<00:00:24.600> I

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
even even a win for for Cody Cody I

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.990 
even even a win for for Cody Cody I
almost<00:00:25.140> feel<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.529> same<00:00:25.890> way<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.820> course

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
almost feel the same way it is of course

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.970 
almost feel the same way it is of course
just<00:00:27.449> like<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.869> older<00:00:28.140> versions<00:00:28.529> though<00:00:28.710> that

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
just like the older versions though that

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.939 
just like the older versions though that
when<00:00:29.160> Keef<00:00:29.400> does<00:00:29.609> get<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.910> knocked<00:00:30.060> out<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.570> is

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
when Keef does get it knocked out it is

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.139 
when Keef does get it knocked out it is

it's like the only +1 on him yeah that
not<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.619> big<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> deal<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.790> or

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
not that big a deal that's like a do or

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.580 
not that big a deal that's like a do or
die<00:01:17.970> kind<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.570> guess<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.900> don't<00:01:18.990> get<00:01:19.140> time<00:01:19.380> to

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
die kind of guess you don't get time to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.429 
die kind of guess you don't get time to
really<00:01:19.799> set<00:01:20.040> anything<00:01:20.310> up<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.380> below<00:01:22.380> she

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
really set anything up and below she

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.270 
really set anything up and below she
just<00:01:22.799> looks<00:01:22.950> fortified<00:01:23.610> at<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.970> point

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
just looks fortified at this point
