00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.350
 seconds of the first one that was barrier 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.340
 difficult points but it has been nice 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.100
 because lately we have been doing 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.650
 very hard stages and today has been more 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.390
 fun more more smooth and we could 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.340
 enjoy a little more and the people and 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.990

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.119

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.540
 difference is from 2014 to those of years 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.570
 gone then I think that 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.400
 harder than I've made from other years 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.740
 and on all the part of Argentina was 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.440
 very very hard and we 'll see how 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.510
 how is chile before entering our 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.060
 territory had said my goal no longer 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.220
 is only winning the female dakar now 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.740
 I want to fight with the others for being 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.740

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.220

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.080
 position 16 of stage 9 sans makes 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.760
 the difference not being a woman does 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.760
 because he has the discipline and the courage 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.130
 to make a helmet more of those who 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.740

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.740
