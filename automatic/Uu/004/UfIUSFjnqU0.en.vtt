00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.969 
beginning or in kobe after the swift
1995<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.720> there<00:01:46.049> ten<00:01:46.259> years<00:01:46.289> it<00:01:46.799> was

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
1995 it was there ten years it was

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.740 
1995 it was there ten years it was
expected<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:47.729> only<00:01:48.060> three<00:01:48.330> years

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
expected for only three years

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.779 
expected for only three years
but<00:01:49.259> because<00:01:49.590> people<00:01:49.649> habit<00:01:50.190> they<00:01:50.459> kept<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
but because people habit they kept the

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.150 
but because people habit they kept the
14<00:01:51.149> years<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.500> donated<00:01:52.890> to

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
14 years then that they donated to

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.070 
14 years then that they donated to
another<00:01:53.399> disaster<00:01:53.970> area<00:01:54.209> Taiwan<00:01:54.690> as<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> whore

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.000 
nobody was talking about recycling
sustainability<00:02:26.790> or<00:02:27.510> ecology<00:02:27.720> because<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.800> just

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
sustainability or ecology because I just

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.640 
sustainability or ecology because I just
didn't<00:02:29.730> want<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:29.970> waste<00:02:30.150> material<00:02:30.690> then<00:02:31.470> this

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
didn't want to waste material then this

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.180 
didn't want to waste material then this
big<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:33.240> movement<00:02:33.660> came<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:34.890> become

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
big the movement came and it's become

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.820 
big the movement came and it's become
very<00:02:35.340> commercial<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.540> nobody<00:02:37.290> really<00:02:37.650> know

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
very commercial and nobody really know

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.270 
very commercial and nobody really know
that<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:39.470> very<00:02:40.470> definition<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:41.070> this

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
that the very definition of this

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.880 
that the very definition of this
sustainability<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.750> I'm<00:02:42.840> not<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.380> never<00:02:43.620> used

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
sustainability so I'm not I never used

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.960 
sustainability so I'm not I never used
this<00:02:44.040> as<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.490> part<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.150> my<00:02:45.210> design<00:02:45.660> concept<00:02:46.970> what

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
this as a part of my design concept what

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.350 
this as a part of my design concept what
did<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:48.990> learn<00:02:49.230> by<00:02:49.950> building<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
did you learn by building and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:01.040 
did you learn by building and
constructing<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.260> building<00:02:59.600> maybe<00:03:00.600> it's

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
constructing this building maybe it's

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.470 
constructing this building maybe it's
these<00:03:01.350> things<00:03:01.680> as<00:03:02.100> Ramzi<00:03:02.550> cousin<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.090> smoothly

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
these things as Ramzi cousin so smoothly

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.370 
these things as Ramzi cousin so smoothly
done<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.700> result<00:03:06.240> was<00:03:06.390> almost<00:03:06.780> as<00:03:07.170> I

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
done and the result was almost as I

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.160 
done and the result was almost as I
expected<00:03:08.160> beginning<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.720> know<00:03:09.810> something

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
expected beginning you know something

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.420 
expected beginning you know something
changes<00:03:12.020> so<00:03:13.020> I<00:03:13.050> think<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.680> not<00:03:14.010> random

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
changes so I think this is not random

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.560 
changes so I think this is not random

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490

popular<00:03:26.880> mess

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
popular mess

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.230 
popular mess
more<00:03:28.140> things<00:03:28.290> too<00:03:28.530> because<00:03:29.430> everything<00:03:30.060> was

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
more things too because everything was

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.020 
more things too because everything was
really<00:03:30.510> fight<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.590> new<00:03:32.340> process<00:03:32.820> or

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
really fight and the new process or
