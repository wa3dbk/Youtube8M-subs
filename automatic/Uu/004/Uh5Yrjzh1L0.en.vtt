00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 speaks good numbers in the victor in the blog 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 today I will introduce you to my 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.700
 true noun pedagogical 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.969
 I'm using it in this demonstration in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 front stratocaster and on my foot from the edge 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.750
 It has the compressor of the cave and pick me 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.420
 the escape artist electronic otoe drive 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.410
 a form a punch box rental and the buffet 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.060
 both ne 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.830
 Let's see how this scheme connects you. 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.680
 and which teams are closing 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.969
 with it's I'm using my male 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.770
 object 150 né with a little bit of reverb 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.450
 own jewelry 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.980
 so here guys it's the following this is the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.980
 sound without pedal 1 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.100
 I use the trophy hoax leaves him always 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.010
 connected because it gives more body to 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.570
 to avoid the same was that she was a 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.670
 extract kester in that one has a sound well 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.519
 skinny then the knee for 1 color 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.519
 brown on the sound néviton always sound 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.420
 with the good start 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.159
 nobody 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.250
 there is a quite remarkable difference 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.560
 simonson né galera the electronic tce of 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.759
 point that is not a time tuner gives a 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.950
 conferred on the pitch I think 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:30.590
 I will not have to go back a little is 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:33.320
 one thing out here go first to the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:40.880
 his books right my first clean sound is 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:43.729
 a clean sound with compressor that gives a 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.380
 one joined in the frequencies nor do I like 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.380
 enough says to the compressor 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.479
 This is one of my dreams, right? 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.659
 another sound that I usually use quite 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.659
 compressor as bodies and with it né 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.659
 I forgot all that the bank went 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.659
 thank you 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.950
 So these are the two are the books, right? 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.540
 I'm me and only with compressor that I 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.239
 I like to use to do more things 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.519
 rhythmic things that is a quest both 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.739
 Ambience A Dream Compressor Strings 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.690
 law when I want something more spatial 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.409
 so then now let me to 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.970
 distortion 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.709
 here I work as follows 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.709
 bridge box is a major distortion 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.629
 youtube drive and gives you a bust on the bridge 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:06.359
 box when I need bigger né 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:09.500
 So here's what football is like and how 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.500
 needs a little more gain 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
 i 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:26.890
 i am and i use the turbo drive and the 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.890
 delay when I'm going to do just one thing 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.890
 Let's use a lot of it so I have 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.020
 basically two stages of distortion 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.480
 When I want something lighter and one 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.960
 of the occupants box to make a solo 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.960
 even is 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.430
 It's the newtom and drive just to give a boost. 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.550
 so guys this is basically the sound of 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.709
 guitar I've been working with, right? 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.680
 Few pedals do not have much 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.020
 mystery in a very simple way and I 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.910
 I have really enjoyed this beauty. 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.370
 My name is Bruno Victor and this was the 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.760
 Teaching February 2013 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.760
 thanks
