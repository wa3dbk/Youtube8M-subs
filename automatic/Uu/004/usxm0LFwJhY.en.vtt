you can buy from Kennex the other thing
I<00:01:23.090> did<00:01:23.300> was<00:01:23.510> I<00:01:25.150> built<00:01:26.150> a<00:01:26.360> a<00:01:28.120> kind<00:01:29.120> of

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.800 

apparatus<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:34.289> connect<00:01:35.289> it<00:01:35.439> to<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.740> top<00:01:36.039> deal

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
apparatus to connect it to the top deal

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.590 
apparatus to connect it to the top deal
you<00:01:37.810> can<00:01:37.960> see<00:01:38.140> it's<00:01:38.259> real<00:01:38.499> simple<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:40.240> a<00:01:40.359> gear

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
you can see it's real simple just a gear

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.099 
you can see it's real simple just a gear
a<00:01:40.630> couple<00:01:41.259> gears<00:01:41.409> turning<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:43.509> would<00:01:43.689> be<00:01:43.869> easy

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
a couple gears turning it would be easy

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.020 
a couple gears turning it would be easy
to<00:01:44.140> copy<00:01:44.500> if<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:44.859> wanted<00:01:45.189> to<00:01:45.369> and<00:01:45.579> feel<00:01:45.789> free

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
to copy if you wanted to and feel free

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.359 
to copy if you wanted to and feel free
to<00:01:46.060> copy<00:01:46.359> and<00:01:46.630> whatever<00:01:49.469> the<00:01:50.469> motor<00:01:50.679> normally

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
to copy and whatever the motor normally

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.399 
to copy and whatever the motor normally
would<00:01:51.520> have<00:01:51.640> hung<00:01:52.209> right<00:01:52.450> from<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.899> outside

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
would have hung right from the outside

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:02.330 
would have hung right from the outside
here<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.729> kind<00:01:55.479> of<00:01:55.599> dangled<00:01:59.159> these<00:02:00.159> two<00:02:00.549> rods

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
here and kind of dangled these two rods

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.550 
here and kind of dangled these two rods
have<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.369> tendency<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:05.399> creep<00:02:06.399> away<00:02:07.410> from<00:02:08.410> each

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
have a tendency to creep away from each

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.100 
have a tendency to creep away from each
other<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:12.150> found<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.360> there's<00:02:13.840> times

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
other and I found that there's times

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.720 
other and I found that there's times
when<00:02:14.349> I<00:02:14.379> don't<00:02:14.680> want<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.010> mouths<00:02:15.220> open<00:02:15.459> and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
when I don't want the mouths open and

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.759 
when I don't want the mouths open and
closed<00:02:16.709> well<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.690> way<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.900> prevent<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
closed well it's the way you prevent the

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.740 
closed well it's the way you prevent the
mouth<00:02:20.920> from<00:02:21.160> opening<00:02:21.549> and<00:02:21.640> closing<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.329> simply

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
mouth from opening and closing is simply

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.479 
mouth from opening and closing is simply
clear<00:02:22.989> remove<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.900> rod<00:02:26.260> let's<00:02:27.220> see<00:02:27.340> the

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
clear remove that rod let's see the

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.480 
clear remove that rod let's see the
surfers<00:02:28.150> going<00:02:28.390> up

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.410 

and<00:02:32.490> Abbas<00:02:32.880> stayed<00:02:33.210> open<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.760> basically<00:02:36.209> if

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
and Abbas stayed open so basically if

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.790 
and Abbas stayed open so basically if
you<00:02:36.450> remove<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:38.580> one<00:02:38.850> rod<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
you remove this one rod that this is the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.309 
you remove this one rod that this is the
trip<00:02:41.040> rod<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.790> for<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.720> mouth<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:46.020> shark

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
trip rod for the for the mouth the shark

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.050 
trip rod for the for the mouth the shark
will<00:02:47.010> stay<00:02:47.360> open<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.130> make<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.430> open

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
will stay open and to make it open

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.300 
will stay open and to make it open

one<00:04:13.820> time<00:04:14.090> in<00:04:14.750> one<00:04:15.050> of<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.320> kits<00:04:15.620> I<00:04:15.860> got<00:04:16.070> a

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
one time in one of the kits I got a

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.250 
one time in one of the kits I got a
tough<00:04:16.940> kid<00:04:17.180> I<00:04:17.239> got<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.540> whole<00:04:17.690> bunch<00:04:17.930> of<00:04:18.049> blue

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.099 
tough kid I got a whole bunch of blue
connector<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:19.250> I<00:04:19.280> just<00:04:19.579> added<00:04:19.940> them<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.840> really

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
connectors from gannets and if you do

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.999 
connectors from gannets and if you do
that<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:30.320> will<00:04:30.350> reinforce<00:04:30.650> it

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
that it will reinforce it

you have a store or something like that

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.420 
you have a store or something like that
you<00:04:35.229> could<00:04:35.379> set<00:04:35.589> this<00:04:35.740> thing<00:04:35.919> up<00:04:36.129> and<00:04:36.249> let<00:04:36.400> it

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
you could set this thing up and let it

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.439 
you could set this thing up and let it
run<00:04:36.639> all<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:36.939> time

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
run all the time

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.100 
run all the time
for<00:04:37.779> example

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
for example

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.809 
for example
the<00:04:40.650> other<00:04:40.830> thing<00:04:41.039> I<00:04:41.159> did<00:04:41.340> if<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.639> look

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
the other thing I did if you look

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:48.179 
the other thing I did if you look
closely<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:43.879> build<00:04:44.879> a<00:04:45.000> little<00:04:45.240> tripod

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:48.189 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:52.350 

and<00:04:48.699> I<00:04:48.789> connected<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.419> right<00:04:49.659> there<00:04:51.149> and<00:04:52.149> that

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
and I connected it right there and that

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.909 
and I connected it right there and that
gives<00:04:52.629> it<00:04:52.839> just<00:04:52.899> a<00:04:53.199> little<00:04:53.349> more<00:04:53.499> stability

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
gives it just a little more stability

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.109 
gives it just a little more stability
but<00:04:56.919> I'll<00:04:57.069> tell<00:04:57.249> you<00:04:57.369> what<00:04:57.550> guys

00:04:58.109 --> 00:04:58.119 
but I'll tell you what guys

00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:01.919 
but I'll tell you what guys
that<00:04:59.129> all<00:05:00.129> those<00:05:00.459> are<00:05:00.819> not<00:05:01.089> the<00:05:01.269> secret<00:05:01.689> of

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
of shark run what to do that I could

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.870 
of shark run what to do that I could
take<00:05:13.119> the<00:05:13.300> surfer<00:05:13.719> off

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.350 

very<00:05:18.880> colorful<00:05:20.610> surfer<00:05:22.949> and<00:05:23.949> here's<00:05:24.190> the<00:05:24.400> rod

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
very colorful surfer and here's the rod

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.809 
very colorful surfer and here's the rod
that<00:05:25.630> he<00:05:25.720> used<00:05:25.900> with<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.229> trip<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:27.490> way<00:05:27.669> the

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:27.819 
that he used with the trip the way the

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.930 
that he used with the trip the way the
surfer<00:05:28.180> works<00:05:28.479> I<00:05:29.220> hold<00:05:30.220> it<00:05:30.340> up<00:05:30.490> here<00:05:30.699> so<00:05:30.789> you

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
surfer works I hold it up here so you

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.760 
surfer works I hold it up here so you
can<00:05:30.970> see<00:05:31.240> see<00:05:31.449> that<00:05:31.479> little<00:05:32.139> piece<00:05:32.259> of<00:05:32.500> plastic

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
can see see that little piece of plastic

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.469 
can see see that little piece of plastic
dangling<00:05:34.289> that<00:05:35.289> plastic<00:05:35.889> basically<00:05:37.680> moves

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
dangling that plastic basically moves

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.930 
dangling that plastic basically moves
and<00:05:40.479> it<00:05:41.470> moves<00:05:41.530> all<00:05:41.949> the<00:05:42.130> way<00:05:42.250> up<00:05:42.340> to<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.639> tippy

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
and it moves all the way up to the tippy

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.850 
and it moves all the way up to the tippy
top<00:05:43.150> at<00:05:43.389> the<00:05:43.509> back<00:05:43.720> of<00:05:43.930> this<00:05:44.110> thing<00:05:44.380> and<00:05:44.680> then

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
top at the back of this thing and then

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.749 
top at the back of this thing and then
down<00:05:45.130> by<00:05:45.460> gravity<00:05:46.530> and<00:05:47.530> on<00:05:48.069> the<00:05:48.250> sprockets

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
down by gravity and on the sprockets

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.400 
down by gravity and on the sprockets
going<00:05:49.060> up<00:05:50.130> it<00:05:51.130> connects<00:05:51.970> the<00:05:52.120> destructs<00:05:52.870> on

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
going up it connects the destructs on

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.920 
going up it connects the destructs on
the<00:05:53.650> chain<00:05:53.919> and<00:05:54.240> then<00:05:55.240> it<00:05:55.419> goes<00:05:55.599> through<00:05:55.840> the

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
the chain and then it goes through the

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.610 
the chain and then it goes through the
top<00:05:57.389> well<00:05:58.389> I<00:05:58.419> was<00:05:58.660> having<00:05:58.840> for<00:05:59.199> the<00:05:59.289> longest

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
top well I was having for the longest

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.469 
top well I was having for the longest
time<00:05:59.740> let<00:06:00.220> them<00:06:00.370> till<00:06:00.550> two<00:06:00.729> weeks<00:06:00.940> ago<00:06:01.240> where

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
time let them till two weeks ago where

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.120 
time let them till two weeks ago where
my<00:06:01.630> surfer<00:06:02.020> would<00:06:02.199> just<00:06:02.380> stop<00:06:02.590> right<00:06:02.860> there<00:06:03.039> at

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
my surfer would just stop right there at

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.649 
my surfer would just stop right there at
the<00:06:03.250> base<00:06:05.220> about<00:06:06.220> six<00:06:06.520> months<00:06:06.820> ago<00:06:07.030> I<00:06:07.060> added<00:06:07.509> a

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:07.659 
the base about six months ago I added a

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:13.560 
the base about six months ago I added a
a<00:06:08.310> tie<00:06:09.310> wrap<00:06:11.280> if<00:06:12.280> the<00:06:12.460> tie<00:06:12.639> wrap<00:06:12.880> gave<00:06:13.210> it<00:06:13.389> kind

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
a tie wrap if the tie wrap gave it kind

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.040 
a tie wrap if the tie wrap gave it kind
of<00:06:13.750> additional<00:06:14.940> connection<00:06:15.940> capability<00:06:16.900> and

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
of additional connection capability and

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.450 
of additional connection capability and
that<00:06:17.080> helped<00:06:17.440> but<00:06:17.710> that<00:06:17.860> didn't<00:06:18.159> solve<00:06:18.280> the

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
that helped but that didn't solve the

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.050 
that helped but that didn't solve the
problem<00:06:19.080> here's<00:06:20.080> the<00:06:20.409> secret<00:06:20.889> of<00:06:21.070> shark<00:06:21.340> run

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.860 

this<00:06:25.199> plastic<00:06:26.199> thing<00:06:26.229> was<00:06:26.949> getting<00:06:27.340> caught<00:06:28.150> up

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
this plastic thing was getting caught up

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.469 
this plastic thing was getting caught up
in<00:06:29.139> the<00:06:29.289> base<00:06:29.500> up<00:06:29.979> up<00:06:30.250> in<00:06:30.460> here<00:06:30.849> and<00:06:31.030> maybe

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
in the base up up in here and maybe

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.110 
in the base up up in here and maybe
because<00:06:32.050> I'd<00:06:32.199> spray<00:06:32.590> wd-40<00:06:33.370> but<00:06:33.610> I<00:06:33.699> think<00:06:33.940> just

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
because I'd spray wd-40 but I think just

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.420 
because I'd spray wd-40 but I think just
by<00:06:34.300> using<00:06:35.020> it<00:06:35.289> over<00:06:35.560> and<00:06:35.889> over<00:06:36.070> again<00:06:36.159> with

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
by using it over and over again with

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.730 
by using it over and over again with
hair<00:06:36.669> or<00:06:36.820> whatever<00:06:38.909> to<00:06:39.909> prevent<00:06:40.270> this<00:06:41.080> plastic

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
hair or whatever to prevent this plastic

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.550 
hair or whatever to prevent this plastic
thing<00:06:42.360> from<00:06:43.360> going<00:06:43.419> any<00:06:43.870> higher<00:06:43.960> than<00:06:44.320> that<00:06:44.380> I

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
thing from going any higher than that I

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.170 
thing from going any higher than that I
just<00:06:45.270> looked<00:06:46.270> at<00:06:46.449> this<00:06:46.690> is<00:06:46.870> paper<00:06:48.180> shoves

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
just looked at this is paper shoves

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.879 
just looked at this is paper shoves
shove<00:06:49.900> some<00:06:50.169> paper<00:06:50.440> in<00:06:50.770> there

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889 
shove some paper in there

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:55.360 
shove some paper in there
and<00:06:53.250> that<00:06:53.639> will<00:06:53.849> prevent<00:06:54.180> this<00:06:54.930> little

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
and that will prevent this little

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.360 
and that will prevent this little
plastic<00:06:56.370> thing<00:06:56.879> from<00:06:57.120> going<00:06:57.389> higher<00:06:57.629> than<00:06:58.370> the

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
plastic thing from going higher than the

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.559 
plastic thing from going higher than the
net<00:06:59.610> and<00:07:00.860> that<00:07:01.860> in<00:07:02.099> turn<00:07:02.340> will<00:07:02.389> prevent<00:07:03.389> it

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.569 
net and that in turn will prevent it

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:07.730 
net and that in turn will prevent it
from<00:07:03.599> ever<00:07:05.120> jamming<00:07:06.120> at<00:07:06.240> the<00:07:06.360> base<00:07:06.569> and<00:07:07.020> at<00:07:07.650> the

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
from ever jamming at the base and at the

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.450 
from ever jamming at the base and at the
bottom

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.370
