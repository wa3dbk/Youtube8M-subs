00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
with that gold medal okay so that's a

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.049 
with that gold medal okay so that's a
really<00:01:03.490> good<00:01:03.580> question

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
really good question

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.370 
really good question
we<00:01:04.360> obviously<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:04.990> best<00:01:05.170> thing<00:01:05.260> about

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 
we obviously the best thing about

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.200 
we obviously the best thing about
worldly<00:01:05.860> for<00:01:06.100> is<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.370> every<00:01:06.670> single<00:01:06.820> game<00:01:07.060> is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
worldly for is that every single game is

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.700 
worldly for is that every single game is
going<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.390> be<00:01:07.450> super<00:01:07.780> tough<00:01:08.080> it's<00:01:08.320> top<00:01:08.560> eight

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.710 
going to be super tough it's top eight
teams<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.220> world<00:01:09.370> I<00:01:09.670> think<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.420> best

teams in the world I think the best

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.330 
teams in the world I think the best
thing<00:01:10.930> about<00:01:11.080> this<00:01:11.230> team<00:01:11.470> is<00:01:11.710> we're<00:01:12.010> young<00:01:12.310> and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.090 
to come back on top but we will go out
game<00:01:22.150> by<00:01:22.300> game<00:01:22.360> process<00:01:23.050> by<00:01:23.229> process<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:23.950> just

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
game by game process by process and just

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.630 
game by game process by process and just
give<00:01:24.250> our<00:01:24.369> absolute<00:01:24.760> best

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.370 

that's<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.450> tough<00:01:30.660> question<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.320> think

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that's a really tough question I think

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.650 
that's a really tough question I think
the<00:01:32.100> best<00:01:32.340> way<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.610> motivate<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> team<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.600> get

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
the best way to motivate a team and get

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.020 
the best way to motivate a team and get
really<00:01:33.990> focused<00:01:34.440> is<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:35.070> us<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.460> always<00:01:35.640> set

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
really focused is for us we always set

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.660 
really focused is for us we always set
really<00:01:36.540> really<00:01:36.570> clear<00:01:37.110> clear<00:01:38.070> goals<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.550> we

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
really really clear clear goals and we

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.190 
really really clear clear goals and we
know<00:01:38.880> what<00:01:39.090> we're<00:01:39.240> about<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> team<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.080> what

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
know what we're about as a team and what

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.110 
know what we're about as a team and what
we<00:01:40.230> worked<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.560> achieve<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.130> then<00:01:41.220> it's

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
we worked to achieve and then it's

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.370 
we worked to achieve and then it's
setting<00:01:42.510> about<00:01:42.690> how<00:01:42.930> you're<00:01:43.080> going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.260> do

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
setting about how you're going to do

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.080 
setting about how you're going to do
that<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.830> really<00:01:44.130> focusing<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.670> process

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that so really focusing on the process

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.120 
that so really focusing on the process
and<00:01:45.840> most<00:01:46.080> importantly<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> little

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and most importantly just have a little

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.330 
and most importantly just have a little
fun<00:01:47.340> along<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> way
