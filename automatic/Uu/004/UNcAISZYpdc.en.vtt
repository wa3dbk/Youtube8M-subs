00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
mess because i teased it and so it gets

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.069

purple<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.740> concentrated<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.520> looks<00:01:20.670> like

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
purple really concentrated it looks like

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.130 
purple really concentrated it looks like
food<00:01:21.090> coloring<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.700> what<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.909> does<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.420> if

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
food coloring and what that does is if

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.050 
food coloring and what that does is if
you<00:01:25.320> guys<00:01:25.500> watch<00:01:25.770> my<00:01:26.009> bleaching<00:01:26.430> video<00:01:26.700> it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
you guys watch my bleaching video it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.450 
you guys watch my bleaching video it
just<00:01:27.390> takes<00:01:27.630> out<00:01:27.900> any<00:01:28.350> brassiness<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.250> yellow

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
just takes out any brassiness or yellow

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.609 
just takes out any brassiness or yellow
tones<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.270> your<00:01:30.360> hair<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.750> I

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
tones that you have in your hair and I

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.319 
tones that you have in your hair and I
think<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.040> works<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.549> well<00:01:32.729> because<00:01:33.090> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
think that works really well because it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.050 
think that works really well because it
doesn't<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.740> not<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.159> concentrated<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
doesn't it's not so concentrated that it

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.270 
doesn't it's not so concentrated that it
turns<00:01:36.270> my<00:01:36.420> hair<00:01:36.570> gray<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:37.950> helps

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
turns my hair gray but it really helps

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.260 
turns my hair gray but it really helps
get<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.430> yellow<00:01:38.880> out<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.369> really<00:01:42.090> like

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
get the yellow out and so I really like

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.030 
get the yellow out and so I really like
that<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> days<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.799> don't

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.550 
that and then on the days that I don't
use<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.430> use<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.790> Pantene<00:01:45.360> pro-v<00:01:46.110> ice

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
expression does make my hair a little

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.469 
expression does make my hair a little
bit<00:02:03.420> less<00:02:03.659> shiny<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.200> um<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.250> want<00:02:05.759> my<00:02:06.210> color

bit less shiny but um I want my color

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.300 
bit less shiny but um I want my color
and<00:02:07.429> for<00:02:08.429> conditioner<00:02:09.060> um<00:02:09.920> I'm<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.190> very

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
and for conditioner um I'm not very

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.900 
and for conditioner um I'm not very
picky<00:02:11.520> about<00:02:11.730> my<00:02:11.940> conditioner

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
picky about my conditioner

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.460 
picky about my conditioner
but<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.810> really<00:02:14.320> I<00:02:14.800> kind<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.430> vary<00:02:16.210> between<00:02:16.470> the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
but I really I kind of vary between the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.060 
but I really I kind of vary between the
sunsilk<00:02:18.570> volumizing<00:02:19.570> conditioner<00:02:19.920> which<00:02:20.920> I

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
sunsilk volumizing conditioner which I

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.160 
sunsilk volumizing conditioner which I
think<00:02:21.340> that's<00:02:21.490> daring<00:02:21.940> volume<00:02:22.390> but<00:02:22.690> i'm<00:02:22.990> not

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
think that's daring volume but i'm not

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.010 
think that's daring volume but i'm not
sure<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.440> then<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.130> herbal<00:02:24.430> essences<00:02:25.020> I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
sure and then the herbal essences I

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.570 
sure and then the herbal essences I
think<00:02:26.380> those<00:02:26.500> both<00:02:26.740> a<00:02:26.890> really<00:02:27.160> thick<00:02:27.370> and

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
think those both a really thick and

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.490 
think those both a really thick and
creamy<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.540> think<00:02:28.780> they<00:02:28.930> give<00:02:29.140> me<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.320> little

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
creamy and I think they give me a little

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.070 
creamy and I think they give me a little
bit<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.740> a<00:02:29.830> booth<00:02:30.010> um<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:31.030> do<00:02:31.360> definitely<00:02:31.570> try

different kinds of waves and curls so

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.020 
different kinds of waves and curls so
I'm<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:09.520> rusk<00:04:09.820> thicker<00:04:10.239> volumizer<00:04:10.930> 5<00:04:11.680> stars

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
I'm the rusk thicker volumizer 5 stars

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.330 
I'm the rusk thicker volumizer 5 stars
and<00:04:13.030> then<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.900> put<00:04:14.530> a<00:04:14.560> lot<00:04:14.709> of<00:04:14.770> product<00:04:15.160> in<00:04:15.280> my

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
and then I put a lot of product in my

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.420 
and then I put a lot of product in my
hair<00:04:15.370> when<00:04:15.610> it's<00:04:15.730> wet<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:16.600> I<00:04:16.630> don't<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.530> I<00:04:17.919> guess

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
hair when it's wet so I don't it I guess

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.039 
hair when it's wet so I don't it I guess
your<00:04:18.549> hair<00:04:18.669> absorbs<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.209> more<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:19.540> so<00:04:19.720> it's

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
your hair absorbs it more and so it's

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.950 
your hair absorbs it more and so it's
not<00:04:20.260> as<00:04:20.620> crispy<00:04:21.520> as<00:04:21.549> when<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:22.539> apply<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:22.780> when

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
not as crispy as when you apply it when

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.220 
not as crispy as when you apply it when
it's<00:04:23.080> dry<00:04:23.320> but<00:04:23.700> after<00:04:24.700> that<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:24.880> applied<00:04:25.330> to

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
it's dry but after that I applied to

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.650 
it's dry but after that I applied to
yo<00:04:26.320> fives<00:04:26.650> play<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.280> again<00:04:27.670> re<00:04:28.030> workable<00:04:28.420> putty

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
yo fives play it again re workable putty

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.410 
yo fives play it again re workable putty
and<00:04:28.930> this<00:04:29.470> does<00:04:29.770> is<00:04:30.040> thick<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.760> gooey<00:04:31.000> as<00:04:31.270> you

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
and this does is thick and gooey as you

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.370 
and this does is thick and gooey as you
can<00:04:31.600> see<00:04:31.870> i<00:04:31.900> mean<00:04:32.200> that's<00:04:32.380> that's<00:04:34.110> how<00:04:35.110> thick

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
can see i mean that's that's how thick

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
it is it's really thick and so i would

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.800 
it is it's really thick and so i would
probably<00:04:38.020> take<00:04:38.290> just<00:04:38.650> that<00:04:38.950> little<00:04:39.510> wave<00:04:40.510> at

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
probably take just that little wave at

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.870 
probably take just that little wave at
the<00:04:40.930> top<00:04:41.140> but<00:04:41.470> ever<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:41.860> is<00:04:41.980> a<00:04:42.010> little<00:04:42.370> dollop

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
the top but ever that is a little dollop

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.920 
the top but ever that is a little dollop
um<00:04:43.740> no<00:04:44.740> more<00:04:44.980> than<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.610> is<00:04:45.940> stuff<00:04:46.300> it

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
they kind of work it through and lastly

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.380 
they kind of work it through and lastly
I<00:04:59.410> apply<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.190> got<00:05:00.640> to<00:05:00.880> be<00:05:01.030> playful

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
I apply the got to be playful

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.110 
I apply the got to be playful
texturizing<00:05:02.290> pomade<00:05:03.040> that's<00:05:04.000> mouthful<00:05:04.510> um

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
texturizing pomade that's mouthful um

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.110 
texturizing pomade that's mouthful um
this<00:05:07.120> is<00:05:07.540> its<00:05:07.930> kind<00:05:08.380> of<00:05:08.530> foamy<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.160> texture<00:05:09.850> I

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
this is its kind of foamy the texture I

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.990 
this is its kind of foamy the texture I
don't<00:05:10.750> know<00:05:10.840> if<00:05:10.960> you<00:05:11.050> can<00:05:11.170> see<00:05:11.380> that<00:05:11.590> too<00:05:11.770> well

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
don't know if you can see that too well

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.940 
don't know if you can see that too well
but<00:05:13.000> it's<00:05:13.150> really<00:05:13.510> light<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:13.780> airy<00:05:14.290> in<00:05:14.620> it<00:05:14.770> I

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
but it's really light and airy in it I

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.860 
but it's really light and airy in it I
think<00:05:15.280> it<00:05:15.370> helps<00:05:15.490> boost<00:05:15.910> my<00:05:16.150> hair<00:05:16.300> quite<00:05:16.630> a<00:05:16.690> bit

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
think it helps boost my hair quite a bit

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.490 
think it helps boost my hair quite a bit
and<00:05:17.100> so<00:05:18.100> then<00:05:18.310> after<00:05:18.490> that<00:05:19.050> there's<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.200> really

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
and so then after that there's a really

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.110 
and so then after that there's a really
important<00:05:21.040> part<00:05:21.130> about<00:05:21.310> when<00:05:21.640> your<00:05:21.850> hair<00:05:22.090> is

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
of an old t-shirt as you can see there's

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.360 
of an old t-shirt as you can see there's

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
like a whole there's it is the whole but

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.390 
like a whole there's it is the whole but
basically<00:06:36.940> these<00:06:37.810> are

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
basically these are

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.070 
basically these are
like<00:06:40.150> this<00:06:40.690> part<00:06:40.930> is<00:06:41.139> the<00:06:42.449> that<00:06:43.449> part<00:06:43.810> of<00:06:43.960> the

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
like this part is the that part of the

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.590 
like this part is the that part of the
sleeve<00:06:44.410> it's<00:06:44.860> it<00:06:45.790> was<00:06:45.910> a<00:06:45.940> short<00:06:46.150> sleeve<00:06:46.389> shirt

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
sleeve it's it was a short sleeve shirt

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.499 
sleeve it's it was a short sleeve shirt
and<00:06:46.870> then<00:06:47.440> this<00:06:48.280> middle<00:06:48.669> part<00:06:48.850> was<00:06:49.060> the<00:06:49.180> back

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:49.509 
and then this middle part was the back

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.650 
and then this middle part was the back
and<00:06:50.080> that<00:06:50.139> was<00:06:51.130> the<00:06:51.250> other<00:06:51.280> sleeve<00:06:51.729> and<00:06:52.030> so

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
and that was the other sleeve and so

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.529 
and that was the other sleeve and so
basically<00:06:53.880> why<00:06:54.880> this<00:06:54.940> is<00:06:55.180> good<00:06:55.360> it's<00:06:55.479> a

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:55.539 
basically why this is good it's a

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:57.330 
basically why this is good it's a
hundred<00:06:55.780> percent<00:06:55.870> cotton<00:06:56.199> and<00:06:56.590> so<00:06:56.710> it<00:06:56.860> it

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
hundred percent cotton and so it it

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.070 
hundred percent cotton and so it it
