00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:05.630
 what we are going to do now is to continue with the application of this rule is khan 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.879
 in this case they go from the images that are already scanned to the computer 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.289
 As I told you before, you have to wait for the information from a micro memory 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.839
 sd 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.869
 according to the story of the day use a card reader directly 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:20.869
 insert it 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.500
 and know the noses of the reader and is that in the computer however to achieve 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.509
 what you do is use the scanner directly 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.079
 incorrect 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.640
 the scanner to the computer through 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.800
 the wire 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.570
 as you see immediately the unit was recognized by the computer if I 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.670
 now 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.110
 ago double click 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.250
 what I'm going to see are the folders that are 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.400
 stored inside the memory and in particular voice of the one who has - the 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.570
 documents and here I can see then the two images we have to change the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.500
 vicenzi top 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
 here we have the final 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.470
 we do politics 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.550
 and let's see 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.690
 the scanned image 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.140
 which is a true copy Jesus is a very good copy 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.310
 I remind you that the scanner can fix in 300 and in 620 and both in color and in 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.440
 black and white 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.430
 another thing 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.520
 of san quintÃ­n this device is that you can also use it as the tip 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.910
 enter with a device for storage of information 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.360
 I can pass 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.070
 an excel file 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.280
 to the memory of the scanner and I can take this information with me 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.530
 obviously 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.480
 the scanner does not process choice as an image or nothing is simply 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.610
 acting at this time as a criminal as a storage device for 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.720
 data that is connected merit have the elements 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.210
 I can go out to work 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.009
 The caricom simply goes and imposed a credit card and guarantees 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.580
 I have complete and definitive manga 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.490
 In short, we are facing a high quality portable scanner 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.800
 what is to merge with common batteries can also put batteries 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.270
 rechargeable and in double size to 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.150
 stores the information in humor in a micro sd memory is connected through 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.599
 google looks at the computer 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.629
 as in force very portable very compact solid barak has the possibility of 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.029
 scan 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:32.199
 three hundred pilsen sit down and this positions it with this button 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.230
 You can choose 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.300
 color black and white and this the other vote 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:43.529
 maresca is going to be present in argentina and we really believe what to do 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.980
