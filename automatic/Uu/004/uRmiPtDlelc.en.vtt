line and fiberglass because of the
nature<00:00:52.629> of<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:53.019> recovery<00:00:53.649> of<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:54.039> fibers

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
slower fly cast the mass on the rod and

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.410 
slower fly cast the mass on the rod and
the<00:01:02.079> recovery<00:01:02.469> of<00:01:02.829> those<00:01:02.979> fibers<00:01:03.489> give<00:01:04.210> you<00:01:04.390> a

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
the recovery of those fibers give you a

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.260 
the recovery of those fibers give you a
little<00:01:04.780> vibration<00:01:05.350> that<00:01:06.219> turns<00:01:06.520> into<00:01:06.759> feel

little vibration that turns into feel

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.660 
little vibration that turns into feel
and<00:01:07.600> I<00:01:07.960> think<00:01:08.259> you<00:01:08.350> can<00:01:08.560> feel<00:01:08.859> the<00:01:09.039> cast<00:01:09.280> more

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
and I think you can feel the cast more

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.760 
and I think you can feel the cast more
with<00:01:09.909> a<00:01:09.939> fiberglass<00:01:10.420> rod<00:01:10.869> then<00:01:11.259> you<00:01:11.409> can<00:01:11.619> with

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
with a fiberglass rod then you can with

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.920 
with a fiberglass rod then you can with

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810

these<00:01:20.380> rods<00:01:20.649> have<00:01:20.950> what<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.159> call<00:01:21.429> a<00:01:21.460> smooth

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
these rods have what I call a smooth

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.719 
these rods have what I call a smooth
modest<00:01:22.630> action<00:01:23.229> that<00:01:23.950> means<00:01:24.100> it's<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.399> nice

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
modest action that means it's a nice

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.700 
modest action that means it's a nice
progression<00:01:25.119> of<00:01:25.630> Bend<00:01:25.840> from<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.229> tip<00:01:26.469> all<00:01:26.679> the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
fast action where the tips the only

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.169 
fast action where the tips the only
thing<00:01:30.310> doing<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.640> work<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:30.939> they're<00:01:31.060> not

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
thing doing the work and they're not

real sloppy in the bottom end that

real sloppy in the bottom end that
modest<00:01:33.759> action<00:01:34.179> I<00:01:34.270> think<00:01:34.509> really<00:01:34.869> takes

modest action I think really takes

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.830 
modest action I think really takes

flies all the rods are three-piece so

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.980
