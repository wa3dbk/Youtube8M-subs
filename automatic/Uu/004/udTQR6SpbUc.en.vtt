00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
plug-in paint wall basically it's a

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.269 
plug-in paint wall basically it's a
minigame<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.230> objective<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:04.920> color

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
minigame in the objective is to color

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.800 
minigame in the objective is to color
the<00:00:05.430> floor<00:00:05.670> with<00:00:05.879> as<00:00:06.029> many<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.299> your<00:00:06.569> color

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
the floor with as many of your color

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.049 
the floor with as many of your color
blocks<00:00:07.140> as<00:00:07.379> possible<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.490> you<00:00:08.580> do<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:08.849> by

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
blocks as possible and you do this by

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.330 
blocks as possible and you do this by
walking<00:00:09.389> around<00:00:09.559> so<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.679> first<00:00:10.920> command<00:00:11.160> is

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
walking around so the first command is

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.339 
walking around so the first command is
/pw<00:00:12.120> create<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.690> then<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> name<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
/pw create and then the name of the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.200 
/pw create and then the name of the
arena<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:14.070> I've<00:00:14.219> created<00:00:14.400> an<00:00:14.730> arena<00:00:14.969> called

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
arena so I've created an arena called

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.990 
arena so I've created an arena called
test<00:00:15.920> then<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.039> have<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.279> select<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.730> arena

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
test then you have to select the arena

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.349 
test then you have to select the arena
so<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.830> /pw<00:00:19.830> one<00:00:20.609> then<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.029> gives<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
so you do /pw one then it gives you the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.929 
so you do /pw one then it gives you the
one<00:00:21.539> tool<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.859> obviously<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.340> go<00:00:23.670> along<00:00:23.880> and

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
one tool and obviously just go along and

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.640 
one tool and obviously just go along and
select<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> floor<00:00:24.779> we've<00:00:25.019> left<00:00:25.230> click<00:00:25.470> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
select the floor we've left click and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
right click to select the first and

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.429 
right click to select the first and
second<00:00:27.570> positions<00:00:28.849> then<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.060> type<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.510> /pw

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
second positions then just type in /pw

I need to set the spawn points so you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.929 
I need to set the spawn points so you
find<00:01:07.740> where<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.950> want<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> go<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.810> /pw

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.899 
of the arena you'll see that I do
actually<00:01:16.710> mess<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.070> up<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> video<00:01:17.580> here

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
actually mess it up in the video here

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.460 
actually mess it up in the video here
but<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.869> correct<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.500> CC<00:01:20.270> PW<00:01:21.270> spawn<00:01:21.570> add<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
but I do correct it CC PW spawn add the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
name or number of the spawn point and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.520 
name or number of the spawn point and
then<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> name<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> arena

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
then the name of the arena

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.249 
then the name of the arena
so<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.820> name<00:01:26.970> mine<00:01:27.270> 1<00:01:27.540> 2<00:01:27.780> 3<00:01:28.020> &amp;<00:01:28.229> 4

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
so I'm just going to name mine 1 2 3 &amp; 4

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.069 
so I'm just going to name mine 1 2 3 &amp; 4
to<00:01:28.619> keep<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.890> simple<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.630> I'll<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.960> around

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
to keep it simple so I'll just go around

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.780 
to keep it simple so I'll just go around
and<00:01:31.439> set<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:31.920> spawn<00:01:32.189> points<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.729> this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
and set the for spawn points for this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.300 
and set the for spawn points for this
arena<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.619> these<00:01:34.770> next<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.189> each

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
arena you can have these next to each

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.499 
arena you can have these next to each
other<00:01:35.430> because<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.820> doesn't<00:01:36.060> actually<00:01:36.119> matter

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
other because it doesn't actually matter

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.020 
other because it doesn't actually matter
obviously<00:01:36.960> you're<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:37.890> trying<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.670> set<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
obviously you're just trying to set the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.609 
obviously you're just trying to set the
color<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> floor<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:39.990> there's<00:01:40.170> natural

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
color on the floor so there's natural

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.380 
color on the floor so there's natural
PvP<00:01:41.130> elements<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.790> doesn't<00:01:42.060> matter<00:01:42.150> if<00:01:42.270> you

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
PvP elements so it doesn't matter if you

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.160 
PvP elements so it doesn't matter if you
spawn<00:01:42.630> next<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> each<00:01:43.140> other<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.720> now<00:01:45.840> I've<00:01:45.960> set

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
spawn next to each other so now I've set

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.649 
spawn next to each other so now I've set
the<00:01:46.259> full<00:01:46.439> spawn<00:01:46.740> points<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.570> do

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the full spawn points so now I can do

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.710 
the full spawn points so now I can do
the<00:01:48.780> same<00:01:48.960> command<00:01:49.259> again<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.829> check<00:01:50.720> so

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the same command again just to check so

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.910 
the same command again just to check so
you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.869> see<00:01:51.990> everything's<00:01:52.439> working<00:01:52.829> this

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
you can see everything's working this

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.520 
you can see everything's working this
time<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.610> /pw<00:01:54.600> edit<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.170> then<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
time so you do /pw edit and then the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.100 
time so you do /pw edit and then the
arena<00:01:55.770> name<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.329> puts<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.719> out<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.960> edit

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
arena name and this puts it out of edit

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.910 
arena name and this puts it out of edit
mode<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.710> now<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.250> played<00:01:59.490> on<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.770> now

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
mode so now it can be played on so now

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.370 
mode so now it can be played on so now
all<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.820> /pw<00:02:03.780> join<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.320> then

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
all you have to do is /pw join and then

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
all you have to do is /pw join and then
the<00:02:04.560> arena<00:02:04.799> name<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.310> you'll<00:02:05.460> join<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.820> arena

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
the arena name and you'll join the arena

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.809 
the arena name and you'll join the arena
so<00:02:06.979> before<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.069> play<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> game<00:02:08.369> we're<00:02:08.700> just

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
so before we play a game we're just

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.130 
so before we play a game we're just
going<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.000> quickly<00:02:09.179> run<00:02:09.420> over<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> config

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
going to quickly run over the config

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.830 
going to quickly run over the config
files<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.209> open<00:02:12.690> up<00:02:12.750> your<00:02:12.930> config

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
files so you open up your config

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.809 
files so you open up your config
you're<00:02:13.959> going<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.379> arena<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:15.370> then<00:02:15.459> open<00:02:15.760> up

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
you're going to arena and then open up

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.420 
you're going to arena and then open up
the<00:02:16.000> arena<00:02:16.209> name<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:17.950> can<00:02:18.040> see<00:02:18.160> it's<00:02:18.310> not

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
the arena name so you can see it's not

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.400 
the arena name so you can see it's not
in<00:02:18.550> edit<00:02:18.790> mode<00:02:18.819> anymore<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.959> can<00:02:20.110> disable

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
in edit mode anymore you can disable

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.869 
in edit mode anymore you can disable
hunger<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:20.980> all<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.190> sort<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.459> thing

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
hunger and all that sort of thing

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.699 
hunger and all that sort of thing
I<00:02:21.910> just<00:02:22.180> leave<00:02:22.360> all<00:02:22.569> this<00:02:22.690> as<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.560> can

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
I just leave all this as it is you can

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.170 
I just leave all this as it is you can
add<00:02:23.830> commands<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.489> you<00:02:24.580> can<00:02:24.730> use<00:02:24.910> if<00:02:25.060> you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
add commands that you can use if you

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.320 
add commands that you can use if you
want<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.890> one<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.040> do<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.610> duration<00:02:28.239> I

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
want this is the one I do the duration I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.410 
want this is the one I do the duration I
tend<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.720> change<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.379> a<00:02:29.500> minute<00:02:30.299> and<00:02:31.299> then

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
tend to change to just a minute and then

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.030 
tend to change to just a minute and then
also<00:02:31.569> start<00:02:31.810> percent<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:32.739> is<00:02:32.890> the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
also start percent this is the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.380 
also start percent this is the
percentage<00:02:33.519> of<00:02:33.610> players<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.239> need

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
percentage of players that you need

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.690 
percentage of players that you need
before<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:34.840> game<00:02:35.019> starts<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.769> tend<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.489> set

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
before the game starts I tend to set

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.400 
before the game starts I tend to set
this<00:02:36.819> low<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.780> can<00:02:37.930> play<00:02:38.110> with<00:02:38.140> two

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
this low so that you can play with two

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.699 
this low so that you can play with two
players<00:02:39.599> but<00:02:40.599> obviously<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.140> is<00:02:41.290> based<00:02:41.500> on

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
players but obviously this is based on

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.130 
players but obviously this is based on
how<00:02:41.860> many<00:02:41.920> spawn<00:02:42.280> points<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.730> set<00:02:42.970> brush<00:02:43.840> size

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
how many spawn points you set brush size

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.720 
how many spawn points you set brush size
depending<00:02:44.739> on<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.890> size<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.340> your<00:02:45.400> arena

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
depending on the size of your arena

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.520 
depending on the size of your arena
maybe<00:02:46.120> if<00:02:46.269> you've<00:02:46.420> got<00:02:46.569> a<00:02:46.599> massive<00:02:46.989> arena<00:02:47.349> for

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
maybe if you've got a massive arena for

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.270 
maybe if you've got a massive arena for
16<00:02:47.950> players<00:02:48.720> you'll<00:02:49.720> set<00:02:49.989> it<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.290> 5<00:02:50.500> or<00:02:50.709> 6<00:02:50.980> I'm

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
16 players you'll set it to 5 or 6 I'm

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.330 
16 players you'll set it to 5 or 6 I'm
just<00:02:51.549> going<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.700> leave<00:02:51.849> mine<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.299> default

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
just going to leave mine is the default

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.100 
just going to leave mine is the default
obviously<00:02:54.340> power-ups<00:02:54.849> I've<00:02:55.060> enabled<00:02:55.299> I<00:02:55.780> want

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
obviously power-ups I've enabled I want

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.660 
obviously power-ups I've enabled I want
to<00:02:56.170> change<00:02:56.470> these<00:02:56.709> though<00:02:56.980> because<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.400> arena

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
to change these though because the arena

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.640 
to change these though because the arena
is<00:02:57.790> only<00:02:57.910> on<00:02:58.090> for<00:02:58.299> 60<00:02:58.660> seconds<00:02:59.079> so<00:02:59.349> I<00:02:59.410> want<00:02:59.440> to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
is only on for 60 seconds so I want to

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.720 
is only on for 60 seconds so I want to
change<00:02:59.860> them<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.280> 10<00:03:00.489> 20<00:03:00.790> 30<00:03:01.060> 40<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.390> 50<00:03:02.730> and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
change them to 10 20 30 40 and 50 and

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.160 
change them to 10 20 30 40 and 50 and
then<00:03:03.849> there's<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.120> list<00:03:04.329> of<00:03:04.450> all<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.720> power-ups

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
then there's a list of all the power-ups

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.660 
then there's a list of all the power-ups
that<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.560> get<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.099> these<00:03:06.220> will<00:03:06.459> just<00:03:06.579> be

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
that you get so these will just be

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.660 
that you get so these will just be
randomly<00:03:07.150> assigned<00:03:07.890> but<00:03:08.890> obviously<00:03:09.310> if<00:03:09.489> I've

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
randomly assigned but obviously if I've

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.699 
randomly assigned but obviously if I've
got<00:03:09.819> a<00:03:09.849> 60-second<00:03:10.690> arena<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.290> some<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.620> these

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
got a 60-second arena and some of these

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.190 
got a 60-second arena and some of these
power-ups<00:03:12.099> are<00:03:12.370> lasting<00:03:12.730> for<00:03:12.970> 22<00:03:13.480> seconds<00:03:14.019> for

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
power-ups are lasting for 22 seconds for

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.020 
power-ups are lasting for 22 seconds for
instance<00:03:14.560> that's<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.340> long<00:03:15.489> time<00:03:15.730> for<00:03:15.970> a

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
instance that's a long time for a

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.160 
instance that's a long time for a
powerup<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.540> be<00:03:16.629> lasting

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
powerup to be lasting

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.050 
powerup to be lasting
so<00:03:17.319> you<00:03:17.379> just<00:03:17.769> change<00:03:18.010> these<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.579> won't<00:03:18.850> do<00:03:18.970> it

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
so you just change these I won't do it

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.840 
so you just change these I won't do it
here<00:03:19.239> but<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.600> would<00:03:19.900> do<00:03:20.049> in<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.260> actual<00:03:20.380> one

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
here but I would do in the actual one

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.220 
here but I would do in the actual one
and<00:03:21.850> then<00:03:21.970> you've<00:03:22.090> got<00:03:22.120> rewards<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.810> don't<00:03:23.049> want

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
and then you've got rewards I don't want

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.629 
and then you've got rewards I don't want
item<00:03:23.500> rewards<00:03:23.889> so<00:03:24.010> I'll<00:03:24.100> set<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.609> false

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
item rewards so I'll set that to false

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.030 
item rewards so I'll set that to false
and<00:03:25.180> I'll<00:03:25.750> set<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.109> money<00:03:26.290> reward<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.859> lower

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
and I'll set the money reward to lower

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.759 
and I'll set the money reward to lower
so<00:03:27.370> 100<00:03:27.850> then<00:03:28.660> all<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.870> do<00:03:28.989> is<00:03:29.019> save<00:03:29.380> it<00:03:29.620> and

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
so 100 then all you do is save it and

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.170 
so 100 then all you do is save it and
then<00:03:30.010> I'll<00:03:30.130> show<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.340> an<00:03:30.519> example<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:31.000> playing

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
then I'll show you an example of playing

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.110 
then I'll show you an example of playing
it<00:03:31.359> now<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:33.040> three<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.430> us<00:03:33.519> have<00:03:33.670> joined<00:03:33.910> all

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
it now so three of us have joined all

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.460 
it now so three of us have joined all
you<00:03:34.209> have<00:03:34.299> to<00:03:34.389> do<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:34.599> type<00:03:34.810> ready<00:03:35.049> into<00:03:35.380> the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
you have to do is type ready into the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.110 
you have to do is type ready into the
chat<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:36.010> then<00:03:36.250> it'll<00:03:36.370> actually<00:03:36.519> start<00:03:37.000> the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
chat and then it'll actually start the

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.280 
chat and then it'll actually start the
game<00:03:39.120> then<00:03:40.120> when<00:03:40.269> you<00:03:40.359> run<00:03:40.480> around<00:03:40.630> your<00:03:41.049> color

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
game then when you run around your color

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.729 
game then when you run around your color
wool<00:03:41.500> was<00:03:41.620> placed<00:03:41.859> on<00:03:42.069> the<00:03:42.160> floor<00:03:42.400> and

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
wool was placed on the floor and

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.289 
wool was placed on the floor and
hopefully<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:44.859> a<00:03:44.919> minute<00:03:45.190> after<00:03:45.609> 10<00:03:45.819> seconds

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
hopefully in a minute after 10 seconds

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.759 
hopefully in a minute after 10 seconds
the<00:03:46.510> first<00:03:46.720> powerup<00:03:47.319> should<00:03:47.530> spawn<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.680> you

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
the first powerup should spawn so you

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.039 
the first powerup should spawn so you
can<00:03:50.889> see<00:03:51.040> it's<00:03:51.190> here<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:52.450> I've<00:03:52.540> got<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.810> boots

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
can see it's here so I've got the boots

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.990 
can see it's here so I've got the boots
and<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.440> boots<00:03:54.069> meaning<00:03:54.459> I've<00:03:54.549> got<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.760> speed

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
and the boots meaning I've got the speed

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.120 
and the boots meaning I've got the speed
powerup<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.750> can<00:03:55.959> run<00:03:56.109> around<00:03:56.230> faster<00:03:57.010> than

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
powerup so I can run around faster than

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.000 
powerup so I can run around faster than
the<00:03:57.220> other<00:03:57.340> players<00:03:58.590> then<00:03:59.590> we<00:03:59.680> just<00:03:59.769> have<00:03:59.919> to

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
the other players then we just have to

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.099 
the other players then we just have to
keep<00:04:00.160> an<00:04:00.340> eye<00:04:00.430> out<00:04:00.459> for<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.819> next<00:04:00.940> powerup<00:04:01.419> so

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
keep an eye out for the next powerup so

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.509 
keep an eye out for the next powerup so
you<00:04:02.200> can<00:04:02.319> see<00:04:02.470> he<00:04:02.620> got<00:04:02.799> that<00:04:02.919> one<00:04:03.069> so<00:04:03.280> he's<00:04:03.400> got

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
you can see he got that one so he's got

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.400 
you can see he got that one so he's got
bigger<00:04:03.760> brush<00:04:04.000> so<00:04:04.359> when<00:04:04.510> he<00:04:04.599> walks<00:04:04.840> around<00:04:05.139> his

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
bigger brush so when he walks around his

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.080 
bigger brush so when he walks around his
brush<00:04:05.650> that's<00:04:05.889> far<00:04:06.250> more<00:04:06.430> than<00:04:06.579> ours<00:04:06.760> does<00:04:09.090> and

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
brush that's far more than ours does and

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.610 
brush that's far more than ours does and
then<00:04:10.209> you<00:04:10.299> just<00:04:10.450> keep<00:04:10.569> searching<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:11.290> see<00:04:11.319> who

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
then you just keep searching to see who

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.960 
then you just keep searching to see who
gets<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.950> bigger<00:04:12.130> power-ups<00:04:12.669> and<00:04:12.880> stuff<00:04:14.970> so

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
gets the bigger power-ups and stuff so

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.150 
gets the bigger power-ups and stuff so
now<00:04:16.120> he's<00:04:16.269> got<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.510> tiny<00:04:16.750> brush<00:04:17.019> power<00:04:17.289> which

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
now he's got the tiny brush power which

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.110 
now he's got the tiny brush power which
basically<00:04:18.549> puts<00:04:18.910> all<00:04:19.060> our<00:04:19.209> brushes<00:04:19.450> tiny<00:04:21.120> so

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
basically puts all our brushes tiny so

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.330 
basically puts all our brushes tiny so
this<00:04:22.360> one<00:04:22.539> actually<00:04:22.659> sucks<00:04:23.169> now<00:04:23.680> I<00:04:23.979> can't

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
this one actually sucks now I can't

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.040 
this one actually sucks now I can't
cover<00:04:24.550> as<00:04:24.700> much<00:04:24.820> ground<00:04:24.880> as<00:04:25.270> he<00:04:25.450> can

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.240 

so<00:04:29.050> at<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.230> end<00:04:29.260> of<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.560> game<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:29.950> will<00:04:30.070> tell
