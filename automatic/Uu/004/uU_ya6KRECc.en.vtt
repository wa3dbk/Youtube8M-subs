snare drum of course and I may use these
top<00:00:36.430> two<00:00:36.699> Tom's<00:00:36.940> so<00:00:37.180> as<00:00:37.269> long<00:00:37.390> as<00:00:37.540> they<00:00:37.600> have

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
two rack toms and then a bunch of

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.579 
two rack toms and then a bunch of
symbols<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.269> whack<00:00:40.480> that<00:00:41.019> would<00:00:41.140> be<00:00:41.199> cool<00:00:41.320> so

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
symbols to whack that would be cool so

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.979 
symbols to whack that would be cool so
basically<00:00:42.309> this<00:00:42.489> is<00:00:42.610> a<00:00:42.640> fill<00:00:42.879> within<00:00:43.360> a<00:00:43.510> groove

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
basically this is a fill within a groove

groove<00:00:46.329> or<00:00:46.540> even<00:00:46.809> a<00:00:46.900> straight<00:00:47.110> forward<00:00:47.290> groove

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
groove or even a straight forward groove

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.410

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:52.869 
in so let's make sure my ear plug is in

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:56.490 
in so let's make sure my ear plug is in

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
basically the fill is down with the

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.149 
basically the fill is down with the
snare<00:01:40.929> and<00:01:41.170> because<00:01:41.679> you're<00:01:41.799> already<00:01:41.950> playing
