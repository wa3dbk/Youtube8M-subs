00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.810 
apartment that has these in it and and
so<00:01:49.350> i<00:01:49.380> bought<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> bunch<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.280> them<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> same

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
so i bought a bunch of them at the same

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.910 
so i bought a bunch of them at the same
time<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.780> i<00:01:52.049> know<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.439> were<00:01:52.500> three<00:01:52.680> dollars

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
time but i know there were three dollars

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.020 
time but i know there were three dollars
per<00:01:53.070> box<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.520> could<00:01:53.640> probably<00:01:53.820> actually

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
per box and you could probably actually

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.209 
per box and you could probably actually
sit<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:55.439> probably<00:01:55.770> would<00:01:55.860> take<00:01:56.009> two

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
sit like it probably would take two

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.920 
sit like it probably would take two
boxes<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:56.939> two<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.299> them<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.570> us<00:01:57.659> because<00:01:57.869> i

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
boxes to do two of them but us because i

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.209 
boxes to do two of them but us because i
think<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.170> was<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.710> little<00:01:58.829> bit<00:01:59.040> over<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
think this was like a little bit over a

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.060 
think this was like a little bit over a
half<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.210> box<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.920> they<00:02:02.040> just

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
half of the box for this so they just

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.770 
half of the box for this so they just
look<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.210> they're<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.750> know

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
look like this and they're just you know

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.010 
look like this and they're just you know
the<00:02:04.820> very<00:02:05.820> small<00:02:06.210> but<00:02:06.570> they<00:02:06.630> don't<00:02:06.810> go

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
the very small but they don't go

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.490 
the very small but they don't go
anywhere<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.599> whenever

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
anywhere so so that whenever

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.150 
anywhere so so that whenever
I<00:02:13.910> take<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.120> my<00:02:15.270> brush<00:02:15.600> just<00:02:16.320> like<00:02:16.530> things<00:02:17.010> in

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
I take like my brush just like things in

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.470 
I take like my brush just like things in
there<00:02:17.870> like<00:02:18.870> us<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.890> saying<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.400> guess<00:02:20.610> so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
there like us is like saying I guess so

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.340 
there like us is like saying I guess so
i<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:21.690> stick<00:02:22.050> them<00:02:22.140> all<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.470> there

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.590 

so

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
so

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.460
