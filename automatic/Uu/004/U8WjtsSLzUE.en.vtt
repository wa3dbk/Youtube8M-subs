the<00:01:42.460> Tower<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:42.730> shadows<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:43.750> this<00:01:43.900> name

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
the Tower of shadows so this name

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.899 
the Tower of shadows so this name
something<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:44.830> I<00:01:44.950> put<00:01:45.190> a<00:01:45.220> lot<00:01:45.400> of<00:01:45.460> effort

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
something that I put a lot of effort

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.060 
something that I put a lot of effort
into<00:01:46.060> was<00:01:46.600> making<00:01:47.050> sure<00:01:47.229> all<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.590> spectrums

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
into was making sure all the spectrums

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.130 
into was making sure all the spectrums
played<00:01:48.340> completely<00:01:48.610> differently<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:49.990> all

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
played completely differently that all

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.960 
played completely differently that all
of<00:01:50.229> them<00:01:50.320> had<00:01:50.560> their<00:01:50.770> only<00:01:51.100> movements<00:01:51.790> in

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
of them had their only movements in

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.670 
of them had their only movements in
attacks<00:01:52.300> that<00:01:52.540> that<00:01:52.720> their<00:01:52.870> apparent<00:01:53.350> silver

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
attacks that that their apparent silver

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.510 
attacks that that their apparent silver
sonality

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
sonality

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.179 
sonality
no<00:01:56.119> mo<00:01:56.420> not<00:01:56.630> in<00:01:56.840> since<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.439> battle<00:01:57.740> system<00:01:57.920> is

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
no mo not in since the battle system is

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.760 
no mo not in since the battle system is
not<00:01:58.369> concentrated<00:01:59.119> on<00:01:59.240> Roland<00:01:59.719> each<00:02:00.229> spectral

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
not concentrated on Roland each spectral

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.620 
not concentrated on Roland each spectral
is<00:02:00.920> different<00:02:01.340> by<00:02:01.429> how<00:02:01.609> they<00:02:01.640> attack<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:02.450> move

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
is different by how they attack and move

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.389 
is different by how they attack and move
so<00:02:03.259> players<00:02:03.530> will<00:02:03.710> have<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.829> reason<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.250> pick

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
so players will have a reason to pick

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.609 
so players will have a reason to pick
specific<00:02:04.610> spectrobes<00:02:05.479> in<00:02:05.630> battle<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.140> we'll

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
specific spectrobes in battle and we'll

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.669 
specific spectrobes in battle and we'll
be<00:02:06.710> able<00:02:06.829> to<00:02:07.039> utilize<00:02:07.399> their<00:02:07.640> unique<00:02:07.909> aspects

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
be able to utilize their unique aspects

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.540 
be able to utilize their unique aspects
when<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.769> got<00:02:09.890> schooled<00:02:10.160> on<00:02:10.220> thinking

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
when you got schooled on thinking

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.070 
when you got schooled on thinking
players<00:02:10.759> will<00:02:10.940> be<00:02:11.030> able<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.269> unearth<00:02:11.450> 48

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
players will be able to unearth 48

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.750 
players will be able to unearth 48
different<00:02:12.260> unique<00:02:12.620> spectra<00:02:13.069> bottles<00:02:13.549> then

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
different unique spectra bottles then

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.949 
different unique spectra bottles then
they'll<00:02:13.879> be<00:02:13.970> able<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.120> train<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.540> evolve<00:02:14.750> them

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
they'll be able to train and evolve them

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.390 
they'll be able to train and evolve them
to<00:02:15.049> their<00:02:15.170> adult<00:02:15.410> forms<00:02:15.799> so<00:02:16.010> we're<00:02:16.129> looking<00:02:16.340> at

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
to their adult forms so we're looking at

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.009 
to their adult forms so we're looking at
about<00:02:16.489> a<00:02:16.610> harness<00:02:16.879> 48<00:02:17.269> unique<00:02:17.540> spectrobes

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
about a harness 48 unique spectrobes

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.300 
about a harness 48 unique spectrobes
that<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.290> player<00:02:18.500> will<00:02:18.680> be<00:02:18.709> able<00:02:18.799> to<00:02:19.010> control

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
that the player will be able to control

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.699 
that the player will be able to control
then<00:02:20.239> when<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:20.840> factor<00:02:21.049> in<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.349> different

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
then when you factor in the different

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.350 
then when you factor in the different
color<00:02:21.860> variations<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.670> different<00:02:22.700> custom

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
color variations the different custom

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.119 
color variations the different custom
parts<00:02:23.629> also<00:02:24.349> some<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.620> them<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.799> asgard

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
parts also some of them of asgard

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.770 
parts also some of them of asgard
version<00:02:25.549> so<00:02:26.120> we're<00:02:26.209> looking<00:02:26.299> at<00:02:26.480> over<00:02:26.750> a

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
version so we're looking at over a

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.059 
version so we're looking at over a
thousand<00:02:27.260> different<00:02:27.319> combinations<00:02:27.980> of

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
thousand different combinations of

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.009 
thousand different combinations of
spectrum<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.760> can<00:02:28.910> use<00:02:29.000> through<00:02:29.870> the

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
spectrum so you can use through the

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.780 
spectrum so you can use through the
rubble<00:02:30.290> suit<00:02:30.470> one<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.370> problems<00:02:31.730> that

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
rubble suit one of the problems that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.699 
rubble suit one of the problems that
exist<00:02:32.180> with<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.569> first<00:02:32.780> battle<00:02:33.140> system<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.590> it

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
exist with the first battle system in it

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.050 
exist with the first battle system in it
was<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.220> players<00:02:34.459> felt<00:02:34.730> they<00:02:34.880> weren't

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
was it the players felt they weren't

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.120 
was it the players felt they weren't
patrolling<00:02:35.660> inscriptions<00:02:36.200> instead<00:02:37.010> they

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
patrolling inscriptions instead they

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.880 
patrolling inscriptions instead they
were<00:02:37.190> ultimately<00:02:37.549> controlling<00:02:38.299> Rawlings<00:02:38.890> so

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
were ultimately controlling Rawlings so

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.920 
were ultimately controlling Rawlings so
we<00:02:40.010> split<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.430> battle<00:02:40.730> system<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.390> by<00:02:41.750> doing

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
we split the battle system and by doing

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.330 
we split the battle system and by doing
that<00:02:42.049> it's<00:02:42.319> Egypt<00:02:42.500> where<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.860> players<00:02:43.130> to

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
that it's Egypt where the players to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.800 
that it's Egypt where the players to
feel<00:02:43.579> the<00:02:43.700> main<00:02:43.910> characters<00:02:44.360> are<00:02:44.599> doing

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
feel the main characters are doing

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.990 
feel the main characters are doing
special<00:02:45.290> abilities<00:02:45.739> while<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.489> specials<00:02:46.910> are

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
special abilities while the specials are

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.729 
special abilities while the specials are
doing<00:02:47.269> their<00:02:47.480> partners<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.140> together<00:02:48.260> they

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
doing their partners and together they

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.500 
doing their partners and together they
create<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.040> team<00:02:49.310> they<00:02:49.880> use<00:02:50.060> their<00:02:50.209> combined

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
create a team they use their combined

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.130 
create a team they use their combined
efforts<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.989> Blanco<00:02:51.349> crawl<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.540> do<00:02:53.629> I<00:02:53.660> muscle

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
efforts to Blanco crawl so do I muscle

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.930 
efforts to Blanco crawl so do I muscle
there's<00:02:54.709> definitely<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.129> unique<00:02:55.340> theme<00:02:55.670> reach

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
there's definitely a unique theme reach

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.030 
there's definitely a unique theme reach
there<00:02:56.209> though<00:02:56.360> that<00:02:56.510> appears<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.930> game<00:02:57.110> for

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
there though that appears the game for

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.170 
there though that appears the game for
characters<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.489> appeared<00:02:58.790> in<00:02:58.849> the<00:02:58.910> first

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
characters that appeared in the first
