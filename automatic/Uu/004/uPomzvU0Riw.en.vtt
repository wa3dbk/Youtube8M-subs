00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
Ironman mini mates

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.420 
Ironman mini mates
very<00:00:45.329> very<00:00:46.110> recently<00:00:46.680> since<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.160> very<00:00:47.370> first

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
very very recently since the very first

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.020 
very very recently since the very first
movie<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:49.070> I<00:00:50.070> think<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> lot<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> hate<00:00:50.850> for

movie but I think a lot of the hate for

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.340 
movie but I think a lot of the hate for
Ironman<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> little<00:00:51.750> unwarranted

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
Ironman is a little unwarranted

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.979
