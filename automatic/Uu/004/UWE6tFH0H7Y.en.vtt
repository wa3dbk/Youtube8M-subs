00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.430
 at 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.160
 and greet everyone that says I hope 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.710
 you have good we will talk today 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.149
 public events in destiny and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.829
 so I explain to you how it works 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.349
 of a small with meetic who was 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.449
 found by our American friends in this 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.099
 regarding the rotation of events 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.140
 public on different planets to 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.809
 the horizon to get to the beard part 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.489
 in theory of all this we will talk about 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.949
 rewards of public events at 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.989
 know the shields of the avant garde so we 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.610
 will focus on the section of 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.440
 the avant-garde is the simplest it's going 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.949
 allow us to understand a little 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.989
 little things 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.509
 when you do a public event 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.199
 in gold you will have four points of the asses 

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.030
 avant garde 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.159
 when you make it into silver three 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.869
 points and bronze two points with these 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.689
 points you will be able to buy some 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:01.890
 legendary weapons and armor from 

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:02.339
 of the avant-garde faction then 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.049
 Warning 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.360
 you can buy them provided 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.369
 to be jars in 2d steam from the front 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.579
 so keep it there will have to mount your 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.960
 faction up to 2 and you go 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.850
 so be able to buy equipment 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.470
 so either wear them for those who do not 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.570
 are not yet at level 29 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.189
 and for those who are level 29 super 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.050
 mega forts that have raid armor 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.700
 and just waiting for splinters 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.080
 of attention and well you will be able 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.670
 dismantle them 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.500
 so the point of all this is you 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.170
 save avant-garde ecus so 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.850
 armor so the level or so of the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.110
 climbing energies strange coins 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.790
 finally a little all these materials 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.650
 ascension so you could 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.080
 possibly needing to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.630
 improve your different weapons and 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.250
 armor so now that we did the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.590
 round of rewards we will linger 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.470
 on a particular website I 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.540
 think the most interesting the most reliable 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.070
 about these public events so 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.420
 so that you understand all that in 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.060
 detail we will go to the sites 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.170
 destiny public events.com I'll go 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.909
 put the site link in the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.380
 destruction do not worry so 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.270
 you have the first basics site 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.130
 information we do not care a bit it's 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.540
 a little the blah blah the explanation of their 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.069
 theory all that if you're interested 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.750
 you can go see for the maths 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.860
 scientists all that you can 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.299
 them for a ride and watch a 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.670
 little how does it work 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.230
 for those who want concrete and 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.629
 live you go on we're going 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.310
 take the 1st map the old Russian land 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.140
 so will be the most obvious one that any 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.540
 the world knows we'll analyze a little 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.249
 little bit of that so we can see that there is 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.850
 five different events the coast 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:31.730
 forget about sky watch planes 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.860
 the spawn area under exploration and the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.200
 division so these events are either 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.580
 in orange in red or glass why 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.710
 it's simply relative to their 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.780
 frequency of appearance you can 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.760
 notice that so planes and the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.800
 division so opinions in this sense couch 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.030
 for those who did not understand 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.590
 are in green ie they are 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.090
 the public events that have the most 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.370
 of chances to appear then it's not 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.900
 100% but you have more luck 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.240
 to meet these public events 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.370
 when they are in glass in orange so 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.080
 the forgotten dimension and the area to his 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.540
 this is the area where there is the cave the lute 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.650
 cellar formerly patcher and so the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.450
 side forget that's where there are the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.650
 boats these two areas smell orange 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.970
 that is, the chances of 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.400
 meet public events are 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.540
 here very mean and round at the 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.460
 steppes it's just the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.680
 first spawn zone when you launch 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.970
 exploration in the cosmodrome the a7 in 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.900
 red simply because it's 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.940
 very very rare 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.930
 once you understand that there is 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.910
 a hierarchy with respect to 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.190
 the appearance of these public events 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.470
 you will be able to focus on the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.090
 timing which is just below so we 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.010
 realizes that there is a series of 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.050
 numbers versus different 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.700
 spawn so we see that the sky watch will have 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.920
 place in eight minutes the word sierre 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.450
 in nine minutes and the ford motor by 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.640
 example in 15 minutes so everything 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.440
 just the zsl at the public event 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.450
 planes will therefore take place in eight 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.160
 minutes the public name of the cave 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.050
 in nine minutes and the public event 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.560
 boats to the coast forgotten in 15 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.880
 minutes 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.410
 knowing this you're going all 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.030
 naturally be able to make a 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.800
 succession of events so I thought 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.750
 of course dvt the events 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.640
 bring closer for example here sky watch 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.070
 emotions which one minute apart so I 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.690
 think the time you do sky 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.070
 watch and that you go to the 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.200
 cave right after the public event 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.090
 will not take place but if you 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.460
 make that of 8 and that of 15 or 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.410
 23 right behind you well you have to 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.240
 Chances may cumulate 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.770
 public events by doing so a 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.840
 succession of back and forth between 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.640
 different spawn for those who have 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.320
 really but then really do not want to 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.730
 to take the lead knowing that you 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.260
 can just go back and forth 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.780
 between the two green areas 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.550
 it will be faster and more efficient by 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.050
 against you will definitely wait 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.300
 longer of the appearance of 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.670
 the public event in question and for 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.660
 those who have absolutely no desire to 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.700
 to argue 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.590
 the little information is that on the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.460
 division is obvious this is the area where he 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.069
 is the public event of the TV 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.560
 lyon know that this one spawn all 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.419
 the 15 and 45 minutes of each hour 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.250
 so you can do your events 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.830
 repeated public twice an hour 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.900
 by simply staying in this area to 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.240
 condition to be reckless and motivated 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.520
 to wait for them tasks etc also 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.530
 these events are accessible on the 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.360
 moon on venus and on march but the 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.889
 rewards restaurant mothers that's 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.509
 just history to change maybe a 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.039
 little environment and view 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.539
 this is finished I hope this 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.460
 little tutorial will be useful and I will 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:14.690
 see you soon for more tips 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.690
 on destiny ciao
