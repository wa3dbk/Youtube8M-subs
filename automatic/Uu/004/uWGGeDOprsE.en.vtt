00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that would be a recommendation also

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
that would be a recommendation also
those<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.060> new<00:01:25.759> avital<00:01:26.759> has<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> new<00:01:27.240> smaller

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
those the new avital has a new smaller

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.840 
those the new avital has a new smaller
to<00:01:28.380> speed<00:01:28.650> rail<00:01:28.860> that's<00:01:29.159> coming<00:01:29.490> out<00:01:29.610> this

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
to speed rail that's coming out this

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.020 
to speed rail that's coming out this
year<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> smaller<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.799> speed<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.549> reel

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
year and so a smaller to speed of reel

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.749 
year and so a smaller to speed of reel
is<00:01:33.299> something<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.220> two<00:01:35.280> speeds

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
is something that you know two speeds

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.990 
is something that you know two speeds
have<00:01:36.000> been<00:01:36.840> an<00:01:37.650> innovation<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.579> tackle

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
have been an innovation in the tackle

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.810 
have been an innovation in the tackle
industry<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.100> they've<00:01:41.100> really<00:01:41.310> helped<00:01:41.640> out

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
industry and they've really helped out

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
industry and they've really helped out
the<00:01:41.850> angler<00:01:42.360> when<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> heavier<00:01:43.530> fish

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the angler when you get a heavier fish

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.080 
the angler when you get a heavier fish

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
for the right size for the wire that you

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.190 
for the right size for the wire that you
buy<00:04:19.890> by<00:04:20.730> crimps<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.840> are<00:04:21.989> bigger<00:04:22.370> then<00:04:24.200> it's
