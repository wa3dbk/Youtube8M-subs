00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.490
 and Hello to you again this kamikaze 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.730
 again tutorial and present today 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.100
 the issue will be dedicated to the exchange room 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.199
 you will need it only on the server and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.140
 only if the plugin is worth 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.220
 for sharing how does it work here set 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.380
 sides you throw 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.949
 any resources that is for example 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.499
 torch I want to exchange well on the other hand 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.090
 another lesson throws risk resources too 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.600
 who he wants to exchange these resources 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.550
 who threw you like redstone 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.770
 accordingly presses the lever in sign 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.739
 consent to the exchange 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.440
 second player do the same and how 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.829
 see the pistons work and the resources 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.800
 fall up and through the water enters 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.500
 already us yes as you understand this works 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.899
 the diagram on already shown by me bugs with 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.190
 moving resources vertically on 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.190
 unspecified number of blocks 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.850
 built on very just need everything 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.660
 only 4 sticky pistons also two levers and 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 little redstone 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:19.960
 we also how many two torches not even three 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.020
 torch hardly Peter and a bucket of water 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.440
 and for the nameplate we are all witty okay 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.190
 let's start building first thing 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.410
 let's make such a snake from any blocks 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.610
 i just like golden blocks i'm from 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:40.390
 there are a lot of them that matter now here 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:45.690
 in the middle of this snake we put the piston on 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:49.509
 them blocks then we also put blocks here 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.210
 so turn on the day on these blocks we set 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.570
 piston from another country also put 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.700
 block we put on it, too, the piston and 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.860
 these guys, too, fasten blocks 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.260
 that is, whether or not let them be 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.570
 gold blocks 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:09.030
 next we have to do the wall walls 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:15.840
 you should already be or you should be them too 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:18.200
 will build I do not know at all but this 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.460
 the scheme is one very big minus 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.890
 is that you do not see 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.230
 how much 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.950
 items threw blog my threw player 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.520
 for exchange 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.460
 although you can read them just as an example 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.570
 seeing how many times will happen 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.100
 from this action let's show 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.960
 You see what they start to fly out 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.980
 and in principle you can even try 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:48.770
 count them by the way I have a mod 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.770
 3 yes it is probably noticed by us 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.230
 I put it on the client for our 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.350
 server as it is impossible to lay 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.460
 that is, you can not even put there 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.290
 Here are all the shaders, he will immediately 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.820
 perry download elk costs protection 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.600
 they will not tell you to 50 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.530
 what kind of protection is it and why is it necessary yes 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.640
 by the way i forgot to comment 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.380
 comment on my action on 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.110
 golden blocks we have to put the glass 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.940
 and checking the glass already make a ceiling out 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.580
 any other blocks or glass 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.970
 although it is better not yet opaque 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.660
 any blocks then do 2 ceiling 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.930
 a block higher than the ceiling 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:41.610
 directly together with together 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.730
 discarding things and now we 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.330
 let's get down to redstone and that's it now 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.620
 all is ready 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.900
 put here well I like to put the lamp 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.520
 when using levers or buttons to 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.710
 it was clear that the lever or button 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.550
 activated well can you not 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:02.840
 do all the more on the server you all 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.050
 there may not be such resources 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.470
 here of course we put on these blocks 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.830
 leverage 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.380
 Further 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.190
 opposite the pistons we put the block here too 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.820
 we put 2 blocks we put redstone 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:24.700
 put redstone should put a diet 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.740
 everything is now doing a notch and there 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.660
 we also put redstone, that is, we put a block 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.750
 grind Peter and under this block set 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.750
 redstone 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.050
 now we do the same here 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:51.080
 here it is ready further here we put the torch 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.080
 and spend liston like this 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:59.759
 we come from this side is our block 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:02.639
 do the same thing here we put the same block 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:05.039
 on his torch that is to say we have this 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:10.800
 big logical element and yourself 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:16.189
 you see and it seems to be all but no, we still 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.770
 didn't do the most important thing namely we didn't 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:22.400
 did the transportation of blocks by 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.930
 no vertical horizontally 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:31.460
 it is done very simply break here 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.460
 block take a sign where we have a sign 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.940
 set me doing the same with the other 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.940
 parties 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.060
 is ready 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.970
 Now 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.639
 here we go through the middle but it 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:52.800
 obviously and around it do bumpers 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:57.150
 then take a bucket of water can glory 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.230
 Better with water according to the version and here 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.160
 do the same 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.160
 pour water 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:08.920
 but ready 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.600
 here we close well and for aesthetics 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.420
 again you can put glu here 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.580
 stone because if the exchange will be 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.000
 occur at night or if you have a city 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.090
 underground, the light will not interfere and think to 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.150
 see example set the night is deep 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.150
 night here we have a little light 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.409
 that room seems to be ready let's 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.190
 check performance 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:37.550
 leave the resources do the same with the other 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.550
 parties 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.520
 is ready 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.740
 push the lever on this side 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.990
 I repeat once again that is this bug 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:52.259
 version works 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:55.560
 145 as I said at 15 that is in 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:57.169
 Redstone update which should go on 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.970
 New Year's Eve 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:01.710
 about fixed all these bugs i.e. 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:05.580
 about fix so this scheme may already 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:09.060
 don't work we start leverage again 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:13.530
 here are our torches floated and accordingly 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:16.639
 other stones stand also emerged applied 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:19.050
 on this all here is such a simple little scheme 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:22.050
 she looks a little inconspicuous of that 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:27.360
 that the pistons are visible but it consumes 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:29.699
 few resources and quite useful but with 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.470
 you were x mikaze subscribe if 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.300
 Do you want to rate this leave 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.889
 your comments and play on the server 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.719
 all old link to me in the description 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:39.870
 join groups by the way about groups 

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:43.319
 VKontakte video I do not post anymore 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:45.539
 I will for vkontakte changed their 

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:47.639
 video sharing strategy with youtube and now 

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:49.560
 view and do not count if you 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:51.870
 watch videos from the contact 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.219
 many bloggers have stopped doing this and but 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.160
 and i'm no exception 

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:58.080
 for viewing for discussions 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.520
 that's how 

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.259
 matter 

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.529
 so there will rather be writing just 

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:09.599
 news related to our channel 

00:08:05.529 --> 00:08:09.599
 well and all good and see you again
