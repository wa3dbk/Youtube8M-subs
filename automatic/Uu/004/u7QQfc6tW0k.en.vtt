00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.760
 Hello, I'm the muscle maker in this 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.559
 video is about choosing the right one 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.210
 weight training that 's not just 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.860
 Decisive how many sentences you make 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.809
 how many repetitions maybe that 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.550
 Bistum was a little more important 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.410
 is that you find the right weight 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.060
 with which you train should there 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.380
 a watch that anyone knows I can 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.910
 in the gym are just where 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.720
 of course, really martial 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.980
 is trained 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.539
 Of course, there are people again 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.130
 the bars fit properly full 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.960
 with weights or just here so what 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.460
 like lastzug so I'll show you 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.530
 repetitions pay, respectively 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.700
 a workout way like me 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.020
 here right on approx 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.210
 the weight is not that great right now 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.230
 a lot could be cleaned very well 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.289
 train to do a clean training 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:51.960
 Of course you can find repetitions here 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.910
 Even at the beginning, it just works 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.620
 sometimes as a small difference makes it 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.600
 just stop at the end of a lot 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.309
 nothing against exclusive training nothing 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.949
 nothing against snow weight training 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.470
 a discharge of the powers of the male 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.030
 national forces at once but completely 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.860
 It is still important in the end that one 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.810
 mastered the weight and exactly at it 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.250
 it often hampers the mastery of the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.900
 Control of the weight is a big one 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 problem if we are very clear now 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.979
 think about what's important in 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.780
 The choice of weight is not only 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.970
 important that you overcome the weight 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.310
 can the concentric execution 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.140
 You can control it, so to speak 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.759
 It is also important that something after that 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.560
 namely isometric is the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.509
 static execution and above all 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.159
 The eccentric also do that exactly 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.720
 there is also a full control of the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.950
 weight I show you times 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.610
 a nice area where you can do that very well 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.619
 able to see 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.649
 maybe I'll take a light one 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:46.439
 weight 1200 kilo hammer here twelve 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.939
 kilogram in the exercise it is like that 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.420
 Of course you are also wholesale 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.430
 can take 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.840
 I could now also 25 per hand 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.549
 Take then you can just 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.930
 Show how I got through here 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.710
 the area later but I'll show you 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.990
 something else 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.640
 It is certainly twelve kilos per hand 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.140
 no weight where you get the whole fitness 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.219
 But studio can impress with that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.630
 nothing works 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.030
 therefore, as many women as possible 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.730
 to impress so that's quite honest 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.920
 and one and only reason 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.690
 possible growth for the right 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.080
 Achieve muscle still looks 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.280
 at times 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.750
 I keep the weight symmetrical 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.090
 a little moment and leave 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.950
 eccentrically slow off I go again 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.680
 fast in concentric phase containing 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.240
 symmetrical little moment inside and 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.440
 Let's go back eccentric salad 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.610
 you could even simplify everything 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.830
 express positive neutral negative though 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.570
 It is important that you are in 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.490
 the neutral and in the negative 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.100
 attitude, as it were, in this movement 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.600
 issue also the control of the weight 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.830
 have when I look at all now 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.580
 I introduce myself here with the double 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.530
 weights that 25 can probably join 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.330
 I do not have the possibility 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.000
 to smash through the care 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.760
 but honestly in the end I only have 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.950
 fear for my shoulders 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.950
 where fear to see my joints around one 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.080
 a bender the potential for injury 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.340
 For the muscle that offers really little 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.500
 black irritates us it is much more important 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.400
 that I control the weight 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.900
 believe that is the very nice 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.760
 execution where you really see 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.540
 At the moment just a moment 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.920
 pause 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.110
 The same applies to the bank press 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.300
 Whole is not trying on pull-ups 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.800
 only to overcome but also once 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.959
 small moment stop and also 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.360
 just the muscle scratch so to speak the 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.860
 eccentric negative phase is accurate 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.660
 the one where he really knew 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.410
 Growing up is needed there 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.810
 to be controlled 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.400
 that's where the execution is right 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.840
 importantly pay attention to the impression 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.370
 nobody else impressed by himself 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.690
 See you in the next video many 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.690
 greetings from your simon
