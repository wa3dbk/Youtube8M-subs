kirkgate is also that I was like so I

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.059

just<00:02:36.909> laid<00:02:37.120> there<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:37.420> silence<00:02:37.870> while<00:02:38.769> he

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
just laid there in silence while he

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.630 
just laid there in silence while he
affixed<00:02:39.459> my<00:02:40.140> oven<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.409> dishwasher<00:02:41.440> or<00:02:42.069> so<00:02:42.610> I

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
affixed my oven and dishwasher or so I

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.640 
affixed my oven and dishwasher or so I
thought<00:02:42.970> dishwasher<00:02:43.780> he<00:02:44.140> left<00:02:44.349> a<00:02:44.440> note<00:02:44.590> saying

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
thought dishwasher he left a note saying

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.410 
thought dishwasher he left a note saying
the<00:02:45.040> oven<00:02:45.340> was<00:02:45.459> fixed<00:02:45.879> and<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.180> working

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
the oven was fixed and it's working

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.960 
the oven was fixed and it's working
which<00:02:47.319> I<00:02:47.829> will<00:02:48.340> be<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.579> judge<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.819> that

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
which I will be the judge of that

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.460 
which I will be the judge of that
because<00:02:49.810> my<00:02:50.470> dishwasher<00:02:51.099> is<00:02:51.160> still<00:02:51.340> broken<00:02:52.470> so

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
because my dishwasher is still broken so

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.729 
because my dishwasher is still broken so
that's<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.190> thing<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:55.720> maybe<00:02:55.959> maybe<00:02:56.230> my<00:02:56.440> oven

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
that's the thing but maybe maybe my oven

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.289 
that's the thing but maybe maybe my oven
will<00:02:56.859> work<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.220> if<00:02:57.310> my<00:02:57.430> oven<00:02:57.700> does<00:02:57.819> work<00:02:58.060> then

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
will work and if my oven does work then

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.300 
will work and if my oven does work then
praise<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.840> Lord<00:02:59.079> except<00:02:59.920> then<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.129> may<00:03:00.250> be

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310
