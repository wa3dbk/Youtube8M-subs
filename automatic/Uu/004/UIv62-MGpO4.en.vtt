00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.450
 how real or what are so many odds 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:10.969
 you have to recover your ex a single 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.299
 a fantasy or there is something proven that 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.250
 I can tell you that you can or can not 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.420
 recover it and bring it to your life how 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.420
 conquer a vitriol man 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.370
 I hear myself speak in some other 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.060
 videos on this subject that is very 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.450
 different than you think about conquering 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.220
 someone to conquer a man who 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.930
 to reconquer a man are things 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.150
 completely different it would seem that 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.530
 they are the same but it is not the same if you 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.300
 have you been reviewing my blog that is 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.950
 I was reviewing my articles and you've 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.070
 thought some of the things that I do 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.900
 I teach there to reconquer it some 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.640
 they have worked and others have 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.620
 have realized that they do not work or 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.470
 that do not make sense to the situation in 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.239
 the one that you are standing another of the things 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.390
 another one of the arguments that you always 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.820
 I speak in my book for example is that 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.250
 everything depends on the time in which 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.090
 do a technique at the right time 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.340
 it may be the best or the worst in the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.619
 not appropriate moment everything has to do 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.810
 with times if you are skillful in the 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.790
 managing your times no matter the 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.440
 technique that you use because the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.560
 circumstances are going to help you 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.450
 have a good result 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.770
 the chances of you recovering 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.829
 your ex increase as it decreases 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.659
 the time in which they have finished if 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.520
 you finished and have a week 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.619
 the odds are very high that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.720
 return if they have a month, 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.149
 odds are not that high if 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.450
 they have six months they are not so if 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:49.229
 they are one year old they are not so happy 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.000
 they are spaced from cutting to 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.039
 that you are trying to recover it 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.770
 the longer is the time your 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.049
 odds are decreasing 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.810
 another factor how long they lasted together 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.200
 The longer they have lasted together 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.270
 more are the odds that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.399
 you can go back then you have 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.590
 here already two factors one how long 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.160
 they were together and two how long 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.950
 a third factor was separated 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.960
 have a couple at this time or 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.030
 does not have a partner 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.400
 if your partner has your odds 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.110
 they also decrease if you do not have a 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.480
 couple your odds too 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.310
 increase are three major factors the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.770
 that you can consider how long 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.380
 you were with him how long they have 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.470
 that ended the relationship and if that 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.510
 he has or does not have a new partner 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.010
 if you combine these factors you can 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.740
 realize how close or how 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.260
