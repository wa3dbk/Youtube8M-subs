moved<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> tin<00:01:11.610> foil<00:01:11.850> which<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.150> pretty

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
moved on to the tin foil which is pretty

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330 
moved on to the tin foil which is pretty
obvious<00:01:12.619> we'd<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.950> take<00:01:14.100> off<00:01:14.220> man<00:01:14.930> and

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
obvious we'd like to take off man and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.070 
obvious we'd like to take off man and
basically<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.640> started<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.330> one<00:01:18.509> corner<00:01:18.780> which

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
basically we started in one corner which

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.679 
basically we started in one corner which
was<00:01:19.259> urges<00:01:19.619> fans<00:01:19.799> door<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:21.509> took

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
was urges fans door all that it took

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.200 
was urges fans door all that it took
spread<00:01:22.110> around<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.310> two<00:01:23.640> separate<00:01:24.000> teams

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
spread around I do two separate teams

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.179 
spread around I do two separate teams
and<00:01:24.750> we're<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.799> stuff

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and we're going to see that stuff

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.160 
and we're going to see that stuff
flavors<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> little<00:01:26.820> bit<00:01:27.000> shoddy<00:01:27.270> there<00:01:27.570> at

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
flavors a little bit shoddy there at

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.179 
flavors a little bit shoddy there at
first<00:01:28.320> time<00:01:28.530> we've<00:01:28.650> got<00:01:28.740> around<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.100> other

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
around and and the ceiling was the real
master<00:01:38.220> craft<00:01:38.490> because<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:39.030> saw<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> lot<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.659> bit
