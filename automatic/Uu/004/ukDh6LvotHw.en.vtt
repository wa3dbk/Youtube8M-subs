and like I said those are your
navigation<00:01:12.630> keys<00:01:12.869> alright<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.770> those<00:01:13.950> are<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
navigation keys alright so those are the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.770 
navigation keys alright so those are the
main<00:01:14.340> navigation<00:01:14.520> keys<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:15.479> we'll<00:01:15.659> move

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
main navigation keys and now we'll move

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.840 
main navigation keys and now we'll move
forward<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.229> learning<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.830> layout<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
forward with learning the layout of the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.730 
forward with learning the layout of the
program<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.200> left<00:01:19.380> side<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.710> have

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
program here on the left side you have

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.950 
program here on the left side you have
these<00:01:20.250> things<00:01:20.400> called<00:01:20.549> exclusive<00:01:21.450> links<00:01:21.780> now

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
these things called exclusive links now

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.270 
these things called exclusive links now
we'll<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.259> into<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.470> later<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.070> so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
we'll get into that later but just so

layers let me get an example of what
this<00:01:43.320> looks<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.680> let<00:01:43.950> me<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.220> create<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
this looks like let me just create a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.469 
this looks like let me just create a
emitter<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.670> there<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.759> go<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.240> how<00:01:48.360> it

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
emitter here and there you go see how it

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.060 
emitter here and there you go see how it
opened<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.079> my<00:01:49.170> nodes<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.979> my

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
opened up here on my nodes and on my

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.399 
opened up here on my nodes and on my
global<00:01:50.369> links<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:51.509> nodes<00:01:51.840> are<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.350> be

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
global links your nodes are going to be

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.929 
global links your nodes are going to be
basically<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:52.890> library<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.670> all<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
basically your library of all the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.539 
basically your library of all the
elements<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.600> realflow<00:01:55.110> uses<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.100> your

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
elements that realflow uses and your

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.889 
elements that realflow uses and your
global<00:01:56.820> links<00:01:57.060> are<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.360> course<00:01:57.600> how<00:01:57.780> they

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
global links are of course how they

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.469 
global links are of course how they
interact<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.259> each<00:01:58.439> other<00:01:59.090> over<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.390> we

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
interact with each other over here we

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.800 
interact with each other over here we
have<00:02:00.630> your<00:02:00.750> no<00:02:00.869> parameters<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
have your no parameters we have the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.810 
have your no parameters we have the
position<00:02:03.810> rotation<00:02:04.439> scale<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.130> usual<00:02:05.549> 3d

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
position rotation scale the usual 3d

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.210 
position rotation scale the usual 3d
with<00:02:06.060> whatnot<00:02:06.600> yeah<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:07.799> cool<00:02:07.950> weird<00:02:08.160> I

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
with whatnot yeah that was cool weird I

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.279 
with whatnot yeah that was cool weird I
like<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.789> usual<00:02:09.149> would<00:02:09.270> what<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
like that the usual would what not the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.619 
like that the usual would what not the
initial<00:02:10.679> state<00:02:11.360> which<00:02:12.360> we'll<00:02:12.510> learn<00:02:12.569> about

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
initial state which we'll learn about

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.820 
initial state which we'll learn about
later<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.260> your

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
later and your

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.800 
later and your
articles<00:02:14.160> your<00:02:14.340> type<00:02:14.610> your<00:02:14.910> resolution<00:02:15.660> your

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
articles your type your resolution your

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.690 
articles your type your resolution your
density<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.350> bunch<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.920> statistics<00:02:17.580> and

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
density a bunch of statistics and

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.000 
density a bunch of statistics and
numbers<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.360> witty<00:02:19.290> whatnot

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
numbers and witty whatnot

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.000 
numbers and witty whatnot
so<00:02:20.190> these<00:02:21.180> are<00:02:21.420> all<00:02:21.540> your<00:02:21.840> parameters<00:02:22.410> now

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
so these are all your parameters now

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.290 
so these are all your parameters now
down<00:02:23.220> here<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.520> course<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.850> have<00:02:23.880> your<00:02:24.090> layers

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
down here of course we have your layers

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.720 
down here of course we have your layers
that<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.020> might<00:02:25.440> want<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.710> use<00:02:25.830> later<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:26.310> for

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
that you might want to use later on for

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.340 
that you might want to use later on for
other<00:02:26.880> projects<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.630> need<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> high<00:02:28.050> D<00:02:28.110> or

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
other projects that you need a high D or

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.080 
other projects that you need a high D or
show<00:02:28.500> them<00:02:28.650> as<00:02:28.770> visible<00:02:29.100> what<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.820> said

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
show them as visible what like I said

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.690 
show them as visible what like I said
we'll<00:02:30.180> get<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.420> later<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:31.340> down<00:02:32.340> here<00:02:32.550> we

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
we'll get to that later on down here we

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.520 
we'll get to that later on down here we
have<00:02:32.880> your<00:02:33.030> messages<00:02:33.570> your<00:02:33.750> messages<00:02:34.320> are

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
have your messages your messages are

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.100 
have your messages your messages are
going<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.950> show<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.250> basically<00:02:35.810> for<00:02:36.810> example

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
going to show you basically for example

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.840 
going to show you basically for example
if<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.410> try<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.710> make<00:02:38.040> anything<00:02:38.460> real<00:02:38.670> flow

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
if you try to make anything real flow

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.670 
if you try to make anything real flow
let<00:02:38.970> me<00:02:39.000> give<00:02:39.150> an<00:02:39.240> example<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.780> let<00:02:40.500> me

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
let me give an example of that let me

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.630 
let me give an example of that let me
simulate<00:02:41.160> something<00:02:41.640> here<00:02:42.560> okay<00:02:43.590> see<00:02:44.460> how

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
simulate something here okay see how

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.190 
simulate something here okay see how
it's<00:02:44.790> saying<00:02:45.030> using<00:02:45.390> 8<00:02:45.600> threads<00:02:45.840> for<00:02:46.020> this

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it's saying using 8 threads for this

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.290 
it's saying using 8 threads for this
simulation<00:02:46.410> there<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.490> go<00:02:47.640> that's<00:02:47.970> because

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
simulation there you go that's because

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.050 
simulation there you go that's because
you're<00:02:48.420> using<00:02:48.570> 8<00:02:48.840> hyper<00:02:49.430> threading<00:02:50.430> threads

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
you're using 8 hyper threading threads

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.470 
you're using 8 hyper threading threads
that<00:02:51.330> my<00:02:51.570> CPU<00:02:52.050> uses<00:02:52.880> down<00:02:53.880> here<00:02:54.060> we<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.330> of

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
that my CPU uses down here we have of

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.570 
that my CPU uses down here we have of
course<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.750> time<00:02:54.990> line<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.560> frame<00:02:55.890> limit<00:02:56.430> and

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
course a time line the frame limit and

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.840 
course a time line the frame limit and
the<00:02:57.180> last<00:02:57.390> simulation<00:02:57.900> frame<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:59.640> course

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
the last simulation frame and of course

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.910 
the last simulation frame and of course
you<00:03:00.030> have<00:03:00.180> these<00:03:00.360> simulation<00:03:00.900> tools<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.709> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
you have these simulation tools and the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.150 
you have these simulation tools and the
simulation<00:03:02.280> progress<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.560> over<00:03:04.560> here<00:03:04.709> also<00:03:04.920> we

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
simulation progress so over here also we

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.000 
simulation progress so over here also we
have<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.640> play/stop<00:03:06.630> usual<00:03:07.590> buttons<00:03:07.890> that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
have the play/stop usual buttons that

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.699 
have the play/stop usual buttons that
you<00:03:08.160> have<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.730> over<00:03:09.720> here<00:03:09.900> we<00:03:10.050> have<00:03:10.290> the

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
you have and over here we have the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.240 
you have and over here we have the
global<00:03:11.220> buttons<00:03:11.640> which<00:03:11.880> are<00:03:12.180> used<00:03:12.540> for

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
global buttons which are used for

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.590 
global buttons which are used for
scaling<00:03:14.250> objects<00:03:14.670> down<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:15.180> their<00:03:15.300> particular

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
scaling objects down to their particular

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.729 
scaling objects down to their particular
size<00:03:16.020> in<00:03:16.410> terms<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.890> global<00:03:17.130> size<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.739> your

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
size in terms of global size and your

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.280 
size in terms of global size and your
job<00:03:20.700> manager<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.330> your<00:03:21.450> key<00:03:21.600> frame<00:03:21.870> manager

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
job manager and your key frame manager

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.500 
job manager and your key frame manager
and<00:03:22.440> all<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.769> jazz<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.150> there<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.239> go<00:03:24.360> that's

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
and all that jazz so there you go that's

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.860 
and all that jazz so there you go that's
so<00:03:24.900> far<00:03:25.230> for<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.560> most<00:03:25.769> part<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.580> main<00:03:27.060> user

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
so far for the most part the main user

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.680 
so far for the most part the main user
interface<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.680> realflow<00:03:29.220> 5<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:30.150> let's<00:03:30.420> get<00:03:30.570> to

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
interface of realflow 5 so let's get to

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.090 
interface of realflow 5 so let's get to
actually<00:03:31.080> creating<00:03:31.410> something<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.950> getting

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
actually creating something and getting

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.880
