00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:10.380
 Hello, today's topic is about successions and 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.469
 are in particular the obsessors in the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.680
 family which unfortunately is a case that 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.740
 happens to a lot of people we have 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.720
 against family scorn 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.660
 I always explain when the person is going to do it. 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.630
 a past-life therapy book that 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.090
 this is a very natural condition only 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.309
 We do not see much of this and it's 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.440
 It's difficult to accept because you find yourself 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.960
 so it's not just in my family or 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.149
 My family has to love my father who 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.820
 My mother has to want me, I have to 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.120
 being born to my father did not do that and 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.930
 always those people are 30 40 and 50 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.510
 years 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.700
 still suffering because there was an abandonment 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.399
 of the father because there was an abandonment of the mother 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.219
 was raised in a home where 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.260
 had the street where the situations of 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.379
 relationship of affection between family members 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.710
 were executed but then I go 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.020
 ask you were you happy 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.110
 everything worked out in your family. 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.200
 relationships were always linear was 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.810
 everything a little booklet you read 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.299
 at school you were a kid barely gives 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.450
 neither for you nor for me nor for 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.990
 no one because it is precisely in the family 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.140
 what happens to our biggest 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.270
 meetings and our biggest 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.990
 disagreements because our karma not 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.210
 It's related to the smart world that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.079
 let's make a car in the larger sense in 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.940
 global sense of recycling planet 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.240
 which is a very important topic 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.820
 one day each time acceleration then 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.160
 exists in big cars but a guy 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.000
 even if that key is the one that people 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.910
 came to solve is are of the intimate relations 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.800
 because he is calling you I always 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.450
 I quote because I think it's cool for us 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.730
 understand that when people understand 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.640
 to run away is the position is in the family 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.970
 in family relationships are called 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.330
 the obsessors are very close to 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.630
 us because these obsessors are bonds of 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.480
 My love, you have love for these people. 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.550
 while love is badly resolved 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.190
 often these people up in 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.260
 attempt to win our offer of 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.160
 conquer our love she in 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.650
 contracts 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.460
 then it exists in most 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.040
 families 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.830
 so when you start to understand this 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.710
 you much to your relationship 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.200
 You accept the situation, you're right. 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.620
 you begin to interact better with these 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.510
 people then not all questions 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.300
 not all successive processes 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.760
 are deeply sick 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.820
 some are ill and give too much 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.030
 complication and have to deal with 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.430
 woman 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.270
 hospitalizations sad things that the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.640
 people did 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.370
 now there are other situations 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.340
 that are not so deep and these you 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.160
 can treat heart you can treat with 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.890
 his personal discipline not hiding 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.250
 no fighting did not hit front 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.350
 when you have conditions do not sing 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.810
 Roberto suddenly living in the same house 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.510
 can be your father can be your mother 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.640
 You can love these people but you. 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.250
 you do not need to demand of yourself 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.580
 so deep and intense together 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.610
 then meat issues with the disciples and 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.570
 observations take place in all 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.670
 families 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.700
 many people go through the same 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.280
 because they are with these people 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.870
 that you will develop bonds of love 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.430
 you will evolve 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.709
 I always joke that we have to 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.870
 thank our successors because 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.450
 takes advantage of this impulse that they 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.530
 Are we finding the way? 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.840
 spiritual 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.530
 We seek prayer and we 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.380
 best 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.810
 so make peace in the processes of 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.230
 Obsession make peace with people 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.380
 pray a lot and learn that there is 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.660
 a potential friend at least one 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.950
 silence you must learn to 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.730
 play a role 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.730
 every game
