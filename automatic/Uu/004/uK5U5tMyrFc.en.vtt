giving<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.310> little<00:01:29.549> bonus<00:01:29.670> damage<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.689> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
giving you a little bonus damage but I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.270 
giving you a little bonus damage but I
found<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.259> rarely<00:01:31.500> hits<00:01:31.890> anything

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
found that it rarely hits anything

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.640 
found that it rarely hits anything
unless<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.210> large<00:01:33.479> target<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.500> you're

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
unless it's a large target or if you're

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.410 
unless it's a large target or if you're
unloading<00:01:34.950> into<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.369> large<00:01:35.610> group<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.000> enemies

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
unloading into a large group of enemies

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.319 
unloading into a large group of enemies
so<00:01:36.659> my<00:01:37.500> verdict<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.070> gun<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.909> one<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
so my verdict on this gun this one is

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.240 
so my verdict on this gun this one is
not<00:01:39.600> great<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.439> hardly<00:01:40.680> worth<00:01:40.890> going

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
not great and it's hardly worth going

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.620 
not great and it's hardly worth going
