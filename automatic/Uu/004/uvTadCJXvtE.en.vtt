I<00:00:50.600> don't<00:00:50.870> know<00:00:50.960> that<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.260> director<00:00:51.410> and<00:00:52.310> the

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
I don't know that the director and the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.820 
I don't know that the director and the
editor<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:53.480> design<00:00:54.110> people<00:00:54.410> are<00:00:54.590> between

editor and design people are between

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.369 
editor and design people are between
them<00:00:55.100> then<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.790> so<00:00:56.030> you<00:00:56.750> think<00:00:56.960> that's<00:00:57.170> going

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
them then and so you think that's going

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.260 
them then and so you think that's going
to<00:00:57.470> be<00:00:57.559> there<00:00:57.770> can<00:00:58.610> be<00:00:58.730> totally<00:00:59.120> different

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
to be there can be totally different

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.049 
to be there can be totally different
from<00:00:59.480> what<00:00:59.629> is<00:00:59.960> actually<00:01:00.320> reached<00:01:00.879> as<00:01:01.879> the

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
from what is actually reached as the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
look like at the end because this is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.490
