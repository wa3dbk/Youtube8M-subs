half<00:01:11.190> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.550> game<00:01:11.760> where<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> hero<00:01:12.540> side<00:01:12.990> and

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
half of the game where the hero side and

team<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.280> final<00:01:17.550> stage<00:01:18.080> it's<00:01:19.080> an

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
team up for that final stage it's an

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.380 
team up for that final stage it's an
action<00:01:19.650> game<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.729> think<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.180> especially

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
action game but I think that especially

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.810 
action game but I think that especially
in<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.990> latter<00:01:22.259> half<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:23.310> has<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.550> really

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
in that latter half it has a really

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.719 
in that latter half it has a really
dramatic<00:01:24.060> story<00:01:24.830> back<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.860> adventure<00:01:26.430> one

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
dramatic story back in adventure one

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.210 
dramatic story back in adventure one
there<00:01:27.210> were<00:01:27.479> all<00:01:27.750> sorts<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.440> things<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.979> wished

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
there were all sorts of things I wished

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280 
there were all sorts of things I wished
I<00:01:29.430> could<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.090> done<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.080> made

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
I could have done and when we made

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.010 
I could have done and when we made
adventure<00:01:31.770> 2<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.280> was<00:01:32.880> finally<00:01:33.210> able<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.720> put

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
adventure 2 I was finally able to put

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.900 
adventure 2 I was finally able to put
them<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.320> there<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.979> wanted<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.280> add<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> game

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
them in there we wanted to add a game

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.670 
them in there we wanted to add a game
element<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.600> fans<00:01:36.930> would<00:01:37.140> want<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.500> come

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
element that fans would want to come

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.910 
element that fans would want to come
back<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.100> play<00:01:38.250> again<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.270> again<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> that's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
back and play again and again so that's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.430 
back and play again and again so that's
why<00:01:41.190> we<00:01:41.220> implemented<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> whole<00:01:42.270> chow<00:01:42.780> system

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
why we implemented the whole chow system

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.859 
why we implemented the whole chow system
the<00:01:44.040> Chow<00:01:44.280> are<00:01:44.550> these<00:01:44.729> creatures<00:01:45.270> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
the Chow are these creatures that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.460 
the Chow are these creatures that
evolved<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.979> progress<00:01:47.220> through<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.910> game

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
evolved as you progress through the game

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.950 
evolved as you progress through the game
the<00:01:49.470> undergo<00:01:49.920> changes<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.850> bill<00:01:51.450> grow<00:01:51.690> wings

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the undergo changes like bill grow wings

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.790 
the undergo changes like bill grow wings
or<00:01:52.740> become<00:01:53.459> a<00:01:53.490> lot<00:01:53.700> faster<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
or become a lot faster and so the

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.190 
or become a lot faster and so the
initial<00:01:56.100> based<00:01:56.670> Chow<00:01:57.119> can't<00:01:57.899> have<00:01:58.050> any

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
initial based Chow can't have any

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.050 
initial based Chow can't have any
special<00:01:58.679> characteristics<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.610> make<00:01:59.910> it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
special characteristics that make it

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.380 
special characteristics that make it
stand<00:02:00.330> out<00:02:00.569> in<00:02:00.869> any<00:02:00.990> way<00:02:01.459> personally<00:02:02.459> I'm<00:02:03.060> not

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
stand out in any way personally I'm not

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.270 
stand out in any way personally I'm not
all<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.539> good<00:02:03.929> when<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.289> comes<00:02:04.679> to<00:02:04.890> coming<00:02:05.130> up

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
all that good when it comes to coming up

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.699 
all that good when it comes to coming up
with<00:02:05.490> things<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.910> are<00:02:06.030> cute<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.990> cuddly<00:02:07.380> but

only<00:05:11.330> thing<00:05:11.540> that<00:05:11.750> ever<00:05:11.870> keeps<00:05:12.140> him<00:05:12.290> safe<00:05:12.760> so

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
only thing that ever keeps him safe so

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.030 
only thing that ever keeps him safe so
he<00:05:13.910> takes<00:05:14.180> all<00:05:14.360> these<00:05:14.540> ideas<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:15.650> puts<00:05:15.890> all

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
he takes all these ideas and puts all

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.370 
he takes all these ideas and puts all
this<00:05:16.190> money<00:05:16.490> and<00:05:16.880> effort<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.540> whatnot<00:05:18.020> into

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
this money and effort and whatnot into

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.860 
this money and effort and whatnot into
making<00:05:18.680> some<00:05:19.010> new<00:05:19.160> contraption<00:05:19.820> and<00:05:19.940> sonic

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
making some new contraption and sonic

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.050 
making some new contraption and sonic
still<00:05:21.169> always<00:05:21.440> just<00:05:21.950> destroys<00:05:22.460> it<00:05:22.640> in<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:22.880> end

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
still always just destroys it in the end

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.320 
still always just destroys it in the end
and<00:05:23.620> so<00:05:24.620> Eggman<00:05:25.070> comes<00:05:25.430> out<00:05:25.640> in<00:05:25.850> that<00:05:25.970> little

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
and so Eggman comes out in that little

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.750 
and so Eggman comes out in that little
machine<00:05:26.660> again<00:05:26.960> like<00:05:27.860> it's<00:05:28.040> a<00:05:28.130> symbol<00:05:28.490> of<00:05:28.580> his

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
machine again like it's a symbol of his

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.450 
machine again like it's a symbol of his
persistence<00:05:29.620> no<00:05:30.620> matter<00:05:30.800> how<00:05:31.010> many<00:05:31.160> times

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
persistence no matter how many times

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.000 
persistence no matter how many times
he's<00:05:31.669> defeated<00:05:32.030> he<00:05:32.660> puts<00:05:32.930> it<00:05:33.050> behind<00:05:33.200> him<00:05:33.530> he

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
he's defeated he puts it behind him he

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.520 
he's defeated he puts it behind him he
doesn't<00:05:34.220> give<00:05:34.490> up<00:05:34.700> he<00:05:35.690> just<00:05:35.900> runs<00:05:36.110> off<00:05:36.260> going

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
doesn't give up he just runs off going

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.040 
doesn't give up he just runs off going
curses<00:05:37.190> and<00:05:37.490> heads<00:05:38.090> off<00:05:38.270> to<00:05:38.300> fight<00:05:38.630> sonic

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
curses and heads off to fight sonic

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.370 
curses and heads off to fight sonic
another<00:05:39.320> day
