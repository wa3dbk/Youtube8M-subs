00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.809
 palante puts his foot on the street his hand 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.660
 in the micro and ear in the village to 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.150
 listen to their reactions to the news 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.029
 most curious of the so-called agency 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.410
 efe we will see 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.359
 Christmas concert knows that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.550
 performed in santa group of the 600s 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.260
 the 20s and the twenties do not know the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.230
 news so that for the edition of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.429
 this year not because you're from the Canary Islands 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.170
 because you're in verbena could 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.260
 replace replace the symphony in the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.989
 Christmas concert I do not see it 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.300
 I have nothing against the extraction area 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.399
 whatever but the symphonic orchestra 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.840
 of this symphony I think that the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.489
 tradition must be maintained that is the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.770
 symphonic that does its work in that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.199
 day and so very classic I like more 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.000
 the symphony orchestra is not ruled out 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.340
 two ways an intermediate formula in the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.920
 that could be that how they will participate 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.739
 the Canarian orchestras with the symphony 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.980
 that yes then it could be a thing 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.379
 pretty pretty good seen from that 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.730
 point of view could be interesting 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.950
 but magnificent 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.390
 for doing something different I am like that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.400
 I do not like to always do the same thing if 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.840
 is for something different it would not be bad 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.630
 people what makes it strong is a 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.040
 little bit more encouragement at this time 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.930
 that we are difficult, I have seen 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.900
 with certain Mexicans with music 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.750
 symphonic and if things of peli and things like that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.030
 because surgery is also quite 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.740
 for the classics now at this point 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.210
 after all what should be done 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.210
 is to bring the verbena orchestras to the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.900
 theaters with the symphonic good at 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.900
 it could be better 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.360
 because you can not ask a question of 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.930
 classical music with the music of verbena 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.820
 swell together and it tasted good that 's the 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.400
 little window of love closed but with 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.220
 a string version for because yes 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.830
 that if so if it would be fine with the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.940
 booth but the symphonic songs what 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.320
 what do you think would be 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.770
 interesting that we missed a party 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.890
 of that type 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.800
 the most well- known well that of swell 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.840
 it has to be 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.550
 that's the way to the little window of love too 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.700
 because there everyone would eat 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.740
 the expense will be the same and they are promoted 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.830
 so much what are the verbena groups and 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.630
 the symphonies that speak even of a 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.580
 small tribute to the three tenors but 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.130
 with canarian verbena singers like 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.140
 could be luis de seda el morocho 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.610
 even pepe benavente I do not know how then 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.610
 I would value it fully 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.650
 I do not have anything against pepe benavente but 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.740
 is that I see it very the others and more than 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:50.120
 90 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:52.130
 a mind of almeria and these little things and 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.130
 we go christmas concert with a lawn 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.350
 of 90 because I could not miss sure 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.090
 they would be carols with Latin rhythms and 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.750
 there are some some proposals we 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.750
 we support someone little 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.690
 if we do not stop 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.170
 yes 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.090
 no no 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.670
 fantastic 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.640
 yes 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.640
 fun so the classic was born 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:32.590
 very nice if there is a little bit stuck with 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.220
 shoehorn I would even sing this in 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.740
 carnivals 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.860
 clear because I was editing it 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.190
 only to a date when a song 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:51.050
 of a universal nature, topics or themes 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:54.370
 more than people and up to here the pa 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.370
 foot of today's street 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.400
 I do not have any 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:06.829
 in the absence of all the equipment and remove more 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.030
 of the truck and it takes all the van and there 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.170
 who carries the skateboard I do not know 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.170
 who are we going to be able to with so much
