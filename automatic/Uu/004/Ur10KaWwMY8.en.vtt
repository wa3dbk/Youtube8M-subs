00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.519
 and good hello to all 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.469
 I hope you are well me it will 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.059
 very well so we have today 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.340
 finds himself for a compilation we 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.279
 conclude quarter of glitch so the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.310
 first will be located in los angeles at 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.230
 Chinatown where adopters I see badly 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.869
 on the screen so for that makes you 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.509
 so bellaouchi over the mission 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.990
 escape is above the ground of 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.720
 baseball 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.270
 no, then this one is it for just 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.580
 take hold of it so when you have 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.830
 do you will put yourself as me 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.810
 between the barrier and the security halo 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.370
 you 're going it's not it's so there you 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.130
 go see that for two to three times 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.960
 so I'll give you after 10 seconds 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.490
 but it's holy piat no 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.490
 handling because add the i it's from 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.960
 pass between the two bars so you 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.280
 can see that this is it I 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.680
 happened between the two banks that the flight 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 breach I start so for me on the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.090
 it's no longer the breach 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.759
 gold one where we can fly underwater 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.619
 so there are two obstacles so the 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.950
 young cruisers at the moment but good 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.000
 nothing very important so this role 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.520
 should warm up in front of him allows for 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.320
 do everything for the baseball stadium and 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.090
 to go in and you'll see that 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.890
 the peculiarity of two gap veils 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.520
 in fact it's that you 're not going to be 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.530
 sure on the ground are on a species of 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.030
 azim tumor so it's a bit flat 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.109
 stuff on top doe because that 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.880
 could be a lot more fun by 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.469
 example with his pals of being able to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.270
 put on firm ground to go in 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.799
 the bleachers so we can go but 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.399
 here are there obstacles still a 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.380
 both good so the commission so 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.429
 there's still everything all the behind the most 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.350
 behind the short flight so it is 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.819
 really good as I am proud but 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.499
 she can ride the plain the volumes 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.990
 in an invisible wall and to go out 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:49.829
 you just have to on the or if you 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.259
 go to the right 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.889
 so we are now for the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.350
 second match immediately returned 

00:01:55.889 --> 00:02:01.020
 so we end up for this second 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.170
 flight brakes so that to seattle in the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.579
 peleton so there level at the level of the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.160
 map is going to be a little more complicated to there 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.040
 access so must you go to the level 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.060
 goals he has both sticks and where 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.030
 there is 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.110
 because on the moon he has the he 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.580
 is even simpler to do this 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.020
 you will just position yourself where 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.540
 I am you have you go back into 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.770
 the angle of the parent who is there you have 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.209
 vibrates so there I had a whole 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.650
 little bit of trouble because I 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.959
 more you too so now I the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.500
 do not take it so it's also a real 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.220
 cat is much less important than 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.870
 previous 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.160
 so here there is already first death a 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.140
 dilemma for the cross you just 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.300
 after a U-turn and take a squeeze to 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.680
 right like geffard the moment and there 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.170
 you will see that these bounded by 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.239
 the poles the poles white and 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.220
 the species of the ngo so it's a whole 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.480
 little flight breach I want to send the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.150
 video the little jackie to do I hope 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.920
 they'll be closer anyway thank you 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.360
 a lot also has the background and if they 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.310
 had more sights do not hesitate to 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.310
 subscribe to the exchange go go there
