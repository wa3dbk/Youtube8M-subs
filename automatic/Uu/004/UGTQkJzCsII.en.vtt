want to do a short video simply
explaining<00:00:15.280> what<00:00:15.490> is<00:00:15.700> AC<00:00:16.119> II<00:00:16.619> there's<00:00:17.619> been

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
explaining what is AC II there's been

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.290 
explaining what is AC II there's been
some<00:00:17.980> confusion<00:00:18.460> in<00:00:18.520> the<00:00:18.610> past<00:00:18.850> and<00:00:19.029> we've<00:00:19.119> had

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
some confusion in the past and we've had

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.730 
some confusion in the past and we've had
some<00:00:19.450> customers<00:00:19.630> call<00:00:20.110> and<00:00:20.290> wanted<00:00:20.560> to<00:00:20.619> know

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
some customers call and wanted to know

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.800 
some customers call and wanted to know
so<00:00:21.250> we've<00:00:21.520> actually<00:00:21.760> done<00:00:22.180> some<00:00:22.210> previous

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
so we've actually done some previous

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.870 
so we've actually done some previous
videos<00:00:23.200> on<00:00:23.230> how<00:00:23.650> to<00:00:23.710> identify<00:00:23.950> whether<00:00:24.730> your

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
videos on how to identify whether your

vehicle has AC e and exactly what is the
the<00:00:29.050> system<00:00:29.470> now<00:00:29.890> if<00:00:30.189> you<00:00:30.369> have<00:00:30.669> a<00:00:30.700> discovery

to<00:00:31.840> and<00:00:32.140> it<00:00:32.860> has<00:00:32.890> AC<00:00:33.340> II<00:00:33.579> which<00:00:34.090> we<00:00:34.450> did<00:00:34.660> shown<00:00:34.870> a

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
to and it has AC II which we did shown a

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.040 
to and it has AC II which we did shown a
video<00:00:35.230> how<00:00:35.410> to<00:00:35.440> identify<00:00:35.890> that<00:00:37.050> essentially

the fluid now later on they came out

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.120 
the fluid now later on they came out
with<00:00:59.980> a<00:01:00.190> similar<00:01:00.790> system<00:01:01.030> in<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.900> Range<00:01:02.770> Rover

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
sports and that was essentially called

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.210

active stabilization system or we've

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.760

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
control essentially they're all the same

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.820 
control essentially they're all the same
thing<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.330> what<00:01:19.930> they<00:01:20.080> did<00:01:20.290> was<00:01:20.440> they<00:01:20.650> got

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
thing and what they did was they got

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.310 
thing and what they did was they got
away<00:01:20.950> from<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.370> two-way<00:01:21.760> split<00:01:22.030> RAM<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:22.690> got

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
away from the two-way split RAM and got

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.500 
away from the two-way split RAM and got
into<00:01:23.650> an<00:01:23.890> integral<00:01:24.310> hydraulic<00:01:24.850> motor<00:01:25.120> built

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
into an integral hydraulic motor built

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.570 
into an integral hydraulic motor built
into<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.960> sway<00:01:26.200> bars<00:01:26.500> but<00:01:27.100> essentially

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
into the sway bars but essentially

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.969 
into the sway bars but essentially
control<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.120> same<00:01:28.390> way<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:29.440> that's<00:01:29.650> all<00:01:29.830> that

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
control the same way and that's all that

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.740 
control the same way and that's all that
he<00:01:30.130> says<00:01:30.400> is<00:01:30.700> just<00:01:30.729> hydraulically<00:01:31.510> controlled

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
he says is just hydraulically controlled

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.510 
he says is just hydraulically controlled
sway<00:01:32.200> bars<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:32.860> help<00:01:33.040> level<00:01:33.250> your<00:01:33.490> vehicle

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
sway bars that help level your vehicle

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.570 
sway bars that help level your vehicle
on<00:01:34.000> cornering<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:35.470> again<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.890> procedure<00:01:36.220> for

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
on cornering and again the procedure for

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.550 
on cornering and again the procedure for
the<00:01:36.640> maintenance<00:01:36.820> on<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.600> sport<00:01:38.080> will<00:01:38.320> be<00:01:38.440> the

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
the maintenance on the sport will be the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.140 
the maintenance on the sport will be the
same<00:01:38.770> as<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:38.979> discovery<00:01:39.490> which<00:01:39.700> is<00:01:39.850> simply

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
same as the discovery which is simply

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.600 
same as the discovery which is simply
filter<00:01:40.479> replacement<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.260> some<00:01:41.440> fluid<00:01:41.799> now<00:01:42.580> I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
filter replacement and some fluid now I

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.810 
filter replacement and some fluid now I
hope<00:01:42.760> that<00:01:42.940> clarifies<00:01:43.150> what<00:01:43.750> AC<00:01:43.900> II<00:01:44.110> is<00:01:44.500> if<00:01:44.950> you

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
hope that clarifies what AC II is if you

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.520 
hope that clarifies what AC II is if you
