and<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.810> great<00:00:24.990> signing<00:00:25.289> reverb<00:00:26.330> a<00:00:27.330> lot<00:00:27.930> of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
and it's a great signing reverb a lot of

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.640 
and it's a great signing reverb a lot of
variability<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.810> main<00:00:31.019> thing<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.470> I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
variability and the main thing that I

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.139 
variability and the main thing that I
love<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.009> much<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.489> use<00:00:32.640> expression

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
love so much as you can use expression

now I'm going to just kind of increase
the<00:01:04.500> pedals<00:01:04.860> death<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.759> going<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.000> morph

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the pedals death and it's going to morph

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.510 
the pedals death and it's going to morph
through<00:01:06.750> slightly<00:01:07.650> bigger<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.009> bigger<00:01:08.159> rooms

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
through slightly bigger and bigger rooms

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.399

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
near-infinite reverb okay let's check it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:02:16.120 
near-infinite reverb okay let's check it
out<00:01:16.220> further<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> travel<00:01:20.390> further<00:01:21.390> still
