00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
Hi.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.020
I'm Katrina Zish on behalf of Crest 3-D White.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.210
Today we’re going to talk about how to find
a whitening system for your teeth.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.469
And to do that, I'm joined by cosmetic dentist,
Dr. Brian Cantor.

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.469
Nice to see you.

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:12.469
Nice to see you.

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:13.469
Great.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.469
So everybody wants a whiter smile.

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.040
But first, we want to know, is this safe?

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.040
It is safe.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.430
There's been a lot of research, a lot of studies.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.539
There is no damage to the enamel.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.670
The only thing that could possibly happen
is you could have temporarily have some sensitivity

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.529
from the bleach, or it can irritate the gums
if it hits the gums.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.779
But it’s very temporary, and it goes away,
and you're totally fine.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.300
Now is everyone a candidate for teeth whitening?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.050
Everyone is not a candidate for teeth whitening.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.739
You must see your dentist first before you
start whitening, because if you have a lot

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.790
of dental work, such as veneers, crowns, bridges,
this porcelain will not change color with

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.640
the bleach, and your real teeth will.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.130
So if you get a great result from bleaching,
then your teeth will be different colors,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.130
and doesn't look great.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.130
Oh, multi-colored mouth.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.130
That’s not good.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.309
So it defeats the purpose of bleaching.

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.940
And if you have a lot of cavities or broken
down teeth, you're also not a candidate for

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.940
bleaching.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.300
Because if you have decay, the bleach will
get into the tooth and will cause extreme

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.300
sensitivity.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.250
So you should see your dentist before you
start bleaching.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.250
Okay.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.570
If I am a candidate, how do I do it?

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.790
That’s a great question.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.790
Everyone wants whiter teeth now.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.200
And there are really three main ways you can
bleach your teeth.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.750
Let’s first talk about what makes one bleaching
product better than another.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.760
So two factors determine how good a bleaching
product is.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.930
One is the percentage of hydrogen peroxide,
which is the bleaching agent in the bleaching

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.930
products.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.420
Two is how well and how long that bleaching
product remains isolated on your teeth.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.040
So the first way we could bleach our teeth
is professionally done in a dental office,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.780
with a laser, it’s the highest concentration
of hydrogen peroxide, and remains isolated

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.030
on your teeth for the longest amount of time,
and very well.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.960
They actually secure the bleach to your teeth
so it doesn't get over any other soft tissue.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.280
The next way is a dentist can give you take-home
custom-made trays.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.670
Now these take-home trays have also a high
percentage of hydrogen peroxide and it remains

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.780
isolated on your teeth for a long duration
of time.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.700
The third way you can whiten your teeth is
with over the counter products.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.890
And these products, first of all, are much
cheaper and much more affordable than in-office

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.890
whitening procedures.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.610
Good for being on a budget.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.610
Yes.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.840
And they also work.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.950
The best way to pick a bleaching product over
the counter is to see which product remains

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.950
isolated on your teeth the longer.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.690
So white strips is great, because there's
a technology that actually keeps the bleaching

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.910
product isolated on your teeth, because that
will actually allow the bleach to remain on

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.940
your teeth and allow the bleaching process
to work.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.940
Okay, fantastic.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.170
Okay, now that my teeth are finally whiter,
how do I keep them whiter?

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.170
Yes.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.170
Maintenance.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.530
It’s just like having your hair dyed blonde.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.890
Once it’s dyed blonde, you have to-- you
have to maintain that color.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.530
Same thing with the color of your teeth.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.640
Once you bleach your teeth, it’s not going
to remain white forever, especially if you're

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.540
having a lot of coffee, red wine that will
stain your teeth.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.950
You have to maintain using over the counter
products or like the white strips or using

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.080
whitening toothpaste or whitening rinse.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.319
These all will help maintain the color of
your teeth.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.319
Okay.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.319
Now, I want to get back.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.319
You mentioned whitening toothpastes.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.319
Are they safe?

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.319
Yes, absolutely.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.069
Now just to clarify, there's a difference
between whitening and bleaching.

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.069
Oh, okay.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.860
So a lot of the products over the counter,
such as this whitening toothpaste, is a whitening

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.860
agent.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.080
What a whitening agent is, is it will remove
surface stains to make your teeth appear whiter

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.260
than they are.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.580
That's different from bleaching.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.250
A bleaching product will have hydrogen peroxide
in it.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.720
And the oxygen from the hydrogen peroxide
will oxidize these long chain stains and breaks

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.680
these chains up, intrinsically.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.420
And that actually bleaches the tooth, making
the teeth lighter than they actually were.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.420
So whitening will make your teeth appear whiter
by removing surface stains.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.950
And bleaching will actually make your teeth
lighter than they were.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.950
Okay, got it.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.810
So if you are a coffee drinker or a red wine
drinker, if you look for whitening products

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.590
that will help to remove those stains that
are caused by those products

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.590
Yes.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.710
And whitening toothpaste, how it works is
there silica particles.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.400
So, what that does is acts as a minor abrasive
to actually remove the surface stains and

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.819
make your teeth appear whiter.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:56.819
And they're great.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.850
And there's no harm to using them, as long
as you use a soft toothbrush, you are not

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.080
going to damage your teeth.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.590
Do whitening rinses really work?

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.590
Yes.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.760
Again, that's a whitening agent.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.590
What it’s going to do, such as Crest 3-D
White, this is going to actually remove surface

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.590
stains.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.040
But it’s not going to bleach your teeth,
it’s going to remove surface stains to make

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.040
your teeth appear whiter.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.040
Okay, fantastic.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.090
Well, I am ready to go out and get a fabulously
white smile.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.620
Thank you so much, Dr. Cantor.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.620
Any time.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.810
So it is possible to get whiter teeth, either
at your dentist or at home with the whitening

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.810
system.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.790
But remember, there is some maintenance to
be done.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.060
So let’s recap.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.460
Consult your dentist to determine which solution
is best for you.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.250
Professional bleaching at your dentist’s
office, purchasing an at-home professional

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.990
teeth whitening kit from your dentist, or
using a professional level over the counter

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.040
teeth whitening product.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.980
Regardless of the whitening solution, keep
your teeth whiter by using specially formulated

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.000
toothpaste, mouthwash and floss in between
your treatments.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.380
On behalf of Crest, I'm Katrina Zish.
