how<00:00:05.320> to<00:00:05.380> achieve<00:00:05.590> the<00:00:05.890> Superman<00:00:06.340> glitch<00:00:06.580> now

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.270 
how to achieve the Superman glitch now

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.470 
how to achieve the Superman glitch now
this<00:00:07.450> isn't<00:00:07.600> a<00:00:07.780> glitch<00:00:07.900> I<00:00:08.109> discovered<00:00:08.560> myself

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
this isn't a glitch I discovered myself

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.970 
this isn't a glitch I discovered myself
but<00:00:10.480> as<00:00:10.690> far<00:00:10.930> as<00:00:11.020> I'm<00:00:11.140> aware<00:00:11.290> there<00:00:11.620> aren't<00:00:11.830> any

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
but as far as I'm aware there aren't any

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.770 
but as far as I'm aware there aren't any
video<00:00:12.280> showing<00:00:12.580> how<00:00:12.790> you<00:00:12.850> can<00:00:13.059> easily<00:00:13.300> do<00:00:13.750> it

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
video showing how you can easily do it

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.230 
video showing how you can easily do it
yourself<00:00:14.320> and<00:00:14.620> there's<00:00:15.580> lots<00:00:15.730> of<00:00:15.790> videos<00:00:15.910> of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
yourself and there's lots of videos of

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.420 
yourself and there's lots of videos of
you<00:00:16.390> on<00:00:16.630> YouTube<00:00:17.080> of<00:00:17.230> people<00:00:17.260> stuck<00:00:18.100> in<00:00:18.250> the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
you on YouTube of people stuck in the

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.120 
you on YouTube of people stuck in the
glitch<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:20.170> not<00:00:20.380> showing<00:00:20.740> how<00:00:20.890> they<00:00:21.010> got

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
glitch but not showing how they got

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
glitch but not showing how they got
there<00:00:21.280> in<00:00:21.369> the<00:00:21.460> first<00:00:21.640> place

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
there in the first place

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.790 
there in the first place
so<00:00:22.960> the<00:00:23.350> most<00:00:23.560> commonly<00:00:23.980> reported<00:00:25.440> way<00:00:26.440> of

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
so the most commonly reported way of

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.510 
so the most commonly reported way of
achieving<00:00:27.400> the<00:00:27.580> glitch<00:00:27.820> is<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.830> fly<00:00:30.189> a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
achieving the glitch is you fly a

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.669 
achieving the glitch is you fly a
helicopter<00:00:30.760> near<00:00:31.689> an<00:00:31.840> enemy<00:00:31.990> helicopter

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:32.679 
helicopter near an enemy helicopter

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:34.919 
helicopter near an enemy helicopter
which<00:00:32.829> is<00:00:32.949> also<00:00:33.100> in<00:00:33.309> flight<00:00:33.640> you<00:00:33.999> then<00:00:34.539> stunt

00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:34.929 
which is also in flight you then stunt

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:37.110 
which is also in flight you then stunt
jump<00:00:35.140> from<00:00:35.350> your<00:00:35.379> chopper<00:00:35.829> aim<00:00:36.699> at<00:00:36.969> the<00:00:37.089> enemy

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
jump from your chopper aim at the enemy

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.840 
jump from your chopper aim at the enemy
helicopter<00:00:37.929> and<00:00:38.139> press<00:00:38.710> R<00:00:38.739> Apple<00:00:39.249> to<00:00:39.550> try<00:00:39.729> and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
helicopter and press R Apple to try and

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.520 
helicopter and press R Apple to try and
zip<00:00:40.030> towards<00:00:40.479> it<00:00:40.659> and<00:00:40.839> in<00:00:41.019> fact<00:00:41.229> what<00:00:41.409> will

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
zip towards it and in fact what will

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.189 
zip towards it and in fact what will
happen<00:00:41.769> is<00:00:41.889> you<00:00:42.010> get<00:00:42.159> stuck<00:00:42.370> in<00:00:42.399> the<00:00:42.579> glitch

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
happen is you get stuck in the glitch

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.809 
happen is you get stuck in the glitch
now<00:00:44.199> in<00:00:44.319> fact<00:00:44.530> I've<00:00:44.710> found<00:00:44.979> that<00:00:45.399> you<00:00:45.579> can

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:45.819 
now in fact I've found that you can

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:48.270 
now in fact I've found that you can
achieve<00:00:46.569> the<00:00:46.960> glitch<00:00:47.139> using<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.589> wind<00:00:47.829> turbine

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
achieve the glitch using a wind turbine

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.069 
achieve the glitch using a wind turbine
which<00:00:48.579> is<00:00:48.760> a<00:00:48.789> lot<00:00:48.969> easier<00:00:49.120> and<00:00:49.510> more<00:00:49.629> we<00:00:49.839> could

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
which is a lot easier and more we could

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.299 
which is a lot easier and more we could
reproducible<00:00:51.069> so<00:00:52.319> I've<00:00:53.319> left<00:00:53.709> all<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.100> wind

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
reproducible so I've left all the wind

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.189 
reproducible so I've left all the wind
turbines<00:00:54.670> at<00:00:54.819> the<00:00:54.850> racetrack<00:00:55.120> intact<00:00:55.870> so<00:00:56.109> I'm

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
turbines at the racetrack intact so I'm

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.680 
turbines at the racetrack intact so I'm
going<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.409> extract<00:00:56.709> the<00:00:56.859> racetrack<00:00:57.510> which<00:00:58.510> is

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
going to extract the racetrack which is

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.279 
going to extract the racetrack which is
just<00:00:58.929> here<00:00:59.409> and<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:01.030> it's<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.839> top<00:01:02.049> left

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
just here and so it's the top left

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.290 
just here and so it's the top left
portion<00:01:02.469> of<00:01:02.649> the<00:01:02.709> map<00:01:02.979> pano<00:01:03.729> International

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
portion of the map pano International

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.420 
portion of the map pano International
Airport<00:01:04.629> is<00:01:04.750> just<00:01:05.020> here<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:06.070> racetrack

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
Airport is just here and the racetrack

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.460 
Airport is just here and the racetrack
is<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.670> first<00:01:06.910> island<00:01:07.270> above<00:01:07.510> it<00:01:07.660> so<00:01:08.380> I'm

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
is the first island above it so I'm

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.540 
is the first island above it so I'm
going<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:08.680> extract<00:01:08.890> there<00:01:09.160> now<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.710> show<00:01:12.520> you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
going to extract there now and show you

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.890 
going to extract there now and show you
how<00:01:12.760> that<00:01:12.790> you<00:01:12.970> can<00:01:13.090> do<00:01:13.240> this<00:01:13.360> using<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.720> wind

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
how that you can do this using a wind

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:23.080 
how that you can do this using a wind
turbine<00:01:18.690> so<00:01:19.690> just<00:01:19.960> up<00:01:20.110> here

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.090 

now<00:01:23.869> if<00:01:23.990> you're<00:01:24.140> not<00:01:24.289> aware<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.619> this<00:01:24.829> wind

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
now if you're not aware of this wind

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.130 
now if you're not aware of this wind
turbines<00:01:25.490> don't<00:01:25.729> respawn<00:01:26.090> in<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.509> game<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.049> if

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
turbines don't respawn in the game so if

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.539 
turbines don't respawn in the game so if
you<00:01:27.259> destroyed<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.890> turbines<00:01:28.310> of<00:01:28.460> the

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
you destroyed the turbines of the

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.179 
you destroyed the turbines of the
racetrack<00:01:29.000> they<00:01:29.179> won't<00:01:29.420> be<00:01:29.630> there<00:01:30.039> and<00:01:31.039> you'll

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
racetrack they won't be there and you'll

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.889 
racetrack they won't be there and you'll
need<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.460> find<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.759> winter<00:01:32.060> back<00:01:32.299> to<00:01:32.479> buying<00:01:32.750> it

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
need to find a winter back to buying it

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:42.500 
need to find a winter back to buying it
elsewhere

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.510 

okay<00:01:43.510> so<00:01:43.570> once<00:01:44.080> you<00:01:44.260> start<00:01:44.320> descending<00:01:45.040> on<00:01:45.310> the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
okay so once you start descending on the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.430 
okay so once you start descending on the
racetrack<00:01:46.450> you'll<00:01:46.930> see<00:01:47.080> that<00:01:47.140> there's<00:01:47.350> this

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
racetrack you'll see that there's this

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.010 
racetrack you'll see that there's this
huge<00:01:47.770> bridge<00:01:48.100> spanning<00:01:48.550> it<00:01:48.790> air<00:01:49.420> spanning<00:01:49.900> the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
huge bridge spanning it air spanning the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.830 
huge bridge spanning it air spanning the
island<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.520> there's<00:01:51.850> five<00:01:52.120> wind<00:01:52.420> turbines

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
island and there's five wind turbines

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.420 
island and there's five wind turbines
just<00:01:53.200> one<00:01:53.350> side<00:01:53.650> of<00:01:53.800> this<00:01:53.890> bridge<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:54.400> that

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
just one side of this bridge so that

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.210 
just one side of this bridge so that
they're<00:01:54.790> very<00:01:54.940> easy<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.360> see<00:01:55.830> so<00:01:56.830> now<00:01:57.010> I'm

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
they're very easy to see so now I'm

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.390 
they're very easy to see so now I'm
gonna<00:01:57.370> do<00:01:57.610> is<00:01:57.880> I'm<00:01:58.120> just<00:01:58.150> gonna<00:01:58.420> land<00:01:58.780> here<00:01:59.400> I'm

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
gonna do is I'm just gonna land here I'm

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.220 
gonna do is I'm just gonna land here I'm
gonna<00:02:00.580> spawn<00:02:00.910> myself<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.420> helicopter<00:02:02.020> you<00:02:02.170> can

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
gonna spawn myself a helicopter you can

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.990 
gonna spawn myself a helicopter you can
use<00:02:02.470> any<00:02:02.650> chopper<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.100> like<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.610> always<00:02:03.820> choose

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
use any chopper you like I always choose

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.370 
use any chopper you like I always choose
the<00:02:04.030> rowlandson<00:02:04.660> because<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:05.050> find<00:02:05.260> it<00:02:05.350> very

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the rowlandson because I find it very

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:14.080 
the rowlandson because I find it very
maneuverable

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.510 

now<00:02:14.630> what<00:02:14.810> we<00:02:14.930> want<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.140> do<00:02:15.319> is<00:02:15.590> we<00:02:15.860> want<00:02:16.069> to<00:02:16.190> fly

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
now what we want to do is we want to fly

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.510 
now what we want to do is we want to fly
up<00:02:16.700> two<00:02:16.880> wars<00:02:17.120> one<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.569> turbines<00:02:18.310> we<00:02:19.310> want

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
up two wars one of the turbines we want

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.870 
up two wars one of the turbines we want
to<00:02:19.640> be<00:02:19.760> sort<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.150> reasonable<00:02:20.480> distance<00:02:20.750> away

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
to be sort of a reasonable distance away

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.530 
to be sort of a reasonable distance away
but<00:02:22.880> within<00:02:23.150> grappling<00:02:24.080> distance<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:26.420> I'm

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
but within grappling distance so I'm

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.760 
but within grappling distance so I'm
just<00:02:26.750> going<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.930> sort<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.170> position<00:02:27.650> the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
just going to sort of position the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.120 
just going to sort of position the
chopper<00:02:28.010> here<00:02:29.050> I'm<00:02:30.050> just<00:02:30.170> gonna<00:02:30.319> stabilize<00:02:30.650> it

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
chopper here I'm just gonna stabilize it

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.520 
chopper here I'm just gonna stabilize it
so<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:31.370> nice<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:31.730> still<00:02:31.970> now<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.540> I'm<00:02:33.380> then

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
so it's nice and still now and I'm then

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.589 
so it's nice and still now and I'm then
going<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.739> scoop<00:02:33.980> them<00:02:34.160> from<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.580> aim<00:02:35.209> at<00:02:35.450> one

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
going to scoop them from it aim at one

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.570 
going to scoop them from it aim at one
of<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.780> rotating<00:02:36.170> blades<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.130> I'm<00:02:37.400> just

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
of the rotating blades and I'm just

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.370 
of the rotating blades and I'm just
gonna<00:02:37.700> keep<00:02:38.000> pressing<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.750> grapple<00:02:39.080> button

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
gonna keep pressing the grapple button

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.259 
gonna keep pressing the grapple button
so<00:02:39.590> as<00:02:39.739> soon<00:02:39.950> as<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:40.220> rescue<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.700> over<00:02:40.970> one<00:02:41.120> the

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
so as soon as the rescue is over one the

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.500 
so as soon as the rescue is over one the
blaze<00:02:41.450> reco<00:02:41.870> will<00:02:42.050> fire<00:02:43.000> now<00:02:44.000> when<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.269> swing

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
blaze reco will fire now when you swing

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.000 
blaze reco will fire now when you swing
jump<00:02:44.720> from<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:44.959> chopper<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.830> weight

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
jump from a chopper the the weight

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.530 
jump from a chopper the the weight
shifts<00:02:46.430> forward<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.940> your<00:02:47.030> helicopters<00:02:47.450> will

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
shifts forward and your helicopters will

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.970 
shifts forward and your helicopters will
start<00:02:47.780> moving<00:02:47.900> forward<00:02:48.440> as<00:02:48.530> you're<00:02:48.650> hanging

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
start moving forward as you're hanging

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.770 
start moving forward as you're hanging
from<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.549> we<00:02:50.090> want<00:02:50.299> to<00:02:50.360> make<00:02:50.480> sure<00:02:50.510> that

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
from it and we want to make sure that

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.180 
from it and we want to make sure that
the<00:02:50.930> chopper<00:02:51.170> doesn't<00:02:51.590> hit<00:02:51.799> one<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.100> the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
the chopper doesn't hit one of the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.830 
the chopper doesn't hit one of the
blades<00:02:52.459> for<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.880> reason<00:02:53.180> I'll<00:02:53.269> explain<00:02:53.600> in<00:02:53.780> a

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
blades for a reason I'll explain in a

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.140 
blades for a reason I'll explain in a
minute<00:02:53.959> so<00:02:54.500> this<00:02:55.010> is<00:02:55.190> why<00:02:55.340> work<00:02:55.610> we're<00:02:55.880> sort<00:02:56.120> of

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
minute so this is why work we're sort of

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.309 
minute so this is why work we're sort of
keeping<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.540> distance<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:57.440> I'm<00:02:57.530> gonna<00:02:57.650> do<00:02:57.920> the

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
keeping a distance so I'm gonna do the

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.949 
keeping a distance so I'm gonna do the
the<00:03:00.319> glitch<00:03:00.650> now<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:01.670> I'm<00:03:01.760> just<00:03:01.790> gonna<00:03:01.970> keep

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
the glitch now so I'm just gonna keep

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.120 
the glitch now so I'm just gonna keep
pressing<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.440> grapple<00:03:03.739> at<00:03:03.830> one<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.040> the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
pressing the grapple at one of the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.300 
pressing the grapple at one of the
blades<00:03:04.310> here<00:03:04.819> we<00:03:04.880> go<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:06.010> you'll<00:03:07.010> see<00:03:07.220> that

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
blades here we go and you'll see that

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.610 
blades here we go and you'll see that
what<00:03:07.489> happens<00:03:07.519> is<00:03:08.060> reco<00:03:08.450> fires<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:10.280> the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
what happens is reco fires and the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.229 
what happens is reco fires and the
grapples<00:03:12.620> sort<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.010> went<00:03:13.250> towards<00:03:13.790> where<00:03:14.030> the

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
grapples sort of went towards where the

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.600 
grapples sort of went towards where the
blade<00:03:14.599> was<00:03:14.870> positioned<00:03:15.410> when<00:03:16.190> we<00:03:16.310> were<00:03:16.430> first

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
blade was positioned when we were first

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.220 
blade was positioned when we were first
aiming<00:03:17.030> at<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.360> but<00:03:17.569> of<00:03:17.660> course<00:03:17.720> because<00:03:18.019> the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
aiming at it but of course because the

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.500 
aiming at it but of course because the
blade<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:18.560> moved<00:03:18.799> from<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.100> position<00:03:19.510> you

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
blade is moved from that position you

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.500 
blade is moved from that position you
get<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.840> glitch<00:03:21.370> there's<00:03:22.370> nothing<00:03:22.730> for<00:03:22.970> reco

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
get the glitch there's nothing for reco

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.599 
get the glitch there's nothing for reco
to<00:03:23.660> zip<00:03:23.840> towards<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.829> he<00:03:24.950> just<00:03:25.130> ends<00:03:25.400> up<00:03:25.489> in

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
to zip towards and he just ends up in

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.360 
to zip towards and he just ends up in
this<00:03:25.670> frozen<00:03:25.970> free-falling<00:03:26.630> position<00:03:27.370> now

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
this frozen free-falling position now

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.099 
this frozen free-falling position now
this<00:03:28.549> is<00:03:28.670> great<00:03:28.790> for<00:03:29.030> screen<00:03:29.329> shots<00:03:29.660> but<00:03:29.900> not

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
this is great for screen shots but not

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:30.729 
this is great for screen shots but not
much<00:03:30.350> else

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
much else

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.970 
much else
so<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:32.180> can<00:03:32.690> aim<00:03:32.810> at<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.109> turbine<00:03:33.530> now<00:03:33.769> and

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
so I can aim at the turbine now and

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.640 
so I can aim at the turbine now and
press<00:03:34.220> my<00:03:34.430> grapple<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:36.170> grapple<00:03:36.500> wall

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
press my grapple and the grapple wall

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.770 
press my grapple and the grapple wall
fire<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:37.760> can<00:03:37.940> hear<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.209> pinging<00:03:38.450> the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
fire and I can hear it pinging the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.780 
fire and I can hear it pinging the
surface<00:03:39.200> of<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.470> turbine<00:03:39.890> but<00:03:40.160> reco<00:03:40.519> doesn't

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
surface of the turbine but reco doesn't

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.030 
surface of the turbine but reco doesn't
move<00:03:40.910> position<00:03:41.329> at<00:03:41.420> all<00:03:41.709> likewise<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.889> can

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
move position at all likewise I can

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.490 
move position at all likewise I can
press<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.340> buttons<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.940> select<00:03:44.900> my<00:03:45.049> weapons

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
actually so what's interesting about the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.170 
actually so what's interesting about the
glitch<00:04:23.160> well<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:24.810> helicopter<00:04:25.620> that<00:04:26.400> you

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
glitch well the helicopter that you

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.690 
glitch well the helicopter that you
perform<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.200> glitch<00:04:28.380> from<00:04:28.770> stays

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
perform the glitch from stays

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.600 
perform the glitch from stays
accelerating<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:30.780> stays<00:04:31.020> in<00:04:31.230> midair<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.830> it

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
accelerating it stays in midair and it

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.540 
accelerating it stays in midair and it
seems<00:04:32.910> that<00:04:33.000> Rico<00:04:33.450> is<00:04:33.630> is<00:04:33.900> sort<00:04:34.890> of<00:04:34.950> linked

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
seems that Rico is is sort of linked

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.660 
seems that Rico is is sort of linked
with<00:04:35.760> this<00:04:35.970> in<00:04:36.900> some<00:04:36.960> way<00:04:37.440> so<00:04:38.160> in<00:04:38.400> fact<00:04:38.550> the

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
with this in some way so in fact the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.310 
with this in some way so in fact the
reason<00:04:38.790> that<00:04:38.970> we<00:04:39.090> position<00:04:39.330> ourselves<00:04:39.570> so<00:04:40.050> far

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
reason that we position ourselves so far

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.770 
reason that we position ourselves so far
from<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.620> Servine<00:04:41.070> was<00:04:41.820> as<00:04:42.210> soon<00:04:42.450> as<00:04:42.630> the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
from the Servine was as soon as the

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.870 
from the Servine was as soon as the
helicopter<00:04:42.930> receives<00:04:43.920> any<00:04:44.190> kind<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.520> impact

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
helicopter receives any kind of impact

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.490 
helicopter receives any kind of impact
so<00:04:45.240> if<00:04:45.360> one<00:04:45.540> of<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.720> survival<00:04:46.200> aides<00:04:46.320> for

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
so if one of the survival aides for

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.890 
so if one of the survival aides for
example<00:04:46.920> manages<00:04:47.370> or<00:04:47.850> completely<00:04:48.420> destroys

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
example manages or completely destroys

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.350 
example manages or completely destroys
the<00:04:49.260> helicopter<00:04:50.220> then<00:04:50.370> Rico<00:04:50.700> will<00:04:50.880> become

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
the helicopter then Rico will become

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.480 
the helicopter then Rico will become
unfrozen<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.290> just<00:04:52.710> start<00:04:52.920> falling<00:04:53.070> towards

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
unfrozen and just start falling towards

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.760 
unfrozen and just start falling towards
the<00:04:53.580> ground
