 It gives that atmosphere of recollection is a 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.190
 a space that projects us a little 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.680
 past times one of the most phrases 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.530
 most beautiful I've heard of this 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.340

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.220
 he said it's like a small museum yes we have 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.670

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.369

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.399
 family for work lunches for 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.580
 celebrations for weddings is a place 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.679
 very special and where where the volumes 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.429
 the whole structure is incredible here 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.229
 of the village is original and as you see here 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.659
 at this point we have the old 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.149
 good cribs I'll see Carlos and 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.520
 we are here in the in this dining room 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.649
 ready for a celebration a wedding 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.640
 in this case it is a space with a lot 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:07.340
 light a big space and where the boyfriends 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.310
 here they feel like in that place 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.000
 romantic dream itself where ever 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.250
 they have always thought that the celebration 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.519
 of a wedding when someone attracts you to a 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.319
 little this is this natural space like 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.890
 where we are we are in full 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.180
 reserve in a 'rival and in a hamlet 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.660
 authentic in a 17th century castle 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.900
 with one with some beams 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.730
 very old elements, well, good 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.240
 I think he projects us a little to that 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.640
 nostalgia yesterday but in that 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.890
 present that the bride and groom require today 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.080
 and with a kitchen of the highest level that 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.420
 it's a little one of our great 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.360
 separated because the kitchen that we 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.350
 we do here is a kitchen especially is 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.620
 cuisine of the earth is cuisine of flavors 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.500
 and a little bit of those memories but it's a 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.780
 very updated kitchen where the dishes 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.020
 that are elaborated here are very thought 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.390
 in that they project us to what always 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.760
 We have had our our sea to 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.310
 our land our villagers 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.400
 our our people who supply us with 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.190
 everything and fundamentally then there is that 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.800
 project it a dimension to begin 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.390
 where from the vision of the 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:28.040
 product is already something magnificent 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:34.210

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:36.130
 have with a consommÃ© of their thorns 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.590

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.140
 a wonderful seasonal dish of the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.860
 richer things that can eat what 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.730

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.150
 is in the desperate anchovies 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.890

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.840
 you will be able to eat with them you will see what 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.420
 rich they are as if they were crispy 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.690

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.690
