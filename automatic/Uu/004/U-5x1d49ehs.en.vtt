 turf tv for your show received five 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.210
 out of five 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.740
 the missions of the quinté plus and 5-5 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.820
 to accompany me 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.890
 today I am lucky to receive 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.600
 julien conan then Julian even knows 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.910
 if of course a great racing enthusiast 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.439
 but also the current leader of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.810
 championship of the tipsters in gallo 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.430
 hello julien hello paul gillon to 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.990
 all it is a pleasure to receive you 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.460
 likewise for the first under the 2 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.349
 this is a first then appointment 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.270
 you this Thursday at houses laffitte on the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.890
 straight line the kilometer is the price 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.350
 of newmarket is reserved for 4 years and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.329
 more good we announce good ground and I 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.230
 believe that the rope numbers have one 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.969
 special importance 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.280
 yeah on the kilometer of houses 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.940
 laffitte it's really 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.489
 we saw it in the arrival the year 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.840
 last and what will change the race 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.460
 reference to chantilly where he had 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.140
 split in two he had come outside 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.489
 so there normally priority to the when 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.780
 she alone just as much do you believe I 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.320
 think slaughterhouses the kilometer they 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.309
 do not have too much time to 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.480
 her parents' homes in 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.610
 general it's a platoon along the 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.960
 lily go we go south attack with 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.760
 our selection 8 horses 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.850
 so I placed at the top of my selection 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.580
 and the bella the 5 in front of the k3 yb the set 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.100
 twilight of the gods the 2nd quirinus the 14th 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.930
 State Minister on 9 smile woman hast 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.240
 kata sentence and the 12 moscow eight 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.130
 so before you listen to your 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.289
 first selection on the 5th and the bella 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.119
 have a hard race of reference we 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.740
 are the 4th of May at chantilly 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.090
 you will see how you him 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.220
 say the pack but the bella 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.630
 progressing outside this is the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.679
 beautifully wisely waited he did the 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.550
 difference in the last 200 meters 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.440
 we do not see it 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.390
 she literally walks bah yeah 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.130
 really easy it was a comeback 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.020
 in addition to that day so as a great 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.390
 back she comes inside the pack 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.590
 which is never very easy to do at 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.940
 lefebvre unless a lot of margin 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.500
 she really does something on the wii 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.250
 yeah that's really me I think about myself 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.720
 hardly think manu our world juice 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.190
 john damon who had chained success 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.810
 card and I think she has a little the 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.280
 same margin and that she is led to go 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.410
 at the top level and the four kilos 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.760
 moreover I think that when class 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.320
 and the 4 kilos it does not change much 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.020
 especially that two exits on the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.600
 kilometer of victory go I go for it 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.040
 go on we try the undefeated 3 on 3 on 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.570
 this course why not it's a good one 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.850
 basis of the test we continue with 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.380
 leucate wahib that he too was doing his 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.789
 returned the last shot he is fifth 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.800
 for his return he is shortened to 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.150
 this opportunity yes I know you are 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.410
 a little skeptical on your shoulders 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.900
 you know why 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.970
 and yes web I think it's the stroke of 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.989
 pot because it's a bit all or nothing we get 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.970
 remember when he won a quinté 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.870
 14 cents on the toboggan year 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.870
 last he had made an impression 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.280
 crazy that day good it was a little 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.540
 less but then the return of the time 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.520
 over 12 hundred meters I have a lot 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.390
 loved it's really well behaved i 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.400
 think it's a test 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.840
 is that 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.459
 can the kilometer please him 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.629
 if he likes it because he has a lot of 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.400
 basic speed I think it's more 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.110
 fast than brave me I think that's it 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.950
 can walk 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.209
 if not at worst we will return to his 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.560
 favorite distance but it's a 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.459
 really fun bet but there is but 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.319
 the agreement of 15 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.209
 there is one but it's true and that's 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.590
 annoying now in pure value 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.030
 appears the Bella I think it is 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.409
 really better than his rivals of the day 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.120
 so it does not bother me because the 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.590
 yard to see himself roll he will wait and 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.700
 he is able to come outside 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.200
 unlike other orders in 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.090
 3rd position we are going to sell the set 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.829
 twilight of the gods so he too 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.720
 it's a psf horse but able to 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.010
 beautiful things also in good ground yes 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.750
 so here it is my favorite goes 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.280
 really the last time when he has 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.510
 run quinté over 200 m this is a 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.129
 nightmare he really never had the 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.069
 passage but she's really really 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.299
 a lot of gas to finish he did his 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.340
 weapons in handicaps a little bit 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.989
 less noted and there won 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.340
 several and the choice of arrival at 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.420
 mature I think and last year 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.920
 it's when other planets that 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.989
 exists for that they started on 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.400
 the kilometer like him it was also a 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.620
 dell expensive but hey it was not the same 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.079
 mauricio delcher christian council 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.159
 okay and I think this choice there 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.389
 it can be revealed at this level because 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.069
 that he really has a big fat 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.379
 mach speed at rest we will listen 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.209
 in his coach gilles ointment is 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:49.970
 went to meet him this is our first 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:49.970
 info field we did not find 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:59.639
 regularly very stay to who could 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.329
 to be as successful on the on the 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:06.209
 turf that are the pff it's a head to 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.609
 head on horseback and at the beginning we had 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.859
 had the head of who could be too 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.440
 performing well on grass but when the track 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:17.070
 he was he wants to do it as well 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.870
 so it's a psm horse is 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.260
 also rife that it should 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.389
 suit 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.669
 we continue with the number 2 peer innus 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.409
 is a real beast to fifth the other 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.430
 day it's really badly pinned bah 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.840
 yes in the bunch of the rope one can 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.370
 we can nevertheless it was born a little 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.990
 soon it will play little to 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.600
 the 6th 7th and 8th places 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.610
 well there he was sixth of this quinté 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.780
 last year with the 18 in the boxes I 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.759
 believe so there is really a number 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.139
 infects he was doing something that day and 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.060
 so the last time before he had done 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.979
 the quinted finish he has the good ground he 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.720
 is really performing well on the 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.759
 kilometer because it's hard to 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.960
 the effort so he goes from afar he 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.120
 prolong his effort and prolong his 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.380
 effort so really it's today 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.759
 he really has a lot of assets in his 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.620
 game there is a lot of weight against 1 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.270
 he is charged to win I think that 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.810
 it's complicated really after could 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.889
 3-4-5 given his courage and his experience at 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.050
 this level because that's nothing 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.979
 when we know well in the quintés I 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.120
 think he really has a very beautiful 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.320
 luck for places because he will have 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.000
 maybe more other conditions too 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.860
 favorable to see moment of agreement so 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.900
 it's a commitment for him we continue 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.039
 with the 14 ministers of state where he had 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.110
 placed in fifth position 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.180
 before you will hear about it 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.009
 we listen to his coach chrystelle 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.520
 cardinal cédric philippe went to his 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:27.099
 meet 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.680
 this is our second info very ground 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:31.810
 well 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.510
 expert have our rope number and like 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.160
 the gide friend admires glasses 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.770
 we can say the first five you 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.990
 think I'd like it but hey it's 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.360
 that he did not grace the very weight in 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.180
 giving the best of himself even if we 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.000
 is here we are better than 5th we will be very 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.460
 happy then no margin to the weight 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.510
 a good rope number this is the case he has 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.330
 inherited from number 5 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.860
 hey he's a good servant yeah 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.630
 I think you limit a little harsh 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.310
 as he finished fourth of the quinté at 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.740
 Longchamp have gone where it was not 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.050
 necessarily well spent ball to him it's 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.700
 same he won the express on 800 m this 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.170
 hair the pope their famous expression 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.700
 ie speed of speed 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.710
 that he had km is really his sport 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.270
 I think that is going to happen 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.070
 he's going to be behind the leaders and 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.390
 the a5 in the boxes there is going to be I have not 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.910
 third line I thought about the rope 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.860
 if it opens it will place its tip 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.090
 I think he can come and take 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.560
 the a45 it's true he does not have much 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.700
 more margin than that but be careful 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.380
 because it's getting faster 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.060
 is really at ceret if they really go 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.070
 very quickly he is able to put some 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.840
 in but many agree since 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.390
 when we listen to a coach we are a 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.770
 little bit cool web after 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.850
 coaches often are not forced me 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.410
 I am more shocked at the crystal because 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.430
 ok I say it we must take some 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.350
 fund takes risk more shocked 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.850
 okay so that's listening we did the 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.140
 turn of the question do you have 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.070

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.320
 second 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.600
 after being absent I believe during 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.620
 a year it was really very very very 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.940
 pleasant and I think it's a choice 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.500
 who will climb category what he has 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.500
