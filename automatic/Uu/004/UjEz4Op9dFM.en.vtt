00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:07.439 
hey guys welcome back to my test world

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.310 
hey guys welcome back to my test world
here<00:00:07.740> i<00:00:08.690> made<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> cruise<00:00:10.320> ship<00:00:10.349> for<00:00:11.009> you<00:00:11.160> guys

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
here i made a cruise ship for you guys

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.980 
here i made a cruise ship for you guys
sailing<00:00:13.320> ship<00:00:14.570> pirate<00:00:15.570> ship<00:00:15.809> or<00:00:16.020> something

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
sailing ship pirate ship or something

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.359 
sailing ship pirate ship or something
actually<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.699> minecart<00:00:20.699> clock<00:00:22.369> believe

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
actually it's a minecart clock believe

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.910 
actually it's a minecart clock believe
it<00:00:23.460> or<00:00:23.550> not<00:00:24.590> and<00:00:27.380> it's<00:00:28.380> powered<00:00:28.890> by<00:00:30.650> one<00:00:31.650> little

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it or not and it's powered by one little

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.120 
it or not and it's powered by one little
stream<00:00:32.310> of<00:00:32.460> water<00:00:32.610> up<00:00:32.880> top<00:00:33.180> which<00:00:34.050> cycles<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
stream of water up top which cycles of a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.530 
stream of water up top which cycles of a
cart<00:00:35.700> once<00:00:36.330> every<00:00:36.690> minute<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:40.100> when<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.700> minute

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
cart once every minute and when a minute

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.140 
cart once every minute and when a minute
happens<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:44.070> cart<00:00:44.730> falls<00:00:45.030> down<00:00:45.360> below<00:00:45.750> and

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
happens the cart falls down below and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.120 
happens the cart falls down below and
take<00:00:48.150> suppl<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.630> takes<00:00:49.260> its<00:00:49.440> place<00:00:49.470> down<00:00:49.860> below

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
take suppl it takes its place down below

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.290 
take suppl it takes its place down below
or<00:00:50.400> it<00:00:50.580> kicks<00:00:50.880> off<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.800> chain<00:00:53.460> reaction<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
or it kicks off the chain reaction that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.660 
or it kicks off the chain reaction that
will<00:00:55.100> tell<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.190> about<00:00:56.250> time<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.580> this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
will tell you about time of this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.230 
will tell you about time of this
basically<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.810> let<00:00:58.380> me<00:00:58.410> set<00:00:58.740> it<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:59.040> for<00:00:59.280> 1159

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
basically so let me set it up for 1159

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.830 
basically so let me set it up for 1159
and<00:01:00.750> then<00:01:01.380> we'll<00:01:01.560> take<00:01:01.740> a<00:01:01.800> look<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:02.970> how

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
and then we'll take a look and see how

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:59.860 
and then we'll take a look and see how
it<00:01:03.990> works<00:01:05.210> go<00:01:06.210> back

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.990 

it's<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.500> little<00:02:01.070> work<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.250> do<00:02:01.490> on<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.730> timing

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
it's a little work to do on the timing

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
it's a little work to do on the timing
on<00:02:02.210> that<00:02:02.270> one<00:02:02.630> but<00:02:04.300> other<00:02:05.300> than<00:02:05.480> that<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.690> worked

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
on that one but other than that I worked

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.600 
on that one but other than that I worked
good<00:02:06.290> all<00:02:06.860> right<00:02:07.010> let's<00:02:07.190> give<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.400> one<00:02:07.580> more

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
good all right let's give it one more

00:02:07.610 --> 00:03:06.490 
good all right let's give it one more
run-through<00:02:09.040> time<00:02:10.040> is<00:02:10.310> eleven<00:02:10.520> fifty-nine

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.500 

so<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.799> little<00:03:08.280> issue<00:03:08.370> with<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.849> carts<00:03:09.180> bump

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
so on a little issue with the carts bump
