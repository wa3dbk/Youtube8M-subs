on the box you know mashup with carnage
and<00:02:19.680> does<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.710> mean<00:02:21.010> we're<00:02:21.130> getting<00:02:21.400> in

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
and does that mean we're getting in

carnage build the figure I don't see
that<00:02:25.630> happening<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:26.170> think<00:02:26.380> they<00:02:26.470> just<00:02:26.620> did<00:02:26.830> it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
that happening I think they just did it

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.310 
that happening I think they just did it
to<00:02:26.950> do<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.190> also<00:02:27.910> he<00:02:28.120> has<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.330> whole<00:02:28.660> back<00:02:28.900> there

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
to do it also he has a whole back there

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.250 
to do it also he has a whole back there
for<00:02:29.610> for<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:30.730> these<00:02:31.600> figures<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:32.140> know

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
for for this these figures you know

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.770 
for for this these figures you know
they're<00:02:32.410> simple<00:02:33.360> they<00:02:34.360> come<00:02:34.540> with<00:02:34.570> no

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
they're simple they come with no

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.580
