reverse and the speed changer you see
the<00:00:54.300> handles<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:55.129> okay<00:00:56.160> easier<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> pull

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the handles on there okay easier to pull

the<00:00:56.879> speed<00:00:57.449> changer<00:00:57.930> all<00:00:58.680> right<00:00:58.859> when<00:00:59.609> do<00:00:59.730> some

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the speed changer all right when do some

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.580 
the speed changer all right when do some
zoom<00:01:00.120> ins<00:01:00.329> here<00:01:00.570> because<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.320> I

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
zoom ins here because that's what I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.990 
zoom ins here because that's what I
wanted<00:01:02.899> was<00:01:03.899> kind<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> little<00:01:04.949> bit<00:01:05.129> so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
wanted was kind of like a little bit so

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.620 
wanted was kind of like a little bit so
bear<00:01:06.810> with<00:01:06.840> me<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.330> video<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.390> one

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
bear with me here this is a video of one

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.039 
bear with me here this is a video of one
particular<00:01:09.810> person<00:01:10.320> really

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
particular person really

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.469 
particular person really
but<00:01:12.469> hopefully<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.609> other<00:01:13.729> guys<00:01:13.939> can<00:01:14.210> use<00:01:14.329> it

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
but hopefully the other guys can use it

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.469 
but hopefully the other guys can use it
as<00:01:14.570> well<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:16.280> trouble<00:01:16.579> with<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.880> governor

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
as well and in trouble with the governor

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.919 
as well and in trouble with the governor
linkage<00:01:18.549> try<00:01:19.549> to<00:01:19.609> zoom<00:01:19.850> into<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.210> linkage

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929

linkage try to zoom into the linkage
here<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:22.280> know<00:01:22.399> it<00:01:22.579> goes<00:01:23.320> it's<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.409> trial

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
here you know it goes it's the trial

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.319 
here you know it goes it's the trial
think<00:01:25.130> if<00:01:25.219> it<00:01:25.369> goes<00:01:25.490> up<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.789> the<00:01:25.850> handlebars

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
think if it goes up to the handlebars

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.410 
think if it goes up to the handlebars
right<00:01:27.200> is<00:01:27.409> your<00:01:27.560> governor<00:01:27.920> here<00:01:28.219> all<00:01:29.179> right

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
right is your governor here all right

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.139 
right is your governor here all right
which<00:01:29.719> obviously<00:01:30.429> works<00:01:31.429> according<00:01:31.759> to<00:01:32.030> the

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
which obviously works according to the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.559 
which obviously works according to the
lowest<00:01:32.979> attractor<00:01:33.979> is<00:01:34.009> under<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:35.030> one<00:01:35.270> here

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
lowest attractor is under this one here

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.929 
lowest attractor is under this one here
runs<00:01:35.929> down<00:01:36.200> below<00:01:36.560> that's<00:01:36.890> your<00:01:37.219> choke

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
runs down below that's your choke

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.539 
runs down below that's your choke
that's<00:01:38.569> your<00:01:38.750> choke<00:01:39.020> in<00:01:39.229> and<00:01:39.409> out<00:01:39.530> opens<00:01:40.399> and

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
that's your choke in and out opens and

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.059 
that's your choke in and out opens and
closes<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.939> choke<00:01:41.209> down<00:01:41.929> there<00:01:42.259> all<00:01:42.890> right

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
closes the choke down there all right

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.649 
closes the choke down there all right
that's<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.880> way<00:01:43.969> they<00:01:44.209> were

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
that's the way they were

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.510 
that's the way they were
that's<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.770> original<00:01:48.220> continental<00:01:49.220> engine

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
that's the original continental engine

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.649 
that's the original continental engine

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
with the pull rope not the recoil start

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.600 
with the pull rope not the recoil start
the<00:01:54.319> one<00:01:54.530> feature<00:01:54.799> that<00:01:54.979> came<00:01:55.280> when<00:01:55.489> these

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
the one feature that came when these

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.429 
the one feature that came when these
tractors<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:56.149> mine<00:01:56.420> does<00:01:56.599> not<00:01:56.810> have<00:01:57.049> is<00:01:57.289> the

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
tractors that mine does not have is the

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.440 
tractors that mine does not have is the
recoil<00:01:57.799> start<00:01:58.250> which<00:01:58.970> is<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.149> spring-loaded

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
recoil start which is a spring-loaded

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.389 
recoil start which is a spring-loaded
start<00:01:59.959> like<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:00.200> cpo<00:02:00.799> longbows<00:02:01.250> and

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
start like the cpo longbows and

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.609 
start like the cpo longbows and
everything<00:02:01.670> today<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.750> original<00:02:03.140> rope<00:02:03.349> he

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
everything today the original rope he

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:04.779 
everything today the original rope he
had<00:02:03.739> to<00:02:03.799> wrap<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.069> rope<00:02:04.219> around<00:02:04.340> here<00:02:04.640> and

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
had to wrap the rope around here and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.529 
had to wrap the rope around here and
pull<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:06.700> that's<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.909> way<00:02:07.969> she<00:02:08.149> started

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
pull it and that's the way she started

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.520 
pull it and that's the way she started
up<00:02:09.940> we<00:02:10.940> simple<00:02:11.360> two<00:02:11.480> extremely<00:02:11.959> extremely

up we simple two extremely extremely

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.710 
up we simple two extremely extremely
strong<00:02:12.950> like<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.340> other<00:02:13.459> one<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:13.819> these<00:02:14.599> were

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
strong like the other one is these were

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:23.370 
strong like the other one is these were
made<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.200> military<00:02:15.799> standard<00:02:16.239> engines<00:02:17.239> and

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.309 

briggs<00:02:24.380> could<00:02:24.859> not<00:02:24.980> keep<00:02:25.130> up<00:02:25.280> with<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.489> demand

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
briggs could not keep up with the demand

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.960 
briggs could not keep up with the demand
the<00:02:27.319> post-war<00:02:27.910> demands<00:02:28.910> with<00:02:29.870> all<00:02:30.410> kinds<00:02:30.799> of

mechanical things and you don't know the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.949 
mechanical things and you don't know the
supplier<00:02:33.829> so<00:02:34.480> that's<00:02:35.480> why<00:02:35.600> they<00:02:35.720> use<00:02:35.840> the

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
supplier so that's why they use the
