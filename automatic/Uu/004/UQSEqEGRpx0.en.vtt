00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
as to where you where you cut them now

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.460 
as to where you where you cut them now
if<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.329> there's<00:01:36.570> going<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.840> continue

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
if you think there's going to continue

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.380
