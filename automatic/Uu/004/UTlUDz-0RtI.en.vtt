00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.550
 one of the English parents beyond 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.250
 of his generation the amparo was named in the tournament team of the uefa of 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.829
 2004 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.739
 and his scoring ability as a midfielder will spur 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.899
 exercise in their national competition as in the uefa champions league 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.079
 the deceased people of another type of london 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.850
 answer the pupils of sixto noguez as a player 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.840
 your palette 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.330
 but that advance 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.350
 the first game I remember was my father's last with something is to act 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.140
 against liverpool and I remember it because whoever was gray was 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.329
 nonetheless the treasure placed in the eighth inning when of my father 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.260
 coming out with the match ball because it was their last meeting and everything 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.199
 the world knew it I grew up as an amateur of the west ham and the pride of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.790
 that my father was playing was something huge santander 4 later juan 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.460
 assistants 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.060
 as such he has died and if there is or not to abort the costs my father was demanding in the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240
 work in which to work with a lot of effort 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.690
 I think that even with 5 6 and 7 years old I was seeing weaknesses in me 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.440
 I always saw that I do not leash like lightning for what made me work 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.170
 constantly doing is prince in the garden behind the house so that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.620
 local improvement should be sitting by moving ore 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.470
 I think the only thing that my father tried to instill month hard work as 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.970
 teenager I think even more so than when I was a child because there was more 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.910
 things out there to distract yourself with 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.760
 my father always made me work on my weaknesses and he worried about me 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.100
 I will dedicate to football from small if I speak with someone now 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.070
 Many people tell young people that they have to have fun playing soccer 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.760
 and I agree with that but sometimes you do not have fun you have to see also the 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.210
 bad side to get where you want if I had not done things 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.890
 unpleasant small 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.610
 because I did not want to experience in the home garden but I did it and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.659
 maybe that helped me to be there will have higher average capacity 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.280
 duncan of the 'golden ball' vote of 2005 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.900
 the jagged young parties that are beginning the importance of cancer and the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.459
 training 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.349
 despite registering any part we will see without a doubt and sometimes I think when not 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.349
 I wanted to do it 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.519
 When I was little my father almost forced me and then when I got older 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.590
 I forced myself to do it because if I did not, I felt bad with myself 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.429
 same 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.869
 if you want to get to the elite you need some players maybe 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:31.669
 are naturally gifted I do not know if lionel messi has to do careers 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:35.699
 side to side win run and this class of players but I knew something that 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:39.549
 I had to do or strengthen, and I think it has given me a bit of luck 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.989
 throughout my career if you work hard you feel it when you play if 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.829
 you get that bit of luck so my feudal mentality works or times the 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.389
 phrase lovers soccer 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.529
 obama has made the fund has greater do and adolescence try to find 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:57.399
 my own ways to train I was different my father was lateral and I want 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:00.149
 players inside the field and I realized that I was not going up and 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:01.430
 lowering enough 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.700
 so I thought what better way to do it than following the path of a 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.060
 midfielder and I started running from the edge of an area is on the edge of 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.300
 opposite area there fateful like 8 repetitions of that first I was jogging 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.330
 of the end and then I returned sprinting and so again and again then I gave myself 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.490
 realize that sometimes you have to stop half the way to turn around and run 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.010
 in the opposite direction if it stops in attack for example so I used to do 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.700
 this as fast as I could and once in a while when I had the day off in 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.860
 the Huesca went and did some extra races nowadays like 12 or 13 years 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.970
 Afterwards, I do not continue to do it, because even that head is the path of a 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.970
 midfielder to him belongs euros rank 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.479
 named uefa midfielder of the year in 2008 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.739
 we have to walk until the departure of key areas of success in the position of 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.079
 midfielder 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.099
 ccoo has hidden the dream of a dirty man without doubt would say that the mobility everest 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.739
 and he took on campers but I think the most important thing is mobility and that 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.669
 means you have to be available for the ball when I was 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.859
 young maybe yes my love party played hide-and-seek 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.359
 I think it's normal, but when you get older, you become more lame 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.009
 and you realize if you are doing badly there are players who are 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.920
 I respect a lot 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.870
 those who are having a bad game and that despite that are 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.160
 top players and they keep showing up and helping their 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.219
 companions 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:21.279
 so I think mobility is key I also considered that it is 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.239
 important to have a good vision ability since four already a ball in a 

00:04:25.239 --> 00:04:28.990
 reduced space who knows in advance how are you going to play that ball 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.680
 that's what I try to do moving the ball quickly maybe sometimes this 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.590
 it does not look very spectacular inside a team but the chelsea does its best 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.920
 game when we move the ball quickly and I love being in 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.700
 half of all that to achieve all that is very important resistance if 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.440
 you want to have mobility and is always available for the ball 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.010
 You must have the legs and the necessary capacity to achieve a safe 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.190
 in the future scene
