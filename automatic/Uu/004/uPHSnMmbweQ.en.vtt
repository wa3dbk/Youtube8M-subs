00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the end there on that dead he's just

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690 
the end there on that dead he's just
kicking<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:43.890> kicking<00:01:44.189> up<00:01:44.430> that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
kicking up it was just kicking up that

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520 
kicking up it was just kicking up that
time<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.180> guess<00:01:45.450> oh<00:01:45.630> yeah<00:01:45.960> there<00:01:46.170> he<00:01:46.290> jumps

time but I guess oh yeah there he jumps

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.889 
time but I guess oh yeah there he jumps
I<00:01:46.799> guess<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.880> get<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> bit<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.360> bun<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.750> as

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
I guess if you get a bit of a bun up as

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.609 
I guess if you get a bit of a bun up as
well<00:01:49.140> my<00:01:49.890> keep<00:01:50.189> flying<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.299> behind<00:01:51.750> me<00:01:52.140> while

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619

into<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.369> giant<00:01:57.090> hole<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> ground

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
into that a giant hole in the ground

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.190 
into that a giant hole in the ground
fair<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.770> left<00:01:58.950> click<00:01:59.369> left<00:01:59.820> shift<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
fair so it's left click left shift to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.590 
fair so it's left click left shift to
dismount<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.610> recipe<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.149> gold

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
dismount so this is a recipe for gold

dismount so this is a recipe for gold
armor<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.610> they<00:02:05.610> seem<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.240> same<00:02:06.540> as

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700
