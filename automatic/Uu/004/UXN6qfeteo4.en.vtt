00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:10.380
 Hi guys, I went through until the mother's support 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:14.670
 It's been a long time since I've been doing stefan. 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.379
 is now in a complicated process of 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.359
 it is with conjunctivitis 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.310
 bronchitis 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.949
 If you want then I'll talk a little 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.840
 about this nerds like weaving treatment 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.230
 and everything else 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.189
 It's these days and I'm at home, we have to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.950
 take care of him and is also complicated in 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.309
 time to get some sleep, which is 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.719
 Good, you know a sick child. 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.120
 stay right 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.059
 we had I'll make a note 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.160
 on milk 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.969
 despite being a fanta almost making a 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.840
 year and six he still drinks milk and I 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.710
 I changed I 'm not using the whistle anymore. 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.039
 thousand because he is already older and he 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.909
 I take it morning and evening, right? 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.619
 Milk is for he eats at daycare 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.630
 everything normal 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.159
 and if you want it too I can 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.420
 make a video about the detention of 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.150
 daycare is so you know how it is 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.520
 this whole process but just giving a 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.080
 update on the milk I talked to 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.240
 her pediatrician and whether or not she 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.350
 You know that my darling does not weigh 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.619
 in the pocket is expensive and whether or not 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.200
 people have to do is not to save money because 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.280
 daughters all right we say that 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.470
 all that is needed but so 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.369
 possible if he adapted a 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:55.310
 cheaper milk and then she passed the 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:02:00.509
 union of a nÃ© this package that I paid 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:03.119
 1990 in the marketing or bic nec nec in 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:08.069
 city â€‹â€‹the bic but it's the network wall mart 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:11.790
 so it cost 1990 and comes as long as 800 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:16.440
 grams that gives for a long time 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.810
 and I mix because like a 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.700
 Reflux problem 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.950
 so I needed some milk 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.950
 thicker than it should not come down 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.599
 reflux and did not go back to his problem 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.000
 so I put some demos too 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.970
 ylon I put the rice that was the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.209
 unique that he adapted and liked 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.489
 and I tried others in sectoral terms and 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.860
 other others if you search more than 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.769
 they fit in rice 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.739
 so what I do is the small package 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.650
 I can not remember how much water it has 230 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:53.660
 but it is double that. 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.660
 what is almost the size of this data 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.590
 it is on average 200 ml which is the same as it 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.340
 take 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:11.159
 I put the wisdom that comes 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.849
 within a radius of a name that comes in the other 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:24.900
 milk in the attack 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:27.150
 had I use the 56's of silom to leave 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.400
 a little thicker for him does not have 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:35.370
 problem he adapted south too 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.450
 thank god and that there is an economy and 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.950
 so great and it just even taking 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.709
 morning and evening 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.870
 The food he's eating, thank God. 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.599
 everything is very difficult to reject 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.310
 something so then he has already 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.280
 adapted with that milk is already taking 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.930
 I think it will do in the three months to 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.799
 but I do not remember 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.010
 and this is so I recommend it is very is 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.760
 as good as others and without saying that 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.129
 It's a little cheaper, I think. 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.040
 receive more when I was in the 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.950
 my way and only now he does not take 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.199
 Only that he ends up eating too. 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.350
 so special I hope you have 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:22.710
 liked it about the formula milks 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.740
 A kiss and until the next video bye 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.740
 bye
