00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 i 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.540
 this is square talk now 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.540
 pieces of paper 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.969
 but I'm doing both the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.190
 cocoon because we are going to talk about one thing 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.990
 that we love and it's dancing that's so 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.460
 pretty with an artistic expression that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.439
 that of our body that you do not need 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.070
 nothing you just need your body and you 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.730
 feeling to make them 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.410
 but we want to move it to discuss or 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.410
 where all the rock goes to everything here 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.750
 and we have chosen 10 tigejos and hass type 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.910
 that there is always a disco and always 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.680
 you're going to see someone dance like that in the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.330
 disco you will always find them 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.710
 in any club you go there 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.660
 where are you going to find these 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.570
 characters can be on the podium in the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.989
 corners or maybe in the middle of the track 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.989
 we started strong 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.810
 in this study 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.100
 the green of number one is jazz dance 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.470
 is the dancer who is motivated because he knows 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.390
 dance but is motivated so much that people 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.810
 ends badly the world looks bad you get it right 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.810
 what to dance 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.110
 the show the show is the typical one they do 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.610
 all the steps of the video of the infa or 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.610
 is that there is no other word 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.840
 this moves from friends friends and so 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.730
 until the dance number 3 that you 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.730
 you find in all the clubs is the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.120
 and good the duel usually they dance 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.890
 girls because they like to move their asses 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.230
 I really like to see dance still 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.540
 yeah yeah really costs me because I Turkey 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.970
 let me not put ourselves like this triquis me 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.070
 kiss then there 's the typical dance of the 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.650
 canine the typical dance that can 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.320
 acknowledge for your forgiveness ring for your 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.320
 pint of cannes for his hospital 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.510
 Well, I always have to dance with 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.370
 some very exaggerated steps that I think that 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.460
 dance well and copy of those who dance 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.460
 all right 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.120
 another dancer we have in the 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.520
 nightclubs is the light effect is a 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.959
 extinct species that continues and that 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.959
 continue with the clubs 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.200
 and good as its name says it is the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.200
 tectonics of extinction 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.800
 It's people who dance tectonic at the time 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.720
 that was fashionable and that still retains 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.720
 those steps that when motivated makes 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.040
 if you want to see a video of how to dance 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.740
 at the time of ivÃ¡n 2 million 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.840
 visits here another dancer is in 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.430
 pockets because maybe he does not know where 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:21.090
 They help put their hands in 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:22.920
 pockets that just keeps pace with the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.290
 music that you know a little bit and that's it 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.270
 another dancer that you can find is 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.700
 the tired is a person who is 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.320

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:38.000
 clear salamander takes her hand from a 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.000
 wall and that's how he 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.440
 and others that there are always Latinos 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.860
 it's not the Latinos who break it 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.860
 dancing 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.010
 they are more typical that they are always there and 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.280
 they dance house with bachata dubstep with 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.280
 bachata 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.610
 and when the time comes they give the perreo 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.610
 maximum that a girl seeks and 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.580

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.229
 ashes of the new era of ld m 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.729
