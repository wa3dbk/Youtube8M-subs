Isaac<00:00:04.620> Newton<00:00:04.770> god<00:00:05.370> bless<00:00:05.759> him<00:00:05.940> for<00:00:06.150> all<00:00:06.240> the

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
Isaac Newton god bless him for all the

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.419 
Isaac Newton god bless him for all the
amazing<00:00:06.690> things<00:00:07.109> that<00:00:07.230> he<00:00:07.379> did<00:00:07.620> thought<00:00:08.010> that

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
amazing things that he did thought that

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.890 
amazing things that he did thought that
our<00:00:08.639> world<00:00:08.970> was<00:00:09.179> simpler<00:00:09.480> than<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.750> actually

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
our world was simpler than it actually

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.410 
our world was simpler than it actually
was<00:00:10.110> when<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.590> Apple<00:00:11.280> fell<00:00:11.519> off<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.790> tree<00:00:12.059> he

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
was when that Apple fell off the tree he

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.580 
was when that Apple fell off the tree he
thought<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.840> was<00:00:12.929> gravity<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.469> was

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
thought that it was gravity that was

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.720 
thought that it was gravity that was
pulling<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.920> Eddie

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
pulling it Eddie

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.019 
pulling it Eddie
that<00:00:15.000> was<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> good<00:00:15.389> example<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.020> if<00:00:16.680> not

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
that was a good example of if not

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.580 
that was a good example of if not
gravity<00:00:18.029> at<00:00:18.270> least<00:00:18.539> equal<00:00:19.140> an<00:00:19.230> opposite

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
gravity at least equal an opposite

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.950 
gravity at least equal an opposite
reaction<00:00:19.710> stuff<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.520> Apple<00:00:20.910> hit<00:00:21.119> me<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.600> I

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
reaction stuff the Apple hit me and I

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.470 
reaction stuff the Apple hit me and I
moved<00:00:22.230> away<00:00:22.580> because<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.730> Apple<00:00:24.060> hit<00:00:24.210> me<00:00:24.359> in

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
moved away because the Apple hit me in

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.599 
moved away because the Apple hit me in
that<00:00:24.689> that's<00:00:24.960> what<00:00:25.289> my<00:00:25.439> head<00:00:25.650> did<00:00:25.949> equal<00:00:26.519> and

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
that that's what my head did equal and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.450 
that that's what my head did equal and
opposite<00:00:26.849> reaction<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:28.410> energy<00:00:28.590> had<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.310> go

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
opposite reaction the energy had to go

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.400 
opposite reaction the energy had to go
somewhere<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.449> went<00:00:30.570> into<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> Apple

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
somewhere and so it went into the Apple

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.170 
somewhere and so it went into the Apple
and<00:00:31.590> if<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.769> drop<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.130> considerably<00:00:32.790> damaged

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
and if we drop this considerably damaged

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.030 
and if we drop this considerably damaged
Apple<00:00:33.480> down<00:00:33.630> into<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> bowl<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.350> water<00:00:34.620> the

Apple down into a bowl of water the
water<00:00:35.309> would<00:00:35.520> all<00:00:35.670> fly<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.270> that's<00:00:36.899> a

water would all fly up that's a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.440 
water would all fly up that's a
Newtonian<00:00:37.800> reaction<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.969> fluid

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
Newtonian reaction that's a fluid

behaving<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.170> way<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.379> Isaac<00:00:41.040> Newton

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
behaving in a way that Isaac Newton

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.889 
behaving in a way that Isaac Newton
would<00:00:41.520> expect<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.390> what<00:00:42.540> if<00:00:42.690> instead

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
would expect it to but what if instead

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.270 
would expect it to but what if instead
of<00:00:43.110> splashing<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.710> water<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.100> water

of splashing in the water the water
suddenly<00:00:44.579> solidified<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> Apple
