00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.880 

you<00:00:32.369> know<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.730> first<00:00:33.000> thing<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.770> get

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
you know the first thing is if I can get

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.680 
you know the first thing is if I can get
this<00:00:35.070> working<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:36.270> right<00:00:38.329> click<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
this working here right click I got to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.459 
this working here right click I got to
get<00:00:39.809> my<00:00:39.899> little<00:00:40.110> pointer<00:00:41.360> and<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:43.050> black

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
get my little pointer and do it in black

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.740 
get my little pointer and do it in black
alright<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> an<00:00:46.670> improper<00:00:47.670> fraction<00:00:47.910> remember

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
alright so an improper fraction remember

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.139 
alright so an improper fraction remember
that's<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:49.500> polite<00:00:50.070> now<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.120> just

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that's one that's not polite now it just

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.770 
that's one that's not polite now it just
means<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.260> bigger<00:00:53.539> numerator<00:00:54.539> than

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
means we have a bigger numerator than

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.209 
means we have a bigger numerator than
denominator<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.500> I'm<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> go<00:00:55.949> 8<00:00:58.219> divided

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
denominator so I'm going to go 8 divided

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.039 
denominator so I'm going to go 8 divided
by<00:00:59.250> 3<00:00:59.840> or<00:01:01.309> 8/3<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.699> fraction<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.930> an

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
by 3 or 8/3 the fraction and this is an

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.750 
by 3 or 8/3 the fraction and this is an
improper<00:01:04.379> fraction<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.100> need<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> go<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
improper fraction and I need to go to a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.750 
improper fraction and I need to go to a
mixed<00:01:06.270> number<00:01:06.740> well<00:01:07.740> check<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.549> is

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
mixed number well check this out this is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.780 
mixed number well check this out this is
quite<00:01:08.970> easy<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.920> division<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
quite easy you just do the division and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.780 
quite easy you just do the division and
then<00:01:12.090> look<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> remainder<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.369> would

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
then look at the remainder so I would

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
then look at the remainder so I would
say<00:01:18.140> 8<00:01:20.840> divided<00:01:21.840> by<00:01:21.869> 3<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:23.070> say<00:01:24.060> how<00:01:24.270> many<00:01:24.450> threes

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
say 8 divided by 3 I say how many threes

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.359 
say 8 divided by 3 I say how many threes
are<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.259> 8<00:01:25.530> well<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:26.040> there's<00:01:26.400> two<00:01:26.820> right

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
are in 8 well I think there's two right

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.090 
are in 8 well I think there's two right
and<00:01:29.369> two<00:01:30.380> times<00:01:31.380> 3<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.950> 6<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.460> put<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.820> here

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
and two times 3 is 6 I put this here

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.340 
and two times 3 is 6 I put this here
hey<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:35.030> thought<00:01:35.420> we<00:01:35.570> weren't<00:01:35.750> gonna<00:01:35.900> do<00:01:36.170> any

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
hey I thought we weren't gonna do any

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.850 
hey I thought we weren't gonna do any
long<00:01:36.590> division<00:01:37.100> here<00:01:37.370> well<00:01:38.270> okay<00:01:38.870> so<00:01:38.900> I<00:01:39.440> guess

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
long division here well okay so I guess

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.230 
long division here well okay so I guess
we<00:01:40.040> are<00:01:40.190> gonna<00:01:40.370> do<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.520> little<00:01:40.670> long<00:01:40.940> division

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
we are gonna do a little long division

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.150 
we are gonna do a little long division
alright<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.320> then<00:01:42.440> we're<00:01:42.530> left<00:01:42.740> foot<00:01:42.950> two

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
alright so and then we're left foot two

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.450 
alright so and then we're left foot two
and<00:01:43.340> that's<00:01:43.430> called<00:01:43.729> remainder<00:01:44.660> two<00:01:45.410> so<00:01:46.250> once

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
and that's called remainder two so once

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.070 
and that's called remainder two so once
you<00:01:46.550> have<00:01:46.729> that<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.260> go<00:01:48.440> like<00:01:52.930> and<00:01:53.930> then

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
you have that so you go like and then

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.480 
you have that so you go like and then
this<00:01:54.259> one<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.500> go<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:57.140> take<00:01:57.410> this<00:01:57.710> that's<00:01:58.130> the

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
this one you go you take this that's the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.560 
this one you go you take this that's the
whole<00:01:59.210> number<00:01:59.869> part<00:02:00.729> there's<00:02:01.729> a<00:02:01.940> remainder

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
whole number part there's a remainder

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.660 
whole number part there's a remainder
now<00:02:03.500> what<00:02:03.710> it<00:02:03.830> means<00:02:03.860> when<00:02:04.400> there's<00:02:04.610> a

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
now what it means when there's a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.300 
now what it means when there's a
remainder<00:02:05.150> is<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:06.020> there<00:02:06.500> wasn't<00:02:06.740> quite

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
remainder is that there wasn't quite

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.100 
remainder is that there wasn't quite
another<00:02:07.940> whole<00:02:08.509> three<00:02:09.550> so<00:02:10.600> how<00:02:11.600> many<00:02:11.660> threes

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
another whole three so how many threes

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.470 
another whole three so how many threes
are<00:02:12.440> in<00:02:12.680> eight<00:02:12.980> that's<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.730> question<00:02:14.180> here

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
are in eight that's the question here

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.990 
are in eight that's the question here
well<00:02:14.959> it's<00:02:15.140> two<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.830> some<00:02:16.340> number<00:02:16.700> less<00:02:16.970> than

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
well it's two and some number less than

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.410 
well it's two and some number less than
one<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:18.110> two<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:19.340> take<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.030> put<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.330> on

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
one so two you take it and you put it on

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.600 
one so two you take it and you put it on
top<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.410> three<00:02:21.739> so<00:02:22.010> this<00:02:22.160> would<00:02:22.340> be<00:02:22.459> the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
top of the three so this would be the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.250 
top of the three so this would be the
numerator<00:02:22.850> this<00:02:23.630> would<00:02:23.840> be<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.080> denominator

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
numerator this would be the denominator

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.850 
numerator this would be the denominator
so<00:02:24.890> two<00:02:24.950> divided<00:02:25.880> by<00:02:26.090> three

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
so two divided by three

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.090 
so two divided by three
all<00:02:28.519> right<00:02:28.670> now<00:02:28.850> let's<00:02:29.150> take<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:30.100> mixed

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
all right now let's take this mixed

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.080 
all right now let's take this mixed
number

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
number

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.110 
number
mixed<00:02:32.540> means<00:02:32.750> there's<00:02:32.989> a<00:02:33.670> whole<00:02:34.670> number<00:02:34.880> an

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
mixed means there's a whole number an

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.120 
mixed means there's a whole number an
integer<00:02:35.390> part<00:02:35.750> here<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.320> fraction<00:02:36.920> and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
integer part here in a fraction and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.620 
integer part here in a fraction and
we're<00:02:37.670> gonna<00:02:37.760> take<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.360> I'm<00:02:38.480> gonna

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
we're gonna take it and I'm gonna

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.060 
we're gonna take it and I'm gonna
rewrite<00:02:39.019> it<00:02:39.200> down<00:02:39.230> here<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:42.110> we<00:02:42.620> want<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.950> go

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
rewrite it down here and we want to go

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.500 
rewrite it down here and we want to go
from<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.489> mixed<00:02:43.820> number<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.150> an<00:02:44.299> improper

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
from a mixed number to an improper

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.970 
from a mixed number to an improper
fraction<00:02:44.900> whoops

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
fraction whoops

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.270 
fraction whoops
and<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.910> don't<00:02:46.970> know<00:02:47.239> how<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.530> erase<00:02:48.530> yet

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
and I don't know how to erase yet

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.949 
and I don't know how to erase yet
is<00:02:50.060> there<00:02:50.299> an<00:02:50.390> eraser<00:02:51.610> yes<00:02:52.610> there<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.450> check

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
is there an eraser yes there is check

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:54.699 
is there an eraser yes there is check
that<00:02:54.200> out

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
that out

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.380 
that out
oh<00:02:54.849> that's<00:02:55.849> so<00:02:56.150> cool<00:02:56.659> right-click<00:02:58.390> Wiener

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
oh that's so cool right-click Wiener

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.730 
oh that's so cool right-click Wiener
options

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.730 

that's<00:03:07.220> what<00:03:07.430> -<00:03:07.700> alright<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:08.630> 2/3

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.040 

now<00:03:13.430> how<00:03:14.240> do<00:03:14.300> we<00:03:14.420> do<00:03:14.570> this<00:03:14.630> well<00:03:14.810> there's<00:03:14.990> a

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
now how do we do this well there's a

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.580 
now how do we do this well there's a
great<00:03:15.260> trick<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.960> it<00:03:18.110> kind<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.290> goes<00:03:18.380> like

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
great trick and it kind of goes like

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.000 
great trick and it kind of goes like
this<00:03:18.740> you<00:03:18.980> go<00:03:19.600> three<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:21.410> I'm<00:03:21.650> gonna<00:03:21.800> put<00:03:21.980> a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
this you go three and I'm gonna put a

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:29.200 
this you go three and I'm gonna put a
little<00:03:22.280> arrow<00:03:22.930> times<00:03:27.100> two<00:03:28.100> I<00:03:28.160> always<00:03:28.760> remember

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
little arrow times two I always remember

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.200 
little arrow times two I always remember
it<00:03:29.330> visually<00:03:29.990> or<00:03:30.110> spatially<00:03:30.560> like<00:03:30.770> one<00:03:31.210> right

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
it visually or spatially like one right

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.540 
it visually or spatially like one right
so<00:03:32.720> two<00:03:32.780> times<00:03:33.440> three<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:34.040> then<00:03:34.310> whatever

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
so two times three and then whatever

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.240 
so two times three and then whatever
that<00:03:34.730> is<00:03:36.760> Plus<00:03:37.900> that<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.230> that's<00:03:39.680> what<00:03:40.010> goes

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
that is Plus that and that's what goes

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.710 
that is Plus that and that's what goes
in<00:03:40.520> the<00:03:41.030> numerator<00:03:41.930> so<00:03:42.020> three<00:03:42.620> times<00:03:43.400> two<00:03:45.100> plus

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
in the numerator so three times two plus

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.350 
in the numerator so three times two plus
two<00:03:47.720> all<00:03:49.030> over<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.510> three<00:03:50.930> right<00:03:51.230> there<00:03:51.260> right

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
two all over the three right there right

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.640 
two all over the three right there right
and<00:03:53.360> we're<00:03:53.810> left<00:03:54.050> with<00:03:55.480> six<00:03:56.480> plus<00:03:57.140> two<00:03:57.620> is

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
and we're left with six plus two is

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.620 
and we're left with six plus two is
eight<00:04:00.580> so<00:04:01.580> how<00:04:02.240> do<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:02.420> go<00:04:02.570> from<00:04:04.330> mixed<00:04:05.330> number

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
eight so how do you go from mixed number

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.180 
eight so how do you go from mixed number
to<00:04:05.660> improper<00:04:06.230> fraction<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.740> do<00:04:06.860> that<00:04:06.980> little

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
to improper fraction you do that little

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.850 
to improper fraction you do that little
ticks<00:04:07.310> three<00:04:07.880> times<00:04:08.210> two<00:04:08.540> plus<00:04:09.290> whatever<00:04:09.620> that

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
ticks three times two plus whatever that

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.940 
ticks three times two plus whatever that
is<00:04:10.070> slap<00:04:10.640> it<00:04:10.850> in<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.270> top<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.870> then<00:04:12.470> take<00:04:12.710> the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
is slap it in the top and then take the

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.470 
is slap it in the top and then take the
denominator<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.640> slap<00:04:13.910> it<00:04:14.060> in<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.210> bottom

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
denominator and slap it in the bottom

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.260 
denominator and slap it in the bottom
how<00:04:15.050> do<00:04:15.140> we<00:04:15.260> go<00:04:15.380> from<00:04:15.760> improper<00:04:16.760> fraction<00:04:17.180> to<00:04:17.239> a

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
how do we go from improper fraction to a

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.240 
how do we go from improper fraction to a
mixed<00:04:17.299> number<00:04:17.510> you<00:04:17.840> got<00:04:17.960> to<00:04:18.140> do<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.739> division

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
mixed number you got to do the division

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.950 
mixed number you got to do the division
all<00:04:20.120> right<00:04:20.330> now<00:04:20.920> let's<00:04:21.920> go<00:04:22.190> over<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.580> excel<00:04:23.270> and

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
all right now let's go over to excel and

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.030 
all right now let's go over to excel and
I'm<00:04:24.770> going<00:04:25.100> to<00:04:25.160> keep<00:04:25.520> this<00:04:26.080> over<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.260> excel<00:04:27.650> and

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
I'm going to keep this over to excel and

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.310 
I'm going to keep this over to excel and
let's<00:04:28.700> see

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.950 

the<00:04:33.010> implications<00:04:33.760> of<00:04:33.850> this<00:04:34.000> well<00:04:34.210> let's<00:04:34.540> do

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
the implications of this well let's do

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.460 
the implications of this well let's do
two<00:04:35.380> things<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.860> want<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.250> do<00:04:36.370> equals<00:04:36.940> 8<00:04:37.570> divided

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
two things I want to do equals 8 divided

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.700 
two things I want to do equals 8 divided
by<00:04:38.500> 3<00:04:38.640> here<00:04:39.640> and<00:04:39.970> hopefully<00:04:40.840> yeah<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.230> then

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
by 3 here and hopefully yeah and then

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.560 
by 3 here and hopefully yeah and then
just<00:04:42.310> for<00:04:42.460> kicks<00:04:42.670> I<00:04:42.910> want<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.210> come<00:04:43.360> down<00:04:43.540> here

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
just for kicks I want to come down here

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.100 
just for kicks I want to come down here
and<00:04:44.050> do<00:04:44.200> the<00:04:44.320> mixed<00:04:44.620> number<00:04:44.950> equals<00:04:45.820> 2<00:04:47.400> plus

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
and do the mixed number equals 2 plus

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.830 
and do the mixed number equals 2 plus
2/3<00:04:50.310> when<00:04:51.310> we<00:04:51.490> look<00:04:51.700> at<00:04:51.820> them<00:04:52.030> without<00:04:52.450> this<00:04:52.660> is

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
2/3 when we look at them without this is

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.440 
2/3 when we look at them without this is
the<00:04:52.990> general<00:04:53.500> number<00:04:53.920> format<00:04:54.130> so<00:04:54.760> you<00:04:55.120> see<00:04:55.300> up

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
the general number format so you see up

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.030 
the general number format so you see up
here<00:04:55.480> this<00:04:55.810> is<00:04:55.960> general<00:04:56.470> right<00:04:56.710> same<00:04:57.010> with

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
here this is general right same with

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.670 
here this is general right same with
this<00:04:57.370> one

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
this one

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.190 
this one
they<00:04:59.680> better<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.430> same<00:05:00.700> number<00:05:01.120> but<00:05:01.780> for

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
they better so the same number but for

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.870 
they better so the same number but for
us<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.770> important<00:05:03.190> thing<00:05:03.280> is<00:05:03.400> we<00:05:03.550> need<00:05:03.700> to

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
us the important thing is we need to

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.510 
us the important thing is we need to
convert<00:05:04.330> back<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:04.990> forth<00:05:05.320> prop<00:05:06.040> maybe<00:05:06.340> on<00:05:06.490> a

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
convert back and forth prop maybe on a

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.800 
convert back and forth prop maybe on a
piece<00:05:06.730> of<00:05:06.850> paper<00:05:07.000> or<00:05:07.270> maybe<00:05:07.420> something

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
piece of paper or maybe something

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.050 
piece of paper or maybe something
ridiculous<00:05:08.590> like<00:05:08.890> this<00:05:09.190> I've<00:05:09.430> never<00:05:09.460> added

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
ridiculous like this I've never added

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.600 
ridiculous like this I've never added
piece<00:05:10.300> of<00:05:10.450> paper<00:05:10.630> is<00:05:10.780> easier<00:05:11.110> right<00:05:11.890> but<00:05:12.460> then

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
piece of paper is easier right but then

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.370 
piece of paper is easier right but then
we<00:05:12.730> need<00:05:12.880> to<00:05:13.000> add<00:05:13.120> some<00:05:13.420> formatting<00:05:13.660> so<00:05:14.170> for<00:05:14.320> us

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
we need to add some formatting so for us

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.200 
we need to add some formatting so for us
in<00:05:14.530> excel<00:05:14.860> it's<00:05:15.010> about<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.850> number

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
in excel it's about the number

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.990 
in excel it's about the number
formatting<00:05:16.570> so<00:05:16.780> control<00:05:17.410> one<00:05:18.130> know<00:05:18.610> same

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
formatting so control one know same

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.310 
formatting so control one know same
number<00:05:19.360> but<00:05:19.510> different<00:05:19.690> it's<00:05:19.990> going<00:05:20.080> to<00:05:20.200> get

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
number but different it's going to get

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.590 
number but different it's going to get
different<00:05:20.530> number<00:05:21.310> formatting<00:05:21.730> so<00:05:21.880> control<00:05:22.360> 1

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
different number formatting so control 1

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.190 
different number formatting so control 1
that's<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:23.110> format<00:05:23.920> cells<00:05:24.510> go<00:05:25.510> down<00:05:25.750> to

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
that's the format cells go down to

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.200 
that's the format cells go down to
custom<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.550> I'm<00:05:27.640> just<00:05:27.820> going<00:05:27.970> to<00:05:28.000> put

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
custom and I'm just going to put

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:37.879 
custom and I'm just going to put
question<00:05:28.810> marks<00:05:29.080> last<00:05:29.260> question<00:05:29.830> mark

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889

twist<00:05:38.490> marks<00:05:38.759> last<00:05:38.909> question<00:05:39.509> mark<00:05:39.659> alright

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
twist marks last question mark alright

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.600 
twist marks last question mark alright
and<00:05:40.229> then<00:05:40.349> I<00:05:40.440> can<00:05:40.590> see<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.800> little<00:05:41.039> preview

and then I can see the little preview

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.559 
and then I can see the little preview

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.659 
want two and two thirds I'm gonna have
to<00:05:48.210> use<00:05:48.300> a<00:05:48.330> pound<00:05:48.750> sign<00:05:49.259> space<00:05:49.800> question<00:05:50.220> mark

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
to use a pound sign space question mark

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:51.499 
to use a pound sign space question mark
question<00:05:51.120> mark

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.550 
all right so control one I'm down to
custom<00:05:54.180> then<00:05:54.659> I'm<00:05:54.780> just<00:05:54.960> gonna<00:05:55.050> build<00:05:55.319> my<00:05:55.530> own

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
custom then I'm just gonna build my own

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.129 
custom then I'm just gonna build my own
now<00:05:55.830> one<00:05:56.009> of<00:05:56.039> the<00:05:56.690> built-in<00:05:57.690> ones<00:05:57.840> will

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
now one of the built-in ones will

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:00.050 
now one of the built-in ones will
probably<00:05:58.470> work<00:05:58.620> just<00:05:58.919> fine<00:05:59.159> notice<00:05:59.849> if<00:05:59.970> you

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
probably work just fine notice if you

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.330 
probably work just fine notice if you
have<00:06:00.090> just<00:06:00.360> one<00:06:00.479> of<00:06:00.659> them<00:06:00.900> it's<00:06:01.139> going<00:06:01.470> to<00:06:01.530> make

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
have just one of them it's going to make

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.270 
have just one of them it's going to make
it<00:06:02.490> look<00:06:02.729> different<00:06:02.759> than<00:06:03.300> it<00:06:03.449> is<00:06:04.009> and<00:06:05.009> then

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
it look different than it is and then

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.070 
it look different than it is and then
question<00:06:05.849> marks<00:06:06.090> last<00:06:06.300> question<00:06:06.900> mark

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
question marks last question mark

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.879 
question marks last question mark
because<00:06:07.259> I<00:06:07.349> want<00:06:07.530> two<00:06:07.710> and<00:06:07.889> two<00:06:07.979> thirds<00:06:09.889> right

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
because I want two and two thirds right

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.570 
because I want two and two thirds right
so<00:06:12.409> changing<00:06:13.409> improper<00:06:13.979> fractions<00:06:14.370> to<00:06:14.550> mixed

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
so changing improper fractions to mixed

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.260 
so changing improper fractions to mixed

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
numbers or vice versa we saw how to do a

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.330 
numbers or vice versa we saw how to do a
little<00:06:18.599> bit<00:06:18.780> in<00:06:18.960> Excel<00:06:19.409> the<00:06:19.590> formatting<00:06:20.190> and

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
little bit in Excel the formatting and

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.059 
little bit in Excel the formatting and
how<00:06:20.520> to<00:06:20.580> do<00:06:20.849> it<00:06:20.969> by<00:06:21.120> hand<00:06:21.389> all<00:06:22.169> right<00:06:22.729> this<00:06:23.729> is

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:25.069 
how to do it by hand all right this is

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.770 
how to do it by hand all right this is
officially<00:06:26.069> the<00:06:26.129> end<00:06:26.219> of<00:06:26.490> section<00:06:26.879> 2.1<00:06:27.360> and

actually there's one other topic in 2.1

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.170 
actually there's one other topic in 2.1
about<00:06:31.560> divisibility<00:06:32.159> rules<00:06:32.699> you<00:06:32.849> can<00:06:33.000> read

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
about divisibility rules you can read

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.230 
about divisibility rules you can read
through<00:06:33.419> that<00:06:33.449> in<00:06:33.690> the<00:06:33.889> pier<00:06:34.889> all<00:06:35.490> it<00:06:35.759> means<00:06:35.909> is

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
through that in the pier all it means is

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.020 
through that in the pier all it means is
if<00:06:36.979> we're<00:06:37.979> not<00:06:38.159> we're<00:06:38.370> not<00:06:38.400> going<00:06:38.639> to<00:06:38.729> use<00:06:38.879> this

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
if we're not we're not going to use this

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.850 
if we're not we're not going to use this
so<00:06:39.270> but<00:06:39.900> you<00:06:40.080> can<00:06:40.199> look<00:06:40.379> through<00:06:40.469> it's<00:06:40.680> in<00:06:40.770> the

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
so but you can look through it's in the

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.670 
so but you can look through it's in the
textbook<00:06:41.159> or<00:06:41.370> here<00:06:41.639> too<00:06:42.120> if<00:06:42.419> you<00:06:43.139> want<00:06:43.349> to<00:06:43.440> find

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
textbook or here too if you want to find

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.019 
textbook or here too if you want to find
a<00:06:43.830> number<00:06:43.979> and<00:06:44.190> whether<00:06:44.340> it's<00:06:44.520> divisible<00:06:44.969> by

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:45.029 
a number and whether it's divisible by

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:47.959 
a number and whether it's divisible by
two<00:06:45.210> if<00:06:45.690> the<00:06:45.870> last<00:06:46.050> digit<00:06:46.590> is<00:06:46.680> 0<00:06:46.919> 2<00:06:47.009> 4<00:06:47.460> 6<00:06:47.729> or<00:06:47.909> 8

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:47.969 
two if the last digit is 0 2 4 6 or 8

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:51.159 
two if the last digit is 0 2 4 6 or 8
then<00:06:48.509> it's<00:06:48.810> divisible<00:06:49.560> by<00:06:49.620> 2<00:06:49.770> if<00:06:50.370> it's<00:06:50.639> 5

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169 
then it's divisible by 2 if it's 5

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.420 
then it's divisible by 2 if it's 5
you're<00:06:52.169> running<00:06:52.349> off<00:06:52.440> is<00:06:52.560> the<00:06:52.830> number<00:06:53.219> is

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
you're running off is the number is

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.589 
you're running off is the number is
divisible<00:06:53.460> by<00:06:53.969> 5<00:06:54.419> like<00:06:55.580> 455<00:06:56.580> well<00:06:56.909> if<00:06:57.029> it's<00:06:57.180> a<00:06:57.270> 0

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 
divisible by 5 like 455 well if it's a 0

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:00.589 
divisible by 5 like 455 well if it's a 0
or<00:06:57.719> a<00:06:57.960> 5<00:06:58.080> than<00:06:58.620> it<00:06:58.740> is<00:06:58.889> 10<00:06:59.849> if<00:07:00.120> the<00:07:00.240> last<00:07:00.419> digit

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 
or a 5 than it is 10 if the last digit

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:02.180 
or a 5 than it is 10 if the last digit
is<00:07:00.930> 0<00:07:01.139> and<00:07:01.289> then<00:07:01.409> there's<00:07:01.560> some<00:07:01.740> other<00:07:01.979> ones

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
is 0 and then there's some other ones

next video we're going to skip to
section<00:07:12.830> 2.3<00:07:13.830> I<00:07:13.860> think<00:07:14.219> and<00:07:14.370> learn<00:07:14.460> how<00:07:14.639> to

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669 
section 2.3 I think and learn how to

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.269 
section 2.3 I think and learn how to
multiply<00:07:15.060> and<00:07:15.449> divide<00:07:15.539> fractions<00:07:16.319> because

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:17.279 
multiply and divide fractions because

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:19.100 
multiply and divide fractions because
later<00:07:17.729> we'll<00:07:17.969> come<00:07:18.180> back<00:07:18.330> to<00:07:18.479> section<00:07:18.690> 2.2

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
later we'll come back to section 2.2

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.420 
later we'll come back to section 2.2
where<00:07:19.409> we<00:07:19.469> add<00:07:19.650> fractions<00:07:19.919> and<00:07:20.279> that

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
where we add fractions and that

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.159 
where we add fractions and that
multiplying<00:07:21.060> trick<00:07:21.360> will<00:07:21.539> help<00:07:21.690> us<00:07:21.810> alright

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:22.169 
multiplying trick will help us alright

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:24.830 
multiplying trick will help us alright
