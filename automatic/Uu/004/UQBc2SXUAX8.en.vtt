just negate it so it won't be able to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.200 
just negate it so it won't be able to
destroy<00:00:43.500> your<00:00:43.680> stuff<00:00:43.920> really<00:00:44.760> good<00:00:44.969> card

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
moon is integral against them so they'll

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.000

trap<00:01:11.670> stun<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.060> try<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> go<00:01:12.510> off<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.110> hope<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
trap stun and try to go off and hope you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.830

don't<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> book<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.640> moon<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.030> then<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
don't have a book of moon and then you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.749 
don't have a book of moon and then you
flip<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> book<00:01:16.290> moon<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.740> them<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.549> really

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
flip the book moon on them and it really

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.359 
flip the book moon on them and it really
ruins<00:01:18.030> their<00:01:18.420> play<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:19.189> they<00:01:20.189> just

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
ruins their play because they just

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.999 
ruins their play because they just
wasted<00:01:20.939> their<00:01:21.360> trap<00:01:21.720> stun<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.200> try<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.650> go<00:01:22.799> off

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
wasted their trap stun to try and go off

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.789 
wasted their trap stun to try and go off
so<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.880> basically<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
so that basically one for one with the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.100 
so that basically one for one with the
book<00:01:25.950> moon<00:01:26.250> you're<00:01:27.000> able<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.330> stop<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> synchro

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
book moon you're able to stop a synchro

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
book moon you're able to stop a synchro
and<00:01:28.320> you're<00:01:28.829> able<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.189> stop<00:01:29.460> their<00:01:29.729> push<00:01:30.329> for

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and you're able to stop their push for

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.170 
and you're able to stop their push for
game<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.619> they<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.220> lost<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:32.970> their

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
game so they just lost all their

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.660 
game so they just lost all their
momentum<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.619> pretty<00:01:34.950> much<00:01:35.040> are<00:01:35.250> able<00:01:35.579> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
momentum and you pretty much are able to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.380 
momentum and you pretty much are able to
win<00:01:35.820> after<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:37.490> mix<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.729> really<00:01:39.060> important

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
ability to make synchros and stuff like

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.600 
ability to make synchros and stuff like
that<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.970> really<00:01:45.450> important<00:01:45.869> against<00:01:46.380> them

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610
