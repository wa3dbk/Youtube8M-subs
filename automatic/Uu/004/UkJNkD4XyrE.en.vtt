00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.750
Hi everyone !

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.500
Hi !

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.750
Welcome on the first video of our new channel, since we have changed.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:30.580
So, if you liked our buildings and our videos, don't hesitate to subscribe on this new channel.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.630
Because we'll show you a lot of new things !

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.060
Who say new channel say new ideas.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.740
You'll find Minecraft's buildings and Timelaps, live constructions, redstone tutorials and many mores. (French Only)

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.160
Like I said, new channel, new ideas, new projects.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.330
If you're French, maybe you have been able to see.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.160
We, Aurelien_Sama and the Team EvenTime, worked really hard on a new map

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.910
that we have given to TheFantasio974.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:08.740
He'll be doing a survival show on it. The first episode should be out at the same time as this video.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.910
In this show, you'll be able to have a preview of our new Textures Pack. Isn't Tabernak ?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:25.600
Yes, a new Textures Pack. I'm currently working on it. It has been completely reworked so it can really be ours.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.740
It still not released yet, but like Oltenzano said, you'll be able to see it in TheFantasio974's show.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:43.040
If you used our pack, it keeps the same spirit, so the buildings are still going to be great.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:51.390
The pack will now be usable in Survival and we expect to make it public before the end of September on our website.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.030
On the website, you'll be able to find the Pack, but not only that.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:05.160
All our videos will be posted on it and we'll had a Live show tab.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:13.130
You'll see us building in Live, you'll be able to ask us questions and interact directly with us.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:24.390
About the website, it'll change a lot. We don't have a date for now, but changes will happen

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.960
Don't hesitate to go on it to follow our actuality. (French only)

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.200
Hi everyone !

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.200
And so ... Yes ... Sorry

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:47.030
Like I said, we have for new project to work with the people who follow us and like what we do.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:55.260
... [Useless French blabla ] ...

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.900
So what we thought is that we come on your server and help you build

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:10.330
a building, a project that you want to do. For example, a Tower, a Capital City, etc.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:22.890
For that, go on the website and on the forum, you'll need to post a postulation about your project.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.760
We'll choose the projects that we like and we'll going on your server to

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.350
build with your team on Live on your project.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.390
About that, we'll need new members for our team, isn't Tabernak ?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.820
Yes, so it the time for a new period of recruitment.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:04:17.110
... [Since we search French people, this section is useless for you.] ...

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.660
What to say ?

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.570
A table going up, that's why we need people to do redstone.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.670
So, we don't know how to make working circuits, isn't Shouka ?

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:40.620
A little bravo to Shouka for finding us that wonderful plugin to be able to sit down.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.800
It's been the most wonderful thing you found since ... ever.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.280
Thanks Oltenz !

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.790

00:04:52.890 --> 00:05:05.390
