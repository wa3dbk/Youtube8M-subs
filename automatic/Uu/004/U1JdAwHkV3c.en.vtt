00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 we return to the emotional issue this is what 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.390
 that we spoke those who know him say 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.790
 that is a person who is very strict 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.120
 very rigid has military training 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.740
 it's military I think if I'm not wrong 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.780
 but he has emotional problems 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.090
 that does not make him a referee that 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.090
 they violate oppression under pressure 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.490
 he missed the game and in the second 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.110
 his head stuck and he gave a minute 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.170
 more when there was nothing to justify 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.670
 the complaints of palermo from the bank not 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.670
 they stopped us for a few seconds 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.540
 to the goal of lanús that was after the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.400
 five minutes completed 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.020
 with horacio elizondo which is very 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.600
 He kindly told me that the rules of 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.820
 procedure of the fifa indicate that a 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.960
 change takes between 30 between 20 and 40 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.839
 seconds therefore you have the 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.150
 30 second term to extend that 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.519
 an injured player is between 40 between 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.720
 30 seconds and a minute and a half too 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.430
 the five minutes 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.650
 horacio the five minutes so impeccable 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.930
 he told me that the minute would not be two 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.600
 mistakes and something to tell you about this 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.390
 referee not good the three minutes the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.800
 five minutes are fine three minutes and 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.170
 the infringement that took the protest did not 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.220
 they played gave beyond what came what 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.360
 it is not understood is because he added 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.490
 minutes more with the will have to have 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.820
 finished no more in the hand than either 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.820
 it is understood 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.759
 is a definition the explanation or a 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.650
 the referee's intention as it had 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.850
 extended both are five minutes and it makes 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.130
 goal unless the fifth minute 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.670
 to see this we try to understand the head 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.830
 of the referee what he says he does not 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.860
 he wanted to say good I'm going to play a 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.350
 minutes more so that they do not believe that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.009
 I played until we will do it came out very 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:58.649
 bad because he turns it over 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:00.869
 you can do that's too bad for 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.560
 that you have not finished for five 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.119
 minutes now one more thing, notice the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.340
 detail that this marked it very well 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.229
 diego that at halftime there was 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.030
 problems with time many times 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.100
 everyone wonders why the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.660
 players protest the penalties because 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.550
 the players protest the infractions 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.080
 if the referee is not going to change their judgments 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.160
 of course again change your fault 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.720
 but they are conditioning it for what 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.769
 happened it is not necessary to protest because it gave 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.840
 five minutes I think the referees 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.519
 should give more minutes because 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.709
 normally things in 6 change the last 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.709
 and it is done to that of André and we like that 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:45.209
 the other day unfortunately the feeling 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.060
 It is very ugly the ugly feeling that left 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.540
 is that it was rigged that I want I want 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.540
 say it clearly 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.120
 when you add up the questions and 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.099
 count the ribs as they did in 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.409
 the reports and have that leaves you a 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.079
 feeling of a lot of bitterness now active 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.109
 I say one the worst copy of castrilli 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.810
 possible appeared the other night plus the 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.290
 own castril and methods all have 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.150
 reason 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.799
 everyone is all right in everything 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.900
 what we are seeing what of no 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.180
 way we can endorse what the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.400
 arsenal campus the version technician 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:26.909
 ariana because there is a place where you 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:28.409
 you have to file your claim for a 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.590
 arsenal because it is well informed framework 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.329
 of career palermo the duck and the teacher 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.390
 mendoza that is going to cost you dearly 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.840
 arsenal this would also have this one 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.010
 between the players themselves and Tuesday was 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.959
 separated from the campus attention because 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.700
 national is all quite complicated and 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.340
 the boys theme to close is also 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.350
 that on Friday there was a first and last name 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.660
 in martín to read more but he could 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.310
 happened to anyone any of the 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.209
 Argentine soccer teams and bodies 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.060
 technicians in the skin of the arsenal 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.760
 they enter the court and make them tremble 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.140
 fear of the relatives of the referee who 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.510
 they are watching the game 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.239
 that is clear but positive for not 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.880
 crucify just arsenal let's say this 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.209
 situation not for anybody 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:19.700
 we are is very reasonable we have 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.700
 the example immediately looks for tiger 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:31.880
 we see it we see the table we do not see six 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:31.880
 direct points ez
