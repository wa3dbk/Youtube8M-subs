it counts back and it's it's a it'll

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.830 
it counts back and it's it's a it'll
reset<00:00:31.529> itself<00:00:31.890> right<00:00:32.160> it'll<00:00:32.610> cool<00:00:32.790> off<00:00:32.850> you

use<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.230> as<00:00:34.440> part<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> Easter<00:00:35.190> egg<00:00:35.340> on

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
use it as part of the Easter egg on

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.729 
use it as part of the Easter egg on
Richthofen<00:00:36.570> side<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.960> order<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.350> power<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
Richthofen side in order to power the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.119 
Richthofen side in order to power the
glass<00:00:38.100> orbs<00:00:38.670> there's<00:00:39.030> four<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> them<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.129> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
glass orbs there's four of them and it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.680 
glass orbs there's four of them and it
slows<00:00:41.489> down<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.879> zombies<00:00:42.000> as<00:00:42.239> well<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
slows down the zombies as well like it

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.450 
slows down the zombies as well like it
does<00:00:42.930> take<00:00:43.260> some<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:44.070> kill<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> zombies

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
does take some time to kill the zombies

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.090 
does take some time to kill the zombies
but<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.120> slows<00:00:45.360> them<00:00:45.539> down<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.559> does<00:00:46.770> slow

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
but it slows them down and it does slow

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.010 
but it slows them down and it does slow
down<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.520> ghosts<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> ghost<00:00:48.480> house<00:00:48.809> I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
down the ghosts in the ghost house I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.450 
down the ghosts in the ghost house I
mean<00:00:49.110> doesn't<00:00:49.379> kill<00:00:49.590> them<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> slows<00:00:50.280> them

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
mean doesn't kill them but it slows them

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.180 
mean doesn't kill them but it slows them
down<00:00:50.489> when<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.360> upgrade<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.230> becomes<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
down when you upgrade it it becomes the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.389 
down when you upgrade it it becomes the
petra<00:00:53.789> fire<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> bit

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
petra fire so it's it you know a bit

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.450 
petra fire so it's it you know a bit
more<00:00:56.430> effective<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.510> takes<00:00:58.020> longer<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
more effective it takes longer for it to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.810 
more effective it takes longer for it to
heat<00:00:59.850> up<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.250> does<00:01:02.550> take

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
heat up you can see that it does take

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.609 
heat up you can see that it does take
down<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> zombies<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.629> little<00:01:04.290> bit<00:01:04.409> more

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
down the zombies a little bit more

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.010 
down the zombies a little bit more
effectively<00:01:05.070> than<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.909> regular<00:01:06.420> paralyzer

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
effectively than the regular paralyzer

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.980 
effectively than the regular paralyzer

fall damage you know if you have that

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.840 
fall damage you know if you have that
PhD<00:01:32.820> flopper<00:01:33.170> persistent<00:01:34.170> upgrade<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:35.100> I

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
PhD flopper persistent upgrade then I

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.090 
PhD flopper persistent upgrade then I
mean<00:01:36.180> you'll<00:01:36.600> fall<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.470> won't<00:01:37.920> take

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
mean you'll fall on you you won't take

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.440 
mean you'll fall on you you won't take
the<00:01:38.220> fall<00:01:38.369> damage<00:01:38.640> at<00:01:38.729> least<00:01:38.909> initially<00:01:39.090> but

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the fall damage at least initially but

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.850 
the fall damage at least initially but
you<00:01:39.570> will<00:01:39.720> lose<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:39.990> persistent<00:01:40.650> upgrade

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
you will lose that persistent upgrade

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.649 
you will lose that persistent upgrade
because<00:01:40.920> you're<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.250> flopping<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> fall

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
because you're not flopping to the fall

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.899 
because you're not flopping to the fall
damage<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.470> over<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.640> fly

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
damage and you can go over you can fly

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.060 
damage and you can go over you can fly
around<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.899> maze<00:01:46.140> here<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.920> actually
