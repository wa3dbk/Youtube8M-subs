00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:11.679
 Well, it's too early at the Detroit show 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.769
 Plutonium came out of the design concept 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.539
 Eh town and the flow of change of various times in 2009 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.330
 This is a cool design in the oki era 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.630
 What kind of eh design concept 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.039
 I wonder if communication is coming up 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.509
 I would like to 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.000
 There is a history of Italy so far 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.800
 After all that is right there in Japan 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.110
 I have an elegant feeling 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.990
 I came for a while 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.060
 If America is losing 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.420
 Concerned early in the United States that the presence was weak in the forefoot 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.640
 Not only do it now, but after all billion yen 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.130
 When I went out of Japan and entered the world, I thought it was still weak 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.390
 First of all it has a strong presence 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.590
 It is basic that let's put out a hole properly, but 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.560
 Well, in North America, for example, Toyota Nissan Honda 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.250
 Relatively 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.090
 Meima 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.990
 Easy-to-buy cars and two luxury brands 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.200
 I have another one but it is another one but either 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.670
 Speaking of which Subaru was Monex Lexus 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.090
 At 23 the US economy is in a position close to the light of speaking in Honda 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.180
 Also felt the user as its uniqueness of the brand 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.740
 I think I'm not a man, but with some premium power 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.080
 I wonder if Keio was the job of that student 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.810
 I think especially premium pianos we seek from 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.260
 It is not mon, so it is accompanied by the thing that you have 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.930
 Was 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.250
 After all I want to do that solid manufacturing 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.950
 As a place where the next generation aims at thinking like that 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.950
 I made it as a concept of 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.490
 It is so-called from the time of president Takenaka of cannabis 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.060
 Various front grille 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.280
 It's an image of the previous aircraft in preparation for being troubled with blue trouble 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.390
 It has been said, but when you go out on the previous voyage, there are so many things 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.770
 I think I was able to design well, but one more 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.060
 What kind of place is it as a universal face? 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.679
 Well, when you look at people from the front 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:13.229
 Our house 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:15.009
 Do you know who in the curtain? 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.799
 This is what Lehman's legacy has 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.109
 It looks like a gated hexagon and this is still the world 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.529
 Even if you look at 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.059
 Have a lot of that pervading you 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:28.319
 I'm going to make it to me 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.389
 sip that boo also used a chip 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.389
 I also keep the memories of s-class hexagons 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.809
 I tried to try to be fair 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:40.849
 So the front end is well in that sense 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.029
 And 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:43.329
 I think i can 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.800
 I would like to go to the end of Taira Matsubara since ancient times 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.729
 7 previous Takeshi Yoshiyoshi principle 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:53.399
 m lyric is so, but how is Katsura's age? 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:57.829
 It's bad, but it's 18 companies like cheap because the company gives priority 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.839
 It was strongly suggested that the 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:03.340
 How is the fusion of design functionalist countries 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.489
 It has been reduced over 73 years 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.349
 Date 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.209
 So basically if you don't prevent blur, it's a big loss 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.349
 So I don't think I want to 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.789
 Where I want to give the appearance that can be expressed properly 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.639
 It is 1. of the day before in the true meaning, but may be different in the original function 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.169
 There is no, but go to such a place with the function that Subaru aims 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.139
 I want to live 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.089
 I strongly want to push that out in the future 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:29.959
 Hi Thank you very much, actually the age of car suspension 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.200
 The new Subaru's will be just above the stormy storm 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.939
 Although it is a design concept, it is not blur of majik 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:41.769
 Bahn's constitution Originality Before such things go for world history 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.519
 By hand of Hirao's design as a bright topic 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.840
 Many of Hitachi's hopes are being opened
