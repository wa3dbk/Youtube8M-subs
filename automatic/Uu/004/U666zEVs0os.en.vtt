00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.210 
for school anyways I just had it made up
my<00:04:47.040> mind<00:04:47.660> what<00:04:48.660> color<00:04:49.050> I<00:04:49.380> wanted<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.800> go<00:04:49.950> but

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
my mind what color I wanted to go but

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.560 
my mind what color I wanted to go but
definitely<00:04:50.640> was<00:04:50.760> gonna<00:04:50.910> go<00:04:51.090> darker<00:04:51.450> bits

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
definitely was gonna go darker bits

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.870 
definitely was gonna go darker bits
because<00:04:51.840> it's<00:04:52.200> a<00:04:52.410> lot<00:04:52.650> harder<00:04:52.950> to<00:04:53.370> keep<00:04:53.700> up

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
because it's a lot harder to keep up

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.400 
because it's a lot harder to keep up
with<00:04:54.000> my<00:04:54.210> blonde<00:04:54.540> hair<00:04:54.690> just<00:04:55.020> because<00:04:55.110> my

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
with my blonde hair just because my

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.440 
with my blonde hair just because my
wounds<00:04:55.590> come<00:04:55.950> in<00:04:56.100> so<00:04:56.280> much<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:57.000> when<00:04:57.150> school

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
wounds come in so much and when school

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.360 
wounds come in so much and when school
is<00:04:57.630> in<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:58.170> last<00:04:58.380> thing<00:04:58.650> that<00:04:58.680> I<00:04:58.890> worry<00:04:59.220> about

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
is in the last thing that I worry about

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.700 
is in the last thing that I worry about
is<00:04:59.820> my<00:05:00.060> hair<00:05:00.360> and

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
is my hair and

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.450 
is my hair and
what<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.310> was<00:05:03.550> going<00:05:03.760> to<00:05:04.030> do<00:05:04.270> was<00:05:04.660> going<00:05:05.460> black

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
what I was going to do was going black

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.280 
what I was going to do was going black
so<00:05:07.120> that<00:05:07.150> way<00:05:07.480> I<00:05:07.660> don't<00:05:07.720> have<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.960> worry<00:05:08.200> about

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
so that way I don't have to worry about

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.660 
so that way I don't have to worry about
my<00:05:08.500> roots<00:05:08.800> because<00:05:09.010> my<00:05:09.130> natural<00:05:09.190> hair<00:05:09.610> color

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670
