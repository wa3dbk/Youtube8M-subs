but this will at least give you some
idea<00:00:14.370> what<00:00:14.700> should<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.000> know<00:00:15.150> which<00:00:15.299> is

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
idea what should you know which is

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.189 
idea what should you know which is
delivering<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.900> baby

right now for you this should take about

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.950 
right now for you this should take about
two<00:00:20.340> minutes<00:00:20.369> we're<00:00:21.330> doing<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.570> very<00:00:21.720> fast

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
two minutes we're doing a very fast

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.259 
two minutes we're doing a very fast
verse<00:00:22.230> at<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.470> moment<00:00:22.830> as<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.939> see<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
verse at the moment as you can see the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.570 
verse at the moment as you can see the
motor<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.840> attach<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.140> Noel<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.830> pushing<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
motor that attach to Noel is pushing the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.759 
motor that attach to Noel is pushing the
baby<00:00:26.670> out<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:27.960> turn<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.289> baby<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.619> any

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
baby out we can turn the baby in any

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.769 
baby out we can turn the baby in any
angle<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.880> also<00:00:30.000> simulate<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.599> breech

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
angle we can also simulate a breech

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.179 
angle we can also simulate a breech
delivery<00:00:30.810> where<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> baby<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.830> upside<00:00:32.160> down

delivery where the baby is upside down

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.580 
delivery where the baby is upside down
we<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> shoulder<00:00:33.660> dystocia<00:00:33.809> deliveries

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
we can be a shoulder dystocia deliveries

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.930 
we can be a shoulder dystocia deliveries
where<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> shoulder<00:00:35.160> actually<00:00:35.489> does<00:00:35.670> get

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
where the shoulder actually does get

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.060 
where the shoulder actually does get
stuck<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> birth<00:00:36.809> canal<00:00:36.920> which<00:00:37.920> can

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
stuck in the birth canal which can

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.709 
stuck in the birth canal which can
create<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.309> crisis<00:00:38.670> situation<00:00:38.790> which<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.570> my

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
create a crisis situation which is my

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
create a crisis situation which is my
support<00:00:39.989> team<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> train<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.710> even<00:00:41.340> though<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
support team to train on even though it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.520 
support team to train on even though it
doesn't<00:00:41.700> happen<00:00:41.790> very<00:00:41.940> often<00:00:42.290> we<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
doesn't happen very often we like to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.900

in how to handle shoulder dystocia

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.229 
in how to handle shoulder dystocia
delivery<00:00:46.440> she<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.460> also<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.820> postpartum

hemorrhaging as well so we really have

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.400 
hemorrhaging as well so we really have
the<00:00:50.309> opportunity<00:00:50.760> with<00:00:50.879> her<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> number

crisis scenarios where we can train our

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.189 
crisis scenarios where we can train our
teams<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> make<00:00:57.360> sure<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.629> they<00:00:57.780> know
