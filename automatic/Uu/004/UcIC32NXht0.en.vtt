00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 handhelds degenerates to another 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:10.980
 video of me this time I show you how 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.809
 you can save point 12 on 17.1.2011 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.089
 thumb link you will find as always in the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.529
 video description and it works too 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.690
 Let's go before the short 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.960
 information the whole here is with 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:27.260
 pankow 1.1 made that can be the version 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.090
 7.1 point two years and 7.1 and 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.630
 7.1 that works on all devices 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.430
 is shown here on an iphone 4 with 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.200
 the point 1.2 and left as I said 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.790
 you can find in the video description 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.550
 This time there is also a version for 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.000
 the mac and actually what you do 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.219
 you have to click on jailbreak and as 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.430
 Next we need to sap the setting 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.800
 open then we click on general 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.480
 Then we click on date and time 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.180
 then we have to hook this one there 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.060
 Remove the clock manually 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.130
 can adjust 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:12.270
 and then we have the date 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.409
 set manually on the second june 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:21.360
 8 o'clock 30 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:24.810
 second june 8 o'clock 30 approximately 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.460
 So we see pankow already starts 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.040
 but 38 is ideal i think second july 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.869
 Just go back then 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.450
 the home button and then just wait 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.630
 until the bundles are discovered we 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.520
 pankow 1.1 was also noticed 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.280
 translated English before there was that 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.770
 tool only in Chinese but not what 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.729
 The whole thing was not that bad 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.229
 is complicated 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.200
 now we are also instructed here 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.619
 Click on the icon and do that 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.390
 we now also asked if we have the app 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.509
 want to execute that confirm me 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.869
 of course it opens the app and we 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.399
 just have to wait 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.920
 I'm just new to the version 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.550
 that is now also the link displayed 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.220
 becomes 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.960
 http goo.gl you can also the reason 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.470
 But I will still loaded 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.830
 times a video description link 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.380
 that will take a moment if that 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.080
 the device is restarted 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.800
 I can tell you something about pankow 1.1 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.470
 tell 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.480
 I have often mentioned that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.460
 there will be a drama video and me 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.650
 I hope I can get it 1 too 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.080
 because the drama is now 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.050
 actually be there in pankow 151 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.170
 namely other explorer used as in 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.140
 pankow 1.0 although not patched 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.310
 the reason for this is that pangoo 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:57.050
 1.0 a exploit of bionic used by 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.140
 stephan esser that was exploit 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.959
 more or less stolen from ionix 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.620
 opinion and that's why the pangoo team 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.090
 decided another version 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.900
 The gap does not bring that out 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.530
 use what then that simply means 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.720
 groundless now two exploits burned 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.390
 high are for one the first of 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.260
 jannik can not go anyway 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.280
 use that as the beautiful 1.0 so 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.489
 was used and now will be 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.170
 a second exploit just wasted 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:35.030
 not to stay on unix bugs around the 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.570
 not to use what actually one 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.660
 Complete nonsense is louder 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:45.010
 jonigk anyway the half jailbreak of 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:48.320
 so the gaps are with him and him 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.570
 yes, I just noticed what I had 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.980
 it can be clear before that 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.700
 We now this is a field was 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.440
 in the middle 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:00.110
 you should remove the pass code or 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.269
 if you do not remove this 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.200
 have then enter as soon as possible 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.330
 press ok 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.230
 ideally located in the passcode 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.340
 before 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.040
 I also had cherix where that was not 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.570
 worked because of the passcode if you 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.709
 The passcode is removed to everyone 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.900
 Be on the safe side and it is 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.220
 but I do not even think so 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.930
 Bad if you do not drive 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.000
 if you have the rhine seen memory 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.699
 All this is a good sign 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.699
 that also means that rudi wais 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.349
 is written now is the the 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:40.180
 iphone rebooted and we are too 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:42.310
 already done with the pc now 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.610
 we see the apple that offers the device 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.949
 short and in a short moment should 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.020
 me already in pankow work on screen 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:55.930
 and we can already see that it is the 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.889
 Attack cinema.to pandemrix setting up 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.860
 cologne gadget and ready to go system and 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.879
 Joy apparently you have these texts too 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:10.360
 changed before standards of enjoy 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:13.780
 enjoy good content small minimum 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.500
 Updates also came with pangoo 1.1 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.539
 the bug fix is ​​not an iphone 4 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.849
 allowed to bid in the dark 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.620
 I know it sounds ridiculous but that 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.930
 was actually a bug in the version 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.159
 1.0 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.770
 The device could only be good if 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:32.080
 is not available when it is sufficient 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.520
 times in the dark must be booted 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.610
 You had to stop with a flashlight 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.129
 light on exactly why this is so 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.680
 Not really anyone knows but it was 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:44.379
 confirmed that this is a bug after 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:49.690
 she finished and sperm the device and we 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:52.270
 click meedia on the first start of 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.789
 Study prepares the file system 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:59.379
 that takes a moment or a little while 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:01.839
 good device grief brings so after that 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:04.930
 is finished, the device fell short 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:09.210
 catches the apple and should see 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.210
 then arrive at our lockscreen 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.520
 we should still see that banks 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:21.270
 we can do that easily now 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.270
 remove 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:26.710
 and last time the icon was gone 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.620
 I check briefly if the certificate with 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.479
 which has been installed or if this is here 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.490
 it's still going on 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.849
 settings 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:40.020
 mean scrolls down and we see here 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:42.509
 profile where catch we click on it 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.300
 and we remove for that is 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:48.120
 the certificate that was staged 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.800
 during the sheriff you should do that 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.080
 after removing that 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.400
 after you finished at Xsight 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.110
 the previous version was the 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.520
 automatically removed here you have to 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.650
 apparently removed manually 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.020
 So again settings in general 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.120
 completely scroll down the profiles 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.020
 then on the certificate and on 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.330
 remove 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:10.639
 you do not need that anymore and it will 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:12.900
 stop by me to remove it 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:17.370
 So we are already finished 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:19.440
 with the gehrig we see here to dia and 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.380
 that takes a moment to close 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:32.150
 load and then we can just 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:40.139
 scroll down and we see iphone 3.1 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:41.639
 ios 7.1 point 22 with the jc when asked 

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:43.710
 Write me in the comments 

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:45.570
 I hope you enjoyed it and then 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.020
 I would say bye and bye 

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.020
 next time
