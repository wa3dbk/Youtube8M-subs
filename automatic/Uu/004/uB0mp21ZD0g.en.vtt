you need to dashboard and try again

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.870

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
otherwise you will not be able to get

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.910 
otherwise you will not be able to get
this<00:00:24.060> if<00:00:24.210> he<00:00:24.269> does<00:00:24.390> not<00:00:24.510> drop<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.080> only<00:00:25.740> took

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
this if he does not drop it I only took

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.429 
this if he does not drop it I only took
him<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.220> two<00:00:26.400> or<00:00:26.580> three<00:00:26.760> times<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.900> me<00:00:28.109> trying

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
him like two or three times of me trying

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.560

to<00:00:28.500> do<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.730> ended<00:00:29.939> up<00:00:30.000> getting<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
to do this and I ended up getting the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.970 
to do this and I ended up getting the
drop<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.170> seems<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.619> happen<00:00:31.740> pretty

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
drop so it seems to happen pretty

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.130 
drop so it seems to happen pretty
frequently<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.750> make<00:00:33.899> sure

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
frequently but you do have to make sure

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.370 
frequently but you do have to make sure
that<00:00:34.969> you<00:00:35.969> exit<00:00:36.480> out<00:00:36.540> otherwise<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.079> will<00:00:37.140> save

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
that you exit out otherwise it will save

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.709 
that you exit out otherwise it will save

this<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.759> pretty<00:01:18.210> easy<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.229> get<00:01:19.409> glue

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
this one was pretty easy to to get glue

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.080 
this one was pretty easy to to get glue
to<00:01:19.979> myself<00:01:20.159> because<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.610> was<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> pineapple

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
level where it was pretty easy once he

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.830 
level where it was pretty easy once he
ends<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.820> getting<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.450> he<00:01:24.570> ends<00:01:24.750> up

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
ends up getting out of there he ends up

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.679 
ends up getting out of there he ends up
coming<00:01:25.320> into<00:01:25.680> his<00:01:26.009> little

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689

here<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.810> Nukem<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.289> says<00:02:09.440> name

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
here is the the Nukem it says name

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.580 
here is the the Nukem it says name
dropper<00:02:10.190> consumes<00:02:11.030> two<00:02:11.420> ammo<00:02:11.780> per<00:02:12.019> shot<00:02:12.350> and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
dropper consumes two ammo per shot and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.210 
dropper consumes two ammo per shot and
and<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:14.600> magazine<00:02:14.959> size<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.290> only<00:02:15.470> two<00:02:15.620> but<00:02:15.950> it

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
and the magazine size is only two but it

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.070 
and the magazine size is only two but it
shoots<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:18.790> like<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.819> grenade<00:02:20.299> sort<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.720> thing

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
shoots a a like a grenade sort of thing

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.170 
shoots a a like a grenade sort of thing
out<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.380> then<00:02:21.440> explodes<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.310> makes<00:02:22.940> like<00:02:23.150> a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
out and then explodes and makes like a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.470 
out and then explodes and makes like a
nuke<00:02:23.560> like<00:02:24.670> explosion<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:25.910> it's<00:02:26.060> pretty<00:02:26.180> cool

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
nuke like explosion so it's pretty cool

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.160 
nuke like explosion so it's pretty cool
I<00:02:26.690> like<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.170> styling<00:02:27.799> of<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:29.049> thing<00:02:30.049> and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
I like the the styling of the thing and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.020 
I like the the styling of the thing and
then<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.350> thought<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.190> cleared<00:02:31.489> up<00:02:31.579> enough<00:02:31.790> space

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
then I thought I cleared up enough space

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.850 
then I thought I cleared up enough space
that<00:02:32.239> I<00:02:32.329> didn't<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:32.690> I'm<00:02:32.780> trying<00:02:33.019> to<00:02:33.110> clear<00:02:33.739> up

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
that I didn't so I'm trying to clear up

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.530 
that I didn't so I'm trying to clear up
a<00:02:34.160> little<00:02:34.579> bit<00:02:34.730> more<00:02:34.820> space<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.299> I'll<00:02:35.390> show

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
a little bit more space and I'll show

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.479 
a little bit more space and I'll show
you<00:02:35.630> guys<00:02:35.720> what<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.049> looks<00:02:36.079> like<00:02:36.459> when<00:02:37.459> I

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
you guys what it looks like when I

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.800 
you guys what it looks like when I
should<00:02:37.730> at<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:37.970> end<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.209> video<00:02:38.420> here<00:02:38.630> but

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
anyway I have more of these types of

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.460 
anyway I have more of these types of
videos<00:02:41.060> as<00:02:41.510> I'm<00:02:41.989> playing<00:02:42.200> through<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.440> game

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
videos as I'm playing through the game

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.650 
videos as I'm playing through the game
and<00:02:42.829> as<00:02:42.920> I'm<00:02:43.070> trying<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.370> pick<00:02:44.120> up<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.420> farm

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
and as I'm trying to pick up and farm

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.140 
and as I'm trying to pick up and farm
some<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.959> these<00:02:45.019> legendaries<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:46.760> this<00:02:46.940> is

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
some of these legendaries but this is

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.729 
some of these legendaries but this is
this<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:47.989> one<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.230> them<00:02:48.410> right<00:02:48.440> here<00:02:48.560> so

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
this is one of them right here so

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.990 
this is one of them right here so
hopefully<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.670> guys<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:51.220> guess<00:02:52.220> like<00:02:52.430> this<00:02:52.609> you

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
hopefully you guys I guess like this you

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.060 
hopefully you guys I guess like this you
can<00:02:53.150> only<00:02:53.269> farm<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:54.200> guess<00:02:54.500> pretty<00:02:54.859> much

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
can only farm it I guess pretty much

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.640 
can only farm it I guess pretty much
once<00:02:55.370> because<00:02:55.760> once<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.510> beat<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.230> if<00:02:57.440> you

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
once because once you beat it you if you

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.289 
once because once you beat it you if you
dashboard<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.400> don't<00:02:58.549> think<00:02:58.730> you'll<00:02:58.910> save<00:02:59.120> it

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299
