00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.210
 do not 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.760
 hi friends from youtube I am a chef 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.030
 tourist thank you very much for visiting my 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.030
 channel 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.710
 this time we are going to prepare some 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.870
 delicious and crispy chicken fingers 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.070
 these little fingers of chickens are like those 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.900
 we eat at food places 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.330
 quick but much better because we're going 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.619
 to prepare ourselves 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.369
 ingredients that we are going to use are 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.849
 whole chicken breast mustard flour 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.220
 of wheat all use 2 whole eggs bread 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.820
 grated and roasted oregano pepper 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.610
 Red 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.790
 basil powder and salt to taste we will 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.739
 cut chicken pieces in fingers 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.990
 one centimeter by 1 centimeter 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.580
 no need to cut it from these measures 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.360
 I suggest it because that's how they cook 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.710
 all in the same way at the same time 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.690
 They can cut the chicken into strips or 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.810
 simply in cubes to make nuggets 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.810
 of chicken 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.800
 all right 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.010
 and once we have the neck cut off 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.960
 can add mustard and salt to taste 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.120
 you can also add others 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.250
 ingredients like garlic powder or the 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.700
 seasoning that you wish 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.700
 and has 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.760
 we take the oregano the basil the 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.130
 paprika and salt and mix it with the 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.469
 bread crumbs 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.450
 let's go to the breaded processor on 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:30.079
 basic breaded simply consists 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.899
 in passing in the flesh or whatever we go to 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:37.340
 Fry in wheat flour then in egg 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:39.110
 and then in bread crumbs first 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.030
 We passed the chicken by flour so that 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.819
 then fix it well and then the bread will 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.960
 paste and repeat the process until 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.649
 all the pieces of chicken are 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.649
 breaded 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.700
 and well done 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.400
 in a saucepan we heat the oil to 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.380
 180 degrees approximately or on fire 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.270
 mean now we are placing one in 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.090
 one the chicken fingers should cook 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.220
 the chicken about 26 minutes yo 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.260
 as cold in deep oil does not 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.680
 cook side and side but it is a 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.680
 single song 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.880
 after the chicken is well browned 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.870
 move to an absorbent paper so that 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.870
 drain all the oil 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.730
 ready we have our chicken finger 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.740
 they saw how simple it is now what he touches 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.060
 is to eat 0 with a sauce napoles or 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.040
 simply with chest 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.349
