00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.929
 times of smartphone ipad co 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.929
 the power supply on the way 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.540
 there are banks then 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.210
 what they are here on the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.369
 13 imagine the fuel cell for 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.500
 on the way is important what is hidden 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.020
 exactly behind the third reactor exactly 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.410
 The hectare is a hydrogen 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.330
 fuel cell for use on tour 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.070
 Of course, you can also go to the hut 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.940
 so for those who are somehow in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.040
 want to take smartphone gps devices 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.809
 camera or even on tablet pc for 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.309
 the reading material in the hut for you 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.430
 can not do without online 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.899
 there is the right device and what 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.170
 hides exactly the technology behind it 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.250
 how does it work? 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.430
 the whole thing works with one 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.810
 adjustable cartridge in this cartridge 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.060
 Hydrogen is stored 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.650
 To store metal hydride means so 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.829
 it does not work that way 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.910
 also when taking in the plane should 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.439
 not a problem 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.930
 best informed but 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.030
 airline before getting formal 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.820
 a check then you screwed this 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.070
 cartouche here 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.899
 You hear a soft hiss then 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.549
 escapes the first water vapor because of 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.689
 Hydrogen from the cartridge with the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.640
 oxygen from the ambient air 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.380
 responds to this creates electricity snaps 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.180
 a cable hides this 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.720
 USB cable here in the back of the USB port 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:37.409
 One grabs his phone ipad what 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.500
 always want to load that concludes 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.190
 whole and waiting for the battery again 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.110
 fully loaded is how many times come 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.030
 that's what it does naturally 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.390
 depending on the battery capacity in one 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.310
 but gets the iphone as a scale 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.410
 used breaks at five and a half 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.960
 the cash register is empty 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.700
 when is the Catholic teaching 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.800
 screwed out you have anyway 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.020
 buy a second one and either 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.610
 Do you go back to the store? 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.540
 teach against a new Catholic 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.820
 costs six euros 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.530
 or do you have a charging station? 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.510
 bought for home and can the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.130
 Catholic self-loading only needs 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.130
 pour in the water at the top 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.260
 turn on and things are up and running 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.660
 Cables are also included with cable 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.680
 The device is included 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.420
 150 euros 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.370
 and as I said the exchange of one 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.610
 empty against a full till was 6 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.610
 Euro
