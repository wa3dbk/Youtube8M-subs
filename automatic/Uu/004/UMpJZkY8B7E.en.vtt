00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.529

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.079
 November 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.420
 I do not know why I was not having that 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.940
 End of year desperation, I see that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.020
 There's a lot that leaves you 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.570
 that 's people and it's just a book I 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.649
 I guarantee that I will finish reading it yet 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.870
 this month 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.960

 of the chronicles of ice and fire 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.670
 I 'm sure I'm halfway there. 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.280
 I already spent, in fact, I'm looking for 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.270
 to look at how many pages the book has because 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.970
 do not be discouraged but anyway this is it 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.580
 In this month, I'll end up like 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.280

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.799

 Who saw this book was beyond radio 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.170
 A thousand leaves, thank you very much and at last 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.040
 this book here has a subtitle to 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.659
 truth here then or isolate the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.239
 write an open letter to the president 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.380
 of the republic of france in defense of dry 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.770
 fans of the case of anger that has been 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.390
 commented to exhaustion in the books of 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.010

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.840
 so it's the way of sisters 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.020
 I stopped remembering live in the moment in 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.870
 that everyone argues in this case is 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.280

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.720

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.970

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.830

 So I need events and that's fine. 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.910
 The introduction you just saw is for 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.880
 that I could start then this month to 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.010

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.709

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.080
 then all the books of the challenges and 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.180
 I am proposing to read the 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.870
 team that I have solemnly proposed 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.750
 lately everyone here and even 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.610
 those of the books to read in 2014 do not know 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.660
 if you noticed but not 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.910
 I have to run a lot and everything 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.360
 these books are in here then and 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.460
 I had 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.460
 I would give you the book even if I said 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.180
 In the middle of November it's from my tin 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.889
 of power 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.110
 only I was very smart panel already 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.770
 I took out the paper and started reading the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.569
 book 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.750
 You will see this video only on Wednesday 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:40.060
 but today is Tuesday a day before and I 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.250
 I already took one of the books out of the air. 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.759
 need to start reading because out 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.460
 exactly the biggest book on my list 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.319
 and I put in the instagram a little 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.599
 this book with the same 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:54.099
 owl people try to guess 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.979
 what leandro were some people 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:59.229
 I really accepted that right 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.509
 I'm reading then infinity acid david 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.370
 Foster Wallace and without people do not have the 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.919
 less notion that you will finish reading 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.550
 this book now in November or even 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.770
 next month but in fife for now 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.930
 at least here is hilarious 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.430
 I thought I'll leave it to comment on the 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.310
 respect as soon as you finish reading the 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.620
 book and then those are the readings 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.659
 in progress before closing this 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.589
 I would like to invite you all to 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:29.250
 Take a look at the blog 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:34.389
 daily of refusal so do not 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:36.400
 but anyway this month of November is good, right? 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.490
 which is the same that everyone stops 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.539
 everything to write a novel, right along 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.909
 of the month 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.289
 there is no number of words there 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:46.180
 people need to write during the 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.339
 day will be two thousand words 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.250
 anyway I can not have it 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:54.009
 discipline, but I decided to adapt it to 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.219
 my reality so I'm trying 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.779
 and for now I can do 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:02.020
 one post per day 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:04.479
 actually I started on the 3rd had to 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.389
 make retroactive but it's there 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.189
 so today 5 day probably the post of 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:12.490
 Today is already on the blog if it is not soon. 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:14.080
 more will be and until the end is the 30th of 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.339
 Then November will be little again. 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.800
 every day 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:20.979
 6 do not forget to take a look there and 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.719
 readying blog that taking all 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.650
 cobwebs and putting that 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:26.439
 little bug to work 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.819
 right and that's it then in the finally I 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:29.680
 I went back to doing what I'm reading 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:33.060
 Last video not earlier than this one 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.290
 that I did for the channel was in September 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.780
 You all the books I had 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.930
 separated to read during the same horror 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.600
 and it's obvious folks you her 30 books to 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.040
 You 'll be able to read 10 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.710
 of those books, right? 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.180
 during the months of September and October 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.460
 a lot of things were left out a lot 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.530
 people charged me a video about red bull 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.300
 but anyway I have not started there two 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.280
 river books as soon as I finish the 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.290
 two others are four in total 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.000
 I'll come and make a video here. 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.320
 will probably only be left then for the 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.480
 same value next year 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.300
 I could not read so many tales like this. 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.310
 How much do you want, but finally, people clothes? 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.169
 just put a pair of these books that I 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.600
 I showed here today probably not 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:14.400
 able to finish reading now for 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.960
 The month of November itself will be very 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.040
 thing that I will only finish in December 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.389
 and look there then, if you liked this 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.070
 not forget to give a young man and 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:26.090
 avoid sharing a kiss for everything 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.090
 world gives more
