00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.730
 that there is a friend of youtube this is but 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.810
 find in the best in the first place and 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.910
 women by watching this video 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.419
 and I decided to do a little tutorial of 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.390
 how to connect what is the capturing 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:36.649
 hd pvr 2 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.829
 with hdmi what is this 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.260
 and with the headsets that is torto elvis 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.809
 in this case it is the x12 is very simple 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.470
 if any problem mo sheen is having 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.300
 to get this ticket look 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.190
 how is it like one of the composer 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.870
 so normal then 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:02.050
 nothing else here is this entry 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.670
 it connects normally 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.670
 obviously connects here 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.580
 if you look at those of the slim consoles 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.900
 have here below we continue here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.890
 in this case around here you have a commune 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.360
 a half circle that prevents what 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.820
 the hdmi 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.060
 the cable can this enter you see that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.049
 how are we both, nowadays all 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.400
 they want to sell 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.240
 then that is purchased separately 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.030
 obviously the headset comes with these 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.540
 cables that are fixed here this entry 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.009
 white and red audio if you simply 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.009
 we connect them 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:03.909
 in this way this is for 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.909
 these are not going to stay like this 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.369
 here because we're not going to connect it with 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.160
 compost 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.209
 simply simply this one stays 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.000
 here they have what is the entrance of the jet 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.590
 set 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.590
 and I have it here 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.440
 so that it is well understood of this 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.220
 way 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.580
 this all this cable comes dragging 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.580
 up to this point 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.769
 with the headset and here here you have the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.530
 microphone input and here's the one from 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.200
 the usb for great topics like it takes 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.690
 of current 1 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.880
 then already what remains in fact this 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.980
 I do what I connect to the pc because 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.660
 it is very uncomfortable with connecting it to the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.630
 console 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.580
 and then you have already told us in a box 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.100
 without the catcher comes with two cables 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.070
 one is very long milk 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.170
 in fact elche forgiveness indeed here 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.400
 is the longest we connect it in what 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.400
 what is the out 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.660
 in this way and the one that comes from the 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.610
 console that would be this one the most 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.610
 cortito and attention to the author 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.600
 so if you are now set if you already leave me 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:32.600
 what is this 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.600
 the entrance and we can already connect here 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.590
 so is fine the outlet 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.650
 the usb cable but I from behind 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.269
 sorry this is the usb cable this one us 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.960
 the captor goes to generate 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.660
 the image for 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.240
 for my videos here equal of the 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.450
 current if our building then 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.730
 this is how it would practically be 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.410
 they fix the head of state is father that 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.610
 it is not very practical when it exposes 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.190
 We want everything to be fixed to what you have for 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.790
 to go up is to adjust the game volume 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:18.480
 that's like it says more bust mute for 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:18.480
 the d 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:28.130
 practically that would be all I would like 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:31.389
 send a greeting to my white friend for 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.389
