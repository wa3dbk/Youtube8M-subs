00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:14.850
 SLR camera mirrorless camera it's like that 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.010
 It is a type that the lens and the body are divided 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.150
 Among these types 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.510
 It is next to the show-through dust in the place of the image 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:32.540
 I think there is a problem of what to do when it enters 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:36.720
 This is the kind of spray type of house fan 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.500
 After drug may come on 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:46.820
 It is the same as the quick-drying type, but this one yakuza one thing is this 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:51.340
 Because the part of the sensor becomes weird, what do you do at this time ? 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.340
 There is no way cococ do 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.340
 Avail will at this time 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.340
 This 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.379
 silicon 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.379
 Already 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.120
 Let's become this Hano home formula 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.870
 The cost is that money in the air 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.159
 I think that you know that person doing that analog Kagura 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.050
 this 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.270
 This part of 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.450
 A guy for removing dust on the spot 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.650
 In fact it is divided a little 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.340
 I understand this section but two weeks I will 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.050
 this 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.800
 From this point on using the state of rubber 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.800
 Tei Masu in the movie 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.470
 The day is 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.950
 Head for here 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.890
 If you have a tentacle 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:55.040
 It is a trick that dust flies 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:02:00.640
 But this is I think to be a story I tell people Ha Oh there you are doing analog camera I 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.640
 Who are not doing it Oh lined cafe I do not Kawakan'm this 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.960
 In fact, it is for flying dust like this 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.470
 In very analog 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.480
 It is a nostalgic singing song for me 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.280
 I think that you can blow like this 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.930
 This itself 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.930
 He is cheap and actually 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.410
 I don't even have sex with this 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.260
 Well like that 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:33.720
 If it's cheap , it 's quite expensive 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:39.800
 That's right , I think that I think that it is from the 500 yen eye to the bargain seller 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:45.390
 Well this is a little more, but I'm not a warrior 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.900
 So as not to break the digital single-lens reflex camera Toka mirror-less camera that I bought it pains 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.900
 This say 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.850
 Follow 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.819
 I 'm flying here 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.510
 And if it is possible to use 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.760
 With such a thing 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.850
 Even though I 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:07.950
 I think that you can prepare because it is a fairly important part 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.950
 Thank you Kedomo will be more
