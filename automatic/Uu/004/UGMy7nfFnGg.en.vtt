now to show you what the issues are the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.470 
now to show you what the issues are the
first<00:00:29.099> thing<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.580> would<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.090> say<00:00:30.269> on

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
first thing I would like to say on

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.680 
first thing I would like to say on
defense<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.980> line<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.759> don't<00:00:33.510> notice

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
defense is that the line I don't notice

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.170 
defense is that the line I don't notice
on<00:00:34.110> NCAA<00:00:35.480> 2011<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.660> lot<00:00:37.170> more<00:00:37.350> spread<00:00:37.620> out<00:00:37.649> and

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
on NCAA 2011 is lot more spread out and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.940 
on NCAA 2011 is lot more spread out and
it's<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.570> think<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.200> gonna<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.410> easier<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:40.770> me

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
it's I think it's gonna be easier for me

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.190 
it's I think it's gonna be easier for me
running<00:00:41.309> back<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.149> inside<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.989> holes

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
running back to get inside of the holes

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.389 
running back to get inside of the holes
so<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:45.480> line<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:46.020> mean<00:00:46.320> usually<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.980> enjoy<00:00:47.190> it

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
so the line I mean usually on enjoy it

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.360 
so the line I mean usually on enjoy it
handle<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.760> looks<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.160> 2011<00:00:50.160> it

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
handle on looks like that but on 2011 it

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.830 
handle on looks like that but on 2011 it
looks<00:00:50.579> somewhat<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.539> mean<00:00:51.719> it's

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
looks somewhat like that so I mean it's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.529 
looks somewhat like that so I mean it's
pretty<00:00:52.079> spread<00:00:52.410> across<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.270> it's<00:00:54.270> not<00:00:54.390> like

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
pretty spread across and it's not like

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.000 
pretty spread across and it's not like
something<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.020> too<00:00:55.170> much<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.649> when<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
something I like too much and when you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.380 
something I like too much and when you
pinch<00:00:56.280> your<00:00:56.399> line<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.730> looks<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> normal

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
pinch your line it looks like a normal

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.000 
pinch your line it looks like a normal
line<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.440> know<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.559> think<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.859> they

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
line so you know I think that they

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.950 
line so you know I think that they
should<00:00:59.039> probably<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.579> know<00:00:59.699> recorrect<00:01:00.270> that

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.109 

now<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> thing<00:01:04.320> about<00:01:04.350> instead<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.400> late<00:01:05.610> 2011

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
now the thing about instead of late 2011

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.789 
now the thing about instead of late 2011
that<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> play<00:01:07.290> calling<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that you like is a play calling is a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.679 
that you like is a play calling is a
little<00:01:08.010> bit<00:01:08.130> different<00:01:08.520> if<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
little bit different if you have the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.070 
little bit different if you have the
games<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.260> know<00:01:10.729> 2009<00:01:11.729> 2008<00:01:12.420> you'll<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.930> that

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
games you know 2009 2008 you'll see that

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.080 
games you know 2009 2008 you'll see that
play<00:01:13.530> calling<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.189> very<00:01:14.430> similar<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
play calling that it's very similar and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.080

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.480 
this is the way that the players moved
and<00:01:46.000> they<00:01:46.120> move<00:01:46.300> more<00:01:46.630> naturally<00:01:46.660> than

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and they move more naturally than

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.930 
and they move more naturally than
without<00:01:48.490> let<00:01:49.120> me<00:01:49.210> show<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.450> here<00:01:50.610> now<00:01:51.610> if<00:01:51.910> you

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
observe you can see how the players when

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.070 
observe you can see how the players when
they<00:01:54.040> only<00:01:54.400> turn<00:01:54.880> they<00:01:55.420> look<00:01:55.540> like<00:01:55.690> their<00:01:55.840> cubs

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
happens is the locomotion allows them to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.790 
happens is the locomotion allows them to
swerve<00:02:07.509> like<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:07.990> regular<00:02:08.259> play<00:02:08.619> would

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
the only other thing is just a view of

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.750 
the only other thing is just a view of
the<00:02:21.940> screen<00:02:22.860> whenever<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.220> look<00:02:24.430> back<00:02:24.640> at
