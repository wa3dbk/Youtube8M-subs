00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 the athlete having a wonderful time 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.930
 but Brazilian football is being 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.960
 criticized mainly that set to 1 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.450
 This morning at the World Cup 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.179
 How do you see this football decadence? 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.609
 Brazil in terms of Europe in terms of 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.680
 from outside countries that are 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.170
 criticizing Brazilian football, then 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.609
 very good position nothing but I see from the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.670
 next way 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.050
 this is the reflection of our 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.059
 society is not football saying we 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.230
 we are very far from the other countries in 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.719
 education issue 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.450
 So we do not organize, so it's 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.180
 this you why you in six 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.550
 months found themselves better and then another in 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.710
 transit that will participate in the series b 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.600
 then there is no stability because 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.670
 it is because the country's educational problem 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.010
 is very unbalanced 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.079
 there is a very large inequality then 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.510
 This is happening already makes things 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.260
 more with emotion but with and lack of 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.899
 planning has names and the view there 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.970
 to strengthen a great team atleticano 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.000
 Of course, of course it is not 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.159
 always have some situations, but the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.420
 athletic is not the athletic 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.920
 Actually, every movie in Brazil 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.939
 need to first resolve the situation 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.720
 financial 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.770
 This is a big question, it 's not legal. 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.920
 some clubs are open to bankruptcy 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.860
 and few are still balanced mouths 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.570
 almost no financially so it is not 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.340
 a legal funding moment then the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.520
 hiring problem 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.610
 come on you'll hire ee 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.619
 person has to pay the players all 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.409
 Your flights are delayed. 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.590
 everybody a funny thing so it 's just a 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.990
 delicate way so it has to be 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.259
 rethought this part of the management of 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.369
 administration and then participate in 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.880
 hirings 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.219
 I consider myself king Dada say I think 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.950
 I understand soccer, but I'm here because neither 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.210
 Miss you, I see I do not know 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.540
 no football 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.710
 is that after you left here given me 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.310
 20 minutes to give me more lessons 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.170
 it's the old you you you could come to 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.830
 here for these folks to nod 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.170
 It would be very good because it 's difficult. 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.730
 but look is an exchange of experiences 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.840
 very cool and I am very pleased to 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.400
 talk to you and respect also because 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.620
 is not easy to have a brand as well as the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.950
 I remember, someone I knew. 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.920
 the story of your life is that this is what 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.960

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.230

 Congratulations, that's why. 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.520
 out of the world the image of the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.560
 trip and it is getting okay and did not fall 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.390
 from serving as an example for everyone 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.240
 so I'm very happy about this when 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.380
 I can cite example the players I am 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.960
 very sad when they can not 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.490

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.190
