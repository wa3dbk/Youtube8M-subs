00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
this one as I'm going to be cutting this

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.600 
this one as I'm going to be cutting this
up<00:02:46.050> using<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.920> sharp<00:02:47.250> knife<00:02:47.340> cut<00:02:47.880> along<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
up using a sharp knife cut along the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.320 
up using a sharp knife cut along the
pastry<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.920> try<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.190> make<00:02:53.340> these<00:02:53.520> as<00:02:53.790> even<00:02:54.209> as

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
pastry and try to make these as even as

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.530 
pastry and try to make these as even as
you<00:02:54.450> can<00:02:55.220> cut<00:02:56.220> across<00:02:56.520> them<00:02:56.820> in<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.270> diagonal

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
you can cut across them in a diagonal

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:05.650 
you can cut across them in a diagonal
line<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.720> now<00:03:03.840> have<00:03:03.950> diamond<00:03:04.950> shaped

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
line so you now have diamond shaped
