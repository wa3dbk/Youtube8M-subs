want to do this for example something

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.439 
want to do this for example something
like<00:00:29.070> surfing<00:00:29.760> where<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.300> lie<00:00:30.420> on

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
like surfing where you have to lie on

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.049 
like surfing where you have to lie on
the<00:00:30.630> board<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.050> swim<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:32.009> really<00:00:32.369> cannot

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
the board to swim out you really cannot

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.790 
the board to swim out you really cannot
ever<00:00:33.420> wear<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> chest<00:00:34.200> mount<00:00:34.320> because<00:00:34.500> that

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
ever wear a chest mount because that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.220 
ever wear a chest mount because that
cameras<00:00:35.130> gonna<00:00:35.250> bang<00:00:35.700> into<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.120> other<00:00:36.870> places

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
cameras gonna bang into you other places

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.139 
cameras gonna bang into you other places
this<00:00:37.590> could<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:37.950> really<00:00:38.250> useful<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.790> sports

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
this could be really useful or sports

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.720 
this could be really useful or sports
where<00:00:39.420> where<00:00:40.320> your<00:00:40.469> hand<00:00:40.860> positioning<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.489> in

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
where where your hand positioning is in

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.310 
where where your hand positioning is in
front<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.390> basically<00:00:42.750> completely

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
front of you it basically completely

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.290 
front of you it basically completely
blocks<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.950> camera<00:00:44.460> view<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> chest<00:00:45.149> mount

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
blocks the camera view of a chest mount

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.610 
blocks the camera view of a chest mount
so<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.629> makes<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> chest<00:00:46.140> mount<00:00:46.289> kind<00:00:46.559> of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
so it makes the chest mount kind of

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.860 
so it makes the chest mount kind of
unusable<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:47.820> maybe<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.329> don't<00:00:48.510> really<00:00:48.660> like

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
unusable but maybe you don't really like

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.410 
unusable but maybe you don't really like
the<00:00:49.020> head<00:00:49.230> mount<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.610> could<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.000> happy

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the head mount so this could be a happy

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.630 
the head mount so this could be a happy
medium<00:00:51.660> between<00:00:52.170> them<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:53.160> thing<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.430> I

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
medium between them one thing that I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.860 
medium between them one thing that I
thought<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:53.969> really<00:00:54.120> cool<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.690> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
thought was really cool with this I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930 
thought was really cool with this I
tested<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.440> out<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.829> lot<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.190> sailing<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.789> was

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
tested it out a lot of sailing I was

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
tested it out a lot of sailing I was
able<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.149> put<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> chest<00:00:58.260> mount<00:00:58.440> directly

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
able to put the chest mount directly

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.799 
able to put the chest mount directly
underneath<00:00:59.399> my<00:00:59.609> lifejacket<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.570> super

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
underneath my lifejacket so it's a super

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.439 
underneath my lifejacket so it's a super
slim<00:01:01.410> profile<00:01:01.980> fit<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> camera

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
slim profile fit and then the camera

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.810 
slim profile fit and then the camera
mount<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.350> my<00:01:04.470> shoulder<00:01:04.920> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
mount was just there on my shoulder so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.640 
mount was just there on my shoulder so
that<00:01:06.150> was<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:06.750> cool<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.229> there's<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.470> ton<00:01:07.619> of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that was really cool so there's a ton of

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.320 
that was really cool so there's a ton of
places<00:01:07.920> where<00:01:08.220> something<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.820> could

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
places where something like this could

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.120 
places where something like this could
be<00:01:09.510> really<00:01:09.960> useful<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> fact<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
be really useful and then the fact that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310 
be really useful and then the fact that
the<00:01:11.280> strap<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> entire<00:01:12.689> thing<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:13.049> made

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the strap and the entire thing is made

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.020 
the strap and the entire thing is made
out<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.560> neoprene<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.790> nice

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
stretch to it and big velcro connections

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.600 
stretch to it and big velcro connections
makes<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.759> super<00:01:18.240> secure<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> super<00:01:20.130> snug

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
makes it a super secure and super snug

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.960 
makes it a super secure and super snug
fitting<00:01:21.240> mount<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:23.070> goes<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.670> like

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
fitting mount so it goes on just like

fitting mount so it goes on just like
this<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.450> undo<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.020> big<00:01:25.290> front<00:01:25.650> buckle<00:01:26.040> they

need to stick one arm through here then

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:38.000 
need to stick one arm through here then

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.520 

and<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.120> up<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.080> position<00:01:40.230> the

camera and just like that the neo pine
shoulder<00:01:44.100> mount<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.550> all<00:01:45.270> mounted<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:47.580> now

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
shoulder mount is all mounted and now

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.930 
shoulder mount is all mounted and now
let's<00:01:48.810> talk<00:01:48.990> about<00:01:49.200> sample<00:01:49.980> footage<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.730> is

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
let's talk about sample footage this is

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.930 
let's talk about sample footage this is
where<00:01:51.150> I<00:01:51.360> was<00:01:51.690> actually<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.680> disappointed

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
where I was actually really disappointed

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.060 
where I was actually really disappointed
well<00:01:53.940> my<00:01:54.570> concern<00:01:54.840> our<00:01:55.260> initial<00:01:55.590> impressions

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
well my concern our initial impressions

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.860 
well my concern our initial impressions
was<00:01:56.220> gonna<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.520> with<00:01:56.640> stability<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.540> that

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
was gonna be with stability and that

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.660 
was gonna be with stability and that
really<00:01:58.200> wasn't<00:01:58.470> a<00:01:58.680> problem<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.250> footage<00:01:59.550> I

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
really wasn't a problem the footage I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.300 
really wasn't a problem the footage I
took<00:01:59.700> with<00:01:59.970> this<00:02:00.120> seems<00:02:00.540> really<00:02:01.170> stable<00:02:01.620> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
took with this seems really stable the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.780 
took with this seems really stable the
problem<00:02:02.880> was<00:02:03.090> how<00:02:03.390> close<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.440> camera<00:02:05.280> ends<00:02:05.700> up

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
problem was how close the camera ends up

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.700 
problem was how close the camera ends up
being<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.300> your<00:02:06.420> heads<00:02:06.720> you<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.080> see<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.410> all

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
being to your heads you can see in all

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.410 
being to your heads you can see in all
of<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.980> sample<00:02:08.369> footage<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.850> I<00:02:08.880> shot<00:02:09.000> with

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
of the sample footage that I shot with

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.650 
of the sample footage that I shot with
this<00:02:09.570> mount<00:02:09.780> my<00:02:10.560> face<00:02:11.130> makes<00:02:11.640> up<00:02:11.850> most<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.570> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
this mount my face makes up most of the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.040 
this mount my face makes up most of the
right<00:02:12.840> hand<00:02:13.050> side<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.040> screen<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.050> well

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
right hand side of the screen and well

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.960 
right hand side of the screen and well
it's<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.440> little<00:02:16.770> bit<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.100> an<00:02:17.190> interesting<00:02:17.670> look

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
it's a little bit of an interesting look

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.120 
it's a little bit of an interesting look
it's<00:02:18.210> definitely<00:02:18.870> not<00:02:19.020> something<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.740> you

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
it's definitely not something that you

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.470 
it's definitely not something that you
could<00:02:20.400> look<00:02:20.580> at<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:20.820> very<00:02:21.570> long<00:02:22.200> so

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
could look at for very long so

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.880 
could look at for very long so
disappointing<00:02:24.480> there<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.200> was<00:02:25.500> wondering<00:02:25.710> if

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
disappointing there I was wondering if

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.620 
disappointing there I was wondering if
maybe<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.130> couple<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.490> extension<00:02:26.940> bars<00:02:27.180> could

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
maybe a couple of extension bars could

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.390 
maybe a couple of extension bars could
move<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.960> away<00:02:28.050> from<00:02:28.350> my<00:02:28.500> face<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.250> get<00:02:29.340> a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
move it away from my face and get a

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.510 
move it away from my face and get a
little<00:02:29.550> bit<00:02:29.730> farther<00:02:30.000> away<00:02:30.120> but<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.520> don't

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
little bit farther away but I don't

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.980 
little bit farther away but I don't
think<00:02:32.850> that's<00:02:33.090> really<00:02:33.450> gonna<00:02:33.600> be<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
think that's really gonna be the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.630 
think that's really gonna be the
solution<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.650> think<00:02:34.680> doing<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.490> going

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
solution and I think doing that is going

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.640 
solution and I think doing that is going
to<00:02:35.970> bring<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.360> much<00:02:36.480> more<00:02:36.690> vibration<00:02:37.440> and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
to bring so much more vibration and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.960 
to bring so much more vibration and
movement<00:02:38.010> into<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.160> shot<00:02:38.460> that<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:38.790> not

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
movement into the shot that it's not

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.260 
movement into the shot that it's not
really<00:02:39.510> going<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.200> work<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.850> could<00:02:42.090> also

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
really going to work so you could also

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.180 
really going to work so you could also
use<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.660> in<00:02:42.870> narrow<00:02:43.260> mode<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.770> can<00:02:43.950> crop

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
use this in narrow mode you can crop

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.820 
use this in narrow mode you can crop
down<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.430> shot<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.880> can<00:02:45.000> crop<00:02:45.180> out<00:02:45.360> your<00:02:45.510> face

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
down the shot you can crop out your face

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.199 
down the shot you can crop out your face
the<00:02:46.830> shot<00:02:47.070> does<00:02:47.340> feel<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.610> little<00:02:47.670> bit<00:02:47.910> lopsided

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
the shot does feel a little bit lopsided

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.120 
the shot does feel a little bit lopsided
because<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.380> mounted<00:02:49.709> off<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.100> side

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
because it is mounted off to one side

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.590 
because it is mounted off to one side
and<00:02:50.520> watching<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.970> back<00:02:51.120> you'll<00:02:51.330> probably

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
and watching it back you'll probably

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.229 
and watching it back you'll probably
notice<00:02:52.020> that<00:02:52.350> but<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.730> still<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> pretty

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
notice that but it is still a pretty

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.210 
notice that but it is still a pretty
cool<00:02:54.720> shot<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.620> does<00:02:55.800> give<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.100> an

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
cool shot and it does give you an

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.850 
cool shot and it does give you an
ability<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:57.239> body<00:02:57.630> mount<00:02:57.900> even<00:02:58.350> if<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.560> can't

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
ability to body mount even if you can't

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.949 
ability to body mount even if you can't
put<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.340> camera<00:02:59.580> directly<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.930> your

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
put that camera directly on to your

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.530 
put that camera directly on to your
chest<00:03:01.410> in<00:03:02.070> conclusion<00:03:02.700> then<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:03.000> neo<00:03:03.180> pine

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
chest in conclusion then that neo pine

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.560 
chest in conclusion then that neo pine
shoulder<00:03:04.440> mount<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.890> really<00:03:05.730> really<00:03:06.390> cool

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
shoulder mount is a really really cool

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.540 
shoulder mount is a really really cool
mount<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.290> love<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.830> fact<00:03:08.070> that<00:03:08.160> it's<00:03:08.370> built

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
mount I love the fact that it's built

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.330 
mount I love the fact that it's built
out<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.850> complete<00:03:09.420> neoprene<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.200> fits<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:11.130> much

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
out of complete neoprene it fits so much

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.310 
out of complete neoprene it fits so much
nicer<00:03:11.700> than<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.880> gopro<00:03:12.420> chest<00:03:12.450> mount<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.110> feels

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
nicer than a gopro chest mount it feels

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.100 
nicer than a gopro chest mount it feels
really<00:03:13.830> snug<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:15.270> really<00:03:15.480> don't<00:03:15.660> notice

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
really snug and you really don't notice

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.330 
really snug and you really don't notice
it<00:03:16.380> when<00:03:16.470> you're<00:03:16.590> wearing<00:03:16.770> it<00:03:16.890> especially<00:03:17.130> if

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
it when you're wearing it especially if

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.490 
it when you're wearing it especially if
you're<00:03:17.459> doing<00:03:17.550> water<00:03:18.000> sports<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:19.170> can<00:03:19.320> kind

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
you're doing water sports you can kind

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.720 
you're doing water sports you can kind
of<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.709> put<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:19.980> on<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.400> can<00:03:20.430> put<00:03:20.670> it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
of just put it on you can put it

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.940 
of just put it on you can put it
underneath<00:03:20.910> whatever<00:03:21.560> bulkier<00:03:22.560> stuff<00:03:22.830> you're

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
underneath whatever bulkier stuff you're

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.010 
underneath whatever bulkier stuff you're
gonna<00:03:23.010> be<00:03:23.220> using<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.790> just<00:03:23.970> kind<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.209> sits

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
gonna be using and it just kind of sits

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.080 
gonna be using and it just kind of sits
there<00:03:25.110> out<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.830> way<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.640> respect

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
there out of the way so in that respect

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.949 
there out of the way so in that respect
it's<00:03:27.330> great<00:03:28.190> but<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.790> shot<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.360> gets<00:03:30.660> from<00:03:30.930> me

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
it's great but the shot it gets from me

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.380 
it's great but the shot it gets from me
is<00:03:31.260> not<00:03:31.770> one<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.220> I'm<00:03:32.370> really<00:03:32.400> gonna<00:03:32.820> want<00:03:33.150> to

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
is not one that I'm really gonna want to

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.630 
is not one that I'm really gonna want to
use<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.989> edits<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.500> stuff<00:03:34.709> like<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:35.070> so<00:03:35.340> I

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
use and edits and stuff like that so I

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.300 
use and edits and stuff like that so I
think<00:03:36.030> despite<00:03:36.540> being<00:03:37.170> an<00:03:37.440> awesomely

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
think despite being an awesomely

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.520 
think despite being an awesomely
constructed<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.360> well-put-together<00:03:39.930> mount

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
constructed and well-put-together mount

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.390 
constructed and well-put-together mount
the<00:03:41.660> shot<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.840> gets<00:03:43.050> isn't<00:03:43.530> really<00:03:44.160> something

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
the shot it gets isn't really something

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.789 
the shot it gets isn't really something
that<00:03:44.700> I'm<00:03:44.790> going<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.120> want<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.049> thus<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.530> this

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
that I'm going to want and thus is this

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.220 
that I'm going to want and thus is this
mount<00:03:47.010> is<00:03:47.190> not<00:03:47.430> something<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:47.850> I<00:03:48.000> would

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
mount is not something that I would

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.470 
mount is not something that I would
really<00:03:49.230> use<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:50.160> may<00:03:50.340> very<00:03:50.519> you<00:03:50.850> may<00:03:51.000> love<00:03:51.299> the
