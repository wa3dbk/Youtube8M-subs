00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
thought because I found myself in the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.930 
thought because I found myself in the
lead<00:00:16.200> and<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.980> wasn't<00:00:17.160> expecting<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.640> be<00:00:17.730> up

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
lead and I wasn't expecting to be up

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.290 
there up there I wanted to get out in
the<00:00:19.830> top<00:00:19.980> 25<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.640> wasn't<00:00:20.820> expected

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
the top 25 but I wasn't expected

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.200 
the top 25 but I wasn't expected
expecting<00:00:21.929> to<00:00:22.019> be<00:00:22.050> leading<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.679> I<00:00:23.580> kind<00:00:24.150> of

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
expecting to be leading so I kind of

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.240 
expecting to be leading so I kind of
tried<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.480> let<00:00:25.140> somebody<00:00:25.349> else<00:00:25.529> go<00:00:25.859> take<00:00:26.130> the

tried to let somebody else go take the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.060 
tried to let somebody else go take the

the girls hang with that tough or

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.610 
the girls hang with that tough or
without<00:00:32.850> lead<00:00:33.060> pack<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.320> going<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
without lead pack this is going to be a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.569 
without lead pack this is going to be a
really<00:00:34.950> good<00:00:35.270> preview<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> Big<00:00:36.960> Ten<00:00:37.200> um

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
really good preview of the Big Ten um

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.819 
really good preview of the Big Ten um
the<00:00:38.579> team<00:00:38.820> I'm<00:00:39.570> pretty<00:00:40.050> sure<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.379> place<00:00:40.590> pretty

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the team I'm pretty sure we place pretty

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.770 
the team I'm pretty sure we place pretty
well<00:00:40.949> we<00:00:41.730> might<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.000> lost<00:00:42.120> one<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> girls

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
well we might have lost one of the girls

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.240 
well we might have lost one of the girls
I<00:00:43.170> think<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.590> them<00:00:43.739> might<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.010> tripped

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
I think one of them might have tripped

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.430 
I think one of them might have tripped
but<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.969> did<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.300> well<00:00:45.390> today<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.989> I'm

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
season I think we're going the right

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.010 
season I think we're going the right
direction<00:01:16.500> obviously<00:01:17.240> this<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> step<00:01:18.810> up

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
direction obviously this was a step up

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
direction obviously this was a step up
for<00:01:19.470> us<00:01:19.650> step<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.220> competition<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.939> I

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
for us step up in competition and I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.679 
for us step up in competition and I
think<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.299> met<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.380> goals<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.920> wanted<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
think we met the goals that we wanted to

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.910 
think we met the goals that we wanted to
we'll<00:01:24.689> see<00:01:24.869> if<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:25.079> can<00:01:25.200> get<00:01:25.259> Ashley<00:01:25.590> back<00:01:25.740> up

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.080 
we'll see if we can get Ashley back up
there<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> think<00:01:26.310> we're<00:01:26.460> very<00:01:26.820> competitive

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
