00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.739
 or the truth to all the devil I bring you 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.630
 a guide on secondary shotguns 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.730
 of operation 7 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.740
 these weapons have become weapons 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.930
 devastating at the time of informant 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.420
 close as they have ammunition 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.620
 called lead this ammo allows 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.620
 throw small matches 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.860
 although to achieve impact these bullets 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.310
 in enemy you must have good aim 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.960
 since being shotguns is 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.030
 say that recharge every time 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 we will shoot we will have only one bullet to 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.540
 impact 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.729
 these weapons most commented at the time of 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.960
 play on small maps since they do not have 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.810
 No harm at a long distance 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.700
 the force instance encounters with the 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.760
 enemy nearby since at medium distance 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.580
 and it lengthens destine warehouses headlights for 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.410
 achieve a low 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.570
 as we will go up the level 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:32.400
 of the block we will make three shotguns for 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:36.240
 move to level 9 the network 870 level 15 and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 for some the best the 12 in the 17 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.860
 although all will fulfill the same function 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.690
 at close range the damage of this 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.210
 shotgun will vary as has 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.160
 directed the impact of the bullet since if 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.580
 impacts on the feet case of damage 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.530
 of 16 percent of the bullet but by the 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.110
 contrary to being shot in the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.450
 body we will automatically die thing 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.310
 that will not happen when it hits the head 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.740
 a mid-range shot with the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.660
 shotgun simply because it's espert and 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.210
 running impact in their entirety by 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.340
 so you kill him remembering that a 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.890
 Shotgun kills a shot if it only hits 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.650
 95% of the pellets in the target 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.600
 one of the tips and tips to manage 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.910
 the shotguns of the 'checkmate' operation is 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.220
 when facing against a 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.740
 enemy jumps and shoots with a shotgun 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.930
 so moving sideways to 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.780
 prevent the enemy from impacting you and you 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.500
 the objective can be set 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.500
 correctly to kill him 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.790
 another tip is when making average shots 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.340
 distance and long distance point 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.430
 quickly this will increase your accuracy 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.660
 at the time of shooting thus achieving 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.660
 get a low 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.510
 another tip is not always to be in 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.970
 a battle you must aim sometimes 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.670
 you will shoot quickly and with 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.340
 aim to end the enemy 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.080
 without being any the response 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.910
 Shotguns are not always very good at 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.950
 a melee combat but if 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.810
 you want to try the best suits for 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.940
 my opinion in a combat with this body 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.800
 in the 810 network of level 15 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.080
