00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
than collecting other seeds first thing

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.780 
than collecting other seeds first thing
is<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.450> want<00:00:12.690> your<00:00:12.809> beans<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.590> fully<00:00:13.950> dry<00:00:14.340> and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790

is you want your beans to fully dry and
grow<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.299> vine<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.599> don't<00:00:15.780> pick<00:00:15.990> these

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
grow on the vine you don't pick these

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.859 
grow on the vine you don't pick these
when<00:00:16.440> they're<00:00:16.650> green<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.220> let<00:00:17.730> them<00:00:17.880> dry<00:00:18.119> you

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
them to stay on the vine until the beans

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.990 
them to stay on the vine until the beans
plump<00:00:24.330> through<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> pod<00:00:25.189> or<00:00:26.189> fully<00:00:26.490> develop

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
plump through the pod or fully develop

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.609 
plump through the pod or fully develop
and<00:00:27.180> then<00:00:27.420> they<00:00:27.599> dry<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.230> can<00:00:28.410> see

completely dry if you store wet seeds

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.690 
completely dry if you store wet seeds
you<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> chance<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.410> growing<00:00:43.559> mold<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
you have a chance of growing mold the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.560 
you have a chance of growing mold the
other<00:00:44.850> thing<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.120> want<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.570> beans<00:00:45.870> is

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
other thing you want to do with beans is

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.200 
other thing you want to do with beans is
put<00:00:48.570> them<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.780> bags<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.620> I've<00:00:49.739> been<00:00:50.010> one<00:00:50.760> being

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
put them in bags so I've been one being

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.639 
put them in bags so I've been one being
too<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.539> being<00:00:51.750> three<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.230> reason<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.590> do

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
too and being three and the reason I do

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.010 
too and being three and the reason I do
this<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.670> beans<00:00:53.910> from<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.329> section<00:00:54.600> will

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
this is the beans from this section will

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.319 
this is the beans from this section will
go<00:00:55.170> into<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.559> bag<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.340> beans<00:00:56.579> from<00:00:56.850> this

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
go into this bag the beans from this

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.299 
go into this bag the beans from this
section<00:00:57.719> we'll<00:00:57.840> go<00:00:57.960> into<00:00:58.109> bag<00:00:58.350> two<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.890> then

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
section we'll go into bag two and then

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.119 
section we'll go into bag two and then
further<00:00:59.579> down<00:00:59.670> my<00:01:00.030> vine<00:01:00.559> there<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> beetle

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
further down my vine there is a beetle

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.240 
further down my vine there is a beetle
that<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.640> lay<00:01:02.960> larvae<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.409> your<00:01:04.710> beans<00:01:04.920> so

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that can lay larvae in your beans so

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.460 
that can lay larvae in your beans so
that<00:01:05.280> after<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> end<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:05.970> picking<00:01:06.210> them<00:01:06.510> you

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that after you end up picking them you

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.530 
that after you end up picking them you
have<00:01:07.590> all<00:01:07.770> your<00:01:07.890> beans<00:01:08.100> dried<00:01:08.580> selected

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
have all your beans dried selected

have all your beans dried selected
stored<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.409> those<00:01:11.330> eggs<00:01:12.330> hatch<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:14.100> larvae

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
stored if those eggs hatch the larvae

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.039 
stored if those eggs hatch the larvae
are<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.939> eat<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> beans<00:01:15.479> season<00:01:15.900> it's

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
are going to eat the beans season it's

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.590 
are going to eat the beans season it's
gonna<00:01:16.200> ruin<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.799> save<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.430> what<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.270> is

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
gonna ruin what you save so what I do is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.690 
gonna ruin what you save so what I do is
I<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:19.080> kind<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.680> work<00:01:19.770> my<00:01:19.950> way<00:01:20.070> down<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.520> vine

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
I I kind of work my way down the vine

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.060 
I I kind of work my way down the vine
left<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.090> right<00:01:21.299> put<00:01:22.049> them<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.530> bag<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:23.040> bag

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
left to right put them in a bag one bag

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.920 
left to right put them in a bag one bag
two<00:01:23.520> bag<00:01:23.549> three<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.240> then<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.450> would<00:01:24.630> store

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
two bag three and then I would store

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.350 
two bag three and then I would store
this<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.380> ziplock<00:01:25.740> bag<00:01:25.979> these<00:01:26.820> beans<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
this in a ziplock bag these beans in a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120 
this in a ziplock bag these beans in a
ziplock<00:01:27.720> bag<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:27.990> these<00:01:28.320> beans<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.799> ziplock

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
ziplock bag and these beans in a ziplock

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.920 
ziplock bag and these beans in a ziplock
bag<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.820> increases<00:01:30.150> your<00:01:30.479> chances

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
bag and that just increases your chances

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.760 
bag and that just increases your chances
of<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.490> contaminating<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:33.030> your<00:01:33.390> beans<00:01:33.770> with

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
of not contaminating all your beans with

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.270 
of not contaminating all your beans with
one<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.850> know<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> bunch<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.390> beetle<00:01:36.720> larvae

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
one you know a bunch of beetle larvae

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.319 
one you know a bunch of beetle larvae
anyway<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:39.509> pick<00:01:39.720> them<00:01:40.759> just<00:01:41.759> open<00:01:42.060> up<00:01:42.150> your

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
anyway to pick them just open up your

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.780 
anyway to pick them just open up your
