00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.530
 O 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.529
 halo game run today we pull 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.930
 again with the pirates around the houses 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.240
 but this time we do not have children 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.939
 or attack opponents but put 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.520
 our incredible pirate include a 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.230
 because in our country are below game 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.599
 the pirate ships on the dry 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.610
 and would have to return to the water around the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.500
 reach flooded their respective 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.750
 area but have to be careful that the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.640
 water only your ships reached 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.890
 and not even the innocent citizens 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.020
 Washed away per level you have one 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.699
 certain number of clicks with which you 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.800
 Obstacle clear away or barricades 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.539
 if you can not build any clicks 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.039
 but there is more left over 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.149
 not every ship has reached 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.100
 you start from the beginning 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.870
 we show you in the following video how 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.260
 the first levels work water 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.260
 march 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.910
 at land under it is about 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.250
 shortest time around with so little 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.410
 as much as possible, the water plays as well 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.380
 pirate ships or bring to saat 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.060
 so that trees grow there 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.070
 It's important to be careful not to 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.110
 by chance the innocent village residents 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.240
 be flushed or the water on 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.220
 ice block comes and freezes faster 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.140
 you are and the more moves you make at the end 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.990
 still left are the higher yours 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.910
 Score is controlled from it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.350
 exclusively with the mouse with this 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.240
 you can, for example, a sand castle 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.490
 click away so that the water flows through 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.229
 can or at a vacancy 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.360
 Sand block build around the water 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.710
 keep 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.660
 in the later levels come still 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.950
 switch can put the added around and 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.020
 the water only in a certain 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.979
 Direction steer and ice blocks this year 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.300
 freeze immediately 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.979
 it gets tricky if you only few 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.509
 But you have a big game 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.820
 winding area with ice blocks 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.860
 Switches and many villagers with 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.720
 water flood must there only helps 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.280
 think and every possibility in 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.470
 consider or at worst 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.420
 fall so long to try until the 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.590
 we found the right solution 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.450
 push your thumb in any case 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.670
 and wish you a lot of fun with our 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.680
 latest pirates are going to screw that up 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.660
 wooden leg on puts on the eye patch 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.040
 and saddle your parrot for now 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.720

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.720
 your freibeuter talents out
