macerated<00:00:03.419> on<00:00:03.510> this<00:00:03.659> map<00:00:03.870> because<00:00:04.140> of<00:00:04.319> the

macerated on this map because of the
backdoor<00:00:04.859> rocks<00:00:05.359> so<00:00:06.359> we'll<00:00:06.480> just<00:00:06.600> do<00:00:06.750> racks

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
backdoor rocks so we'll just do racks

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:42.369 
backdoor rocks so we'll just do racks
this<00:00:07.109> guy<00:00:11.660> put<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.750> rocks<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.200> our<00:00:13.320> advantage

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379

so enjoy our probably false reports
that's<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.870> way<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> fix<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> system<00:00:58.280> you

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that's the way to fix the system you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.920 
that's the way to fix the system you
know<00:00:59.399> isn't<00:00:59.550> filing<00:00:59.969> Fox<00:01:00.210> false<00:01:00.510> reports

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930

because<00:01:02.750> rock<00:01:03.750> hackers<00:01:04.350> are<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.270> pretty

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
because rock hackers are so pretty

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.620 
because rock hackers are so pretty
pretty<00:01:07.110> rare<00:01:07.909> gods<00:01:08.909> are<00:01:09.030> running<00:01:09.240> into<00:01:09.360> more

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.030 
pretty rare gods are running into more
than<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:09.869> hacker<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.439> session<00:01:10.619> it's

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
than one hacker in this session it's

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.149 
than one hacker in this session it's
pretty<00:01:11.250> low

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:22.930 

there's<00:01:14.909> an<00:01:15.030> obvious<00:01:15.180> hacker

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.680 

actually<00:01:23.940> can't<00:01:24.090> remember<00:01:24.150> last<00:01:24.480> time<00:01:24.570> I

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
actually can't remember last time I

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.900 
actually can't remember last time I
faced<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.050> Packer<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.550> that<00:01:26.730> was

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
faced in that Packer I do if that was

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:40.660 
faced in that Packer I do if that was
obvious<00:01:33.530> quite<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> few<00:01:34.740> sessions

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.680 

unfortunately<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.760> best<00:01:41.880> hacking<00:01:42.330> race<00:01:42.479> is

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
unfortunately the best hacking race is

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.920 
unfortunately the best hacking race is
Zerg<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:45.080> it's<00:01:46.080> almost<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.979> there's<00:01:47.220> no

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
Zerg and it's almost like there's no

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.090 
Zerg and it's almost like there's no
there's<00:01:48.930> nothing<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.260> basically<00:01:49.800> it's<00:01:50.010> just

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
there's nothing like basically it's just

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.070 
there's nothing like basically it's just
tells<00:01:50.970> them<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.270> drone<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:51.900> not<00:01:52.050> to

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
tells them when to drone and what not to

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.790 
tells them when to drone and what not to
and<00:01:52.530> that's<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:54.390> know<00:01:54.509> that's<00:01:55.200> not<00:01:55.380> evidence

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
and that's you know that's not evidence

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.010 
and that's you know that's not evidence
