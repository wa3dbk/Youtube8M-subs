like<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.340> said<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.610> tomb<00:04:17.790> spider<00:04:18.090> model<00:04:18.570> was

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
like I said the tomb spider model was

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.060 
like I said the tomb spider model was
discontinued<00:04:19.380> or<00:04:19.500> something<00:04:19.830> I<00:04:19.890> couldn't

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
discontinued or something I couldn't

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.160 
discontinued or something I couldn't
find<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.459> for<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.580> longest<00:04:20.850> time<00:04:21.060> pick<00:04:21.959> those

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
find it for the longest time pick those

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.820 
find it for the longest time pick those
up<00:04:22.400> cheap<00:04:23.600> these<00:04:24.600> are<00:04:24.810> my<00:04:24.870> homemade<00:04:25.260> obelisks

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
and i did a little short video and then

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.590 
and i did a little short video and then
they're<00:04:32.640> made<00:04:32.790> of<00:04:32.970> foam<00:04:33.720> catch<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.800> a

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
they're made of foam catch to a

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.110 
they're made of foam catch to a
heroscape<00:04:36.600> base<00:04:37.520> will<00:04:38.520> cylinder<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.090> the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
heroscape base will cylinder in the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.770 
heroscape base will cylinder in the
middle<00:04:39.420> just<00:04:39.810> for<00:04:40.130> detail<00:04:41.130> put<00:04:42.060> some<00:04:42.240> rooms<00:04:42.510> on

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
middle just for detail put some rooms on

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.000 
middle just for detail put some rooms on
them<00:04:42.960> eventually<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:44.810> got<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.840> immortal<00:04:46.770> flan

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
them eventually I got a immortal flan

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.240 
them eventually I got a immortal flan
and<00:04:47.280> then<00:04:48.270> these<00:04:48.630> guys<00:04:48.870> here<00:04:49.170> my<00:04:49.440> proxy<00:04:49.950> model

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
and then these guys here my proxy model

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.140 
and then these guys here my proxy model
for<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.430> mortal<00:04:52.070> but<00:04:53.070> these<00:04:53.310> they<00:04:53.730> do<00:04:53.850> have<00:04:54.000> some

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
for a mortal but these they do have some

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.410 
for a mortal but these they do have some
real<00:04:54.270> ones<00:04:55.940> and<00:04:57.440> much<00:04:58.440> different<00:04:58.890> is<00:04:59.400> 15<00:05:00.060> or<00:05:00.300> so

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
real ones and much different is 15 or so

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.990 
real ones and much different is 15 or so
of<00:05:00.570> them<00:05:01.220> now<00:05:02.220> we<00:05:02.280> get<00:05:02.550> into<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.910> weird<00:05:03.240> stuff

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
of them now we get into the weird stuff

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.880 
of them now we get into the weird stuff
in<00:05:06.000> here<00:05:06.240> these<00:05:06.750> actually<00:05:07.200> came<00:05:07.470> from<00:05:07.500> a

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
in here these actually came from a

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.210 
in here these actually came from a
website<00:05:08.160> it's<00:05:08.730> a<00:05:08.820> fan<00:05:09.030> site<00:05:09.360> that<00:05:10.190> when<00:05:11.190> I

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
website it's a fan site that when I

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.130 
website it's a fan site that when I
broke<00:05:11.520> 11<00:05:12.680> that<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:14.300> cover<00:05:15.300> second<00:05:15.780> edition

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
broke 11 that a cover second edition

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.030 
broke 11 that a cover second edition
stuff<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:17.280> they<00:05:17.430> made<00:05:17.640> these<00:05:17.850> they're<00:05:18.180> called

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
stuff and they made these they're called

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.800 
stuff and they made these they're called
sentinels<00:05:20.040> I<00:05:20.340> think<00:05:20.820> yeah<00:05:21.330> these<00:05:21.630> are<00:05:21.750> the

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
sentinels I think yeah these are the

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.140 
sentinels I think yeah these are the
Sentinels<00:05:22.169> I<00:05:22.640> still<00:05:23.640> getting<00:05:23.880> the<00:05:23.940> names

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
Sentinels I still getting the names

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.600 
Sentinels I still getting the names
right<00:05:24.450> but<00:05:25.230> they're<00:05:26.100> supposed<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.490> be<00:05:26.580> a

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
right but they're supposed to be a

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.740 
right but they're supposed to be a
little<00:05:26.669> bit<00:05:26.790> smaller<00:05:27.090> than<00:05:27.210> these<00:05:27.450> but<00:05:27.690> I

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
little bit smaller than these but I

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.180 
little bit smaller than these but I
found<00:05:27.960> these<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.440> they<00:05:28.530> work<00:05:28.680> perfect<00:05:29.130> for

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
found these and they work perfect for

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:35.000 
found these and they work perfect for
what<00:05:29.910> they<00:05:30.030> are<00:05:30.140> and<00:05:32.990> have<00:05:33.990> a<00:05:34.110> guy<00:05:34.350> here<00:05:34.650> so<00:05:34.919> you

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
what they are and have a guy here so you

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.409 
what they are and have a guy here so you
can<00:05:35.160> kind<00:05:35.400> of<00:05:35.460> see<00:05:35.520> how<00:05:35.760> big<00:05:35.940> they're<00:05:36.150> they're

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
can kind of see how big they're they're

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.140 
can kind of see how big they're they're
a<00:05:36.450> little<00:05:36.570> bigger<00:05:36.780> than<00:05:36.990> there<00:05:37.169> should<00:05:37.200> be

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
a little bigger than there should be

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.830 
a little bigger than there should be
next<00:05:39.150> to<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.830> prior<00:05:40.830> there<00:05:41.360> but<00:05:42.410> they<00:05:43.410> have<00:05:43.710> a

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
next to the prior there but they have a

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.290 
next to the prior there but they have a
flux<00:05:45.840> art<00:05:46.080> gun<00:05:46.350> on<00:05:46.860> either<00:05:47.040> side<00:05:47.400> and<00:05:50.300> then

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
flux art gun on either side and then

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.920 
flux art gun on either side and then
they<00:05:51.450> have<00:05:51.890> here's<00:05:52.890> a<00:05:52.950> twin<00:05:53.340> linked<00:05:53.930> heavy

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
they have here's a twin linked heavy

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.270 
they have here's a twin linked heavy
goth<00:05:55.230> is<00:05:56.070> actually<00:05:56.520> Gauss<00:05:56.700> rifles<00:05:57.180> but<00:05:57.390> hey

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
goth is actually Gauss rifles but hey

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.230 
goth is actually Gauss rifles but hey
and<00:06:00.830> may<00:06:01.830> I<00:06:01.860> get<00:06:02.040> a<00:06:02.070> couple<00:06:02.220> of<00:06:02.430> them<00:06:02.580> they're

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
and may I get a couple of them they're

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.360 
and may I get a couple of them they're
interesting<00:06:03.810> they<00:06:03.930> died<00:06:04.110> real<00:06:04.380> quick<00:06:04.410> they're

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
interesting they died real quick they're

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.230 
interesting they died real quick they're
on<00:06:06.180> par<00:06:06.540> with<00:06:06.600> a<00:06:06.840> with<00:06:07.260> a<00:06:07.290> predator<00:06:08.070> for<00:06:08.910> damage

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
on par with a with a predator for damage

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.860 
on par with a with a predator for damage
wise<00:06:09.740> now<00:06:10.740> these<00:06:10.919> here<00:06:11.190> actually<00:06:12.090> a<00:06:12.300> Halifax

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
wise now these here actually a Halifax

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.500 
wise now these here actually a Halifax
croyd<00:06:13.260> from<00:06:13.470> Star<00:06:13.740> Wars<00:06:13.770> but<00:06:14.250> we<00:06:14.790> use<00:06:14.970> them<00:06:15.180> as

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
croyd from Star Wars but we use them as

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.370 
croyd from Star Wars but we use them as
another<00:06:15.750> fan<00:06:16.230> made<00:06:16.650> thing<00:06:17.250> called<00:06:18.060> a

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
another fan made thing called a

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.940 
another fan made thing called a
decimator<00:06:19.380> and<00:06:20.300> it's<00:06:21.300> basically<00:06:22.290> the<00:06:22.410> necron

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
decimator and it's basically the necron

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.620 
decimator and it's basically the necron
equivalent<00:06:23.490> of<00:06:23.520> a<00:06:23.610> dreadknot<00:06:24.000> with<00:06:24.330> living

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
equivalent of a dreadknot with living

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.380 
equivalent of a dreadknot with living
armor<00:06:25.039> and<00:06:26.039> I<00:06:26.280> believe<00:06:26.669> they<00:06:26.880> have<00:06:27.000> a<00:06:27.030> twin

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
armor and I believe they have a twin

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.910 
armor and I believe they have a twin
linked<00:06:27.600> heavy<00:06:27.960> Gauss<00:06:28.229> and<00:06:28.650> some

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
linked heavy Gauss and some

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.870 
linked heavy Gauss and some
Alton<00:06:29.570> but<00:06:30.620> later<00:06:31.620> on<00:06:31.710> we<00:06:32.010> found<00:06:32.220> these<00:06:32.370> models

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
Alton but later on we found these models

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.940 
Alton but later on we found these models
are<00:06:33.090> actually<00:06:33.720> from<00:06:33.930> terminator<00:06:34.590> they're<00:06:34.920> a

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
are actually from terminator they're a

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.330 
are actually from terminator they're a
little<00:06:35.100> bigger<00:06:35.340> but<00:06:36.150> I<00:06:36.240> think<00:06:36.420> they<00:06:36.510> fit<00:06:36.840> the

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
little bigger but I think they fit the

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.340 
little bigger but I think they fit the
look<00:06:38.340> better<00:06:38.910> so<00:06:39.750> this<00:06:39.900> is<00:06:39.930> what<00:06:40.080> we're<00:06:40.170> using

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
look better so this is what we're using

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:50.480 
look better so this is what we're using
now<00:06:42.950> and<00:06:43.950> for<00:06:44.880> the<00:06:45.080> last<00:06:46.080> final<00:06:46.740> a<00:06:49.460> piece<00:06:50.460> that
