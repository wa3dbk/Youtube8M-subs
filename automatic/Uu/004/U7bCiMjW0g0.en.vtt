I can't see it with the clock and that's

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.649 
I can't see it with the clock and that's
where<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> higher<00:02:26.010> quality<00:02:26.219> lens<00:02:26.730> right<00:02:27.299> is

where a higher quality lens right is
going<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.930> give<00:02:28.019> you<00:02:28.109> better<00:02:28.230> optics<00:02:28.650> well<00:02:29.010> as

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
going to give you better optics well as

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.759 
going to give you better optics well as
a<00:02:29.280> darker<00:02:29.730> lens<00:02:29.879> more<00:02:30.689> protection<00:02:31.109> there<00:02:31.650> are

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
a darker lens more protection there are

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.709 
a darker lens more protection there are
not<00:02:31.889> necessarily<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.879> these<00:02:33.090> lenses<00:02:33.389> here

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
not necessarily so these lenses here

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.720 
not necessarily so these lenses here
were<00:02:33.870> perfectly<00:02:34.290> clear<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.010> they<00:02:35.519> have<00:02:35.700> a

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
hundred percent UV protection as well so

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.740 
hundred percent UV protection as well so
the<00:02:38.310> tint<00:02:38.549> has<00:02:38.819> more<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.239> do<00:02:39.420> with<00:02:39.569> your
