00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
up but so what I'm thinking about doing

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.529 
up but so what I'm thinking about doing
is<00:00:28.439> adding<00:00:28.680> another<00:00:29.189> layer<00:00:29.460> shelving<00:00:30.150> up<00:00:30.269> top

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
is adding another layer shelving up top

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.380 
is adding another layer shelving up top
and<00:00:31.460> that<00:00:32.460> will<00:00:32.640> give<00:00:32.820> me<00:00:32.940> another<00:00:33.210> 21<00:00:33.899> feet<00:00:34.200> of

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
and that will give me another 21 feet of

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.260 
and that will give me another 21 feet of
storage<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.430> even<00:00:38.670> though<00:00:38.940> my

to the marsh light all you have to do
now<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.140> trick<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:11.710> getting<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.900> old<00:03:13.900> hatch

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.980 
now the trick is getting the old hatch
off<00:03:14.560> okay<00:03:15.400> there's<00:03:15.730> two<00:03:15.940> screws<00:03:16.270> top<00:03:16.630> one<00:03:16.810> sees

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
off okay there's two screws top one sees

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.490 
off okay there's two screws top one sees
the<00:03:17.350> bottom<00:03:17.650> one<00:03:17.800> is<00:03:17.950> on<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:19.570> pilot<00:03:20.020> is<00:03:20.200> in<00:03:20.230> the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
the bottom one is on the pilot is in the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.330 
the bottom one is on the pilot is in the
way<00:03:20.650> so<00:03:21.580> in<00:03:21.880> my<00:03:22.060> opinion<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:23.350> if<00:03:23.440> anybody<00:03:23.860> has

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
way so in my opinion and if anybody has

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.460 
way so in my opinion and if anybody has
the<00:03:24.370> better<00:03:24.670> way<00:03:24.880> please<00:03:25.150> let<00:03:25.330> me<00:03:25.450> know<00:03:25.600> but<00:03:26.350> in

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
the better way please let me know but in

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.949 
the better way please let me know but in
my<00:03:26.500> opinion<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:27.130> easiest<00:03:27.430> way<00:03:27.940> best<00:03:28.390> way<00:03:28.660> is

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
my opinion the easiest way best way is

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.170 
my opinion the easiest way best way is
to<00:03:29.020> pull<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.680> boiler<00:03:30.280> off<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.700> undercarriage

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
to pull the boiler off the undercarriage

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.690 
to pull the boiler off the undercarriage
and<00:03:32.020> I<00:03:32.140> think<00:03:32.380> it's<00:03:32.530> only<00:03:32.680> four<00:03:33.040> screws<00:03:33.430> could

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
and I think it's only four screws could

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.480 
and I think it's only four screws could
be<00:03:33.820> six<00:03:34.120> but<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.420> believe<00:03:34.630> it's<00:03:34.780> only<00:03:34.870> four<00:03:35.490> and

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
be six but I believe it's only four and

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.620 
be six but I believe it's only four and
then<00:03:36.670> you<00:03:36.790> have<00:03:37.050> an<00:03:38.050> EZ<00:03:39.150> then<00:03:40.150> it's<00:03:40.360> easy

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
then you have an EZ then it's easy

access<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.380> bottom<00:03:41.650> screw<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:44.320> in<00:03:44.530> my

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
access to the bottom screw and so in my

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.040 
access to the bottom screw and so in my
opinion<00:03:44.740> that's<00:03:45.130> way<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.370> go<00:03:45.690> also<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:46.930> guys

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050
