00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.490
Oh, sorry!
I was having too much fun

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.760
with camera glitches
for a moment there.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.709
Hello Internet, what's up.
My name is Joel,

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.610
and in today's video
I am going to explain

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.400
some things about
early Mega Man games.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.380
Quite a few people
have requested that

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.220
someone please explain
what exactly is happening

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.980
in the Mega Man 2 speedruns,
specifically in the Crashman and Woodman stages.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.520
So in today's video
I'll walk through

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.669
the basic understanding
of what happens

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.110
in those glitches.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.680
First, let's see
how the Item-1 works.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.480
We can see that
when the item is placed

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.680
under a ceiling,
the game prevents

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.330
the item from
pushing Mega Man

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.760
into the ceiling.
However,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.470
it's not like
the game actually checks

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.680
whether Mega Man is
near the ceiling.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.720
The Item simply disappears
when it gets closer

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.210
than a certain distance
to the ceiling.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.810
If there is no ceiling
above the Item,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.040
the game will not
prevent Mega Man himself

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.610
from being pushed
into the ceiling.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.399
When Mega Man is
inside the ceiling

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.060
or a wall,
and he faces left,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.790
without walking,
the game will

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.900
automatically push him
towards the right,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.250
in attempt to eject him
from inside the wall,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.250
in hopes that
he eventually emerges from somewhere.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.420
This ejection is called zipping.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.170
Next, let's see
what happens

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.700
in the Crashman stage.
This is me playing

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.750
the first section
of that stage

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.790
using mostly the
same techniques

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.700
as the TAS does.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.619
After the quite intentional death,
we are surprisingly

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.210
in the next section
of the map.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.280
That was all
pretty self-evident,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.659
wasn't it? Huh? Hmm.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.320
This is the map
of the first few rooms

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.350
of the stage,
created using my

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.259
state-of-art high-tech
illustration tools.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.650
It's all wrong!
This is not

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.650
the true map at all.
The reality of how

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.799
the levels are designed
looks more like this.

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.510
The screens are numbered
so that the first screen

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.029
is number one.
After one comes two,

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:18.370
after two comes three,
after three comes four,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.819
and so on.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.480
But how it really works
in the game

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.519
is more like this:
You've got screen #1,

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.939
screen #2, screen #3,
screen #4, and so on.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.680
You'll notice the screens
were in a pile now.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.599
This is because
the screens are

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.249
not really connected
in terms of directions at all,

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.519
other than what follows which.
The game presents you

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.389
an illusion
where screen 2 is above screen 1,

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.450
and screen 3 is above screen 2.
And screen number 4 comes here.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.549
This is only a half-truth.
The full truth is that

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.400
screen 2 is the next screen
from screen 1.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.889
The next screen can be above,
but it can also be on the right side, it could

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.620
even be below screen number 1.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.859
Screen number 3
could be on the

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.599
right side of screen number 2,
or it could be below...

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.139
or it could be above
screen number 2.

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.829
All three screens could
even be horizontally

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.689
in line like this.
The possibilities are numerous.

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.569
The only restriction is that screen
#1 must be followed by screen #2.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.449
You can never go from
screen #1 directly to screen #3.

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:33.449
It just doesn't work like that.
You must always go the screens in sequence.

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.180
Now let's re-watch
that Clashman stage

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.650
with these traits in mind.
On the left,

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.349
you can see
the original game;

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.669
on the right,
a hacked version

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.430
that follows Mega Man
and shows where he really is.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.089
When Mega Man is first
pushed into the ceiling,

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:53.010
the game ejects him
towards the right.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.829
What is on the right
from the right edge

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.829
of the screen?
It's the next screen.

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.979
So he gets ejected
into the next screen,

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:05.999
but the camera doesn't follow.
Mega Man is in an different room

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:08.729
than he appears.
But he can still interact

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:12.029
with the objects
from the previous room.

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:14.269
Next, comes the long walk
and the suicide.

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.359
As you can see
on the right,

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.139
Mega Man is really walking
on a steady ground

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.460
comprised from the floors
of a few successive screens.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.970
On screen 8
there is a checkpoint.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.620
Conveniently
on that same screen

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.880
there is a ladder leading down.
Since the screen is not

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.710
perfectly aligned horizontally,
climbing down that ladder

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.380
has the same effect
as falling into a pit.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.420
Mega Man dies.
Once he respawns,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:49.420
he starts from screen 8, because
that's where the checkpoint was.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.790
This little tutorial
should have now given you

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.260
the right starting points
to start exploring the game

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.120
yourself.
I am not going to explain

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.620
every single spot
in the various speedruns

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.680
of this game,
because most of the time

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.570
it's just the application
of this same technique

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.850
in different ways.
I urge you

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.130
to solve the puzzle yourself.
You have the tools now.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.150
Who knows,
maybe you're the next

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.630
rockstar speedrunner!
It has happened before.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.950
Thanks for watching!
See you in the next video.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.570
Bye!
