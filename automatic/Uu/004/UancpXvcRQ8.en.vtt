00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
even will this happen you need to go

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.390 
even will this happen you need to go
back<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.410> fundamentals<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:19.070> learn<00:03:19.220> how<00:03:19.310> to

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
back to fundamentals and learn how to

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.830 
back to fundamentals and learn how to
catch<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.820> learn<00:03:19.970> how<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.150> throw<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:20.510> learn

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
catch you learn how to throw you learn

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.230 
catch you learn how to throw you learn
how<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.960> tackle<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.620> seems<00:03:22.550> hard<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:22.940> you

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
how to tackle and it seems hard that you

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.370 
how to tackle and it seems hard that you
know<00:03:23.300> after<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.600> whole<00:03:23.810> training<00:03:24.020> camp<00:03:24.260> you

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
know after a whole training camp you

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.890 
know after a whole training camp you
don't<00:03:24.920> get<00:03:25.070> that<00:03:25.100> down<00:03:25.430> yeah<00:03:26.210> I<00:03:26.240> think<00:03:26.540> it's

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
don't get that down yeah I think it's

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.780 
don't get that down yeah I think it's
strictly<00:03:27.440> up<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.860> coaching<00:03:28.430> staff<00:03:28.460> I

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
strictly up the coaching staff I

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.010 
strictly up the coaching staff I
