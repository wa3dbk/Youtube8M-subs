00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi to all zoom this week on the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.899
 new renault space and the clio 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.480
 initial citroën c1 passes meanwhile 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.920
 in suv mode and our journalist at brice 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.849
 perrin makes us discover in 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.730
 exclusivity the concept of divine finally 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.730
 after twelve years of career the space iv 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.980
 gives way to the fifth generation 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.689
 enhanced ground clearance protection in 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.150
 plastic with small diffuser to 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.490
 the back and imposing wheel arches 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.730
 the new flagship of the diamond 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.450
 poster tunes of suv mail is it 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.370
 Actually 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.469
 we asked mathieu 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.719
 knight editor of the car 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.010
 legs so no the new space is 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.719
 clearly not a suv 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.820
 because he simply does not have the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.180
 attributes that defines this category of 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.969
 vehicles 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.730
 he does not have four wheel drive he did 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.860
 no protection of wheel arches 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.870
 contout suv and if he has a guard at 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.760
 ground a little bit elevated she is not 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.640
 as elevated as true subjects 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.079
 then the other detail that makes this 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.309
 vehicle belongs more to the world of 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.979
 minivans suv orders 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.380
 this is the alignment of the inclination of the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.850
 windshield with hood on a suv 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.409
 there is no alignment on a 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.700
 monospace these two elements are 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.900
 perfectly aligned 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.670
 so we can not say that new 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.070
 space either an elected is provided in 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.439
 concession next March the renault 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.780
 space 5 can board seven people 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.759
 on board you discover the cockpit 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.330
 with this vertical touch screen of 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.479
 nice size 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.369
 the head-up display or even 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.900
 digital instrumentation space 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.509
 also offers several moods 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.610
 luminous patience all the details 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.500
 will be revealed next month at 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.840
 the opening of the global automobile 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.700
 one thing is sure this new space does not 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.970
 so will not be present in the last 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.340
 number of self-journal escape 4.4 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.229
 currently in newsstands and who prefers 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.439
 focus especially on the duel at 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.509
 summit between the bmw x4 and the maca porch 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.549
 we continue with renault which showed 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.200
 by mistake and with a bit of advanced 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.299
 the high-end version of the clio 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.219
 christened initial paris she will be 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.579
 displayed from 21 thousand five hundred 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.829
 euros with the new e90 shield 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.170
 front chrome down the tailgate and everything 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.020
 around the side window leather upholstery 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.600
 with heated front seats features 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.060
 luxurious diesel clio will require 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.210
 count at least 23 1800 euros with the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.520
 dci engine 90 orders taking 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.590
 will start at the world where pass 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.450
 now at citroën which unveils the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.750
 concept it's an urban ride a 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.490
 suv version of the mini city car 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.020
 raised by 15 mm she receives 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.220
 black plastic protections while 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.650
 around the body 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.260
 the tracks have also been expanded from 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.330
 10 mm to accentuate the beefy side of 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.070
 this version on the global auto 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.770
 the chevron mark will install a 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.930
 terminal allowing the public to give 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.460
 opinion and to say whether or not they 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.460
 wish to see this c1 and follow 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.430
 passed in original series at the 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.630
 luxurious cousin of the world star 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.670
 will name divine 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.100
 our journalist brice perrin makes us 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.780
 exclusively the owner's tour 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.370
 as you can see the concept 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.230
 divine ds is really very very 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.710
 spectacular a very picked line 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.120
 very rabelais the forms very compact 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.700
 since the car only measures four 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.380
 doctors with fairly fluid lines 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.780
 quite sweet and at the same time a lot 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.670
 of chiseled elements quite aggressive like 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.530
 if it has too much viewfinder that extends the 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.879
 along the chrome jeans on the hood or 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.410
 still the optics at the back 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.019
 the telescope that replaced by 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.340
 moving parts then again these people 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.160
 chrome running all along the 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.950
 bodywork to finish on rims of 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.670
 20 inches very spectacular with 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.400
 floating branches 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.920
 the concept foreshadows the divine ds 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.420
 next ds4 and will be to discover more 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.019
 in detail in the next issue of 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.269
