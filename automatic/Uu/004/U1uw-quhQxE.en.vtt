00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you basically the AM pitch and wattage

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.760 
you basically the AM pitch and wattage
of<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.070> power<00:01:11.250> supply<00:01:11.580> which<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:11.939> also<00:01:12.240> nice

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
of this power supply which is also nice

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.980 
of this power supply which is also nice
now<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> power<00:01:14.280> cord<00:01:14.720> it's<00:01:15.720> pretty

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
now we have the power cord it's pretty

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.420 
now we have the power cord it's pretty
simple<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.470> mean<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.740> pretty<00:01:16.860> basic<00:01:17.040> it's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
simple I mean it's pretty basic it's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.679 
simple I mean it's pretty basic it's
something<00:01:17.610> at<00:01:17.670> 700<00:01:18.119> watt<00:01:18.240> though<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
something at 700 watt though so you

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.749 
something at 700 watt though so you
can't<00:01:18.840> expect<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.200> whole<00:01:19.320> lot<00:01:19.380> because<00:01:19.770> there's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
can't expect a whole lot because there's

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.399 
can't expect a whole lot because there's
much<00:01:21.000> better<00:01:21.270> out<00:01:21.479> there<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
much better out there but this is

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.469 
much better out there but this is
definitely<00:01:23.009> good<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> job

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
definitely good for the job

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.440 
definitely good for the job
it<00:01:24.869> has<00:01:25.259> four<00:01:25.590> screws<00:01:26.000> they're<00:01:27.000> still<00:01:27.240> there

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
is a heavy one I don't know wait how

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.249 
is a heavy one I don't know wait how
much<00:01:36.270> he<00:01:36.420> goes<00:01:36.540> where<00:01:36.689> they<00:01:36.780> got<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.049> say<00:01:37.140> it's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
much he goes where they got to say it's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.010 
much he goes where they got to say it's
probably<00:01:37.350> at<00:01:37.590> least<00:01:37.710> ten<00:01:37.979> pounds<00:01:38.780> if<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.869> put

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
probably at least ten pounds if I put

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.140 
probably at least ten pounds if I put
him<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.229> scale<00:01:40.670> probably<00:01:41.670> should<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:41.970> that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
him on a scale probably should do that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.670 
him on a scale probably should do that
later<00:01:42.329> once<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.020> is

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
later once it is

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.350 
later once it is
they<00:01:45.280> usually<00:01:45.430> don't<00:01:45.610> wrap<00:01:45.790> them<00:01:45.940> on<00:01:46.060> bubbles

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
they usually don't wrap them on bubbles

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.580 
they usually don't wrap them on bubbles
they<00:01:46.480> usually<00:01:46.600> have<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:46.840> different<00:01:47.110> kind<00:01:47.560> of

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
they usually have a different kind of

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.170 
they usually have a different kind of
packaging<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:48.280> they<00:01:48.370> must<00:01:48.520> be<00:01:48.640> going<00:01:48.790> with<00:01:49.120> a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
packaging so they must be going with a

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.750 
packaging so they must be going with a
different<00:01:49.300> package<00:01:49.600> snow<00:01:51.960> already<00:01:53.760> looks

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
different package snow already looks

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.610 
different package snow already looks
pretty<00:01:54.940> nice<00:01:55.120> here<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:55.810> we've<00:01:56.350> got<00:01:56.410> the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
pretty nice here and we've got the

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.580 
pretty nice here and we've got the
Silverstone<00:01:56.920> fan<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:58.540> kind<00:01:58.750> of<00:01:58.870> off<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.530> the

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
Silverstone fan it's kind of off to the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.870 
Silverstone fan it's kind of off to the
side<00:01:59.680> it's<00:02:00.070> kind<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.310> different<00:02:00.460> because

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
side it's kind of different because

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.090 
side it's kind of different because
usually<00:02:01.060> they're<00:02:02.050> in<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.440> middle<00:02:02.710> or<00:02:02.950> this

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
usually they're in the middle or this

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.680 
usually they're in the middle or this
one's<00:02:03.280> not<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:03.490> Center<00:02:04.000> as<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.360> is<00:02:04.479> over<00:02:04.600> here

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
one's not so Center as it is over here

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.510 
one's not so Center as it is over here
which<00:02:05.140> is<00:02:05.170> kind<00:02:05.470> of<00:02:05.590> cool<00:02:05.800> for<00:02:06.040> a<00:02:06.220> change

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
which is kind of cool for a change

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.620 
which is kind of cool for a change
because<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.850> mean<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.060> doesn't<00:02:07.210> have<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.540> be

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
because I mean it doesn't have to be

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.169 
because I mean it doesn't have to be
Center<00:02:07.930> it's<00:02:08.830> got<00:02:09.100> soap<00:02:09.399> stone<00:02:09.610> stick<00:02:10.090> around

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.140 
Center it's got soap stone stick around
the<00:02:10.360> side<00:02:11.130> it's<00:02:12.130> got<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.400> backplate<00:02:12.880> it's

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
the side it's got the backplate it's

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.449 
the side it's got the backplate it's
pretty<00:02:13.390> heavy

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
pretty heavy

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.890 
pretty heavy
and<00:02:15.459> then<00:02:15.580> just<00:02:15.970> that's<00:02:16.300> about<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:16.690> mean

anybody<00:02:26.440> uses<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.800> really<00:02:27.040> anymore<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.550> mean

that's about it you get the power on
switch<00:02:29.709> it's<00:02:30.430> pretty<00:02:30.670> nice-looking<00:02:31.030> power

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
switch it's pretty nice-looking power

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.110 
switch it's pretty nice-looking power
