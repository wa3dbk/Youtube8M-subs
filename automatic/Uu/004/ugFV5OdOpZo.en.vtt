Hey there!

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.228
Today I gonna make homemade Malibu liqueur.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.628
I took this recipe from American forums

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.800
and suprisingly, here's used not a fresh meat of coconut, but its flakes.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.971
You need half a liter of vodka or stretched till 40% ABV alcohol

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.714
160 g of coconut flakes

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.800
Fill up the jar with flakes and alcohol

00:00:52.742 --> 00:00:56.000
Cover the jar, leave in the dark place for 7 days

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.142
and shake it everyday.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.885
After 10 days it's time to filter it.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.628
I'll use 2 layered cheese cloth.

00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:20.685
I've got about 400 Ml of coconut infusion.

00:01:20.742 --> 00:01:23.542
There are 2 variants of this recipe:

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.942
first is to add here sugar syrup,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.371
and coconut milk for getting its ABV about 20% like real Malibu,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.085
the second one is to add condensed milk.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.600
it's the simplest method.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.771
Let's try to add here a canful of condensed milk

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.028
so we'll figure out how will it be

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:05.314
To get about 800 Ml I added here a bit water and vanilla sugar

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.000
so the expected potency should be about 20% ABV.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
cover it

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.228
mixing it well

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.600
and leave in the fridge for about 4 days

00:02:21.657 --> 00:02:28.685
After 4 days in the fridge, here you can see the layer of coconut fat

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.142
Now I'll elutriate the liquid into another jar

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.600
leaving the fat in the previous jar

00:02:40.057 --> 00:02:44.171
Let it be assumed I've separated fat from liqueur

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.771
the rest of the fat is on the bottom and wallside of the jar

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.942
Then cover it and leave for 7 days at the room temperature

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.857
let the taste get settled down

00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:02.971
After 7 days I elutriate the liqueur through the siphon pipe.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.800
so that the fat gravitates to the bottom and wallside

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:18.571
Let's test our Malibu

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.257
Putting the fact to the side, that original Malibu needs rum instead of vodka,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.685
coconut milk instead of flake,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.857
and of course without condensed milk, so

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.600
in general it's like Malibu,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.714
to be honest it's milk and coconut liqueur.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.742
Well, to the smell...

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.428
you can slightly feel coconut flavour

00:03:46.114 --> 00:03:49.828
very nice smell

00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:56.228
sufficiently sweet

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.371
the taste is nice

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.114
it's hard enough

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.714
it could be stretched

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:12.857
7 days of infusing did a power of good to it

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:20.457
Despite the taste is nice, I'd like to leave it for another 7 days for infusing

00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:26.057
but the smell is very nice

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.050
delicious!

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.571
Yeah, it must be better infused because of being a bit hard

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.914
but in general it's very tasty.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.428
so, let it be our homemade Malibu!

00:04:48.514 --> 00:04:54.971
though that it must be clear, it's like original Malibu to the taste and smell

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.114
