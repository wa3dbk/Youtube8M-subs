this gun is absolutely amazing I tried

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.030 
this gun is absolutely amazing I tried
using<00:01:28.479> it<00:01:28.690> in<00:01:28.810> other<00:01:28.960> game<00:01:29.229> modes<00:01:29.440> like<00:01:29.680> hard

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
using it in other game modes like hard

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.899 
using it in other game modes like hard
point<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.640> domination<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.710> it<00:01:33.190> ran<00:01:33.700> out<00:01:33.880> of

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
point and domination but it ran out of

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.840 
point and domination but it ran out of
ammo<00:01:34.360> so<00:01:34.870> fast<00:01:35.229> and<00:01:35.620> that's<00:01:36.430> another<00:01:36.760> reason

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
ammo so fast and that's another reason

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.940 
ammo so fast and that's another reason
why<00:01:37.090> I<00:01:37.180> like<00:01:37.360> team<00:01:37.570> deathmatch<00:01:37.960> is<00:01:38.290> that<00:01:38.530> the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
why I like team deathmatch is that the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.210 
why I like team deathmatch is that the
game<00:01:39.190> does<00:01:39.460> not<00:01:39.700> last<00:01:40.210> too<00:01:40.659> long<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:41.260> if

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
game does not last too long and if

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.190 
game does not last too long and if
you're<00:01:42.490> really<00:01:42.700> good<00:01:42.970> at<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.690> might<00:01:43.990> be

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
you're really good at it you might be

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.980

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
just it was just terrible but um the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
just it was just terrible but um the
MSMC<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:13.120> really<00:02:14.120> accurate<00:02:14.720> by<00:02:14.900> constant<00:02:15.319> at<00:02:15.769> a

MSMC is really accurate by constant at a
short<00:02:16.190> range<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.760> Fred<00:02:17.209> long-range<00:02:17.840> kills<00:02:18.140> I

short range and Fred long-range kills I

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.059 
short range and Fred long-range kills I
I<00:02:19.610> guess<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.239> is<00:02:20.450> but<00:02:21.380> there's<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:21.680> certain

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
I guess it is but there's just certain

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.190 
I guess it is but there's just certain

up those packages on the ground for your
scavenger<00:03:02.959> i<00:03:03.470> recommend<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.370> use

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
scavenger i recommend that you use

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.580 
scavenger i recommend that you use
scavenge<00:03:05.150> because<00:03:05.480> man<00:03:05.780> Demi<00:03:06.140> run<00:03:06.440> out<00:03:06.560> of

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
scavenge because man Demi run out of

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.160 
scavenge because man Demi run out of
bullets<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.130> fast<00:03:07.519> we're<00:03:08.269> doing<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:08.959> many

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
bullets so fast we're doing so many

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.190 
bullets so fast we're doing so many
bullets<00:03:09.380> on<00:03:09.680> one<00:03:10.069> person<00:03:10.579> now<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.209> MSMC<00:03:11.690> feels

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
bullets on one person now the MSMC feels

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.199 
bullets on one person now the MSMC feels
great<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:13.370> hold<00:03:13.489> in<00:03:13.670> your<00:03:13.700> hand<00:03:14.000> it's

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
great to hold in your hand it's

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.440 
great to hold in your hand it's
lightweight<00:03:14.650> it's<00:03:15.650> it's<00:03:16.130> easy<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.790> use<00:03:16.819> and

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
lightweight it's it's easy to use and

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.780 
lightweight it's it's easy to use and
it's<00:03:18.170> probably<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.590> most<00:03:18.769> stereotypical<00:03:19.100> gun

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
it's probably the most stereotypical gun

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.020 
it's probably the most stereotypical gun
I<00:03:20.139> mean<00:03:21.139> uh<00:03:21.290> not<00:03:21.739> stereotypical<00:03:22.430> how<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.730> most

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
I mean uh not stereotypical how the most

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.069 
I mean uh not stereotypical how the most
overused<00:03:23.739> SMG<00:03:24.739> in<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.880> game<00:03:26.090> besides<00:03:26.930> a

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
overused SMG in the game besides a

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.390 
overused SMG in the game besides a
scorpion<00:03:27.620> evo<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.579> PDW<00:03:29.239> see<00:03:30.019> if<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:31.040> fire

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
scorpion evo and the PDW see if I fire

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.640 
scorpion evo and the PDW see if I fire
rings<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.299> other<00:03:32.480> guns<00:03:32.810> aren't<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.380> same

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
rings of the other guns aren't the same

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.250 
rings of the other guns aren't the same
with<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.609> MSMC<00:03:35.030> I'm<00:03:35.269> i<00:03:35.450> think<00:03:35.690> name<00:03:35.900> is<00:03:36.079> some

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
with the MSMC I'm i think name is some

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.650 
with the MSMC I'm i think name is some
see<00:03:36.470> probably<00:03:36.709> as<00:03:37.220> for<00:03:37.639> widow<00:03:37.819> and<00:03:38.120> lower<00:03:38.239> fire

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
see probably as for widow and lower fire

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.860 
see probably as for widow and lower fire
rate<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.829> know<00:03:40.060> compared<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:41.389> with<00:03:41.569> every

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.620 
other marimba every other SMG in the air
it<00:03:45.799> probably<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.400> one<00:03:46.760> of<00:03:46.850> my<00:03:47.000> favorites

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
it probably is one of my favorites

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.160 
it probably is one of my favorites
though<00:03:47.840> because<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.130> just<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:49.940> clean<00:03:50.870> as

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
though because it is just so clean as

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.319 
though because it is just so clean as
you<00:03:51.200> CD<00:03:51.560> that<00:03:51.829> was<00:03:51.980> my<00:03:52.100> terrible<00:03:52.790> death<00:03:53.060> that<00:03:53.299> I

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
you CD that was my terrible death that I

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:53.820 
you CD that was my terrible death that I
had

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
had

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.960 
had
maybe<00:03:54.460> not<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.090> mad<00:03:55.300> but<00:03:56.170> um<00:03:56.430> it's<00:03:57.430> just<00:03:57.550> so

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
maybe not so mad but um it's just so

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.990 
maybe not so mad but um it's just so
clean<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:59.200> just<00:03:59.440> feels<00:03:59.710> it<00:04:00.100> just<00:04:00.730> feels

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
clean and it just feels it just feels

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.820 
clean and it just feels it just feels
like<00:04:01.150> you're<00:04:01.750> untouchable<00:04:02.230> when<00:04:02.680> you're
