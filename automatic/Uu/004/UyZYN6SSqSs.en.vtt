00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
rare to put in a breast implant for a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.820 
rare to put in a breast implant for a
breast<00:01:54.000> reduction<00:01:54.150> some<00:01:54.960> surgeons<00:01:55.410> do<00:01:55.620> that

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
breast reduction some surgeons do that

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.530 
breast reduction some surgeons do that
but<00:01:56.010> that<00:01:56.190> is<00:01:56.370> like<00:01:56.580> one<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.910> a<00:01:57.000> thousand<00:01:57.510> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
but that is like one in a thousand and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.740 
but that is like one in a thousand and
that<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.200> not<00:01:58.410> be<00:01:58.650> appropriate<00:01:59.000> plus<00:02:00.000> no<00:02:00.300> no

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that would not be appropriate plus no no

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.480 
that would not be appropriate plus no no
no<00:02:01.170> insurance<00:02:01.350> company<00:02:02.010> is<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.280> pay<00:02:02.460> for

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
no insurance company is going to pay for

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.340 
no insurance company is going to pay for
that<00:02:02.700> one<00:02:02.970> but<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.690> beauty<00:02:03.930> isn't<00:02:04.050> he<00:02:04.229> already

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
that one but the beauty isn't he already

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.990 
that one but the beauty isn't he already
said<00:02:04.650> it<00:02:04.800> in<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:04.979> last<00:02:05.190> segment<00:02:05.370> when<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:05.760> do

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
said it in the last segment when we do

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.370 
said it in the last segment when we do
these<00:02:06.180> breast<00:02:06.510> reduction<00:02:06.900> techniques<00:02:07.229> we're

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
these breast reduction techniques we're

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.590 
these breast reduction techniques we're
removing<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:08.130> significant<00:02:09.030> amount<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.450> those

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
removing a significant amount of those

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.300 
removing a significant amount of those
that<00:02:10.020> heavy<00:02:10.320> breast<00:02:10.649> tissue<00:02:10.860> right

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that heavy breast tissue right

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.330 
that heavy breast tissue right
I<00:02:11.340> mean<00:02:11.970> sometimes<00:02:12.240> up<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.380> in<00:02:13.740> really<00:02:14.160> large

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
I mean sometimes up to in really large

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.780 
I mean sometimes up to in really large
patients<00:02:15.300> four<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.780> five<00:02:15.990> pounds<00:02:16.290> per<00:02:17.100> side

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
patients four to five pounds per side

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.910 
patients four to five pounds per side
which<00:02:18.209> may<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.690> significant<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.740> weight

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
which may be significant and the weight

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.350 
which may be significant and the weight
difference<00:02:20.250> between<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.850> breast<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.270> an

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
difference between the breast and an

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.610 
difference between the breast and an
implant<00:02:21.690> although<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:21.989> haven't<00:02:22.170> looked<00:02:22.410> at<00:02:22.590> a

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
implant although I haven't looked at a

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.410 
implant although I haven't looked at a
study<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.220> don't<00:02:23.370> think<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.760> significantly

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
study I don't think a significantly

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.000 
study I don't think a significantly
different<00:02:24.480> especially<00:02:24.900> with<00:02:25.320> silicone<00:02:25.770> I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
different especially with silicone I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.340 
different especially with silicone I
agree<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.430> would<00:02:26.730> be<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.360> think<00:02:27.690> an<00:02:27.959> uncommon

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
agree that would be I think an uncommon

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.830 
agree that would be I think an uncommon
and<00:02:28.739> common<00:02:29.220> thing<00:02:29.400> that's<00:02:29.670> probably<00:02:30.450> seldom

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
and common thing that's probably seldom

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.900 
and common thing that's probably seldom
done<00:02:31.020> yeah<00:02:31.410> okay<00:02:32.070> that's<00:02:32.310> great<00:02:32.459> let's<00:02:32.730> take<00:02:32.880> a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
done yeah okay that's great let's take a

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.870 
done yeah okay that's great let's take a
look<00:02:33.120> at<00:02:33.239> our<00:02:33.330> second<00:02:33.690> question<00:02:34.050> okay<00:02:34.880> I've

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
look at our second question okay I've

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.850 
look at our second question okay I've
heard<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.690> breast<00:02:36.989> reduction<00:02:37.140> might<00:02:37.680> make

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
heard that a breast reduction might make

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.610 
heard that a breast reduction might make
my<00:02:38.010> breasts<00:02:38.310> look<00:02:38.400> square<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.230> result

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
my breasts look square is that a result

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.380 
my breasts look square is that a result
of<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.830> particular<00:02:41.100> technique<00:02:41.790> or<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.150> it

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
of a particular technique or is it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.460 
of a particular technique or is it
something<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.780> should<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:43.020> concerned<00:02:43.380> about

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
something I should be concerned about

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.970 
something I should be concerned about
regardless<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.459> procedure<00:02:44.820> that's<00:02:45.030> used

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
regardless of the procedure that's used

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.830 
regardless of the procedure that's used
so<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.489> squarest<00:02:47.940> looking<00:02:48.390> breast<00:02:48.630> what

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
so the the squarest looking breast what

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.060 
so the the squarest looking breast what
do<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.989> think<00:02:49.140> yeah<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.590> mean<00:02:49.860> that's

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
do you think yeah I mean that's

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.500 
do you think yeah I mean that's
something<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.520> want<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.790> avoid<00:02:50.970> if<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.300> can

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
something you want to avoid if you can

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.000 
something you want to avoid if you can
but<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.750> happens<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.440> me<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.590> think<00:02:52.920> it

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
but that happens to me I think it

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.920 
but that happens to me I think it
happens<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.489> everybody<00:02:53.700> but<00:02:54.090> basically<00:02:54.720> you

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
happens to everybody but basically you

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.780 
happens to everybody but basically you
know<00:02:55.049> in<00:02:55.140> nature<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.560> natural<00:02:56.190> breast<00:02:56.489> is

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
know in nature a natural breast is

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.180 
know in nature a natural breast is
Roundy<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.410> don't<00:02:58.560> want<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.890> square

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
Roundy and so you don't want the square

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.890 
Roundy and so you don't want the square
look<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.549> little<00:02:59.700> bit<00:02:59.910> of<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.150> comes<00:03:00.420> back<00:03:00.510> to

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
look a little bit of that comes back to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.020 
look a little bit of that comes back to
what<00:03:01.049> your<00:03:01.260> initial<00:03:01.440> Anatomy<00:03:02.130> was<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.610> I

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
what your initial Anatomy was and I

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.340 
what your initial Anatomy was and I
think<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.390> know<00:03:03.510> again<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.930> goes<00:03:04.049> back<00:03:04.110> to

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
think you know again it goes back to

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.259 
think you know again it goes back to
this<00:03:04.590> isn't<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> cosmetic<00:03:05.489> procedure<00:03:05.640> but<00:03:06.209> we

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
this isn't a cosmetic procedure but we

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.910 
this isn't a cosmetic procedure but we
want<00:03:06.570> it<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.690> look<00:03:06.959> good<00:03:07.110> anyway<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:07.860> a

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
want it to look good anyway but it's a

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.130 
want it to look good anyway but it's a
procedure<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.549> relieve<00:03:08.670> pain<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.150> suffering

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
procedure to relieve pain and suffering

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.170 
procedure to relieve pain and suffering
but<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.500> would<00:03:10.769> say<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> Boxey<00:03:11.519> breast<00:03:11.790> as<00:03:12.030> we

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180
