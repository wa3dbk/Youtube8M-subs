thing I've got to to look at in this
batch<00:00:34.649> I've<00:00:34.980> got<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.370> fat<00:00:35.579> sandwich<00:00:36.030> which<00:00:36.239> is

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
batch I've got the fat sandwich which is

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.950 
batch I've got the fat sandwich which is
this<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.350> I've<00:00:37.500> got<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.160> angry<00:00:39.090> troll<00:00:39.390> or

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
this one and I've got the angry troll or

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.190 
this one and I've got the angry troll or
angry<00:00:40.500> troll<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:41.399> you're<00:00:41.550> from<00:00:41.760> America<00:00:43.219> and

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
angry troll if you're from America and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.639 
angry troll if you're from America and
these<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.440> two<00:00:46.680> different<00:00:46.980> takes<00:00:47.190> on

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
these are two different takes on

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.619 
these are two different takes on
distortion<00:00:49.850> they<00:00:50.850> call<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.210> harmonic

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
distortion they call it a harmonic

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.340 
distortion they call it a harmonic
saturator

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
saturator

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.310 
saturator
it's<00:00:54.110> it's<00:00:55.110> good<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.590> them<00:00:56.809> for<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:57.930> kinds<00:00:58.260> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it's it's good for them for all kinds of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.180 
it's it's good for them for all kinds of
purposes<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:59.129> the<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:01.020> level<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.920> control

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
purposes really the the level of control

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.780 
purposes really the the level of control
over<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.670> tone<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.120> pretty<00:01:03.780> impressive<00:01:04.790> on

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
over the tone is pretty impressive on

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.750 
over the tone is pretty impressive on
the<00:01:06.390> front<00:01:06.689> panel<00:01:07.020> you've<00:01:07.290> got<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> away

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the front panel you've got on the away

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.399 
the front panel you've got on the away
in<00:01:08.939> you've<00:01:09.119> got<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> distortion<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> gain

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
in you've got a distortion or a gain

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.090 
in you've got a distortion or a gain
stage<00:01:11.270> then<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.619> three<00:01:13.619> different<00:01:13.740> tone

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
stage then you have three different tone

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.469 
stage then you have three different tone
controls<00:01:14.490> you've<00:01:14.640> got<00:01:14.729> tone<00:01:15.030> control<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
controls you've got tone control in the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.840 
controls you've got tone control in the
middle<00:01:15.799> you've<00:01:16.799> also<00:01:16.920> got<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> resonance<00:01:17.640> which

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
middle you've also got a resonance which

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.940 
middle you've also got a resonance which
controls<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> bottom<00:01:18.630> end<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.350> thick<00:01:19.619> sort

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
controls the bottom end the thick sort

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.850 
controls the bottom end the thick sort

of suit peace sabe low-end stuff which

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.560 
of suit peace sabe low-end stuff which
is<00:01:23.009> great<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.520> sort<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.850> pumping<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.390> all

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
is great for sort of pumping that up all

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.390 
is great for sort of pumping that up all
rolling<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.990> off<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.470> want<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.189> cut

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
rolling it off if you want it to cut

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.340 
rolling it off if you want it to cut
through<00:01:26.659> you've<00:01:27.659> also<00:01:27.780> got<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> presence

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
through you've also got a presence

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.950 
through you've also got a presence
control<00:01:28.799> which<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.310> obviously<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.450> sort

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
control which is obviously the the sort

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
control which is obviously the the sort
of<00:01:31.049> higher<00:01:31.229> end<00:01:31.970> sort<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.560> 10k<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.009> above<00:01:35.310> 12<00:01:35.759> K

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
and above something like that and then

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
and above something like that and then
you've<00:01:38.460> got<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> tone<00:01:38.820> control<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> middle

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you've got a tone control in the middle

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.760 
you've got a tone control in the middle
which<00:01:40.020> kind<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:41.659> dependent<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:43.290> these

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
which kind of is dependent on on these

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.990 
which kind of is dependent on on these
two<00:01:44.299> controls<00:01:45.740> as<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> does<00:01:50.000> there's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
two controls as to what it does there's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.899 
two controls as to what it does there's
also<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.619> small<00:01:52.619> amount<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.920> gain<00:01:53.159> involved<00:01:53.729> on

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
also a small amount of gain involved on

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.690 
also a small amount of gain involved on
this<00:01:54.299> resonance<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.960> presence<00:01:55.259> control

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
this resonance and presence control

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.859 
this resonance and presence control
you'll<00:01:56.700> get<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.969> see<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.450> bit<00:01:57.659> when

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
you'll get to see that in a bit when

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.590 
you'll get to see that in a bit when
shortly<00:01:58.680> when<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.030> start<00:02:00.030> showing<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.360> some<00:02:00.420> of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
shortly when I start showing you some of

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.080 
shortly when I start showing you some of
the<00:02:00.719> houses<00:02:01.110> they<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.439> come<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.680> with

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
the houses they can come out with

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.960 
the houses they can come out with
interestingly<00:02:03.590> in<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.369> instruction<00:02:06.180> manual

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
interestingly in the instruction manual

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.620 
interestingly in the instruction manual
there's<00:02:08.970> also

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
there's also

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.160 
there's also
it<00:02:11.630> tells<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.830> inside<00:02:13.340> there's<00:02:13.700> also

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
it tells you the inside there's also

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.530 
it tells you the inside there's also
three<00:02:15.170> other<00:02:15.200> internal<00:02:16.100> pots<00:02:16.700> trimpots

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
three other internal pots trimpots

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.600 
three other internal pots trimpots
on<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.140> circuit<00:02:18.530> board<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.310> can<00:02:19.460> access

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
on the circuit board that you can access

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.540 
on the circuit board that you can access
by<00:02:19.960> whipping<00:02:20.960> off<00:02:21.260> these<00:02:21.590> four<00:02:22.070> rubber<00:02:22.250> feet

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
by whipping off these four rubber feet

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.260 
by whipping off these four rubber feet
and<00:02:22.790> getting<00:02:23.270> involved<00:02:23.630> inside<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:25.150> as<00:02:26.150> you

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
and getting involved inside and as you

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.970 
and getting involved inside and as you
can<00:02:26.360> see<00:02:26.420> there<00:02:26.750> you've<00:02:26.960> got<00:02:26.990> got<00:02:27.530> these<00:02:27.710> three

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
can see there you've got got these three

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.490 
can see there you've got got these three
other<00:02:28.070> trim<00:02:28.340> trim<00:02:28.730> pots<00:02:29.110> one<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.260> them<00:02:30.350> is

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
other trim trim pots one of them is

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.800 
other trim trim pots one of them is
called<00:02:30.740> a<00:02:30.920> curve<00:02:31.190> control<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.060> that's<00:02:32.630> for

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
called a curve control and that's for

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.070 
called a curve control and that's for
fine<00:02:33.020> tuning<00:02:33.050> corner<00:02:33.830> frequencies

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
fine tuning corner frequencies

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.270 
fine tuning corner frequencies
whatever<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.140> means<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.770> first<00:02:37.040> stage

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
whatever that means of the first stage

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.320 
whatever that means of the first stage
of<00:02:37.430> distortion<00:02:38.200> there's<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.260> highs<00:02:40.330> control

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
of distortion there's a highs control

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.670 
of distortion there's a highs control
which<00:02:41.570> tweaks<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.900> high<00:02:42.050> end<00:02:42.260> between<00:02:42.590> the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
which tweaks the high end between the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.890 
which tweaks the high end between the
two<00:02:42.830> drive<00:02:43.160> stages<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.880> there's<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.570> drive

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
two drive stages and there's a drive

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.480 
two drive stages and there's a drive
which<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.320> just<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.650> gain<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.160> second

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
which is just the gain of the second

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.310 
which is just the gain of the second
stage<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.030> second<00:02:47.480> stage<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.810> distortion

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
stage is the second stage of distortion

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.040 
stage is the second stage of distortion
so<00:02:48.920> if<00:02:49.490> you<00:02:49.820> want<00:02:50.030> any<00:02:50.270> more<00:02:50.660> than<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:50.930> actually

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
so if you want any more than it actually

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.260 
so if you want any more than it actually
Gibbs<00:02:51.560> I<00:02:51.740> think<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.430> think<00:02:52.940> if<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.150> go

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
Gibbs I think it I think if you go

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.120 
Gibbs I think it I think if you go
inside<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.870> start<00:02:54.080> tweak<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.530> up<00:02:54.650> you'll<00:02:54.980> get

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
inside and start tweak it up you'll get

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.640 
inside and start tweak it up you'll get
to<00:02:55.580> you'll<00:02:56.330> get<00:02:56.480> even<00:02:56.600> more<00:02:56.870> gain<00:02:57.140> out<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.500> it

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
to you'll get even more gain out of it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.270 
to you'll get even more gain out of it
and<00:02:57.860> even<00:02:58.070> more<00:02:58.340> sort<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:58.670> tone<00:02:58.940> control

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
and even more sort of tone control

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.320 
and even more sort of tone control
anyway<00:03:01.280> let's<00:03:01.460> give<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.730> whirl<00:03:01.760> see<00:03:02.120> what<00:03:02.240> it

anyway let's give it a whirl see what it

00:03:02.330 --> 00:05:29.980 
anyway let's give it a whirl see what it
sounds<00:03:02.450> like
