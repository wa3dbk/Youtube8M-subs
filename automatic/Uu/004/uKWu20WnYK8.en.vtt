00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.450
 urr 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.490
 friends I sincerely congratulate you that 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.769
 our torment was over and we gave it 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.210
 we will not see the game of our team like this 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.889
 you can say forehead I decided to start 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.379
 no review release from a friendly match 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.300
 between national teams of Russia and Kazakhstan and 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.340
 all those who have sustainable 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.470
 psyche, I suggest to see what 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.019
 interesting was this tense 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.369
 the heat of the match on the field football players did not come out 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.289
 alone with children 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.360
 and children since we have the end of March 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.430
 negative weather came out in caps 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.450
 but not in simple but in football caps 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.850
 club Khimki 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 he find such a club remember remember but 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.930
 This is the one from where a wide zenith bought from 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.789
 I have only one question where did it come from 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.590
 These caps as an option children do not 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.000
 only hardcore fans but Khimki 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.620
 according to him it is hard to believe 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.180
 the second option is peculiar 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.010
 marketing move to at least somehow 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.390
 sell and how many caps by unofficial 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.600
 according to kinky football club 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.649
 fail because of them 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.690
 telling when Khimki came out 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.699
 premier league club management recalling 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.350
 For example, the real and Barcelona decided 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.450
 earn on club paraphernalia and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.820
 a two millionth party of such caps 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.590
 went on sale well, except for 22 caps 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.840
 who forcibly bought football players 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.340
 Khimki more was not sold and because 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.540
 only 1 million left to sell 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.939
 nine hundred ninety nine thousand 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.890
 nine hundred and seventy eight caps then and 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.659
 This marketing move was chosen 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.820
 but it seems to me that such a marketing 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.890
 the move was more promising the caps needed 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.100
 advertise not to children but more famous 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.100
 personalities 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.720
 but the most interesting thing is that with the eyes 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.729
 the boy is not got a cap and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.409
 t-shirts with no racism this 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.409
 the picture will come out even more funny 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.430
 let's go directly to the match 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.380
 I repeat once again that nervous 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.450
 people and pregnant women are better off 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.700
 watch I will show only the best 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.409
 moments of the match so to speak highlights a to 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.539
 these moments will add words 2 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.960
 visionaries who commented on this 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.850
 the game 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.799
 let's go all the more far to go 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.020
 because already at 16 seconds 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.110
 there was such an episode or only we 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.720
 find out what are the consequences of what 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.610
 happened then the eighth year as 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.590
 Russian team in status 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.989
 teams preparing pride precisely our 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.450
 the team is the best among all 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.350
 teams that are now ranked third 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.350
 place in the group you 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.430
 you are probably the thing is that 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.230
 format allows the favorite not very 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.770
 strain and some meetings 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.130
 conduct exactly the experimental 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.050
 maybe here it is true our team is up 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.270
 so far the favorite is just the format allows 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.920
 relax a bit and we are already here 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.830
 We worry that with such a game, our team 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.750
 quietly will not come to the euro guys 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.030
 format allows you to relax a bit 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.310
 This is the moment when two Kazakhs do what 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.140
 want how much fighting approaches and 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.850
 Kazakhstan so can be very dangerous 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.390
 get sanic penalty area team 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.270
 Russia 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.790
 but if it wasn't for Vasya, the Berezutsky plan would 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.470
 could come up with something more serious 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.300
 by the way after this episode vasin tired 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.770
 and he left the field and we continue 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.430
 watch the most exciting moments 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.920
 games 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.400
 Ours starts the output of the Sameds transmission 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.290
 does not move forward until jubi 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.730
 Islam Khan's words another interception but 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.360
 immediately losing the ball 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.850
 Alexey Kozlov 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.360
 gives it the team itself will be so 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.690
 so well organized 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.730
 and berezovsky exchanged glances with 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.620
 Alexei goat wow wow you what 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.360
 the moment they are pleasant and sighs yuri 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.600
 Lodygin outside the penalty fights 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.600
 and 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.040
 here is a simple friend situation i can 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.080
 remember that the national team has never 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.490
 the Soviet Union was called the queen 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.100
 friendly matches 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.470
 maybe the other way around will be with this 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.870
 specifically the composition of the Russian national team in 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.790
 Friendly play not so hot as 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.650
 we are trying to start a draw 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.190
 results but in the official everything will be 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.190
 much better 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.370
 that's how we play friends you know when 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.020
 I'm preparing this issue for the second time 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.930
 reconsidered the match and just plain 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.490
 fell asleep three times but nevertheless I am somewhere 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.740
 on my hard drive save this 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.959
 match for the future because when i have 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.060
 there will be children and suddenly one of the evenings to me 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.010
 will be too lazy to read a story, I just turn on 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.110
 this match and in a minute my baby 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.910
 will sleep sweetly i notice that name 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.830
 Our team Stalin theme as they were 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.990
 before the date, yes, we also do not always 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.360
 won before there were shameful games 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.040
 it was necessary somehow all live in a different way 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.950
 banal advertising on billboards was different 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.750
 what used to be all alex and vodka 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.760
 and from five different brands and 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.320
 It turns out vodka for the fans because 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.150
 that without her it was impossible to watch 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.650

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.660
 wretched baltic 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.620
 therefore, there are no people stands but across the field 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.160
 run and patents 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.510
