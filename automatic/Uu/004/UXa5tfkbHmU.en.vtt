00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.860 

so<00:00:56.340> yeah<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.520> really<00:00:59.940> don't<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.660> halo

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
for a recount helmet just because it

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.890 
for a recount helmet just because it
doesn't<00:01:05.549> look<00:01:05.790> very<00:01:06.260> recounting<00:01:07.760> like<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
doesn't look very recounting like on the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.960 
doesn't look very recounting like on the
one<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> game<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.100> supposed<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
one in the game it's supposed to be and

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.390 
one in the game it's supposed to be and
with<00:01:12.930> one<00:01:13.170> inhale<00:01:13.439> forward<00:01:13.860> line<00:01:14.010> picture<00:01:14.369> i

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
with one inhale forward line picture i

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.160 
with one inhale forward line picture i
saw<00:01:14.670> supposed<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.900> more<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:18.170> but

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
saw supposed to be more like that but

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.310 
saw supposed to be more like that but
like<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:20.700> dimensions<00:01:21.210> jump<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.990> don't<00:01:22.140> make

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
like the dimensions jump just don't make

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.050 
like the dimensions jump just don't make
sense<00:01:22.380> when<00:01:22.890> yall<00:01:23.040> may<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:23.490> picture<00:01:23.939> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
sense when yall may have one picture to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.490 
sense when yall may have one picture to
work<00:01:24.270> off<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:25.159> for<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.610> an<00:01:26.880> angle<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.780> why

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
work off of for like an angle that's why

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.289 
work off of for like an angle that's why
i<00:01:28.530> couldn't<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> tracker<00:01:29.400> how<00:01:29.670> much<00:01:29.850> which
