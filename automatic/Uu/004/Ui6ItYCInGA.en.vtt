so<00:02:01.190> I've<00:02:01.310> always<00:02:01.490> admired<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:02.150> phrase<00:02:02.420> drive

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
it like you stole it and while I was a

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.780 
it like you stole it and while I was a
kid<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:05.900> I<00:02:05.930> watched<00:02:06.170> old<00:02:06.560> car<00:02:06.920> chase<00:02:07.250> movies

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
kid and I watched old car chase movies

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.520 
kid and I watched old car chase movies
where<00:02:08.000> someone<00:02:08.450> was<00:02:08.630> stealing<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:09.140> car<00:02:09.350> or

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
where someone was stealing a car or

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.500 
where someone was stealing a car or
something<00:02:09.800> of<00:02:10.040> that<00:02:10.070> nature<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:11.360> always

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
something of that nature it always

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.940 
something of that nature it always
seemed<00:02:11.900> like<00:02:12.140> they<00:02:12.320> were<00:02:12.380> sticking<00:02:12.860> a

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
seemed like they were sticking a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.160 
seemed like they were sticking a
screwdriver<00:02:13.490> or<00:02:13.790> something<00:02:14.240> into<00:02:15.080> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
screwdriver or something into the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.240 
screwdriver or something into the
ignition<00:02:15.440> switch<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:17.680> my<00:02:18.680> thought<00:02:18.980> what

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
ignition switch so my thought what

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.540 
ignition switch so my thought what
better<00:02:19.460> than<00:02:19.820> to<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:21.410> know<00:02:21.530> kind<00:02:21.860> of<00:02:21.980> take<00:02:22.400> an

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
better than to you know kind of take an

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.580 
better than to you know kind of take an
old<00:02:22.700> screwdriver<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.690> hook<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.930> key<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.380> it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
old screwdriver and hook the key to it

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.280 
old screwdriver and hook the key to it
and<00:02:24.820> stick<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:25.850> in<00:02:26.090> your<00:02:26.360> ignition<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:27.140> it's

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
and stick that in your ignition and it's

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.050 
and stick that in your ignition and it's
kind<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.710> kind<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.220> like<00:02:28.340> you're<00:02:28.520> stealing<00:02:28.820> it

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
kind of kind of like you're stealing it

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.970 
kind of kind of like you're stealing it
all<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.330> time<00:02:29.600> or<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.440> know<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.590> don't<00:02:30.710> know<00:02:30.950> I

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
all the time or you know I don't know I

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.190 
all the time or you know I don't know I
just<00:02:31.130> thought<00:02:31.460> it'd<00:02:31.550> be<00:02:31.610> kind<00:02:31.820> of<00:02:31.940> neat<00:02:32.200> so

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
just thought it'd be kind of neat so

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.380 
just thought it'd be kind of neat so
what<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.160> went<00:02:34.310> ahead<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.580> did<00:02:34.820> is<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.030> took

what I went ahead and did is just took
an<00:02:35.510> old<00:02:35.630> screwdriver<00:02:36.020> here<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:37.880> had

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
an old screwdriver here that I had

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.260 
an old screwdriver here that I had
broken<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.630> tip<00:02:38.840> off<00:02:39.020> of<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.970> went<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.060> had

a key made for my truck ignition and
then<00:02:45.490> what<00:02:46.490> I<00:02:46.520> did<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:47.060> sawed<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:49.460> end

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
of the screwdriver off and then I sawed

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.520 
of the screwdriver off and then I sawed
a<00:02:54.230> notch<00:02:54.680> into<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:56.120> screwdriver<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.320> did

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
a notch into the screwdriver and I did

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.740 
a notch into the screwdriver and I did
this<00:02:57.680> all<00:02:57.920> with<00:02:58.220> just<00:02:58.520> you<00:02:59.239> know<00:02:59.330> your<00:02:59.510> basic

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
this all with just you know your basic

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.320 
this all with just you know your basic
metal<00:03:00.350> saw<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.420> then<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.950> sawed<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.150> match

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
metal saw and then I sawed it to match

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.449 
metal saw and then I sawed it to match
the<00:03:05.360> diameter<00:03:06.140> or<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.709> width<00:03:06.950> of<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.250> key

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
the diameter or the width of the key

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.100 
the diameter or the width of the key
there<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.910> then<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.090> slid<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.450> key<00:03:08.780> into<00:03:09.080> the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
there and then I slid the key into the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.820 
there and then I slid the key into the
slot<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.860> was<00:03:09.980> nice<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.250> snug<00:03:10.820> fit<00:03:11.209> and

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
slot so it was nice and snug fit and

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.770 
slot so it was nice and snug fit and
then<00:03:12.830> you<00:03:13.370> know<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.489> did<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:13.910> because<00:03:14.450> you

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
then you know I did this because you

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.100 
then you know I did this because you
know<00:03:15.380> for<00:03:15.709> one<00:03:16.000> with<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.150> being<00:03:17.420> in<00:03:17.570> that<00:03:17.750> slot

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
know for one with it being in that slot

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.920 
know for one with it being in that slot
there's<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.590> lot<00:03:18.830> more<00:03:19.040> stability<00:03:19.520> than<00:03:19.940> if<00:03:20.780> I

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
there's a lot more stability than if I

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.970 
there's a lot more stability than if I
just<00:03:21.140> tried<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.440> weld<00:03:21.830> or<00:03:22.130> braze<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:23.690> the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
just tried to weld or braze it to the

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.350 
just tried to weld or braze it to the
screwdriver<00:03:24.980> itself<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.820> really<00:03:26.090> can't

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
screwdriver itself and you really can't

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.960 
screwdriver itself and you really can't
weld<00:03:26.630> pressed<00:03:27.790> metal<00:03:28.790> there<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:30.730> anyway<00:03:31.730> once

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
weld pressed metal there so anyway once

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.570 
weld pressed metal there so anyway once
I<00:03:32.120> got<00:03:32.300> that<00:03:32.450> slot<00:03:32.900> in<00:03:33.110> there<00:03:33.290> I<00:03:33.530> went<00:03:34.489> ahead

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
I got that slot in there I went ahead

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.470 
I got that slot in there I went ahead
and<00:03:34.820> just<00:03:36.580> dropped<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.700> tack<00:03:37.970> wall<00:03:38.270> on<00:03:38.450> either

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
and just dropped a tack wall on either

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.170 
and just dropped a tack wall on either
side<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:38.930> screwdriver<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.739> eventually<00:03:40.370> tack

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
side of screwdriver and eventually tack

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.530 
side of screwdriver and eventually tack
welded<00:03:41.630> over<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:42.110> key<00:03:42.500> on<00:03:43.430> both<00:03:43.970> ends<00:03:44.420> it's

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
welded over the key on both ends it's

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.530 
welded over the key on both ends it's
kind<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:44.810> ugly<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.560> I<00:03:45.590> hope<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.220> rusts<00:03:47.180> up<00:03:47.360> a

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
kind of ugly so I hope it rusts up a

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.710 
kind of ugly so I hope it rusts up a
little<00:03:47.750> bit<00:03:48.019> but<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.850> know<00:03:49.970> anyone<00:03:50.330> could<00:03:50.540> do

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
little bit but you know anyone could do

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.860 
little bit but you know anyone could do
this<00:03:50.870> with<00:03:51.110> like<00:03:51.290> jb<00:03:51.709> weld<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.540> could<00:03:53.540> see<00:03:53.720> also

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
this with like jb weld I could see also

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.560 
this with like jb weld I could see also
do<00:03:54.170> another<00:03:54.440> there's<00:03:54.769> something<00:03:55.160> called

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
do another there's something called

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.240 
do another there's something called
quick<00:03:56.570> steel<00:03:57.019> that<00:03:57.440> you<00:03:57.590> could<00:03:57.740> put<00:03:57.920> over<00:03:58.040> and

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
quick steel that you could put over and

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.059 
quick steel that you could put over and
it<00:03:58.310> probably<00:03:58.580> even<00:03:58.850> be<00:03:59.060> better<00:03:59.270> than

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
it probably even be better than

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.710 
it probably even be better than
so<00:04:01.069> anyway<00:04:01.459> I<00:04:01.489> dropped<00:04:01.819> the<00:04:01.939> weld<00:04:02.150> then<00:04:02.420> I<00:04:02.510> went

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
so anyway I dropped the weld then I went

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.780 
so anyway I dropped the weld then I went
and<00:04:02.870> I<00:04:03.049> filed<00:04:03.439> down<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:03.950> weld<00:04:04.159> so<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.610> looks

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
and I filed down the weld so it looks

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.649 
and I filed down the weld so it looks
you<00:04:05.480> know<00:04:05.510> acceptable<00:04:06.170> but<00:04:06.500> still<00:04:07.489> rough<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:08.629> I

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
you know acceptable but still rough so I

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.750 
you know acceptable but still rough so I
think<00:04:09.140> I<00:04:09.349> think<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:09.860> roughness<00:04:10.280> is<00:04:10.430> kind<00:04:10.700> of

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
think I think the roughness is kind of

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.220 
think I think the roughness is kind of
neat<00:04:10.939> but<00:04:11.209> right<00:04:11.540> now<00:04:11.689> I<00:04:11.720> got<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:11.930> screwdriver

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
neat but right now I got a screwdriver

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.470 
neat but right now I got a screwdriver
line<00:04:12.650> sticking<00:04:13.069> my<00:04:13.220> ignition<00:04:14.000> switch<00:04:14.269> and

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
line sticking my ignition switch and

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.140 
line sticking my ignition switch and
turn<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.160> literally<00:04:16.160> make<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.430> look<00:04:16.639> like<00:04:16.820> I'm

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
turn and literally make it look like I'm

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.199 
turn and literally make it look like I'm
driving<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:17.870> like<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.169> stole<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.650> so<00:04:19.209> anyway

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
driving it like I stole it so anyway

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.999 
driving it like I stole it so anyway
pretty<00:04:20.660> much<00:04:20.900> there<00:04:21.199> you<00:04:21.289> go<00:04:21.470> that's<00:04:21.709> how<00:04:21.949> you

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.009 
pretty much there you go that's how you

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.510 
pretty much there you go that's how you
can<00:04:22.750> make<00:04:23.750> this<00:04:24.020> item<00:04:24.470> with<00:04:24.650> basic<00:04:25.130> hand<00:04:25.370> tools

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520

and<00:04:25.940> again<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:26.210> welded<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:26.930> but<00:04:27.139> you<00:04:27.289> could<00:04:27.470> use

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
and again I welded it but you could use

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.980 
and again I welded it but you could use
quick<00:04:28.039> steal<00:04:28.310> or<00:04:28.490> jb<00:04:28.820> weld<00:04:29.120> as<00:04:29.389> long<00:04:29.570> as<00:04:29.750> you

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
quick steal or jb weld as long as you

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.920 
quick steal or jb weld as long as you
get<00:04:30.889> that<00:04:31.070> slot<00:04:31.490> in<00:04:31.759> there<00:04:32.000> like<00:04:32.449> he's<00:04:32.690> not

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
get that slot in there like he's not

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.040 
get that slot in there like he's not
really<00:04:33.199> going<00:04:33.440> anywhere<00:04:33.919> in<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:35.690> extra

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
really going anywhere in the the extra

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.379 
really going anywhere in the the extra
bonding<00:04:36.500> agent<00:04:36.919> would<00:04:37.039> just<00:04:37.250> be<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.610> help<00:04:38.210> it

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
bonding agent would just be to help it

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.770 
bonding agent would just be to help it
from<00:04:38.570> moving<00:04:39.380> around<00:04:39.620> but<00:04:40.039> you<00:04:40.130> should<00:04:40.780> slot

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
from moving around but you should slot

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.060 
from moving around but you should slot
it<00:04:41.960> out<00:04:42.080> so<00:04:42.320> you<00:04:42.380> have<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.500> nice<00:04:42.710> snug<00:04:42.919> fit

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070

neat<00:04:47.210> kind<00:04:48.080> of<00:04:48.139> an<00:04:48.199> idea<00:04:48.620> of<00:04:50.229> something<00:04:51.229> to<00:04:51.470> do

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
neat kind of an idea of something to do
