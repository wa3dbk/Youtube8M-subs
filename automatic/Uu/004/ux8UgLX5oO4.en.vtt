00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
commercial buildings so they have a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.920 
commercial buildings so they have a
pretty<00:00:51.480> substantial<00:00:51.720> penalty<00:00:52.440> there<00:00:53.930> now

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
pretty substantial penalty there now

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.740 
pretty substantial penalty there now
looking<00:00:55.260> specifically<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.280> Sparta<00:00:56.670> we'll<00:00:57.660> go

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
looking specifically at Sparta we'll go

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.410 
looking specifically at Sparta we'll go
ahead<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.020> look<00:00:58.140> at<00:00:58.290> their<00:00:59.180> diplomatics<00:01:00.180> I

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
ahead and look at their diplomatics I

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.120 
ahead and look at their diplomatics I
think<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.810> going<00:01:01.080> on<00:01:01.170> they<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.740> pretty<00:01:02.010> good

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
think I going on they have pretty good

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.410 
think I going on they have pretty good
relations<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.550> Athens<00:01:02.850> even<00:01:03.300> though<00:01:03.360> it

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
relations with Athens even though it

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.030 
relations with Athens even though it
doesn't<00:01:03.540> show<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.930> they're<00:01:04.470> already<00:01:04.650> at<00:01:04.799> war

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
doesn't show it they're already at war

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.539 
doesn't show it they're already at war
with<00:01:05.220> Epirus<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.770> they<00:01:07.770> also<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
with Epirus and then they also have a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.910 
with Epirus and then they also have a
defensive<00:01:09.150> alliance<00:01:09.510> with<00:01:09.660> makedonia<00:01:10.170> so

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
defensive alliance with makedonia so

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.860 
defensive alliance with makedonia so
that's<00:01:11.310> definitely<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:12.000> benefit<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:12.660> again

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
that's definitely a benefit but again

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.990 
that's definitely a benefit but again
makedonia<00:01:13.620> can't<00:01:13.950> really<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.400> trusted<00:01:14.550> from

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
makedonia can't really be trusted from

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.990 
makedonia can't really be trusted from
the<00:01:15.180> eyes<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.660> Sparta<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:19.830> looking<00:01:20.820> at<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the eyes of Sparta so looking at the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.450 
the eyes of Sparta so looking at the
Spartan<00:01:21.240> army<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.080> obviously<00:01:22.740> if<00:01:23.130> you're

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
Spartan army this is obviously if you're

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.950

playing<00:01:23.730> Sparta<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.450> already<00:01:24.780> know<00:01:24.930> about

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
playing Sparta you already know about

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.310 
playing Sparta you already know about
the<00:01:25.290> Spartan<00:01:25.560> army<00:01:25.820> but<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.600> should<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> noted

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the Spartan army but it should be noted

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.430 
the Spartan army but it should be noted
at<00:01:28.470> least<00:01:28.620> in<00:01:28.830> general<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.330> view<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:30.720> the

at least in general what we view as the
Spartan<00:01:32.040> units<00:01:32.400> themselves<00:01:32.930> they<00:01:34.490> they<00:01:35.490> can't

which<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.790> already<00:02:06.030> impressive<00:02:06.570> considering

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
which is already impressive considering

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.509 
which is already impressive considering
that<00:02:07.290> you're<00:02:07.470> probably<00:02:07.650> your<00:02:07.860> best<00:02:08.039> version

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
that you're probably your best version

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.149 
that you're probably your best version
of<00:02:08.549> these<00:02:09.090> guys<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.629> 70<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.470> these<00:02:10.709> hoplites

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
of these guys is 70 on these hoplites

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.890 
of these guys is 70 on these hoplites
and<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.670> can<00:02:11.819> tell<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.030> for<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.239> fact<00:02:12.269> that<00:02:12.599> on

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and I can tell you for a fact that on

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.309 
and I can tell you for a fact that on
ones<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:13.650> pontus<00:02:14.579> or<00:02:14.849> in<00:02:15.840> Mecca

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
ones like pontus or in Mecca

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.250 
ones like pontus or in Mecca
those<00:02:16.739> are<00:02:16.890> only<00:02:17.099> 50<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> armor<00:02:19.140> is

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
those are only 50 so the armor is

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.289 
those are only 50 so the armor is
substantially<00:02:20.010> higher<00:02:20.219> here<00:02:21.120> they're

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
substantially higher here they're

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.330 
substantially higher here they're
definitely<00:02:21.420> gonna<00:02:21.659> be<00:02:21.780> more<00:02:22.219> defensive<00:02:23.219> kind

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
definitely gonna be more defensive kind

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.459 
definitely gonna be more defensive kind
of<00:02:23.489> guys<00:02:23.609> but<00:02:23.969> again<00:02:24.329> they<00:02:24.840> don't<00:02:24.959> have<00:02:25.049> a

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
of guys but again they don't have a

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.679 
of guys but again they don't have a
whole<00:02:25.859> lot<00:02:25.890> Calvary<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.609> mean<00:02:27.000> they<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.569> get

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
whole lot Calvary I mean they can get

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.059 
whole lot Calvary I mean they can get
Calvary<00:02:27.989> from<00:02:28.170> your<00:02:28.260> mercenary<00:02:28.620> units<00:02:28.890> here

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
Calvary from your mercenary units here

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.800 
Calvary from your mercenary units here
but<00:02:29.519> again<00:02:29.609> these<00:02:30.030> are<00:02:30.090> mercenary<00:02:30.569> units

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
but again these are mercenary units

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.910 
but again these are mercenary units
they're<00:02:30.930> not<00:02:31.140> going<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.319> be<00:02:31.500> something<00:02:31.709> that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
they're not going to be something that

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.670 
they're not going to be something that
are<00:02:32.010> gonna<00:02:32.159> hold<00:02:33.120> up<00:02:33.390> entirely<00:02:33.989> well<00:02:34.379> when<00:02:34.590> it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
are gonna hold up entirely well when it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.449 
are gonna hold up entirely well when it
comes<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:36.230> prices<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.560> even<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.920> more<00:02:38.099> route

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
comes to prices and even a more route

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.289 
comes to prices and even a more route
cuz<00:02:38.549> they're<00:02:38.670> not<00:02:38.760> gonna<00:02:38.849> want<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.120> sacrifice

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
cuz they're not gonna want to sacrifice

themselves as well as your own troops

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.699 
themselves as well as your own troops

have four small objectives control two
powers<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.239> very<00:02:48.420> typical<00:02:48.780> for<00:02:49.739> it's<00:02:49.889> an

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
powers is very typical for it's an

these are your ultimate goals we have
140<00:03:17.790> settlements<00:03:18.299> maintain<00:03:18.629> 180<00:03:19.200> units<00:03:19.409> and

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
140 settlements maintain 180 units and

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.920 
140 settlements maintain 180 units and
Congress<00:03:20.669> in<00:03:20.790> certain<00:03:21.060> areas<00:03:21.389> I<00:03:21.419> think<00:03:21.510> this

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
Congress in certain areas I think this

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.569 
Congress in certain areas I think this
is<00:03:22.109> pretty<00:03:22.590> standard<00:03:23.040> what<00:03:23.340> you'd<00:03:23.459> expect

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
is pretty standard what you'd expect

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.159 
is pretty standard what you'd expect
from<00:03:24.060> basically<00:03:24.659> land<00:03:25.109> troop<00:03:25.970> faction<00:03:26.989> as<00:03:27.989> an

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
from basically land troop faction as an

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.020 
from basically land troop faction as an
economic<00:03:28.650> victory<00:03:28.799> not<00:03:29.220> exactly<00:03:29.819> their

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
economic victory not exactly their

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.780 
economic victory not exactly their
strong<00:03:30.299> suit<00:03:30.569> can<00:03:30.840> but<00:03:31.799> maintains<00:03:32.190> 70<00:03:32.549> units

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
strong suit can but maintains 70 units

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.890 
strong suit can but maintains 70 units
that's<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.030> little<00:03:33.239> bit<00:03:33.359> higher<00:03:33.479> than<00:03:33.659> most<00:03:33.750> of

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
that's a little bit higher than most of

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.059 
that's a little bit higher than most of
the<00:03:33.959> ones<00:03:34.079> again<00:03:34.349> because<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.739> fact<00:03:34.949> that

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
the ones again because of the fact that

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.210 
the ones again because of the fact that
they<00:03:35.400> are<00:03:35.579> more<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.060> military<00:03:36.680> faction<00:03:37.680> the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
they are more of a military faction the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.780 
they are more of a military faction the
80<00:03:38.970> income<00:03:39.540> they<00:03:39.930> only<00:03:40.139> have<00:03:40.319> to<00:03:40.409> worry<00:03:40.590> about

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
80 income they only have to worry about

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.550 
80 income they only have to worry about
the<00:03:41.790> rest<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.120> pretty<00:03:42.150> generic<00:03:42.750> 90

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
the rest is pretty generic 90

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.490 
the rest is pretty generic 90
settlements<00:03:44.299> that's<00:03:45.299> kind<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:45.959> high<00:03:46.109> as<00:03:46.169> well

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
settlements that's kind of high as well
