more<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.560> fight<00:02:13.739> depends<00:02:14.160> then<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.400> what

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
more of the fight depends then on what

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.370 
more of the fight depends then on what
Cotto<00:02:14.790> does<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.299> opposed<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:16.019> think<00:02:16.200> it's

Cotto does as opposed to I think it's

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.710 
Cotto does as opposed to I think it's
code<00:02:16.590> words<00:02:16.769> flight<00:02:16.920> delay<00:02:17.190> yeah<00:02:17.569> look<00:02:18.569> like

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
the six inches in reach are they going

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.890 
the six inches in reach are they going
to<00:03:35.849> play<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.000> big<00:03:36.180> advantage<00:03:36.450> even<00:03:36.720> though

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
to play a big advantage even though

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.420 
to play a big advantage even though
margarito<00:03:37.319> tends<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.829> fight<00:03:37.980> on<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.159> inside

quite<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.640> bit<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:38.939> don't<00:03:39.810> think<00:03:39.959> they<00:03:40.049> make<00:03:40.200> as

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
quite a bit I don't think they make as

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.050 
quite a bit I don't think they make as
much<00:03:40.500> advantage<00:03:40.890> as<00:03:41.189> everyone<00:03:41.549> makes<00:03:41.760> him<00:03:41.939> out

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
much advantage as everyone makes him out

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.740 
much advantage as everyone makes him out
to<00:03:42.090> be<00:03:43.519> not<00:03:44.519> only<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:45.000> fact<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.299> he<00:03:45.390> fights

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
to be not only the fact that he fights

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.949 
to be not only the fact that he fights
better<00:03:45.930> inside<00:03:46.409> mm-hmm<00:03:47.540> he<00:03:48.540> just<00:03:48.689> wants<00:03:48.900> to
