already<00:01:54.090> ordered<00:01:54.330> new<00:01:54.750> headlights<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.320> I

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
already ordered new headlights so I

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.969 
already ordered new headlights so I
don't<00:01:55.500> really<00:01:55.590> care<00:01:55.890> about<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.160> bulbs<00:01:56.550> but

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
don't really care about the bulbs but

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.320 
don't really care about the bulbs but
that's<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.430> whole<00:01:59.580> headlight<00:01:59.940> assembly

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
that's it the whole headlight assembly

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.070 
that's it the whole headlight assembly
comes<00:02:00.510> off<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.570> said<00:02:06.720> I'll<00:02:06.810> take<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
comes off and like I said I'll take the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.740 
comes off and like I said I'll take the
side<00:02:07.619> marker<00:02:07.950> lights<00:02:08.280> off<00:02:08.490> I'll<00:02:09.450> pull<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
side marker lights off I'll pull the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.330 
side marker lights off I'll pull the
bumper<00:02:10.140> cover<00:02:10.290> off<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:10.920> we'll<00:02:11.040> see<00:02:11.250> what

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
bumper cover off and then we'll see what

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.729 
bumper cover off and then we'll see what
we<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.910> get<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:13.290> remains<00:02:13.620> of

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
we have to do to get that the remains of

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.280 
we have to do to get that the remains of
that<00:02:13.860> header<00:02:14.070> panel<00:02:14.340> out<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.730> there<00:02:15.230> yeah<00:02:16.230> you

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
that header panel out of there yeah you

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.540 
that header panel out of there yeah you
guys<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.830> do<00:02:16.890> some<00:02:17.160> hillbilly

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
guys think I do some hillbilly

guys think I do some hillbilly
engineering<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.180> what<00:02:18.450> was<00:02:18.600> passing<00:02:19.050> for

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
engineering this is what was passing for

sheet metal screws and then the top for
support<00:02:34.110> was<00:02:34.640> what<00:02:35.640> appears<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.030> be<00:02:36.180> the

shoestring out of one of the children's
tennis<00:02:38.220> shoes<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:41.150> will<00:02:42.150> give<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.540> little

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
tennis shoes I will give it a little

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.199 
tennis shoes I will give it a little
more<00:02:43.190> care<00:02:44.190> than<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.549> before<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.850> turn<00:02:45.060> it

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
more care than that before I turn it

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.990 
more care than that before I turn it
over<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.390> my<00:02:45.570> daughter<00:02:46.459> whose<00:02:47.459> marker<00:02:47.790> lights

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
over to my daughter whose marker lights

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.539 
over to my daughter whose marker lights
actually<00:02:48.209> come<00:02:48.510> off<00:02:48.630> pretty<00:02:48.810> easy<00:02:49.080> that

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
actually come off pretty easy that

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.270 
actually come off pretty easy that
thought<00:02:50.549> that'd<00:02:50.700> be<00:02:50.820> more<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.120> problem<00:02:51.360> but

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
thought that'd be more of a problem but

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.440 
thought that'd be more of a problem but
if<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.370> get<00:02:53.580> my<00:02:53.700> camera<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.120> right<00:02:54.180> place

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
if I get my camera in the right place

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.710 
if I get my camera in the right place
right<00:02:54.750> down<00:02:54.959> there<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> 7/16<00:02:56.190> bolt<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.790> got<00:02:57.690> a

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
right down there is a 7/16 bolt I got a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.620 
right down there is a 7/16 bolt I got a
long<00:02:57.930> extension<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:59.269> holding<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:00.390> side

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
long extension on it holding this side

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.020 
long extension on it holding this side
of<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.840> on<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.250> then<00:03:02.250> right<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.610> corner<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.000> a

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
of it on and then right the corner is a

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.690 
of it on and then right the corner is a
p2<00:03:03.690> Phillips<00:03:04.110> screw<00:03:04.440> take<00:03:05.250> those<00:03:05.459> two<00:03:05.670> things

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
p2 Phillips screw take those two things

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.560 
p2 Phillips screw take those two things
off<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.150> it

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
off of it

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.319 
off of it
marker<00:03:07.049> light<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:07.380> peels<00:03:07.620> right<00:03:07.709> away<00:03:08.329> this

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
marker light just peels right away this

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.490 
marker light just peels right away this
bumper<00:03:09.600> cover<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.900> going<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.079> come<00:03:10.230> off<00:03:10.320> here

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
bumper cover is going to come off here

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.990 
bumper cover is going to come off here
pretty<00:03:10.709> easy<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.250> has<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.430> trick<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.910> it

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
pretty easy but it has a trick to it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.360 
pretty easy but it has a trick to it
that<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.239> need<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.540> know<00:03:13.070> there<00:03:14.070> were<00:03:14.160> just

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
that you need to know there were just

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.800 
that you need to know there were just
three<00:03:14.700> uh<00:03:15.380> three<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.500> these<00:03:16.560> little<00:03:16.829> body<00:03:17.040> pins

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
three uh three of these little body pins

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.680 
three uh three of these little body pins
all<00:03:18.810> met<00:03:19.170> in<00:03:19.200> there<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:20.220> there<00:03:20.910> was<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.299> think

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
all met in there and there was a I think

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.770 
all met in there and there was a I think
that's<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:22.730> 5/32<00:03:23.750> 5/16<00:03:24.860> bolt<00:03:25.860> holding<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.340> there

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
that's a 5/32 5/16 bolt holding it there

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.569 
that's a 5/32 5/16 bolt holding it there
there<00:03:27.780> was<00:03:27.900> another<00:03:28.110> bolt<00:03:28.440> right<00:03:28.890> here<00:03:28.950> on<00:03:29.459> the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
there was another bolt right here on the

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.640 
there was another bolt right here on the
left<00:03:29.790> side<00:03:29.970> of<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.209> license<00:03:30.750> plate<00:03:31.110> holder

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
left side of the license plate holder

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.130 
left side of the license plate holder
and<00:03:32.070> I'm<00:03:32.970> pretty<00:03:33.299> sure<00:03:33.540> there's<00:03:33.720> supposed<00:03:34.079> to

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
and I'm pretty sure there's supposed to

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.990 
and I'm pretty sure there's supposed to
be<00:03:34.200> one<00:03:34.410> on<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.560> right<00:03:34.829> too<00:03:35.100> there<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.430> not<00:03:35.730> so

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
be one on the right too there is not so

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.250 
be one on the right too there is not so
I'm<00:03:36.060> guessing<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.480> was<00:03:36.690> lost<00:03:36.900> than<00:03:37.200> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
I'm guessing that was lost than the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.610 
I'm guessing that was lost than the
damaged<00:03:38.989> same<00:03:39.989> thing<00:03:40.200> on<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.410> other<00:03:40.440> side

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
damaged same thing on the other side

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.030 
damaged same thing on the other side
three<00:03:41.579> of<00:03:41.700> these<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.900> then<00:03:43.350> there<00:03:43.500> was<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.650> bolt

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
three of these and then there was a bolt

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.660 
three of these and then there was a bolt
right<00:03:45.709> here

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
right here

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.120 
right here
where<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.820> side<00:03:49.450> markers<00:03:49.870> came<00:03:50.110> out<00:03:50.320> but<00:03:50.980> then

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
where the side markers came out but then

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.280 
where the side markers came out but then
there's<00:03:51.310> also<00:03:51.550> a<00:03:51.910> hidden<00:03:52.390> one<00:03:52.570> down<00:03:52.870> in<00:03:53.080> there

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
there's also a hidden one down in there

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.100 
there's also a hidden one down in there
that<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.650> have<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:53.980> access<00:03:54.690> it's<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.900> same

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
that you have to access it's the same

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.710 
that you have to access it's the same
size<00:03:56.350> as<00:03:56.410> all<00:03:56.740> the<00:03:56.860> other<00:03:56.980> ones<00:03:57.570> but<00:03:58.570> it's

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
size as all the other ones but it's

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.830 
size as all the other ones but it's
right<00:03:59.140> back<00:03:59.530> here<00:03:59.610> and<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:01.360> have<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.690> access

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
right back here and you have to access

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.600 
right back here and you have to access
it<00:04:02.320> by<00:04:02.440> putting<00:04:02.770> an<00:04:02.860> extension<00:04:03.010> on<00:04:03.550> your

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
socket and putting it up through the

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.150 
socket and putting it up through the
little<00:04:06.130> access<00:04:06.610> hole<00:04:06.850> inside<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.390> wheel<00:04:07.720> well

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.150 
it's going to come out but you got to
know<00:04:10.540> it's<00:04:10.690> there<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.200> you<00:04:11.260> got<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.770> on<00:04:11.860> to<00:04:12.040> get

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.060 
know it's there and you got it on to get
it<00:04:12.190> out<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.490> there<00:04:12.610> it's<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.850> little<00:04:13.090> flummoxed

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
little tabs that have to go inside a

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.280 
little tabs that have to go inside a
couple<00:05:27.700> of<00:05:27.790> mounting<00:05:28.150> holes<00:05:28.390> in<00:05:28.690> that<00:05:28.990> fender

couple of mounting holes in that fender

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.690 
couple of mounting holes in that fender
and<00:05:32.290> I<00:05:32.440> mean<00:05:32.620> this<00:05:32.710> thing<00:05:32.919> doesn't<00:05:33.220> Bend<00:05:33.490> at

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
and I mean this thing doesn't Bend at

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.010 
and I mean this thing doesn't Bend at
all<00:05:33.820> so<00:05:34.060> you've<00:05:34.180> got<00:05:34.330> to<00:05:34.450> deflect<00:05:34.780> these

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
all so you've got to deflect these

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.810 
all so you've got to deflect these
fenders<00:05:35.470> outward<00:05:35.890> so<00:05:36.070> you<00:05:36.220> can<00:05:36.400> get<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.640> thing

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
fenders outward so you can get the thing

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.820 
fenders outward so you can get the thing
on<00:05:36.970> there<00:05:37.260> we'll<00:05:38.260> see<00:05:38.410> how<00:05:38.500> that<00:05:38.650> works

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
on there we'll see how that works

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.260 
on there we'll see how that works
