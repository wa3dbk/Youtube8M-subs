00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
a fuel tap I don't know anything about

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.759 
a fuel tap I don't know anything about
this<00:00:52.309> haven't<00:00:53.309> even<00:00:53.400> pulled<00:00:53.729> called<00:00:54.239> yet

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
this haven't even pulled called yet

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.640 
this haven't even pulled called yet
let's<00:00:55.769> check<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.220> oil<00:00:58.280> it's<00:00:59.280> about<00:00:59.369> dipstick

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
let's check the oil it's about dipstick

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.289 
let's check the oil it's about dipstick
still<00:01:01.650> got<00:01:01.799> a<00:01:01.860> bit<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.220> model<00:01:02.519> code<00:01:02.729> left<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
still got a bit of a model code left I

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.760 
still got a bit of a model code left I
couldn't<00:01:04.199> find<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> bagger<00:01:06.410> that's<00:01:07.410> got

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
couldn't find the bagger that's got

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.100 
couldn't find the bagger that's got
plenty<00:01:07.980> of<00:01:08.130> oil<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:12.090> fuel<00:01:12.360> tanks<00:01:12.660> falling<00:01:13.020> off

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
plenty of oil the fuel tanks falling off

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.630 
plenty of oil the fuel tanks falling off
and<00:01:13.230> I<00:01:13.290> don't<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.590> any<00:01:13.710> fuel<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.580> I

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and I don't have any fuel for it so I

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
and I don't have any fuel for it so I
don't<00:01:14.820> know<00:01:14.910> if<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.060> runs<00:01:15.270> or<00:01:15.510> not<00:01:15.660> I<00:01:15.870> can't

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
don't know if it runs or not I can't

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.430 
don't know if it runs or not I can't
really<00:01:16.680> test<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.100> out<00:01:17.190> I<00:01:17.900> know<00:01:18.900> nothing<00:01:19.200> about

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
really test it out I know nothing about

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.440 
really test it out I know nothing about
this<00:01:19.710> engine<00:01:20.130> yet<00:01:21.260> so<00:01:22.260> when<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:23.360> now<00:01:24.360> bone<00:01:24.960> dry

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
this engine yet so when do now bone dry

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.690 
this engine yet so when do now bone dry
it's<00:01:27.450> fallen<00:01:27.780> off<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.550> tank<00:01:31.340> law<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.550> it's

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
it's fallen off the tank law and it's

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.880 
it's fallen off the tank law and it's
got<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:32.940> of<00:01:32.970> those<00:01:36.110> ones<00:01:37.110> that's<00:01:37.320> impossible

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
got one of those ones that's impossible

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.970 
got one of those ones that's impossible
spread<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.840> think<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:39.990> either<00:01:40.230> a<00:01:41.000> honda<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
spread I think it's either a honda or a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.060 
spread I think it's either a honda or a
to<00:01:43.980> come<00:01:44.370> sir<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.630> know<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.900> is<00:01:46.170> well<00:01:46.770> over

a chinese honda club or to come sir so

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.240 
a chinese honda club or to come sir so
can<00:01:50.580> you<00:01:51.409> say<00:01:52.409> if<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.120> is<00:01:54.390> oh<00:01:55.190> come<00:01:56.190> on

can you say if you know it is oh come on
come<00:01:56.659> this<00:01:57.659> isn't<00:01:57.960> possible<00:01:58.110> spread<00:01:58.470> system

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
come this isn't possible spread system

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.840 
come this isn't possible spread system
okay<00:02:00.300> I<00:02:00.330> got<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.780> fuel<00:02:01.530> cap<00:02:01.740> wheel<00:02:02.310> cap<00:02:02.640> back

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
okay I got the fuel cap wheel cap back

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.910 
okay I got the fuel cap wheel cap back
on<00:02:03.620> it's<00:02:04.620> got<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:04.980> safety<00:02:05.370> bar<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:06.080> got<00:02:07.080> ya<00:02:07.380> back

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
on it's got a safety bar I got ya back

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.450 
on it's got a safety bar I got ya back
on<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.600> well<00:02:09.600> somewhat<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.320> need<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.740> spend<00:02:11.340> at

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
on so well somewhat I need to spend at

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.900 
on so well somewhat I need to spend at
that<00:02:11.610> sort<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.090> rot<00:02:12.300> or<00:02:12.480> control<00:02:12.840> which<00:02:13.020> works

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
that sort of rot or control which works

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.699 
that sort of rot or control which works
now<00:02:14.910> let's<00:02:15.060> check<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.330> compression<00:02:15.900> well

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
now let's check the compression well

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:32.720 
now let's check the compression well
it's<00:02:16.890> quick<00:02:17.810> oops<00:02:29.180> hmm<00:02:31.040> not<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.070> huge<00:02:32.430> amount<00:02:32.489> of

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
it's quick oops hmm not a huge amount of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:41.060 
it's quick oops hmm not a huge amount of
compression<00:02:35.870> that's<00:02:36.870> right<00:02:37.080> again<00:02:39.860> not<00:02:40.860> very

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
compression that's right again not very

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:48.229 
compression that's right again not very
much<00:02:41.190> compression<00:02:41.640> really<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:47.060> might<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.150> a

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
much compression really I might have a

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.400 
much compression really I might have a
compression<00:02:48.720> release<00:02:48.840> actually<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:51.410> believe

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
compression release actually I believe

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.430 
compression release actually I believe
that's<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.770> choke<00:02:56.540> but<00:02:57.540> see<00:02:57.720> if<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:58.050> seem

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
that's the choke but see if we can seem

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.250 
that's the choke but see if we can seem
to<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:59.120> opening<00:03:00.120> yeah<00:03:04.010> yeah<00:03:05.010> that's<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.340> joke

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
to the opening yeah yeah that's a joke

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.960 
to the opening yeah yeah that's a joke
so<00:03:07.260> yeah<00:03:07.410> here's<00:03:07.650> my<00:03:07.799> new<00:03:08.130> llama<00:03:08.370> I'll<00:03:08.640> see<00:03:08.910> you

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
so yeah here's my new llama I'll see you

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.330 
so yeah here's my new llama I'll see you
next<00:03:09.000> time
