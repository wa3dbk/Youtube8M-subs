the<00:00:19.289> question<00:00:19.770> starts<00:00:19.980> off<00:00:20.189> with<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.550> quote<00:00:20.730> I

photograph weddings at seven degrees

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.470 
photograph weddings at seven degrees
before<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.220> I've<00:00:23.340> challenged<00:00:23.850> myself<00:00:23.880> to

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
before so I've challenged myself to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.390 
before so I've challenged myself to
shoot<00:00:24.720> differently<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.410> find<00:00:25.740> new<00:00:25.980> angles

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
shoot differently and find new angles

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.269 
shoot differently and find new angles
then<00:00:27.060> kitchen<00:00:27.630> asks<00:00:28.080> would<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.590> mind<00:00:28.859> taking

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
then kitchen asks would you mind taking

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.710 
then kitchen asks would you mind taking

us through the thought process of how
you<00:00:30.779> challenge<00:00:31.320> yourself<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.219> ask

dialogue going on do you take ideas that

dialogue going on do you take ideas that
you<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.570> previously<00:00:36.989> tried<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.440> different

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
you have previously tried in different

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.170 
you have previously tried in different
situations<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.280> fly<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> situation

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
situations and fly it to the situation

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.510 
situations and fly it to the situation
that<00:00:39.480> you're<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> could<00:00:40.920> answer<00:00:41.309> all<00:00:41.489> of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
that you're in so I could answer all of

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.459 
that you're in so I could answer all of
those<00:00:41.820> three<00:00:42.090> questions<00:00:42.329> independently<00:00:43.290> but

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
those three questions independently but

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.660 
those three questions independently but
what<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.620> thought<00:00:43.950> might<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.219> more<00:00:44.520> beneficial

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
what I thought might be more beneficial

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.660 
what I thought might be more beneficial
would<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.629> address<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.649> five<00:00:47.219> easy

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
would be to address this in five easy

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.610 
would be to address this in five easy
tips<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.840> shooting<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.289> same

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
tips so if I'm shooting at the same

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.900 
tips so if I'm shooting at the same
location<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.280> does<00:00:50.520> happen<00:00:50.730> quite

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
location which does happen quite

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
location which does happen quite
frequently<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.629> try<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> apply<00:00:52.230> these<00:00:52.590> five

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
frequently I try to apply these five

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.650 
frequently I try to apply these five
principles<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.910> walk<00:00:54.090> into<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.449> shoot

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
principles as I walk into the shoot

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.680 
principles as I walk into the shoot
number<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.280> time<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.670> day<00:00:56.850> dictates<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
number one the time of day dictates the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.299 
number one the time of day dictates the
lighting<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.440> I'm<00:00:58.590> shooting<00:00:58.800> at<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> same

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
lighting so if I'm shooting at the same

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.340 
lighting so if I'm shooting at the same
location<00:00:59.820> but<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.480> wedding<00:01:00.899> I'm<00:01:01.020> shooting

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
location but in one wedding I'm shooting

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349 
location but in one wedding I'm shooting
it<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.590> noon<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.280> at<00:01:02.640> another<00:01:02.760> wedding<00:01:03.120> I'm

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
it at noon and at another wedding I'm

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.149 
it at noon and at another wedding I'm
shooting<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:03.750> 6<00:01:03.960> p.m.<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.500> could<00:01:04.949> shoot<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
shooting at 6 p.m. I could shoot the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.890 
shooting at 6 p.m. I could shoot the
same<00:01:05.549> location<00:01:06.000> much<00:01:06.180> differently<00:01:06.600> because

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
same location much differently because

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.600 
same location much differently because
the<00:01:07.020> lighting<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:07.650> dictates<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.520> I'm

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the lighting is there dictates what I'm

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
the lighting is there dictates what I'm
able<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.420> I'm<00:01:09.840> shooting<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.350> noon<00:01:10.590> at

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
able to do if I'm shooting at noon at

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.950 
able to do if I'm shooting at noon at
the<00:01:10.799> location<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.369> might<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:12.030> able<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.420> say

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the location I might not be able to say

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
the location I might not be able to say
take<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.590> clients<00:01:14.010> out<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.369> full<00:01:14.700> Sun<00:01:15.030> without

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
take the clients out in full Sun without

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.929 
take the clients out in full Sun without
having<00:01:15.990> natural<00:01:16.140> reflectors<00:01:16.830> or<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.729> want

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
having natural reflectors or if I want

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.999 
having natural reflectors or if I want
favorable<00:01:18.330> light<00:01:18.479> or<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:18.869> too<00:01:19.170> hot<00:01:19.439> these

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
favorable light or if it's too hot these

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.320 
favorable light or if it's too hot these
are<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> considerations<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
are the considerations that I have to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.050 
are the considerations that I have to
take<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.170> sometimes<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.799> might<00:01:23.040> take<00:01:23.880> them

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
take and so sometimes I might take them

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.210 
take and so sometimes I might take them
into<00:01:24.240> wide<00:01:25.080> open<00:01:25.380> shade<00:01:25.619> or<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> will<00:01:26.100> shoot

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
into wide open shade or I will shoot

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.819 
into wide open shade or I will shoot
them<00:01:26.400> indoors<00:01:26.759> using<00:01:27.240> window<00:01:27.540> light<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:28.020> light

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
them indoors using window light as light

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.319 
them indoors using window light as light
during<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.280> situation<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.030> say<00:01:30.210> I'm

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
during that situation but if say I'm

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.450 
during that situation but if say I'm
shooting<00:01:30.720> at<00:01:30.840> sunset<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.890> gives<00:01:32.159> me<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> lot

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
shooting at sunset that gives me a lot

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.069 
shooting at sunset that gives me a lot
more<00:01:32.490> latitude<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:33.210> what<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:33.960> my

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
more latitude with what I can do with my

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.480 
more latitude with what I can do with my
clients<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.560> where<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.950> navigate<00:01:35.130> them

but<00:01:48.780> I'll<00:01:48.899> say<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> again<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.040> clients

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
but I'll say it again I can have clients

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.340 
but I'll say it again I can have clients
standing<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> exact<00:01:51.509> same<00:01:51.720> position<00:01:51.869> they

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
standing in the exact same position they

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.109 
standing in the exact same position they
don't<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.770> change<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.310> all<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:54.000> to

don't have to change and all I have to
do<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.420> simply<00:01:54.630> change<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> lens<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
do is simply change the lens and the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.770 
do is simply change the lens and the
entire<00:01:56.159> photograph<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.909> different<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.479> can

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
entire photograph is different I can

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.090 
entire photograph is different I can
have<00:01:58.049> clients<00:01:58.500> standing<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.950> same

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
have clients standing in the same

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.550 
have clients standing in the same
position<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.700> shoot<00:01:59.880> them<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.210> 85<00:02:00.719> 1.2

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.620 
position and shoot them with the 85 1.2
I<00:02:01.770> could<00:02:02.219> shoot<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.670> simply<00:02:03.000> swap<00:02:03.329> out<00:02:03.509> my

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
I could shoot it and simply swap out my

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.889 
I could shoot it and simply swap out my
lens<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.130> swap<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.369> go<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.820> 35<00:02:06.299> 1<00:02:06.630> point

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
lens and swap and go to the 35 1 point

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.559 
lens and swap and go to the 35 1 point
for<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> 35<00:02:07.530> millimeter<00:02:07.680> 1.4<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.179> pitch

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
for the 35 millimeter 1.4 and that pitch

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.809 
for the 35 millimeter 1.4 and that pitch
is<00:02:09.659> entirely<00:02:10.109> different<00:02:10.859> so<00:02:11.129> if<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.579> made<00:02:11.730> an

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
is entirely different so if I made an

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.819 
is entirely different so if I made an
exact<00:02:12.180> same<00:02:12.329> situation<00:02:12.629> if<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.319> exact<00:02:13.650> same

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
exact same situation if the exact same

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.440 
exact same situation if the exact same
time<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.129> day<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.489> having<00:02:14.819> my<00:02:14.909> clients<00:02:15.299> in<00:02:15.359> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
time of day and having my clients in the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.970 
time of day and having my clients in the
exact<00:02:15.749> same<00:02:15.930> position<00:02:16.079> but<00:02:16.469> in<00:02:16.650> two<00:02:16.829> different

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
exact same position but in two different

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.470 
exact same position but in two different
scenarios<00:02:17.219> I<00:02:17.700> will<00:02:18.090> shoot<00:02:18.269> it<00:02:18.359> with<00:02:18.450> a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
scenarios I will shoot it with a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.209 
scenarios I will shoot it with a
different<00:02:18.810> lens<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.230> hopefully<00:02:19.650> give<00:02:20.069> me<00:02:20.159> a

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
different lens to hopefully give me a

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.670 
different lens to hopefully give me a
very<00:02:20.549> different<00:02:20.670> result<00:02:21.209> tip<00:02:22.200> number<00:02:22.379> three

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
very different result tip number three

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.739 
very different result tip number three
use<00:02:23.280> your<00:02:23.489> second<00:02:23.819> shooter<00:02:23.999> as<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.239> buffer<00:02:24.599> and

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:24.749 
use your second shooter as a buffer and

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.479 
use your second shooter as a buffer and
I've<00:02:24.840> done<00:02:25.019> this<00:02:25.139> quite<00:02:25.349> often<00:02:25.680> if<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.250> feel

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
I've done this quite often if I feel

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.459 
I've done this quite often if I feel
like<00:02:26.609> I'm<00:02:26.790> stuck<00:02:27.060> I'm<00:02:27.299> in<00:02:27.629> this<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.170> shooting

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
like I'm stuck I'm in this and shooting

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.929

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
at the same venue I'm feeling that the

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.280 
at the same venue I'm feeling that the
light<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.389> same<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.780> I'm<00:02:30.840> doing<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.260> same
