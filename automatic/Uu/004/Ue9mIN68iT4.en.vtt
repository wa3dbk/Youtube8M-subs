really there in the room with you even
though<00:05:50.970> they're<00:05:51.180> actually<00:05:51.659> down<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:52.050> hall<00:05:52.229> in

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
though they're actually down the hall in

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.730 
though they're actually down the hall in
one<00:05:52.620> of<00:05:52.650> the<00:05:52.800> other<00:05:52.949> test<00:05:53.220> pots<00:05:54.530> we<00:05:55.530> really

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
one of the other test pots we really

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.040 
one of the other test pots we really
think<00:05:55.979> that<00:05:56.099> oculus<00:05:56.849> touch<00:05:57.090> is<00:05:57.419> going<00:05:57.990> to

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
think that oculus touch is going to

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.960 
think that oculus touch is going to
surprise<00:05:58.199> you<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:58.710> I'm<00:05:59.070> really<00:05:59.250> excited<00:05:59.580> to

show off toy box to a lot of people I'll

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.170 
show off toy box to a lot of people I'll
be<00:06:02.039> actually<00:06:02.370> running<00:06:02.520> a<00:06:02.639> lot<00:06:02.789> of<00:06:02.880> the<00:06:02.940> demos

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
be actually running a lot of the demos

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.089 
be actually running a lot of the demos
at<00:06:03.360> e3<00:06:03.510> so<00:06:03.870> we<00:06:04.260> might<00:06:04.409> get<00:06:04.560> a<00:06:04.620> chance<00:06:04.860> to<00:06:05.010> play

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
at e3 so we might get a chance to play

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:10.460 
at e3 so we might get a chance to play
together<00:06:06.409> so<00:06:07.699> that's<00:06:08.699> oculus<00:06:09.180> touch<00:06:09.389> we<00:06:10.289> think

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
together so that's oculus touch we think

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.270 
together so that's oculus touch we think
that<00:06:10.530> they're<00:06:10.680> going<00:06:10.770> to<00:06:10.830> deliver<00:06:10.979> an

that they're going to deliver an

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.710 
that they're going to deliver an
entirely<00:06:11.639> new<00:06:11.820> set<00:06:12.270> of<00:06:12.449> virtual<00:06:12.570> reality

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
entirely new set of virtual reality

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.260 
entirely new set of virtual reality
experiences<00:06:13.470> and<00:06:13.770> we<00:06:13.979> can't<00:06:14.340> wait<00:06:14.430> to<00:06:15.240> see

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
experiences and we can't wait to see

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.830 
experiences and we can't wait to see
