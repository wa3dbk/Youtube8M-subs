and I'm going to show you how easy it is

to<00:00:17.789> put<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.090> together<00:00:18.330> I'm<00:00:19.289> starting<00:00:19.830> with<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
to put this together I'm starting with a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.160 
to put this together I'm starting with a
can<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.490> black<00:00:20.699> beans<00:00:20.760> which<00:00:21.240> I've<00:00:21.480> drained<00:00:21.840> I

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
can of black beans which I've drained I

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.470 
can of black beans which I've drained I
didn't<00:00:22.500> rinse<00:00:22.769> them<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.580> one<00:00:23.730> thing<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.090> did<00:00:24.300> do

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
didn't rinse them but one thing I did do

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.910 
didn't rinse them but one thing I did do
is<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.779> saved<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.260> liquid<00:00:25.590> from<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> beans

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
is I saved the liquid from the beans

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.220 
is I saved the liquid from the beans
because<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> might<00:00:27.240> need<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> add<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> little<00:00:27.960> bit

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
because I might need to add a little bit

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.929 
because I might need to add a little bit
at<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.800> case<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.220> ends<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.519> being<00:00:29.699> too

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
at just in case it ends up being too

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.420 
at just in case it ends up being too
thick<00:00:30.240> I'm<00:00:30.810> gonna<00:00:31.230> put<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> beans<00:00:31.800> into<00:00:32.279> my

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
thick I'm gonna put the beans into my

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.850 
thick I'm gonna put the beans into my
food<00:00:32.730> processor<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.719> could<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
food processor you could do this in a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.350 
food processor you could do this in a
blender<00:00:35.250> if<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.460> want<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.120> little

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
blender if you want to but it's a little

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.119 
blender if you want to but it's a little
easier<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> processor<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.920> be

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
easier if you have a processor to be

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.880 
easier if you have a processor to be
able<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.850> out<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:40.290> normally

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
able to get it out and then normally

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.220 
able to get it out and then normally

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
things I'm gonna do is I'm gonna watch

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.800 
things I'm gonna do is I'm gonna watch
it<00:01:23.400> because<00:01:23.790> if<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.060> looks<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:24.630> too

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
it because if it looks as if it's too

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
it because if it looks as if it's too
thick<00:01:25.140> or<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.530> my<00:01:25.740> machine<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.340> straining<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
thick or if my machine is straining a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.609 
thick or if my machine is straining a
little<00:01:27.030> bit<00:01:27.360> I'm<00:01:27.689> gonna<00:01:27.869> add<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> little<00:01:28.409> bit<00:01:28.590> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
little bit I'm gonna add a little bit of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:39.660 
little bit I'm gonna add a little bit of
the<00:01:28.770> juice<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:29.579> we<00:01:29.700> go

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.130 

so<00:01:40.670> this<00:01:40.880> is<00:01:41.030> looking<00:01:41.180> pretty<00:01:41.600> good<00:01:41.780> but<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:42.110> is

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
so this is looking pretty good but it is

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.440 
so this is looking pretty good but it is
a<00:01:42.260> little<00:01:42.500> bit<00:01:42.710> thick<00:01:43.010> so<00:01:43.700> I'm<00:01:43.910> gonna<00:01:44.060> go<00:01:44.270> and

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
a little bit thick so I'm gonna go and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.970 
a little bit thick so I'm gonna go and
add<00:01:44.600> just<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:44.990> little<00:01:45.230> bit<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.470> their<00:01:45.620> liquid

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
add just a little bit of their liquid

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.650 
add just a little bit of their liquid
that<00:01:46.160> I<00:01:46.190> reserved<00:01:46.670> out<00:01:46.880> of<00:01:47.000> my<00:01:47.120> canned<00:01:47.420> beans

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
that I reserved out of my canned beans

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.880 
that I reserved out of my canned beans
