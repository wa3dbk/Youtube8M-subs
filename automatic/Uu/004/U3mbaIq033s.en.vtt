yield benefits that there are from
drainage<00:01:29.060> tile<00:01:29.389> well<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:29.779> say<00:01:29.990> environmental

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
drainage tile well you say environmental

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.109 
drainage tile well you say environmental
benefits<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.249> yield<00:01:31.459> benefits<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:31.939> thought

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
benefits and yield benefits I thought

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.489 
benefits and yield benefits I thought
you<00:01:32.179> were<00:01:32.270> talking<00:01:32.539> about<00:01:32.689> our<00:01:32.779> strip<00:01:33.109> tillage

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
you were talking about our strip tillage

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:34.989 
you were talking about our strip tillage
we're<00:01:33.770> gonna<00:01:33.859> also<00:01:34.159> look<00:01:34.310> at<00:01:34.429> some<00:01:34.579> strip<00:01:34.819> tail

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
we're gonna also look at some strip tail

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:36.459 
we're gonna also look at some strip tail
like<00:01:35.149> this<00:01:35.179> field<00:01:35.600> for<00:01:35.810> example<00:01:35.899> that<00:01:36.350> we're

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
like this field for example that we're

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.800 
like this field for example that we're
in<00:01:36.590> we<00:01:36.740> strip<00:01:37.069> tilled<00:01:37.340> corn<00:01:37.819> on<00:01:38.060> corn<00:01:38.389> and<00:01:38.719> we

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
in we strip tilled corn on corn and we

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.480 
in we strip tilled corn on corn and we
get<00:01:38.959> a<00:01:38.990> lot<00:01:39.139> of<00:01:39.170> questions<00:01:39.740> on<00:01:39.979> that<00:01:40.249> strip

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
get a lot of questions on that strip

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.699 
get a lot of questions on that strip
tillage<00:01:40.819> looks<00:01:41.090> nice<00:01:41.359> on<00:01:41.630> your<00:01:41.810> farm<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:42.469> boy

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
tillage looks nice on your farm but boy

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.649 
tillage looks nice on your farm but boy
it<00:01:42.889> won't<00:01:43.069> really<00:01:43.310> work<00:01:43.429> with<00:01:43.849> 200<00:01:44.329> bushel

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
it won't really work with 200 bushel

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.169 
it won't really work with 200 bushel
corn<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.200> we<00:01:45.529> say<00:01:45.709> well<00:01:45.889> yeah<00:01:46.490> well<00:01:46.759> here<00:01:47.060> we

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
corn and we say well yeah well here we

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.879 
corn and we say well yeah well here we
are<00:01:47.209> in<00:01:47.509> one<00:01:47.689> field<00:01:47.990> just<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.349> show<00:01:48.619> you<00:01:48.679> that

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
and and you can learn how to do it for

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.459 
and and you can learn how to do it for
yourself<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:55.189> once<00:01:55.639> again<00:01:55.899> with<00:01:56.899> farmers

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
yourself so once again with farmers

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.260 
yourself so once again with farmers
every<00:01:57.919> year<00:01:58.189> they're<00:01:58.429> always<00:01:58.579> looking<00:01:58.819> for

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
every year they're always looking for

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.179 
every year they're always looking for
the<00:01:59.359> competitive<00:01:59.959> advantage<00:02:00.560> always<00:02:00.950> trying

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
the competitive advantage always trying

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.279 
the competitive advantage always trying
to<00:02:01.310> learn<00:02:01.579> more<00:02:02.029> things<00:02:02.599> are<00:02:02.749> changing<00:02:03.259> very

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
to learn more things are changing very

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.469 
to learn more things are changing very
quickly<00:02:03.859> in<00:02:04.159> agriculture<00:02:04.789> especially<00:02:05.389> if

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
quickly in agriculture especially if

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.330 
quickly in agriculture especially if
you're<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.659> non<00:02:05.899> farmer<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:06.560> may<00:02:06.679> not<00:02:06.889> realize

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
you're a non farmer you may not realize

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.100 
you're a non farmer you may not realize
all<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.969> changes<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.479> have<00:02:08.599> come<00:02:08.629> just<00:02:09.019> in
