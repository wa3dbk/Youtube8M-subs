been the difference for them this season
well<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.580> think<00:00:08.700> what<00:00:08.940> Sir<00:00:09.090> Alex<00:00:09.330> has<00:00:09.450> done<00:00:09.599> is

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
well I think what Sir Alex has done is

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.470 
well I think what Sir Alex has done is
built<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.559> best<00:00:11.010> squad<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.820> terms<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.240> depth

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
built the best squad in terms of depth

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.240 
built the best squad in terms of depth
that<00:00:12.780> he's<00:00:12.929> ever<00:00:13.080> had<00:00:13.230> at<00:00:13.349> man<00:00:13.500> United<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
that he's ever had at man United the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.740 
that he's ever had at man United the
quality<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.849> squad<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.299> think<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> key

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
quality in the squad and I think the key

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.200 
quality in the squad and I think the key
has<00:00:15.929> been<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.260> spine<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:17.400> we'll<00:00:17.850> start<00:00:18.060> with

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
has been the spine that we'll start with

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.420 
has been the spine that we'll start with

of<00:00:43.680> him<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.950> know<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.070> think<00:00:44.340> he<00:00:44.399> was<00:00:44.520> singled

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
of him you know I think he was singled

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.119 
of him you know I think he was singled
out<00:00:44.940> early<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.390> question<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.410> remember<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.950> lot

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
out early on question I remember a lot

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.350 
out early on question I remember a lot
of<00:00:47.219> question<00:00:47.550> much<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.879> he<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.090> he<00:00:48.210> was

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
of question much and he was he was

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.910 
of question much and he was he was
singled<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.170> think<00:00:49.410> he<00:00:49.500> stood<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
singled out but I think he stood up to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.950 
singled out but I think he stood up to
these<00:00:50.129> challenges<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.820> think<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.570> helped

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
these challenges I think it's helped

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.450 
these challenges I think it's helped
helped<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.710> way<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.980> he's<00:00:53.070> played<00:00:53.309> in

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
helped in a way that he's played in

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.270 
helped in a way that he's played in
front<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.239> settled<00:00:55.020> back<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.070> think

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
front of a settled back for and I think

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.490 
front of a settled back for and I think
I<00:00:56.460> think<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.239> leader<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.750> back<00:00:58.199> for

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
I think the the leader of that back for

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.410 
I think the the leader of that back for
is<00:00:58.770> Rio<00:00:59.250> Ferdinand<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.850> think<00:01:00.059> he's<00:01:00.210> at<00:01:00.329> his

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
is Rio Ferdinand I think he's at his

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
is Rio Ferdinand I think he's at his
best<00:01:00.690> ever<00:01:00.899> season<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.410> my<00:01:01.500> United<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.010> think

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
best ever season for my United I think

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.290 
best ever season for my United I think
there's<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> lot<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.550> question<00:01:02.879> marks<00:01:03.090> against

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
there's a lot of question marks against

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.750 
there's a lot of question marks against
real<00:01:03.710> whether<00:01:04.710> he<00:01:04.860> had<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
real whether he had but you know the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.730 
real whether he had but you know the
pace<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> fitness<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.869> mobility<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.439> still

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
pace the fitness the mobility to still

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.960 
pace the fitness the mobility to still
play<00:01:07.920> at<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> top<00:01:08.220> level<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.640> think<00:01:08.850> he's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
play at the top level but I think he's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.490 
play at the top level but I think he's
answered<00:01:09.270> all<00:01:09.390> them<00:01:09.510> questions<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.049> year<00:01:10.290> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
answered all them questions this year I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.469 
answered all them questions this year I
think<00:01:11.010> he's<00:01:11.130> been<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> great<00:01:11.610> organizer<00:01:12.150> at<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
think he's been a great organizer at the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.480 
think he's been a great organizer at the
back<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.840> think<00:01:12.900> with<00:01:13.140> Rafael<00:01:13.560> outside<00:01:13.979> who<00:01:14.100> who

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
back I think with Rafael outside who who

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.510 
back I think with Rafael outside who who
else<00:01:15.030> has<00:01:15.240> had<00:01:15.360> an<00:01:15.600> outstanding<00:01:15.689> season

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
else has had an outstanding season

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.649 
else has had an outstanding season
they've<00:01:17.520> been<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:17.939> consistent<00:01:18.270> at<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
they've been really consistent at the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.999 
they've been really consistent at the
back<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.020> all<00:01:19.049> know<00:01:19.259> Rios<00:01:19.500> got<00:01:19.770> great

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
back and we all know Rios got great

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.640 
back and we all know Rios got great
composure<00:01:20.810> anything<00:01:21.810> he<00:01:21.930> gives<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.380> team
