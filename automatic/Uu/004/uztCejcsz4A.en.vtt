witnesses especially the principle of
two<00:00:02.820> weaknesses<00:00:04.700> witness<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.000> square<00:00:06.509> which

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
two weaknesses witness is a square which

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.320 
two weaknesses witness is a square which
cannot<00:00:07.230> be<00:00:07.290> defended<00:00:08.130> by<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.280> friendly<00:00:09.050> pawn<00:00:10.160> of

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
cannot be defended by a friendly pawn of

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.680 
cannot be defended by a friendly pawn of
course<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.480> could<00:00:12.660> also<00:00:13.080> be<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:14.190> pawn<00:00:14.690> standing

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
course it could also be a pawn standing

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.080 
course it could also be a pawn standing
on<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:15.929> week's<00:00:16.139> square<00:00:16.500> which<00:00:16.770> then<00:00:17.190> itself

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
on this week's square which then itself

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.019 
on this week's square which then itself
is<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.949> weakness<00:00:21.590> also<00:00:22.590> what<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.519> do<00:00:23.670> with<00:00:23.880> why

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
is a weakness also what to do with why

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.980 
is a weakness also what to do with why
did<00:00:24.300> Manx<00:00:24.539> Carson<00:00:24.960> Fabiano<00:00:25.730> Khurana<00:00:26.990> Black

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
did Manx Carson Fabiano Khurana Black

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.370 
did Manx Carson Fabiano Khurana Black
has<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> weakness<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:29.279> b6<00:00:30.140> yeah<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.579> weak<00:00:32.579> pawn

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
has a weakness on b6 yeah a weak pawn

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.959 
has a weakness on b6 yeah a weak pawn
which<00:00:34.380> cannot<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.860> defended<00:00:35.130> by<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> black<00:00:35.700> pawn

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
which cannot be defended by a black pawn

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.500 
which cannot be defended by a black pawn
any<00:00:36.300> more<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.190> on<00:00:38.190> f7<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.770> h6<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.180> g6<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.329> some

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
any more and on f7 and h6 and g6 is some

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.279 
any more and on f7 and h6 and g6 is some
kind<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.840> tactical<00:00:43.410> weakness<00:00:44.399> maybe<00:00:45.289> because

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
kind of tactical weakness maybe because

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.200 
kind of tactical weakness maybe because
why<00:00:46.500> that's<00:00:46.800> why<00:00:46.980> detecting<00:00:47.430> twice<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.059> is

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
why that's why detecting twice and it is

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.860 
why that's why detecting twice and it is
defended<00:00:49.219> twice<00:00:50.219> but<00:00:50.460> ok<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> slightly

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
defended twice but ok this is a slightly

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.939 
defended twice but ok this is a slightly
different<00:00:52.079> approach<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.100> course<00:00:54.770> yeah<00:00:55.770> but

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
different approach of course yeah but

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.369 
different approach of course yeah but
but<00:00:56.129> okay<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.789> weakness<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.420> p6<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:58.170> be

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
but okay this one weakness on p6 can be

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.979 
but okay this one weakness on p6 can be
defended<00:00:58.949> by<00:00:58.980> kuranes<00:00:59.789> army<00:01:00.300> relatively

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
defended by kuranes army relatively

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.070 
defended by kuranes army relatively
comfortably<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.390> this<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.480> often<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> case

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
comfortably and this is often the case

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.149 
comfortably and this is often the case
that<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.559> weakness<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.400> defended<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that one weakness can be defended so the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.609 
that one weakness can be defended so the
principle<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> two<00:01:08.790> weaknesses<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.619> extremely

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
principle of two weaknesses is extremely

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.859 
principle of two weaknesses is extremely
important<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.520> end<00:01:11.700> games<00:01:11.909> usually<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.600> in

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
important in end games usually and in

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
important in end games usually and in
the<00:01:12.960> game<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.260> general<00:01:15.650> rugby<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.830> often<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the game in general rugby one often the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.520 
the game in general rugby one often the
attacker<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:19.740> shift<00:01:20.520> his<00:01:20.759> forces<00:01:21.530> more

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
attacker can shift his forces more

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.940 
attacker can shift his forces more
easily<00:01:23.479> than<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.890> easier<00:01:26.600> than<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.950> defender

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
easily than the easier than the defender

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.719 
easily than the easier than the defender
so<00:01:29.640> white<00:01:29.880> rock<00:01:30.210> now<00:01:30.590> pressure<00:01:31.590> rises<00:01:32.310> both

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
so white rock now pressure rises both

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.749 
so white rock now pressure rises both
wings<00:01:33.320> in<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.439> way<00:01:34.560> because<00:01:34.979> which<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.640> be

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
wings in a way because which one can be

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.270 
wings in a way because which one can be
played<00:01:36.030> very<00:01:36.390> quickly<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.049> okay<00:01:37.680> white<00:01:37.890> king

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
played very quickly and okay white king

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.770 
played very quickly and okay white king
can<00:01:39.030> invade<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.619> weak<00:01:40.920> light<00:01:41.759> squares<00:01:42.979> of

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
can invade on the weak light squares of

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.319 
can invade on the weak light squares of
the<00:01:45.780> Queen<00:01:46.049> side<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.490> whole<00:01:47.640> color<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the Queen side there the whole color the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.569 
the Queen side there the whole color the
whole<00:01:48.570> color<00:01:48.990> complex<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.649> light<00:01:49.799> squares<00:01:50.250> is

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
whole color complex of light squares is

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.630 
whole color complex of light squares is
weak<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.619> such<00:01:52.619> weaknesses<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.930> very

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
weak and such weaknesses are very

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.999 
weak and such weaknesses are very
precarious<00:01:56.640> often<00:01:57.030> Bavaria<00:01:57.479> diseases<00:01:58.170> not

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
precarious often Bavaria diseases not

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.120 
precarious often Bavaria diseases not
good<00:01:59.310> to<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.979> large<00:02:02.280> V<00:02:02.700> color<00:02:03.060> complexes

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
good to have so large V color complexes

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.310 
good to have so large V color complexes
while<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.399> other<00:02:05.430> hand<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.600> could<00:02:06.810> also<00:02:07.049> be

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
while on the other hand it could also be

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.680 
while on the other hand it could also be
said<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.770> Magnus<00:02:08.310> Carlsen<00:02:08.910> also<00:02:09.360> has<00:02:09.509> some

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
said that Magnus Carlsen also has some

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.260 
said that Magnus Carlsen also has some
weaknesses<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.590> yeah<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.879> would<00:02:12.030> not

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
weaknesses and yeah that that would not

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.940 
weaknesses and yeah that that would not
be<00:02:12.510> wrong<00:02:12.930> but

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
be wrong but

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.280 
be wrong but
black<00:02:14.550> cannot<00:02:14.910> exploit<00:02:15.360> them<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.020> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
black cannot exploit them and the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.260 
black cannot exploit them and the
weakness<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.830> cannot<00:02:17.160> be<00:02:17.340> exploited<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:18.060> no

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
weakness that cannot be exploited is no

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.760 
weakness that cannot be exploited is no
weakness<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.870> also<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.319> guideline<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:21.770> yeah

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
weakness is also a guideline and yeah

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.160 
weakness is also a guideline and yeah
the<00:02:22.950> c3<00:02:23.489> is<00:02:23.760> defended<00:02:24.360> very<00:02:24.390> well<00:02:24.900> by<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
the c3 is defended very well by the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.630 
the c3 is defended very well by the
bishop<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.800> bishop<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.250> not<00:02:26.430> only

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
bishop and the bishop is not only

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.449 
bishop and the bishop is not only
passive<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.270> is<00:02:27.390> also<00:02:27.599> very<00:02:28.319> very<00:02:28.650> active<00:02:28.890> it

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
passive it is also very very active it

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.150 
passive it is also very very active it
pressurizes<00:02:29.880> v6<00:02:30.630> weakness<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.980> weak

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
pressurizes v6 weakness and the weak

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.800 
pressurizes v6 weakness and the weak
squares<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:33.410> blacks<00:02:34.410> King<00:02:34.560> side<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:36.690> can

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
squares on blacks King side and it can

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.300 
squares on blacks King side and it can
maybe<00:02:37.260> also<00:02:37.530> attack<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.010> h6<00:02:38.700> quite<00:02:39.030> quickly

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
maybe also attack the h6 quite quickly

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.500 
maybe also attack the h6 quite quickly
but<00:02:41.310> blacks<00:02:41.610> Bishop<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.470> yeah<00:02:44.269> mostly<00:02:45.269> passive

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
but blacks Bishop is yeah mostly passive

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.540 
but blacks Bishop is yeah mostly passive
okay<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.110> has<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.290> protect<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.830> b6<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:47.430> it

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
okay it has to protect the b6 but it

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.630 
okay it has to protect the b6 but it
cannot<00:02:47.930> okay<00:02:48.930> but<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.530> cannot<00:02:49.830> be<00:02:49.890> active

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
cannot okay but it cannot be active

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.300 
cannot okay but it cannot be active
easily<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.810> cannot<00:02:51.989> be<00:02:52.110> activated<00:02:52.319> easily<00:02:53.000> so

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
easily it cannot be activated easily so

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.680 
easily it cannot be activated easily so
this<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.430> also<00:02:56.580> important<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.180> weakness<00:02:57.540> which

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
this is also important a weakness which

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.090 
this is also important a weakness which
cannot<00:02:57.900> be<00:02:58.110> exploited<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.739> no<00:02:58.890> weakness

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
cannot be exploited it is no weakness

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.670 
cannot be exploited it is no weakness
and<00:02:59.400> this<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.420> course<00:03:00.450> also<00:03:00.989> must<00:03:01.140> be<00:03:01.290> shown<00:03:01.500> by

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
and this of course also must be shown by

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.280 
and this of course also must be shown by
concrete<00:03:01.980> calculation<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.900> here<00:03:04.170> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
concrete calculation and so here the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.920 
concrete calculation and so here the
following<00:03:04.440> variation<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.340> important<00:03:06.060> now

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
following variation is important now

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.580 
following variation is important now
black<00:03:07.319> tries<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.900> use<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.170> weakness<00:03:10.319> and

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
black tries to use the weakness and

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.350 
black tries to use the weakness and
attack<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.310> but<00:03:13.610> Marcus<00:03:14.610> has<00:03:14.760> calculated

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
attack it but Marcus has calculated

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.900 
attack it but Marcus has calculated
there<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.630> no<00:03:15.840> threat<00:03:16.170> because<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.549> invasion

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
there is no threat because the invasion

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.460 
there is no threat because the invasion
of<00:03:18.209> his<00:03:18.359> King<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:19.310> more<00:03:20.310> important<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:22.290> this

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
of his King is more important and this

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.420 
of his King is more important and this
really<00:03:22.739> yeah

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
really yeah

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.430 
really yeah
this<00:03:23.820> really<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.359> amazing<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.959> don't<00:03:25.140> know<00:03:25.290> how

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
this really is amazing I don't know how

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.039 
this really is amazing I don't know how
Magnus<00:03:25.829> does<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:26.370> somehow<00:03:27.049> always

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
Magnus does it but somehow always

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.840 
Magnus does it but somehow always
manages<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:29.000> dominate<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:31.739> enemy<00:03:32.310> army<00:03:32.609> and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
manages to dominate the enemy army and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.400 
manages to dominate the enemy army and
here<00:03:33.299> yeah<00:03:35.329> black<00:03:36.329> would<00:03:36.510> lose<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:37.079> exchange

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
here yeah black would lose the exchange

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.180 
here yeah black would lose the exchange
first<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.890> game<00:03:38.040> later<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.370> course<00:03:40.190> yeah

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
first in the game later of course yeah

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.729 
first in the game later of course yeah
this<00:03:41.370> position<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.850> invite<00:03:42.180> always<00:03:42.810> wins

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
this position you invite always wins

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.319 
this position you invite always wins
now<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.220> reason<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.500> he<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.620> much<00:03:47.040> more

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
now the reason is that he is much more

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.770 
now the reason is that he is much more
active<00:03:48.440> than<00:03:49.440> black<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.299> is<00:03:51.420> also<00:03:51.570> one

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
active than black and this is also one

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.720 
active than black and this is also one
disadvantage<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.590> having<00:03:52.769> to<00:03:53.400> defend

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
disadvantage of having to defend

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.599 
disadvantage of having to defend
weaknesses<00:03:54.329> passively<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.530> may<00:03:55.799> lead<00:03:56.100> in

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
weaknesses passively this may lead in

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.130 
weaknesses passively this may lead in
general<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.150> passivity<00:03:57.569> of<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.989> whole

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
general to passivity of the whole

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.170 
general to passivity of the whole
position<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.799> then<00:03:58.980> there<00:03:59.700> may<00:03:59.850> be<00:03:59.880> other

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
position and then there may be other

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.990 
position and then there may be other
ways<00:04:00.269> for<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.840> attacker<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.440> transform<00:04:02.069> this

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
ways for the attacker to transform this

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.590 
ways for the attacker to transform this
advantage<00:04:03.630> like<00:04:04.410> this<00:04:04.709> year<00:04:05.010> into<00:04:05.280> his

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
advantage like this year into his

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.220 
advantage like this year into his
intervening<00:04:06.739> due<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:08.120> more<00:04:09.350> active<00:04:11.150> forces

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
intervening due to more active forces

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.920 
intervening due to more active forces
and<00:04:13.760> wide<00:04:14.760> wins<00:04:15.000> according<00:04:15.389> to<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.540> computer

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
and wide wins according to the computer

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.560 
and wide wins according to the computer
but<00:04:16.019> Magnus<00:04:16.739> has<00:04:16.919> seen<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.609> don't<00:04:18.419> doubt

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
but Magnus has seen it I don't doubt

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.289 
but Magnus has seen it I don't doubt
that<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:19.079> here<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:20.130> wide<00:04:20.789> would<00:04:21.060> win

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
that and here a wide would win

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.129 
that and here a wide would win
immediately

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.330 

okay<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:29.139> the<00:04:29.319> principle<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:29.770> two<00:04:29.919> weaknesses

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
okay so the principle of two weaknesses

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.480 
okay so the principle of two weaknesses
is<00:04:30.520> extremely<00:04:30.970> important<00:04:32.129> create<00:04:33.129> a<00:04:33.189> second

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
is extremely important create a second

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.640 
is extremely important create a second
weakness<00:04:33.789> and<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.569> weakness<00:04:34.870> that<00:04:35.199> cannot<00:04:35.530> be

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
weakness and a weakness that cannot be

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.640 
weakness and a weakness that cannot be
exploited<00:04:36.009> is<00:04:36.490> no<00:04:37.000> weakness<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.539> weak<00:04:38.289> color

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
exploited is no weakness and weak color

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.450 
exploited is no weakness and weak color
complexes<00:04:39.310> should<00:04:40.150> be<00:04:41.099> avoided<00:04:42.099> orange<00:04:42.280> must

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
complexes should be avoided orange must

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.439 
complexes should be avoided orange must
be<00:04:42.550> Yahoo<00:04:42.750> then<00:04:43.750> then<00:04:43.990> great<00:04:44.319> care<00:04:44.620> is

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
be Yahoo then then great care is

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.129 
be Yahoo then then great care is
necessary<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:47.520> here<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.550> veidt's<00:04:49.210> king<00:04:49.509> always

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
necessary and here a veidt's king always

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.950 
necessary and here a veidt's king always
threatens<00:04:50.889> to<00:04:51.039> invade<00:04:51.189> on<00:04:51.699> the<00:04:52.360> light<00:04:52.539> squares

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
threatens to invade on the light squares

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.390 
threatens to invade on the light squares
of<00:04:53.199> the<00:04:53.289> Queen<00:04:53.530> side<00:04:55.620> this<00:04:56.620> interview<00:04:57.069> also

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
of the Queen side this interview also

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.379 
of the Queen side this interview also
what<00:04:57.520> happened<00:04:57.849> in<00:04:57.909> the<00:04:58.000> game<00:04:59.729> now<00:05:00.729> mark<00:05:01.150> knows

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
what happened in the game now mark knows

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:09.050 
what happened in the game now mark knows
played<00:05:03.030> broke<00:05:04.060> h1<00:05:04.539> playing<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.289> trump<00:05:06.009> card

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.399 

it<00:05:10.060> doesn't<00:05:10.360> certain<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:10.960> take<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.319> edge

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
it doesn't certain to take the edge

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.879 
it doesn't certain to take the edge
exactly<00:05:12.039> due<00:05:12.219> to<00:05:12.370> G<00:05:12.610> takes<00:05:12.819> a<00:05:13.000> five<00:05:13.210> check<00:05:13.449> but

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
exactly due to G takes a five check but

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.330 
exactly due to G takes a five check but
there<00:05:14.889> the<00:05:15.099> rock<00:05:15.280> now<00:05:15.520> works<00:05:16.300> on<00:05:16.479> the<00:05:17.340> inside

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
there the rock now works on the inside

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.490 
there the rock now works on the inside
and<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.669> King<00:05:18.940> on<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.690> Queen<00:05:19.930> side<00:05:19.960> and<00:05:20.409> this

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
and the King on the Queen side and this

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.580 
and the King on the Queen side and this
overloads<00:05:21.099> black<00:05:21.550> defense<00:05:22.090> in<00:05:22.479> the<00:05:23.259> long<00:05:23.409> run

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
overloads black defense in the long run

the principle of two weaknesses is
