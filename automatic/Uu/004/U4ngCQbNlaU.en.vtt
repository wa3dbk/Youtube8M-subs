00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
so this I'm gonna be showing guys like

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.650 
so this I'm gonna be showing guys like
certain<00:00:51.129> fighters<00:00:51.370> like<00:00:51.550> Rashad<00:00:51.850> Evans<00:00:51.879> can

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
certain fighters like Rashad Evans can

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.240 
certain fighters like Rashad Evans can
do<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:52.930> hip<00:00:53.230> throw<00:00:53.410> the<00:00:53.590> judo<00:00:53.829> throw<00:00:54.039> whatever

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
do the hip throw the judo throw whatever

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.709 
do the hip throw the judo throw whatever
you<00:00:54.370> want<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:54.609> call<00:00:54.699> when<00:00:55.059> there's<00:00:55.239> over<00:00:55.510> under

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
you want to call when there's over under

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.170 
you want to call when there's over under
control<00:00:56.079> and<00:00:56.320> that's<00:00:56.769> like<00:00:56.980> neutral<00:00:57.340> control

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
control and that's like neutral control

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.939 
control and that's like neutral control
I<00:00:58.210> guess<00:00:58.390> so<00:00:58.899> he<00:00:59.109> can<00:00:59.260> still<00:00:59.440> get<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.620> slam<00:00:59.800> from

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
I guess so he can still get to slam from

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.500 
I guess so he can still get to slam from
there<00:01:00.129> which<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.550> lot<00:01:00.699> of<00:01:00.760> fighters<00:01:01.000> cannot<00:01:01.300> do

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
there which a lot of fighters cannot do

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.270 
there which a lot of fighters cannot do
so<00:01:01.920> Rashad<00:01:02.920> Evans<00:01:02.949> can<00:01:03.429> do<00:01:03.579> that<00:01:03.760> so<00:01:04.950> even<00:01:05.950> when

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
so Rashad Evans can do that so even when

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.820 
so Rashad Evans can do that so even when
he<00:01:06.429> has<00:01:06.550> full<00:01:06.850> control<00:01:07.090> under<00:01:07.750> hooks<00:01:07.929> shot

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
he has full control under hooks shot

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.639 
he has full control under hooks shot
Evans<00:01:09.070> able<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.640> do<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.229> slam<00:01:11.229> and<00:01:11.259> it's<00:01:11.560> the

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
Evans able to do the slam and it's the

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.600 
Evans able to do the slam and it's the
same<00:01:11.950> thing<00:01:11.979> l<00:01:12.250> 1<00:01:12.460> minor<00:01:12.700> transition<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:14.610> next
