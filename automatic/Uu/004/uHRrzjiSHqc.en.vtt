00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:04.930
 hello is this little bit fast sure used bullets the interest of this 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.040
 year where there is no fear of colorization that I put to your 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.209
 disposition 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:13.320
 this table% and resume the entire methodology of technical preparation 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:17.829
 and to export chnic from the book I co-wrote with night the coordination of 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:18.919
 all countries 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.089
 for 100 th so read besides note the second edition to get by 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.689
 9 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.609
 December 2010 so hold for me in a few days so June 3 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.329
 % right here 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.720
 physical you have a lot of information 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.399
 the goal is that they are very isolated 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.510
 for example the cleaning steps which is very 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.160
 the stellar structure amisom separate features in the duels the amount of the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.490
 funds prepare calculations these lands 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.020
 the opposite is flat 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.380
 and then to come and do the keyword and the child 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.480
 give one of the elements before your printer according to different 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.350
 methods I choose 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.220
 so we could have killed very fast words 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.680
 alain the opportunity to come 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.620
 so easily clean your help in a comprehensive way 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.230
 we can of course also ringing I am quite easily 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.280
 either localized with tools that will allow you for example 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.380
 6 to clear up this area 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.899
 we also have the opportunity to come and make sure that the board 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.749
 good baddeley but well and good 3 coming for example signed the straightener 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:26.350
 this board 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.180
 it was rare in activity to crop the board to make sure the framing 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.180
 of the board 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.160
 ouattara 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.729
 tools like this 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.350
 e for example here 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.750
 fillon will come to crop me the move a little bit the area 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.210
 so here same giant principle chara I'm going to come add a little bit of 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.100
 material 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.260
 that's with the air of the lost fund 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.460
 et cetera and so on 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.350
 once we did because if we discussed and recorded 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.700
 a copy for the future quickly work on it 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.319
 then well why the pool why 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:57.900
 structure the document 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.740
 methods that will choose to read you do not forget that he said 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.560
 the tooltips every time sweaty on the elements 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.919
 but I take the first detonation level of 8 to 6 years of friends countries very 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:12.599
 so there ffm version 1 1 percent to three hundred of the countries we arrived with 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.189
 all the more channel structures with its memorized features 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.719
 for his alone can make my encyclical 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.540
 the fact that it is inscribed in actions that leave you panels 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.709
 allow for example 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.340
 after thanks to this table we added could be displayed kayak expedition for 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.029
 show you 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:29.429
 in the long run and in what way 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:31.700
 because the care he has taken for granted 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.230
 same principle that I select magic wand the closed areas the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.349
 people do that 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.680
 she now that I have reversed and that the traits are asking under several 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.090
 selection methods 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.950
 these areas are closed 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.499
 are closed we are going to have several methods 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.259
 then I choose a color 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:54.029
 I come here to fill his colors with selected 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:57.579
 no limestone here the transparent waters to lock them directly 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.159
 and all this otherwise we were bored I'll be some people 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.569
 but I use different methods 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.169
 for example reported 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:11.529
 use the magic wand to come she will fill select areas and 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:12.959
 et cetera and so on 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.159
 again it's a color 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.260
 here their owners this year as well as in this suite 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.060
 different methods 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.430
 to be able to prepare yourself German where you have to define 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.639
 you would see 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.470
 finally quick access 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.280
 to the set of tools and to the set of calculations interesting here 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:35.930
 by here you will be able to work 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.889
 to offer sessions for example 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.189
 to select on this calculation so scary way fast 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.299
 here the elements that are I remind you 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.769
 already on a layer of power looping for example come and do a little more 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:55.929
 change the colors the young man is not on the rest of the clan I 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:57.409
 isolates me the first plans 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:58.990
 so that's all easy 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.700
 for once we've done all that and well we'll be able to 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.370
 come take his time 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.660
 we will be able to choose a low this basic color a little clearer for 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:08.689
 the light 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:10.989
 the future to enhance the spikes 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.579
 this fear of going a little darker for the shadows maybe in 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:15.829
 shifted by the way 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.870
 a little bit of messy color 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.769
 right here 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.639
 see how we will be able before x 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.090
 and come add shadows and lights 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.240
 right here 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.710
 so many ways to go we can go 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.120
 instead of seeing a round brush if we can go get 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.139
 other types of soul voice and set a little look for them 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.100
 dl prosper thus defined predefined tools of this state 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.219
 and then we'll see different things 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:46.749
 such as for example other top-selling titles example shop - which is going 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:47.530
 allow us 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.190
 talk about coming in quite easily enough 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.120
 well, drapery effects 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.590
 so we can see 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.030
 we will be able to use here to be able to come and have fun locally 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.360
 doors of this news of this food what I wanted a crash of type 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.279
 we will be able to use the brush 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:08.699
 yes if we suddenly saw in the focus actually are prized 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.849
 everything you may need 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:12.229
 here for example 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.290
 see that I will be able to replace the color by keeping 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.969
 it is a notion that we associate 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.220
 standing of brightness 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.210
 the situation can locally over others 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.249
 stamping emblem the world copy that I was not good 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.280
 nine here you are going to be able 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.509
 a sixth place offer them a case that is done is done 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.170
 and then you will also be able to 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.870
 create very very quickly 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.490
 if if I come back often smiled 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.659
 we created here for example 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.659
 once in the mouth a little anything that would be for example 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.740
 pollard pending 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.680
 papals of torture that would be a form of computer science I want to draw 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.150
 from that moment 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.559
 I create my way of thinking about 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:55.559
 that's it i'm coming back here and here i come to attribute it 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:59.769
 here I am with a sling in his game that we 

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:01.229
 are the Belgian register 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:02.960
 and what can I start 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.960
 coming soon 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.520
 we are with a part of my form of pressure that falls rather happy 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.360
 set 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.990
 r you have to finish% several methods depending on what you have determined 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.050
 your printer you have your editor stubbe this contact 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.369
 several methods of board optimization 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:27.019
 she launched m with color support that's with the spot colors it 

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:29.150
 is very good of panic that's out of his lands 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.180
 here it was a little overview you have tutorials on wet the 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.669
 shirt 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.549
 for more details on each part see you soon
