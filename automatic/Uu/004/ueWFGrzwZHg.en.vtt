really big problem
I<00:00:12.540> can<00:00:12.809> only<00:00:12.929> fit<00:00:13.320> two<00:00:13.559> figures<00:00:14.040> in<00:00:14.070> there<00:00:14.460> it

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
I can only fit two figures in there it

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.689 
I can only fit two figures in there it
really<00:00:15.000> sucks<00:00:15.710> so<00:00:17.359> what<00:00:18.359> you're<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.779> do

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
and the face amount just rip this whole

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.330 
and the face amount just rip this whole
thing<00:00:24.029> out<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.510> that<00:00:28.340> okay

next<00:00:29.760> we're<00:00:30.090> going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.920> take<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.750> 1<00:00:33.750> by<00:00:33.780> 4<00:00:34.020> brick

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
next we're going to take a 1 by 4 brick

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.240 
next we're going to take a 1 by 4 brick
flat<00:00:35.730> brick<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:37.610> we're<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.760> going<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:40.250> place

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
flat brick and we're just going to place

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.860 
flat brick and we're just going to place
it<00:00:42.170> on<00:00:43.170> top<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.950> each<00:00:44.070> other<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.910> this

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
it on top of each other like this this

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.900 
it on top of each other like this this
is<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> really<00:00:46.530> simple<00:00:46.739> design<00:00:47.129> by<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> way

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
is a really simple design by the way

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.740 
is a really simple design by the way
then<00:00:48.870> we're<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.649> take<00:00:51.379> this<00:00:53.180> 2<00:00:54.180> by<00:00:54.420> 8

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
then we're going to take this 2 by 8

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.939 
then we're going to take this 2 by 8
brick<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:56.840> I'm<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> place<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.620> like

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
brick and I'm going to place it on like

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:08.390 
brick and I'm going to place it on like
that<00:00:59.190> and<00:01:02.660> then<00:01:03.660> we're<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.890> take<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:07.369> 2<00:01:08.369> by

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that and then we're going to take a 2 by

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.050 
that and then we're going to take a 2 by
1<00:01:08.610> brick<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.810> place<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.520> top<00:01:11.729> like

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
1 brick and place it on the top like

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.310 
1 brick and place it on the top like
this<00:01:12.860> then<00:01:13.860> you're<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.400> take<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
this then you're going to take on a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.810 
this then you're going to take on a
dashboard<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:18.750> takes<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.380> um<00:01:20.869> to<00:01:21.869> UM<00:01:22.820> or

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
dashboard that takes up um to UM or

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.109 
dashboard that takes up um to UM or
takes<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.420> 1<00:01:24.600> by<00:01:24.780> 2<00:01:24.840> space<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.640> use<00:01:26.820> those

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
takes up a 1 by 2 space I just use those

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.270 
takes up a 1 by 2 space I just use those
two<00:01:27.360> things<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.290> first<00:01:28.560> two<00:01:28.770> things<00:01:29.070> I

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
two things up the first two things I

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.530 
two things up the first two things I

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
let me know when there is figures in

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.749 
let me know when there is figures in
there<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.940> little<00:02:06.060> bit<00:02:06.360> hard<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.759> you're

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
there it's a little bit hard so you're

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.270 
there it's a little bit hard so you're
just<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.740> place<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:11.160> inside<00:02:12.320> of<00:02:13.320> us<00:02:13.710> and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
just going to place it inside of us and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.570 
just going to place it inside of us and
then<00:02:14.460> close<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.760> up<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:17.930> we're<00:02:18.930> going<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.140> take

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
then close it up so we're going to take

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.210 
then close it up so we're going to take
on<00:02:20.580> solo<00:02:21.380> place<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.220> front<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:25.530> then

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
on solo place in in the front and then

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.690 
on solo place in in the front and then
we're<00:02:26.430> going<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.640> take<00:02:26.870> Chewbacca<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.830> place

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
we're going to take Chewbacca and place

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.210 
we're going to take Chewbacca and place
him<00:02:30.000> right<00:02:30.330> here<00:02:31.820> then<00:02:33.140> we're<00:02:34.140> going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.350> take

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:50.230 

this<00:02:38.330> loop<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:42.410> place<00:02:43.410> him<00:02:43.980> right<00:02:45.050> down<00:02:46.050> here

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:58.420 

like<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:52.940> then<00:02:53.940> let's<00:02:54.660> take<00:02:55.700> skip<00:02:56.700> leg

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
like that then let's take skip leg

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.660 
like that then let's take skip leg
layout<00:02:59.430> here<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.390> then<00:03:00.650> place<00:03:01.650> her<00:03:02.780> down

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
layout here and then place her down

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.900 
layout here and then place her down
right<00:03:05.670> next<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.270> Luke<00:03:07.580> right<00:03:08.580> here<00:03:10.519> so<00:03:11.519> there

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
right next to Luke right here so there

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.120 
right next to Luke right here so there
they<00:03:12.120> are

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
they are

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.620 
they are
then<00:03:14.130> like<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.610> said<00:03:14.880> you'll<00:03:15.150> just<00:03:17.330> slide<00:03:18.330> it

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
then like I said you'll just slide it

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.949 
then like I said you'll just slide it
inside<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:22.250> cockpit<00:03:23.250> like<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:24.060> then

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959
