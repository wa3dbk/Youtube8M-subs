00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Good day to everyone listening to this but also 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.319
 Now there will be many good words about 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.639
 a new series of daredevil in netflix 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.530
 difference from my pilot reviews 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.660
 episodes flash drive year and this time I 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.490
 I want to see the full show and 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.949
 only then give your opinion and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.949
 I can say that I was not mistaken that's why 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.460
 so much emotion about everything step by step 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.470
 let's start with the first episode after 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.840
 view 1 usually difficult of course 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.700
 describe your impressions here just 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.370
 one word combination describes everything 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.710
 nothing more than these two words 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.170
 are the wildest compliment from me and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.000
 so it remains for all 13 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.830
 episodes of the quality bar which 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.930
 set on the first episode holding on 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.900
 you'll meet the whole season now 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.699
 rarely everything is absolutely in its place over 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.620
 lik created almost columnar series 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.870
 which for me at the moment is a hundred 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.910
 percent became the flagship superheroic on 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.219
 tv not a single extra plot twist 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 not a single useless scene not a single 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.940
 no extra character 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.009
 the dialogue between them is no tormenting 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.560
 musical insert hearing and perfect 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.880
 the balance between action and grams is absolutely 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.630
 nothing extra can be 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.360
 admire 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.140
 and this opening special thanks to those who 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.270
 made it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.990
 the intro splash screen was not a desire 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.820
 miss she she here you words me 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.250
 not find it just awesome 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.170
 I was waiting for you a lot of heads 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.030
 specially passes all trailers and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.640
 teasers so as not to spoil the impression 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.440
 to watch a clean slate and got 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.600
 even more than expected I was waiting 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.399
 the story of the formation of the hero on us 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.830
 also showed the formation of the main 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.780
 antagonist yes as shown to me 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.819
 always wanted to be disappointed 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.369
 fieschi hair constantly seemed to 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.200
 something is missing here a hero's head 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.000
 I had a slightly different image of fis and 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.280
 the serial did not correspond to him at all 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.619
 but it was intended incredible 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.569
 vincent d'onofrio played excellent on 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.030
 throughout all the episodes his character 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.039
 developed as one character said 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.830
 Fisk was necessary to choose whom he 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.720
 must be the very end we understand by whom 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.550
 he has already become visible 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.009
 wilson fiska one left 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.020
 desire to help this city of who 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.310
 chose the path of evil and hatred for him 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.380
 their daredevil and his voice oh that voice 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.650
 how many missed those who looked in 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.630
 voice acting and white wall white wall in general 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.540
 separate respect from me this character 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.910
 led through the whole history of fiska and how 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.610
 ironic to see him at the very end in 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.620
 in general, who watched he would understand at all 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.510
 almost every character is not even 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.920
 the main got its development 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.140
 some stories went their way 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.730
 the creator is forced to empathize not 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.989
 only the main character but also to those who 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.720
 is only auxiliary 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.909
 the characters and the villain is also too much 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.670
 I read a positive opinion about 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.560
 assistant office to james if this 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.690
 stylish asshole really leaves for 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.849
 a mere liking of his image with something 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.310
 reminds character of Colin Firth Iskin 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.409
 change in general casting I am very pleased 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.780
 and all managed their roles and 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.640
 the main character is no exception charlie coke 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.379
 could not play with his eyes 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.109
 show your emotions using already 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.760
 In general, the rest of the facial expression is very 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.980
 it's hard to believe but he's great 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.530
 inquired about the suit must be said 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.569
 it was separately eyeliner even to him with 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.250
 moments from the first episode 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.560
 when different characters advised 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.019
 the main character improve the costume improve 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.150
 he himself gradually approached his defense 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.310
 to this we were shown his acquaintance with 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.889
 future suit material and acquaintance 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.500
 with whoever did it here everything has 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.150
 their motives and reasons for the appearance of nothing 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.980
 does not arise simply because it was 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.959
 in comics, everything is done by 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.120
 the classics have super active episodes a 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.340
 there are injectors so to speak forcing 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.949
 the atmosphere preparing a springboard for a sharp 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.449
 bang action and plot but usually such 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.760
 episodes are boring by themselves 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:53.160
 however, in their raw head even their interesting 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.980
 watch everyone was waiting for a good action all 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.720
 got a great shooter but few who 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.609
 gave a cool law drama 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.280
 but it is there and takes no 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.799
 last place and i am very glad that marvel 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.549
 finally did not cheerful kids 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.970
 attraction 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.730
 and the real hard is all real tin 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.829
 really enough but I love this and this 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.310
 familiar to the movie disi atmosphere too 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.560
 love 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.320
 and the main thing is that here you are nothing extra 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.419
 No, they did not overdo it, I will not hide it with 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.539
 all sorts of fractures and battles that 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.430
 By the way are well set, many know 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.830
 that I don't like long TV shows and 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.990
 blurred storyline too nobody here 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.210
 did not extend anything 1 season initially 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.340
 consisted of 13 episodes and the same 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.229
 left it allowed to show that 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.780
 a story that doesn't let you get bored 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.940
 minute save all viewers from the heap 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.700
 side villains tying everything into one 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.130
 the plot i can sing songs of praise just 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.169
 talk about this show for hours but i 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.060
 I try to keep myself and I understand what's needed 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.590
 come to estimates which by the way 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.110
 plainly you won't see mister 10 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.849
 out of 10 10 out of 10 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.889
 I tried for a long time to invent some 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.200
 minus which is really minus and 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.139
 gave me displeasure but such 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.180
 just no oh yes yes yes yes I do not 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.020
 liked an asian granny like that 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.000
 that's a minus from me 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.639
 that is, with her as with the character all 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.789
 good but I just did not like it 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.580
 I'm such a minus and the rest 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.960
 firmly dozens I know that there are those who 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.520
 didn't appreciate charlie head 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.500
 so waiting for your comments and 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.150
 noticed flaws about those who 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.219
 He agrees with me and waits madly at 3 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.650
 I wait for the season under the video and on this 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:34.639
 We ended with you but love comics 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.639
 and all bye
