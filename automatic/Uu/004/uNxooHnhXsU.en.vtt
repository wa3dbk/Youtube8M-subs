00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.450> the<00:00:00.900> best<00:00:01.110> aspect<00:00:01.530> of<00:00:01.650> course<00:00:02.070> for<00:00:02.399> me

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
I think the best aspect of course for me

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.480 
I think the best aspect of course for me
is<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:03.600> high<00:00:03.750> standard<00:00:04.230> that<00:00:04.440> they<00:00:04.560> set<00:00:04.830> which

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
is the high standard that they set which

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.240 
is the high standard that they set which
at<00:00:06.390> times<00:00:06.660> can<00:00:06.750> be<00:00:06.899> hard<00:00:07.410> but<00:00:07.710> it<00:00:07.980> really

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
at times can be hard but it really

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.709 
at times can be hard but it really
drives<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.880> become<00:00:09.150> like<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.570> best

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
drives you to become like the best

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.629 
drives you to become like the best
practitioner<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.380> can<00:00:10.559> be<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:10.980> there's

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
practitioner that you can be and there's

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.789 
practitioner that you can be and there's
always<00:00:11.790> support<00:00:12.210> from<00:00:12.450> all<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.259> staff<00:00:13.469> there

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
always support from all the staff there

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.890 
always support from all the staff there
and<00:00:14.009> from<00:00:14.639> your<00:00:14.880> fellow<00:00:15.059> students<00:00:15.630> as<00:00:15.719> well

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
and from your fellow students as well

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.200 
and from your fellow students as well
the<00:00:16.440> facilities<00:00:17.039> at<00:00:17.340> some<00:00:17.670> areas<00:00:17.970> are<00:00:18.090> really

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
the facilities at some areas are really

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.630 
the facilities at some areas are really
first<00:00:18.600> class<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.439> labs<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:20.010> use<00:00:20.220> for<00:00:20.580> our

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
first class the labs that we use for our

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.910 
first class the labs that we use for our
lectures<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.689> our<00:00:21.840> practical<00:00:22.350> work<00:00:22.500> have<00:00:22.769> all

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
lectures and our practical work have all

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.500 
lectures and our practical work have all
the<00:00:23.039> static<00:00:23.460> art<00:00:23.820> equipment<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.390> could

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the static art equipment you could

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.870 
the static art equipment you could
possibly<00:00:24.779> want<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.380> really<00:00:25.800> like<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.310> small

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
possibly want I really like the small

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.400 
possibly want I really like the small
amount<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.330> students<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> classroom<00:00:28.050> so

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
amount of students in the classroom so

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.960 
amount of students in the classroom so
we<00:00:28.590> have<00:00:28.740> more<00:00:28.949> one-on-one<00:00:29.189> time<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
we have more one-on-one time with the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.669 
we have more one-on-one time with the
lecturers<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.539> they<00:00:30.990> really<00:00:31.260> give<00:00:31.410> us<00:00:31.529> an

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
lecturers and they really give us an

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.740 
lecturers and they really give us an
in-depth<00:00:32.099> information<00:00:32.550> about<00:00:33.000> each<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
in-depth information about each of the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.569 
in-depth information about each of the
topics<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> different<00:00:34.829> sports<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
topics in the different sports the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.310 
topics in the different sports the
proximal<00:00:36.000> element<00:00:36.270> they<00:00:36.390> give<00:00:36.600> us<00:00:36.719> here<00:00:37.200> at

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
proximal element they give us here at

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.170 
proximal element they give us here at
st.<00:00:37.530> Mary's<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.980> really<00:00:38.250> important<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.090> our

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
st. Mary's is really important to our

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.479 
st. Mary's is really important to our
learning<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.750> find<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.770> lectures<00:00:41.219> they

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
learning I find that the lectures they

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.549 
learning I find that the lectures they
go<00:00:41.640> over<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.050> mechanisms<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.200> how<00:00:43.320> things

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
go over the mechanisms of how things

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.590 
go over the mechanisms of how things
work<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.100> then<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.730> reinforce<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
work and then we reinforce it in the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.720 
work and then we reinforce it in the
practical<00:00:45.989> element<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.469> enjoy<00:00:46.829> our<00:00:47.129> seminars

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
practical element I enjoy our seminars

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.369 
practical element I enjoy our seminars
and<00:00:47.910> things<00:00:47.940> are<00:00:48.210> quite<00:00:48.420> small<00:00:48.750> groups<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and things are quite small groups and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.220 
and things are quite small groups and
it's<00:00:49.710> quite<00:00:49.980> easy<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.570> talk<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.840> them<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
it's quite easy to talk in them and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.200 
it's quite easy to talk in them and
things<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.980> heard<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:54.030> don't

enjoy seeing a practical aspect to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.210 
enjoy seeing a practical aspect to
science<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.200> I've<00:01:19.409> applied<00:01:19.590> physics<00:01:20.070> and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
science so I've applied physics and

science so I've applied physics and
study<00:01:20.400> electronics<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.420> study<00:01:22.250> liked<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.759> in

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
study electronics we study liked as in

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.840 
study electronics we study liked as in
lasers<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.750> quantify<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:26.070> actually

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
lasers so we can quantify that actually

really really enjoy well I like most
about<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:30.780> degree<00:01:31.140> program<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> fact<00:01:32.040> that

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
about my degree program is the fact that

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.980 
about my degree program is the fact that
there's<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> lot<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.820> variety<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.900> my

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
there's a lot of variety going on in my

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.830 
there's a lot of variety going on in my
degree<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.430> pick<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.030> take<00:01:36.479> off<00:01:36.689> my
