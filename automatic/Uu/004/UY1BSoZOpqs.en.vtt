stock<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> stock<00:01:16.740> sound<00:01:17.960> it<00:01:18.960> was<00:01:19.020> two

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
stock with the stock sound it was two

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.010 
stock with the stock sound it was two
and<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.759> course<00:01:20.970> they<00:01:21.090> didn't<00:01:21.360> fit<00:01:21.540> exact

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and one of course they didn't fit exact

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.249 
and one of course they didn't fit exact
so<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> had<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.830> put<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> little<00:01:23.280> bend<00:01:24.020> right<00:01:25.020> down

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
so I had to put a little bend right down

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.179 
so I had to put a little bend right down
by<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.560> foot<00:01:25.920> peg<00:01:26.360> but<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:28.200> hammer<00:01:28.680> kind<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.070> did

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
by the foot peg but a hammer kind of did

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.990 
by the foot peg but a hammer kind of did
that<00:01:30.079> you'll<00:01:31.079> never<00:01:31.290> see<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.759> cut<00:01:32.759> them<00:01:32.880> off

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that you'll never see it cut them off

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.039 
that you'll never see it cut them off
sounds<00:01:33.869> great<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.920> know<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.280> two<00:01:35.520> outs<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
sounds great you know just two outs and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.770 
sounds great you know just two outs and
they<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.310> baffle<00:01:38.970> incorporated<00:01:39.659> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
they have the baffle incorporated in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.319 
they have the baffle incorporated in
them<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.280> gives<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.850> enough<00:01:42.119> back

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
them so it gives it just enough back

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.330 
them so it gives it just enough back
pressure<00:01:44.840> put<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> drag<00:01:46.140> bars<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.710> of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
pressure put the drag bars on it of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.190 
pressure put the drag bars on it of
course<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.939> know<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.240> rid<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> big<00:01:48.780> bulky
