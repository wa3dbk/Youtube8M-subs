we'll<00:03:18.880> go<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.329> next<00:03:19.450> step<00:03:19.720> just<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.739> be

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
we'll go to the next step just to be

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.650 
we'll go to the next step just to be
clear<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.400> can<00:03:21.519> be<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.700> friend<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.359> can<00:03:22.480> be

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
clear it can be a friend it can be

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.720 
clear it can be a friend it can be
counter<00:03:23.140> can<00:03:23.380> be<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.530> corner<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.130> can<00:03:24.280> be<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.459> rail

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
counter can be a corner it can be a rail

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.080 
counter can be a corner it can be a rail
it<00:03:25.000> can<00:03:25.120> be<00:03:25.239> anything<00:03:25.620> okay<00:03:26.620> now<00:03:27.220> this<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:27.819> what

it can be anything okay now this is what

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.250 
it can be anything okay now this is what
I<00:03:28.150> call<00:03:28.540> finding<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.380> balance<00:03:29.829> point<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.810> your

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
I call finding the balance point so your

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.370 
I call finding the balance point so your
shoes<00:03:32.680> should<00:03:33.010> have<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.220> little<00:03:33.579> slant<00:03:34.380> for

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
shoes should have a little slant for

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.580 
shoes should have a little slant for
your<00:03:35.680> nose<00:03:36.010> so<00:03:36.819> what<00:03:37.269> finding<00:03:37.720> about<00:03:37.840> Louise

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
point and then try to let go of the rail

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.750 
point and then try to let go of the rail
you<00:03:55.230> can't<00:03:55.530> good<00:03:56.459> okay<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:58.040> then<00:03:59.040> if<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.519> want

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
okay next step but first before we could

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.229 
okay next step but first before we could
move<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:10.980> next<00:04:11.099> step<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.579> want<00:04:11.849> to<00:04:12.000> find

move on to the next step I want to find
my<00:04:12.389> balance<00:04:12.569> point<00:04:12.930> one<00:04:13.319> more<00:04:14.040> time<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:17.070> change

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:29.450 

oh<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.350> big<00:04:22.620> hole<00:04:23.370> down<00:04:25.280> okay<00:04:27.470> now<00:04:28.470> ready<00:04:29.280> for

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
oh that big hole down okay now ready for

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:49.939 
easy zip - all you do is it's basically
moved<00:04:43.110> yourself<00:04:43.590> along<00:04:46.970> okay<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.780> I'm<00:04:49.740> going

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
moved yourself along okay so I'm going

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.500 
moved yourself along okay so I'm going
to<00:04:50.010> find<00:04:50.220> my<00:04:50.340> balance<00:04:50.520> wind<00:04:50.849> again

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
to find my balance wind again

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.250 
to find my balance wind again
but<00:04:52.020> farther<00:04:52.470> away<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:53.690> then<00:04:54.690> I'm<00:04:54.870> just<00:04:54.900> gonna

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
but farther away and then I'm just gonna

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.629 
but farther away and then I'm just gonna
hold<00:04:55.650> myself<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.520> push<00:04:56.760> myself<00:04:56.840> along

hold myself and push myself along

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:07.810 
hold myself and push myself along
lightly<00:04:59.639> put<00:04:59.880> my<00:05:00.000> feet<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:00.449> the<00:05:00.479> ground<00:05:00.720> so

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.379 

find<00:05:08.820> your<00:05:09.000> balance<00:05:09.150> point<00:05:09.360> again<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:11.490> then

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
find your balance point again and then

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.310 
find your balance point again and then
take<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.560> rail<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:14.220> is<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.820> great<00:05:15.150> here<00:05:15.720> and

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
take the rail that is a great here and

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.350 
take the rail that is a great here and
then<00:05:16.710> hold<00:05:16.979> yourself<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:17.820> push<00:05:17.970> yourself

like that okay ready okay okay so the

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.820 
like that okay ready okay okay so the
next<00:05:32.280> step<00:05:32.550> is<00:05:32.789> the<00:05:33.419> step<00:05:33.860> plant<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:35.280> kick<00:05:36.830> so

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
next step is the step plant and kick so

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.820 
next step is the step plant and kick so
let<00:05:38.400> me<00:05:38.490> just<00:05:38.669> get<00:05:39.300> my<00:05:39.510> knee<00:05:39.690> pads<00:05:39.960> ready<00:05:40.409> okay

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
the knee pads have to be there because

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.600 
the knee pads have to be there because
this<00:05:45.330> one<00:05:45.720> might<00:05:45.990> be<00:05:46.229> the<00:05:46.440> hardest<00:05:47.250> step<00:05:47.340> of

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
this one might be the hardest step of

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.140 
this one might be the hardest step of
all<00:05:47.789> Freight<00:05:48.210> some<00:05:48.570> guys
