00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.840
 I can not see you 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.170
 This is a little 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.470
 Let's get a little sleep on what kind of lens it is 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.800
 Gone are such is the feeling of the lens 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.910
 wife 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:39.830
 Yes, as a feature of this Logitech c 920 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:45.880
 It also means that it can be taken with high resolution of 1080p 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:49.810
 Say 1080 p that is a clean is to take the Zokao of high-resolution 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:56.410
 Yes, delivery or something will become simmering 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:04:01.860

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.760
 Also the voyage view say so because 264 and say guy do is I h 264 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.890
 It is moving certain 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:13.160
 And in like a digital format that compresses 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:15.000
 Because this is loaded with such a thing, it is such a cabinet and it becomes such a picture 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.680
 It is difficult 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.680
 Then I think that I want to open it
