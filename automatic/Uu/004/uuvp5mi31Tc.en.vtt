focus very heavily towards tank and
specifically<00:00:41.610> health<00:00:41.910> because<00:00:42.329> health

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
specifically health because health

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.840 
specifically health because health
influences<00:00:43.590> your<00:00:43.950> passive<00:00:44.460> how<00:00:44.579> much<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
influences your passive how much you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.130 
influences your passive how much you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
heal because that does Stokes then of

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.410 
heal because that does Stokes then of
your<00:00:46.230> max<00:00:46.469> health<00:00:46.680> similarly<00:00:47.670> your<00:00:47.820> W<00:00:48.239> does

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
your max health similarly your W does

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.209 
your max health similarly your W does
damage<00:00:48.690> based<00:00:49.079> off<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.320> your<00:00:49.559> max<00:00:49.770> health<00:00:49.890> too

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
