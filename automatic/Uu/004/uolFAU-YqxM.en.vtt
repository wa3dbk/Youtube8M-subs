for<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.980> create<00:00:26.250> waves<00:00:26.700> in<00:00:27.119> poser<00:00:27.840> object

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
for you to create waves in poser object

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.000 
for you to create waves in poser object
like<00:00:28.800> waves<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.610> the<00:00:29.700> surface<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.240> water<00:00:31.010> for

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
like waves in the surface of water for

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.560 
like waves in the surface of water for
it<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.369> effective<00:00:32.699> you<00:00:33.030> need<00:00:33.150> a<00:00:33.210> fairly

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
it to be effective you need a fairly

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.080 
it to be effective you need a fairly
high<00:00:33.900> resolution<00:00:34.220> surface<00:00:35.220> so<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:35.970> gonna

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
high resolution surface so I'm gonna

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.869 
high resolution surface so I'm gonna
pick<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.570> high-res<00:00:37.230> tablecloth<00:00:38.040> from<00:00:38.699> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
pick the high-res tablecloth from the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.689 
pick the high-res tablecloth from the
poser<00:00:39.150> content<00:00:39.750> library<00:00:40.230> now<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> tablecloth

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
poser content library now a tablecloth

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.670 
poser content library now a tablecloth
is<00:00:41.910> kind<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.239> small<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.870> surface<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.410> pond

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
is kind of small for a surface of a pond

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.170 
is kind of small for a surface of a pond
or<00:00:43.860> something<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.220> that<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:44.879> gonna

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
or something like that so I'm just gonna

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.619 
or something like that so I'm just gonna
scale<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.469> 500%<00:00:47.270> that<00:00:48.270> gives<00:00:48.450> us<00:00:48.540> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
scale it up to 500% that gives us a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.430 
scale it up to 500% that gives us a
pretty<00:00:48.809> good<00:00:49.050> sized<00:00:49.260> area<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.800> work<00:00:50.010> with<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
pretty good sized area to work with and

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
pretty good sized area to work with and
to<00:00:52.440> apply<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> way<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.090> works<00:00:54.329> just

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
to apply the way the for it works just

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.690 
to apply the way the for it works just
like<00:00:54.719> magnets<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.950> object<00:00:56.640> that

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
like magnets you have the object that

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.760 
like magnets you have the object that
you're<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.120> apply<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.690> selected<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you're going to apply it to selected and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.750 
you're going to apply it to selected and
click<00:00:59.190> create<00:00:59.579> wave<00:01:00.149> from<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> object<00:01:01.140> menu

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
click create wave from the object menu

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
click create wave from the object menu
now<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.360> didn't<00:01:03.660> really<00:01:03.870> make<00:01:04.080> gaps<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.800> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
now that didn't really make gaps in the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.920 
now that didn't really make gaps in the
object<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:05.520> you're<00:01:05.700> seeing<00:01:05.940> is<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.450> ground

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
object what you're seeing is the ground

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.719 
object what you're seeing is the ground
showing<00:01:07.350> through<00:01:07.800> so<00:01:08.070> I'm<00:01:08.160> just<00:01:08.310> gonna<00:01:08.430> turn

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
showing through so I'm just gonna turn

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.410 
showing through so I'm just gonna turn
the<00:01:08.940> ground<00:01:09.180> off<00:01:10.580> we<00:01:11.580> also<00:01:11.729> got<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.180> big

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the ground off we also got this big

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.389 
the ground off we also got this big
green<00:01:12.750> squiggly<00:01:13.110> thing<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:14.009> is<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
green squiggly thing here this is the

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.570 
green squiggly thing here this is the
wave<00:01:14.670> deformer<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:16.350> works<00:01:16.680> very<00:01:17.039> similar<00:01:17.430> to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
wave deformer it works very similar to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.210 
wave deformer it works very similar to
the<00:01:17.670> magnet<00:01:18.179> from<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:18.509> magnet<00:01:18.899> tools<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.440> we

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the magnet from your magnet tools if we

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.249 
the magnet from your magnet tools if we
look<00:01:20.459> at<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> properties<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.390> two<00:01:21.750> kinds

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
look at the properties we have two kinds

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.529 
look at the properties we have two kinds
of<00:01:22.380> waves<00:01:22.649> now<00:01:23.429> it's<00:01:23.640> currently<00:01:24.119> set<00:01:24.509> to

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
of waves now it's currently set to

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.990 
of waves now it's currently set to
radial<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.830> would<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.039> for<00:01:26.280> simulating

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
radial and that would be for simulating

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.839 
radial and that would be for simulating
for<00:01:27.300> example<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.959> a<00:01:28.170> rock<00:01:28.800> thrown<00:01:29.190> into<00:01:29.399> a<00:01:29.520> pond

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:29.849 
for example of a rock thrown into a pond

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:32.570 
for example of a rock thrown into a pond
where<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.240> waves<00:01:30.709> start<00:01:31.709> from<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.979> point<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
where the waves start from a point and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.480 
where the waves start from a point and
work<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:33.090> towards<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.660> edge<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.979> other<00:01:35.160> type

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
work out towards the edge the other type

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.249 
work out towards the edge the other type
is<00:01:35.759> directional<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.690> that<00:01:36.810> would<00:01:36.899> be<00:01:37.020> more

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
is directional and that would be more

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.350 
is directional and that would be more
like<00:01:37.470> waves<00:01:37.830> breaking<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.640> coastline<00:01:39.179> or

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
like waves breaking on a coastline or

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.150 
like waves breaking on a coastline or
something<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:39.959> that<00:01:40.020> where<00:01:40.410> they're<00:01:40.560> coming

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
something like that where they're coming

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.309 
something like that where they're coming
from<00:01:41.280> such<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> distant<00:01:42.599> point<00:01:42.929> they<00:01:43.200> don't

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
from such a distant point they don't

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.990 
from such a distant point they don't
seem<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.739> diverge<00:01:44.220> anymore

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
seem to diverge anymore

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.690 
seem to diverge anymore
the<00:01:45.599> settings<00:01:46.080> for<00:01:46.200> radial<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.160> directional

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the settings for radial and directional

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.120 
the settings for radial and directional
waves<00:01:47.940> work<00:01:48.300> pretty<00:01:48.690> much<00:01:48.959> the<00:01:49.170> same<00:01:49.440> there's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
waves work pretty much the same there's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.889 
waves work pretty much the same there's
little<00:01:50.429> differences<00:01:50.910> in<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> scale<00:01:51.660> of

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
little differences in the scale of

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.109 
little differences in the scale of
frequency<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.619> things<00:01:52.979> like<00:01:53.190> that<00:01:53.250> we're

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
frequency and things like that we're

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.059 
frequency and things like that we're
gonna<00:01:54.209> play<00:01:54.509> with<00:01:54.660> a<00:01:54.690> radial<00:01:55.229> wave<00:01:55.470> setting

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
gonna play with a radial wave setting

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.690 
gonna play with a radial wave setting
this<00:01:56.220> up<00:01:56.420> just<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.630> deformers<00:01:58.520> there<00:01:59.520> is

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
this up just like deformers there is

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.080 
this up just like deformers there is
also<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.330> zone<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.619> zone<00:02:01.649> works<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.789> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
also a zone the zone works just like the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.630 
also a zone the zone works just like the
zones<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.690> magnets<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.770> even<00:02:05.069> has<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> fall-off

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
zones for magnets it even has a fall-off

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.229 
zones for magnets it even has a fall-off
graph<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.569> magnets<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:09.060> can

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
graph like the magnets have you can
