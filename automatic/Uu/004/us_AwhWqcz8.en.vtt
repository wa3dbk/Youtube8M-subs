00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
enemies at once but they can also be

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.740 
enemies at once but they can also be
completely<00:01:02.309> insignificant<00:01:02.729> in<00:01:03.299> battle<00:01:03.600> if

completely insignificant in battle if
used<00:01:03.989> incorrectly<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.509> main

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
used incorrectly so what are the main

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.389 
used incorrectly so what are the main
differences<00:01:06.869> between<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.979> different<00:01:08.280> their

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
differences between the different their

differences between the different their
strike<00:01:08.640> units<00:01:08.970> let's<00:01:09.509> take<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.810> closer<00:01:10.020> look

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
strike units let's take a closer look

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.260 
strike units let's take a closer look
okay<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.440> now<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.950> three<00:01:14.190> types<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.759> strike

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
okay we now have three types of a strike

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.779 
okay we now have three types of a strike
and<00:01:15.539> they<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:16.049> events<00:01:16.440> based<00:01:16.789> however

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
and they are all events based however

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.460 
and they are all events based however
they<00:01:18.179> are<00:01:18.210> unique<00:01:18.569> in<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.780> way<00:01:18.929> they<00:01:19.229> deal

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
they are unique in the way they deal

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.139 
they are unique in the way they deal
damage<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:20.250> are<00:01:20.340> different<00:01:20.759> tactics

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
damage and there are different tactics

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.559 
damage and there are different tactics
for<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:23.190> first<00:01:23.429> type<00:01:23.610> uses<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> skill

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
for it the first type uses a skill

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.290 
for it the first type uses a skill

amount of damage to an area this type is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.240 
amount of damage to an area this type is
the<00:01:29.909> safest<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.810> most<00:01:31.050> guaranteed<00:01:31.770> weight<00:01:32.039> of

this<00:01:59.310> commander<00:01:59.729> has<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> much<00:02:00.149> larger<00:02:00.539> blast

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
this commander has a much larger blast

how<00:02:07.380> do<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:07.649> use<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.859> strike<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.489> most

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
how do we use a strike in the most

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.370 
how do we use a strike in the most
effective<00:02:09.000> way<00:02:09.269> what<00:02:09.539> are<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.720> best<00:02:09.899> tactics

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
effective way what are the best tactics

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.910 
effective way what are the best tactics
let's<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.070> look<00:02:12.380> there<00:02:13.380> are<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.500> few<00:02:13.680> things

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
let's have a look there are a few things

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.830 
let's have a look there are a few things
to<00:02:14.070> keep<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.400> mind<00:02:14.459> when<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:14.970> when<00:02:15.329> using<00:02:15.570> a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
to keep in mind when you when using a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.620 
to keep in mind when you when using a
strike<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.859> first<00:02:17.130> one<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.299> strike

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
strike the first one is the a strike

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.080 
strike the first one is the a strike
takes<00:02:19.019> time<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.590> reach<00:02:19.769> their<00:02:20.130> destination<00:02:20.910> so

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
takes time to reach their destination so

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.900 
takes time to reach their destination so
timing<00:02:21.329> is<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.570> most<00:02:21.870> important<00:02:22.380> factor<00:02:22.910> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
timing is the most important factor the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.759 
timing is the most important factor the
easiest<00:02:24.329> way<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.660> make<00:02:24.900> sure<00:02:25.049> you<00:02:25.200> hit<00:02:25.350> enemies

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
easiest way to make sure you hit enemies

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.949 
easiest way to make sure you hit enemies
is<00:02:25.920> by<00:02:26.100> making<00:02:26.519> sure<00:02:26.760> they're<00:02:27.269> standing<00:02:27.630> still

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
is by making sure they're standing still

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.310 
is by making sure they're standing still
and<00:02:28.170> engaging<00:02:28.620> your<00:02:28.950> units<00:02:29.310> already<00:02:30.320> secondly

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
and engaging your units already secondly

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.410 
and engaging your units already secondly
make<00:02:31.799> sure<00:02:32.010> your<00:02:32.220> s<00:02:32.400> track<00:02:32.640> isn't<00:02:32.790> damaged<00:02:33.239> on

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
make sure your s track isn't damaged on

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.240 
make sure your s track isn't damaged on
the<00:02:33.510> way<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:34.140> target<00:02:34.350> because<00:02:34.799> they<00:02:35.160> all

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
the way to the target because they all

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.150 
the way to the target because they all
deal<00:02:35.459> reduced<00:02:36.000> damage<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.660> case<00:02:37.160> air

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
deal reduced damage in that case air

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.059 
deal reduced damage in that case air
intercept<00:02:38.640> units<00:02:38.940> are<00:02:39.120> your<00:02:39.269> biggest<00:02:39.570> threat

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
intercept units are your biggest threat

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.590 
intercept units are your biggest threat
but<00:02:41.069> AV<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.670> infantry<00:02:42.060> can<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:42.329> so<00:02:42.480> greatly

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
but AV and infantry can I so greatly

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.069 
but AV and infantry can I so greatly
reduce<00:02:43.140> your<00:02:43.350> units<00:02:43.680> potential<00:02:44.569> so<00:02:45.569> ideally

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
reduce your units potential so ideally

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.840 
reduce your units potential so ideally
you<00:02:46.260> want<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.650> deploy<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.190> strike<00:02:47.489> right

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
you want to deploy in a strike right

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.699 
you want to deploy in a strike right
after<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.329> enemy<00:02:48.600> uses<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.079> our<00:02:49.200> intercepts

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
after the enemy uses in our intercepts

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.610 
after the enemy uses in our intercepts
so<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:49.920> know<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.310> can't<00:02:50.609> be<00:02:50.730> countered

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
so you know you can't be countered

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.580 
so you know you can't be countered
and<00:02:52.459> finally<00:02:52.909> this<00:02:53.090> may<00:02:53.330> be<00:02:53.390> obvious<00:02:53.870> but<00:02:54.200> make

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
and finally this may be obvious but make

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.740 
and finally this may be obvious but make
sure<00:02:54.620> your<00:02:54.980> ass<00:02:55.340> rack<00:02:55.640> units<00:02:56.000> is<00:02:56.209> at<00:02:56.390> the

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
sure your ass rack units is at the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.509 
sure your ass rack units is at the
appropriate<00:02:57.049> level<00:02:57.349> units<00:02:58.129> have<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.310> reduced

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
appropriate level units have a reduced

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.940 
appropriate level units have a reduced
rate<00:02:59.239> against<00:02:59.599> higher<00:02:59.930> level<00:03:00.319> enemies<00:03:00.709> and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
rate against higher level enemies and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.180 
rate against higher level enemies and
with<00:03:01.519> air<00:03:01.670> strike<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.200> very<00:03:03.470> important

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
with air strike this is very important

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.759 
with air strike this is very important
if<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.180> miss<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.540> enemy<00:03:05.840> then<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.530> just

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
if you miss the enemy then you just

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.850 
if you miss the enemy then you just
