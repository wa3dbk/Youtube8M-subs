right<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.170> sign<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.410> probably<00:01:01.829> pronounced

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
right on that sign I probably pronounced

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.130 
right on that sign I probably pronounced
that<00:01:02.309> wrong<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> hill<00:01:03.480> square<00:01:03.840> sign

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
that wrong but it's the hill square sign

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.340 
that wrong but it's the hill square sign

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
basically it's across from the bridge so

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.530 
basically it's across from the bridge so
it's<00:01:07.380> pretty<00:01:07.799> easy<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.159> spot<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:09.390> you're

it's pretty easy to spot and what you're

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.120 
it's pretty easy to spot and what you're
gonna<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.170> get<00:01:10.260> up<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> sign<00:01:10.890> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
gonna do is just get up on the sign and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.880 
gonna do is just get up on the sign and
then<00:01:11.250> strafe<00:01:11.610> jump<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.090> between<00:01:12.479> those<00:01:13.320> two

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
then strafe jump in between those two

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.940 
then strafe jump in between those two
poles<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.970> black<00:01:15.270> little<00:01:15.689> thing<00:01:15.990> it's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
poles on to that black little thing it's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.010 
poles on to that black little thing it's
a<00:01:17.040> little<00:01:17.250> black<00:01:17.430> edge<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> line

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
a little black edge and you have to line

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.390 
a little black edge and you have to line
it<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.229> perfectly<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.890> might<00:01:20.070> take<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> few

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
it up perfectly it might take a few

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.249 
it up perfectly it might take a few
tries<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.240> not<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.600> hard<00:01:21.780> once<00:01:21.869> you're

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
tries but it's not that hard once you're

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.039 
tries but it's not that hard once you're
well<00:01:22.409> practice<00:01:23.030> kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.119> slide<00:01:24.360> over<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
way along the edge and line up over here

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.539 
way along the edge and line up over here
next<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.500> other<00:01:31.740> pole<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.220> then<00:01:32.369> you're

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
more on to the bridge spot this is one

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.100 
more on to the bridge spot this is one
of<00:02:20.310> my<00:02:20.430> favorite<00:02:20.880> spots<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.390> because<00:02:21.900> it's

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
of my favorite spots just because it's

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.199 
of my favorite spots just because it's
the<00:02:22.530> second<00:02:22.950> glitch<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.489> second<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.120> only

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
the second glitch and second and only

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.720 
the second glitch and second and only
glitch<00:02:24.630> I've<00:02:24.810> found<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.350> map<00:02:25.800> you're

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
glitch I've found in this map you're

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.580 
glitch I've found in this map you're
gonna<00:02:26.850> just<00:02:27.090> line<00:02:27.390> up<00:02:27.420> onto<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:27.959> wall<00:02:28.350> right

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
gonna just line up onto that wall right

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.970 
gonna just line up onto that wall right
there

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
there

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.190 
there
and<00:02:29.069> strafe<00:02:29.850> jump<00:02:30.120> onto<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.569> mossy<00:02:30.959> grass

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
and strafe jump onto the mossy grass

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.390 
and strafe jump onto the mossy grass
right<00:02:31.680> here<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.310> then<00:02:32.850> you're<00:02:33.120> basically<00:02:33.630> on

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
right here and then you're basically on

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.699 
right here and then you're basically on
glitch<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.300> just<00:02:36.540> add<00:02:37.200> your<00:02:37.260> way

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
glitch and you can just add your way

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.620 
glitch and you can just add your way
across<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.459> then<00:02:38.670> there's<00:02:38.880> these<00:02:39.060> little

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
across it and then there's these little

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.470 
across it and then there's these little
building<00:02:40.230> things<00:02:40.800> walls<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.970> guess<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.330> would

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
building things walls I guess you would

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.170 
building things walls I guess you would
call<00:02:42.510> them<00:02:42.870> da<00:02:43.280> but<00:02:44.280> you're<00:02:44.580> just<00:02:44.760> gonna<00:02:44.850> line

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
call them da but you're just gonna line

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.820 
call them da but you're just gonna line
up<00:02:45.209> on<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.570> walls<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.320> can<00:02:46.470> pry<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.709> in

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
up on the walls and you can pry it in

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.370 
up on the walls and you can pry it in
between<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.160> two<00:02:47.340> siding<00:02:48.030> walls<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.540> there's

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
between the two siding walls and there's

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.000 
between the two siding walls and there's
an<00:02:49.500> exact<00:02:49.920> replica<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.930> those<00:02:51.930> wall<00:02:52.739> glass

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
an exact replica of those wall glass

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.160 
an exact replica of those wall glass
things<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.209> get<00:02:54.390> over<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.900> over

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
things that you can get over to over

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.500 
things that you can get over to over
here<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.850> basically<00:02:56.850> just<00:02:57.120> hide<00:02:57.300> from

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
here and basically just hide from

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.900 
here and basically just hide from
infected<00:02:58.140> or<00:02:58.319> Michael<00:02:58.709> Mars<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.760> good

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
infected or Michael Mars it's a good

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.820 
infected or Michael Mars it's a good
spot<00:03:00.150> for<00:03:00.180> Michael<00:03:00.690> Mars<00:03:00.870> especially<00:03:01.530> because

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
spot for Michael Mars especially because

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.470 
spot for Michael Mars especially because
it<00:03:02.069> takes<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.430> while<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:02.610> Michael<00:03:03.090> Myers<00:03:03.239> to

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
it takes a while for Michael Myers to

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.780 
it takes a while for Michael Myers to
get<00:03:03.630> up<00:03:03.750> there<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:05.160> you're<00:03:05.340> at<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.640> edge

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
get up there and if you're at the edge

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.300 
get up there and if you're at the edge
then<00:03:06.209> you're<00:03:06.930> gonna<00:03:07.019> be<00:03:07.200> seeing<00:03:07.800> I'm<00:03:07.980> coming
