00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
with the FAA coming up with training

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.510 
with the FAA coming up with training
programs<00:01:02.440> first<00:01:03.440> we<00:01:03.680> were<00:01:03.770> able<00:01:04.009> to<00:01:04.040> do<00:01:04.250> flight

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
programs first we were able to do flight

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.820 
programs first we were able to do flight
training<00:01:04.880> for<00:01:05.149> pilots<00:01:05.390> in<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.899> aircraft<00:01:06.380> and

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
training for pilots in the aircraft and

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.130 
training for pilots in the aircraft and
we<00:01:06.950> continue<00:01:07.460> to<00:01:07.610> do<00:01:07.759> that<00:01:07.790> today<00:01:08.390> all<00:01:08.660> the<00:01:09.110> way

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
we continue to do that today all the way

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.020 
we continue to do that today all the way
up<00:01:09.380> through<00:01:09.530> type<00:01:09.770> ratings<00:01:10.190> in<00:01:10.340> both<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.640> f4

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
up through type ratings in both the f4

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.330 
up through type ratings in both the f4
and<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.570> a4<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.259> now<00:01:12.740> we're<00:01:12.920> able<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.160> take

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
and the a4 and now we're able to take

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.180 
and the a4 and now we're able to take
non<00:01:13.640> pilots<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:14.840> it's<00:01:15.320> quite<00:01:15.530> an<00:01:15.680> intensive

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
non pilots so it's quite an intensive

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.130 
non pilots so it's quite an intensive
course<00:01:16.399> it's<00:01:16.820> not<00:01:17.060> like<00:01:17.270> going<00:01:17.479> for<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.780> ride<00:01:17.930> on

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
course it's not like going for a ride on

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.990 
course it's not like going for a ride on
a<00:01:18.170> b-17<00:01:18.410> that<00:01:19.160> where<00:01:19.310> we're<00:01:19.460> used<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.789> doing

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
a b-17 that where we're used to doing

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.109 
a b-17 that where we're used to doing
and<00:01:20.300> it<00:01:20.899> is<00:01:21.020> very<00:01:21.799> interesting<00:01:22.310> for<00:01:23.060> the

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
and it is very interesting for the

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.969 
and it is very interesting for the
students<00:01:23.690> who<00:01:23.869> are<00:01:23.900> going<00:01:24.170> through<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:24.650> for

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
students who are going through this for

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.740 
students who are going through this for
the<00:01:25.040> participants<00:01:25.790> because<00:01:26.180> it's<00:01:26.330> much<00:01:26.510> more

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
the participants because it's much more

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.560 
the participants because it's much more
immersive<00:01:27.229> than<00:01:27.619> just<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.220> ride<00:01:28.369> right<00:01:29.360> now<00:01:29.510> we

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
immersive than just a ride right now we

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.240 
immersive than just a ride right now we
have<00:01:29.720> quite<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:29.960> backlog<00:01:30.409> for<00:01:30.650> people<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.070> go

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
have quite a backlog for people to go

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.130 
have quite a backlog for people to go
for<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:31.520> flight<00:01:31.850> there's<00:01:32.210> a<00:01:32.270> lot<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.750> interest

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
for a flight there's a lot of interest

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.440 
for a flight there's a lot of interest
in<00:01:33.290> these<00:01:33.409> aircraft<00:01:34.040> in<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.490> history<00:01:35.000> it

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
in these aircraft in the history it

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.000 
in these aircraft in the history it
certainly<00:01:35.900> is<00:01:36.229> one<00:01:36.260> of<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.650> most<00:01:36.830> iconic

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
in in the f4 phantom where we take it

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.870 
in in the f4 phantom where we take it
out<00:01:57.049> over<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.439> Gulf<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.770> Mexico<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.729> can
