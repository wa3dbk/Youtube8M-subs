00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.410
 other applications of what we're going to 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.739
 do with that dad noel then what 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.010
 first thing we're going to do is have a course 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.480
 the same white green red skin color and 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.440

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.010
 cord 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.879
 we need a ball of color number 4 and 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.230
 number 2 for the body and the head and what 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.850
 first thing we're going to do then is 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:06.280
 line the coconut ball and line the 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.390
 little head with skin color I'm going to 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.250
 teach how we will work the rockrose 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.250
 first we line the ball 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.159
 and we went 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.120
 the Korean brand 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.590
 then school and the 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.229
 so 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.320
 we take another little bit apart from another little ball 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.420
 that we're going to crush crush more than 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.759
 Milan 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.890
 to get this out that they are like 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.940
 cheeks 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.000
 of Santa Claus and we put it here 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.220
 and later 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.610
 we are just going to work and 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.610
 fulin 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.830
 we could not make the cheeks 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.830
 stay the way we think 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.360
 in that case the thanks with more 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.599
 patience plus thistle and then once 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.789
 dear everything we are going to catch and known 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.190
 they are simply last and we drag a 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.210
 bit 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.360
 what do you want 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.950
 well in this way 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:25.540
 as if I was scared well 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.549
 then we tie it here to the body 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.920
 the next thing we're going to do is take out 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.590
 two cylinders 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.460
 exact 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.400
 the legs 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.790
 let's take out with the black 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.069
 a little ball 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.010
 what are we going to do as 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.010
 an irrigation and we crush it 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.590
 after this then we are going to 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.050
 extend let's place the other the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.090
 leg on the narrowest side 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.870
 and see what we extend a little bit of 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.460
 black 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.740
 the black mass the cropped 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.740
 and we are going to put it here 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.770
 shape and then we paste the note 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.020
 that's how we are going to be, so the father does not 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.530
 let's put then 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.530
 legs 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.210
 comes the next step then we're going to 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.470
 put in the dune 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.470
 with a disc 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.210
 that it comes out as a tape type 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.970
 so that we take out the belt 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.800
 then we already have so we get to 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.560
 yours 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:11.180
 the tape then just simply 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.630
 we will place the belt well by the 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.170
 part of the waist 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.170
 from Santa Claus 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:26.530
 then we also take out with the same disk 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.530
 of the white 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.360
 and let's continue in this case double 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.360
 A) Yes 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.920
 that's where our father goes then 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.800
 let's make the other two cylinders 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.960
 More smalls 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.379
 for the arms and we're going to do the 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.379
 hands
