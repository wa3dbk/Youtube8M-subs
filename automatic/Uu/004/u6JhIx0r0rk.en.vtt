00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.970
 hello welcome to our 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.310
 new video 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.290
 Today we do not want to show you 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.300
 what we catch for fish or fish 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.040
 but it should be the one in this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.570
 video really only about the tactics 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.610
 Tricks and tips go 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.309
 we try to show you how 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.750
 we proceed on our waters yes it 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.420
 is a total of a pretty 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.890
 spontaneous night that was us too 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.270
 already somehow clear that we are not 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:52.739
 necessarily and save a lot 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:55.260
 I had it this morning it was one 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.790
 breathe because a lot of pressure is not there now 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.839
 made 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.150
 routes are now again we are one 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.100
 few hours here we hope it works 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.629
 maybe something else and how did we say 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.680
 make you stop at times as we ans 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.050
 approach the buttocks 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.610
 yes exactly and we have our tactics 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.220
 now we have recorded for you 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.260
 so a few added that we now 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.780
 see and we want you 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.270
 we just want to show you how 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.740
 We proceed on our waters and only 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.470
 because we do not have a fish now 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.810
 to have caught well think well 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.030
 but otherwise always very good 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.730
 worked out and we have the tactics 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.100
 now in together from the beginning of the year 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.220
 what you works best and you'll see that 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.220
 now 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.850
 now in this video you can see how 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.320
 we approached this knife now 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.210
 are at this station with which 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.160
 bait like they used to in 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.800
 which combinations like you fished 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.510
 So first we have to say in 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.050
 the night a consistently with large 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.820
 bait 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.980
 because we just want to avoid that 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.500
 smaller fish such as bream 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.420
 so we combine them then 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.150
 For example, with corn we have 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.220
 also pop up rice grains so the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.050
 cooler on the ground on pop in 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.670
 different colors with them now 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.710
 everything in the fall where the foliage on the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.140
 reason is a bit of the 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.880
 environment say I take off and that 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.100
 So think that the fish are the bait 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.230
 a little better then find one 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.600
 well-tried bait you certainly too 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.870
 know is cheerful the only disadvantage 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.700
 is that it dissolves very quickly 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.709
 we still fish in it most of the time 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.230
 We have a lot to do with the morning hours 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.750
 good experiences we have made 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.640
 actually no particle mix here as we 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.799
 So that's relatively bad experience 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.230
 have done at the beginning of the year 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.819
 We came here new in this club 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.650
 and then had to realize that one 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.319
 Particle mix with hemp and wheat does not 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.510
 Feeding is good because of that 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.549
 we are actually only using myspace and 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.730
 stop is there as that too 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.069
 Well, there is a lot going on under water 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.500
 also a pretty good cloud is created 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.500
 which attracts the fisherman even more 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.450
 so we want ours now 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.500
 Imagine assembly and that is what we have 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:16.220
 here I guess about 1 meter time is 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.989
 then a 90 grams lead and here comes 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.389
 then a quicklink would do that 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.210
 incidents hook blunt or so fast 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.490
 can exchange an antityp with it 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.389
 The whole thing is not tangled and here 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:33.020
 an approximately 20 cm long front fold 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:36.830
 down here then a sixth hook 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.120
 bulli with a pop up so 10 you yes 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.120
 Let's hope that brings something
