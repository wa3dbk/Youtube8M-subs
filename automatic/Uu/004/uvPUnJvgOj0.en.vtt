00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.760
 yes it caught me as well 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.540
 a mondeo and the hand creator 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.280
 Schloss suddenly did not open anymore 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.359
 I have a new part and worried 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.210
 I show up here got want 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:28.349
 I'm looking for after film rental so that looks 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.869
 part of how it works that the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:37.559
 new part 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:41.520
 Here the tongue is closed and I 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:46.079
 Search is under here in this housing 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.039
 and has the foot and a feather here 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.860
 that is when the part is broken 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.809
 and if you manage from below here 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.320
 to get here and you can do that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.690
 pull down the foot of the club 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.330
 connected then he gets the thing 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.909
 to taste on top 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.860
 in vain I could not do it 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.080
 apply 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.509
 The tolerances are also very close here 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.360
 The distance is also very tight and that 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.540
 You can not give up that easily 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.970
 That's why I would suggest here 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.570
 just to come in either by 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:37.079
 you make this broken by fatigue 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:42.740
 and takes away reading and he comes in and 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:45.329
 the trains here it is 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.100
 broken part so it turns out with me 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.110
 I tried that for a very long time 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.900
 about an hour 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:01.150
 I got it is to break away 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.030
 and so much fumbling, I have that up 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.770
 got only after I disassembled it 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.509
 I found out how the whole thing 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.300
 you just have to work here 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:16.230
 coming in and the time to you down 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.230
 and that was a lot of fun and a lot of success
