00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.219
 yes the case that a whole magazine at 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.870
 insurgency roloff we both have is 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.350
 tested a bit on what do you say 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.490
 to insurgency or to that he 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.039
 his whole magazine already for 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.810
 Ballack I think he's good for the game so 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.920
 the game said so much, it is a 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.189
 solid shooter right now 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.560
 came out is based on a mod 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.059
 the iss earlier was free and now has 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.340
 you develop the game a bit further 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.280
 and now sells it at steam for me 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.980
 think a decade packs or 13 euro 13 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.079
 euro ok 13 euro in the four pack there is 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.210
 indeed I believe to be about 38 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.469
 offer to the rotation exactly but what 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.600
 it is actually in the game 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.000
 what is tactical about ? 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.980
 not like any other 08 15 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.140
 school where you just ballast 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.920
 and we think you some survive 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.469
 but here 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.699
 when you are dead you are dead and you are dead 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.199
 You can not have so many balls 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.690
 endure like in another shooter 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.790
 so you have to act tactically small 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.900
 to divide the shot 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.900
 I think that's exactly what it is 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.090
 right game for people that one 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.100
 Little boredom have from the red orchestra 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.610
 2 for example forever tactical 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.330
 games 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.070
 it is graphically it is 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.140
 of course quite outdated if you 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.290
 the battlefield 3 opposite presents 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.549
 four or modern shooters but about it 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.560
 it is not at all important 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.450
 is that in contrast to these give 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.460
 called battlefield is the netcode 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.700
 very good because is quite based on the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.930
 source engine and basically what you do 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.829
 maybe that's what it's all about 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.759
 that competitive madness where 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.280
 you really where to put it 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.170
 seconds fractions arrives whether you are now 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.630
 another or he that one function 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.070
 as wonderful and that makes the appeal 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.409
 The game is fast 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.610
 it's direct it's tactical as well 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.729
 you also addressed through the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.700
 sprawling open webs thats one 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.909
 very good thing so many possibilities 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.439
 cover or go through any 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.590
 which sneak paths in the back of the 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.910
 wine comes on has become elements 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.039
 also waived as you can see so 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.150
 you just look straight in the picture 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.829
 nothing but the weapon as you see 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.290
 do not you see anything exactly so you have and 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.810
 a shot share your shot display 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.340
 his magazines and the time they are watching 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.079
 has expired and more so not 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.340
 So that's not even if you have someone 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.010
 is shot or shot 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.909
 by whom or who has shot dense 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.370
 exactly 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.780
 and in contrast to red orchestra that yes 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.299
 it has already been mentioned 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.739
 not a hammer-hard simulation 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.170
 but it is rather a bit 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.769
 arcadia so rather in the direction counter 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.060
 strike for example just like you 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.030
 You look different too 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.909
 classes for example support the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.730
 so mature the sniper player or 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:57.209
 other classes for example the with 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.709
 the pumpgun and the whole is right 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.299
 funny so you really can 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.799
 throw down different tactics 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.500
 There are only a few 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.510
 Limited number like many players one 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.430
 can not play class like so 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.799
 For example, battlefield needs something like that 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.720
 you are very good and also the arsenal of weapons 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.209
 can be fully populated as well 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.139
 which is always fashionable today 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.729
 By the way, all the weapons all 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.729
 Weapons exception very modern 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:23.099
 as well as the whole scenario because 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:24.989
 insurgency that basically means that 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.239
 the uprising went an authoritarian 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.979
 existing system so fight in the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.650
 reason it can be said terrorists 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.650
 give a leading faction
