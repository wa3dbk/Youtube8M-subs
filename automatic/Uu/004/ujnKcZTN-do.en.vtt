00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 but you are welcome to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.940
 a video about that I say 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.680
 technically most exciting ship in the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.300
 this year still starts and that the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.349
 quantum of the seas of royal caribbean 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.540
 international 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.370
 and now there are still several technical ones 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.719
 I announce innovations 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.100
 very exciting and not you 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.050
 especially if so wants 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.930
 technically interested is like me yes 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.449
 well, let's start it will be like this in the future 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.880
 be if you have booked a trip 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.830
 then you can almost do the check-in 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.330
 largely online before 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.859
 example you can upload your photo 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.809
 So it will not be on the pier anymore 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.700
 or did and you'll get 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.129
 a time to meet her 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.629
 and then promises holger bien vom pier 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.170
 it is only 10 o'clock on the ship 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.969
 take maximum minutes then get the 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.860
 a rfid tag and so on 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.420
 they can be located on the ship 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.730
 So you learn when their on the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.770
 ship since when your suitcase in the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.809
 Cabin is so very exciting then there 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.480
 It will take these bracelets in the future 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.010
 boarding pass to pay or around 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.989
 Cabin to come but I think that is 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.579
 an optional so that's not nothing 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.220
 but forcibly, I am quite sure 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.110
 that this is the cruze planner so 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.060
 there is no paper program anymore 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.280
 If I'm the boss of loose 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.810
 have understood correctly but that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.760
 Can you stay there on the brought 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.770
 smartphone or tablet yourself then 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.229
 can look at like the trip to 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.299
 So book everything very practical and you 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.830
 saves a lot of paper 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.930
 These are the station where I am here 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.930
 For example, you can book excursions 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.950
 this shows the satellite coverage 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.690
 the vendor on revue networks this 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.920
 Provider should be incredibly fast 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.400
 enable internet 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.930
 on board the quantum of the seas so it 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.730
 should be considerably faster than all 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.020
 what you already know and become 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.490
 There are also cheaper prices 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.070
 not yet solid but so far in the north 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.990
 you see , it is not so here 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.190
 somehow with Spain or something 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.050
 So let's go much further north 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.390
 It was not working 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.960
 so here is the 3 jannik bader 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.729
 become 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.680
 you hardly believe it from robots 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.050
 cocktails mixed so an exciting 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.119
 betting becomes technology 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.679
 like me that will live 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.880
 However, there is no bartender there 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.220
 sometimes a little more restrict 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.990
 the little bit more alcohol that there is 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.750
 Of course it is not that here are the ones 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.739
 so-called robus greens namely in 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.750
 this very exciting lounge before seventy 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.060
 and whatever is shown there but 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.620
 I think these screens are 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.930
 just the hammer this is one 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.510
 inside cabin with a virtual balcony 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.890
 looks about two meters in diameter 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.780
 Here we have to go really well 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.790
 if that's really good in real life, too 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.739
 looks and how that feels easy 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.989
 So that's just what you have to experience 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.120
 I think, but have a more exciting 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.670
 approach to get rid of the inside cabins 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.230
 So if you liked that and you 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.700
 say so I would like the same 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.930
 drive off then click the link in 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.910
 the video description there is one 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.620
 few offers for the quantum of the seas 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.690
 and that you support my work 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.790
 and gives the whole a thumbs up 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.000
 and I would say until next time 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.000
 bye
