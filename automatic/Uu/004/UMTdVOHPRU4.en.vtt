all<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:22.099> way<00:02:22.220> out<00:02:24.099> but<00:02:25.099> I<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.220> have<00:02:25.459> them

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
all the way out but I just have them

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.339 
all the way out but I just have them
propped<00:02:26.030> up<00:02:26.239> here<00:02:26.450> right<00:02:26.629> now<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.870> have<00:02:27.200> them

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
propped up here right now I have them

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.039 
propped up here right now I have them
cut<00:02:27.560> out<00:02:27.590> still<00:02:28.580> have<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.819> actually<00:02:29.720> build<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
cut out still have to actually build the

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.119 
cut out still have to actually build the
framework<00:02:30.500> for<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:31.480> which<00:02:32.480> will<00:02:32.690> come<00:02:32.840> off

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
framework for it which will come off

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.170 
framework for it which will come off
right<00:02:34.129> through<00:02:34.400> here<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:36.670> have<00:02:37.670> this<00:02:37.849> section

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
right through here I have this section

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.030 
right through here I have this section
over<00:02:38.480> here<00:02:39.579> and<00:02:40.780> then<00:02:41.780> as<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.170> can<00:02:42.290> see

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.080 

there's<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.510> walls<00:02:47.510> framed<00:02:47.900> up<00:02:48.230> and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
there's the walls framed up and

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.580 
there's the walls framed up and
basically<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.299> reason<00:02:50.599> for<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.870> when<00:02:51.500> this

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
basically the reason for that when this

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.610 
basically the reason for that when this
plan<00:02:51.920> was<00:02:52.549> Trek<00:02:52.819> plan<00:02:53.090> was<00:02:53.329> uh<00:02:53.359> was<00:02:54.140> designed

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
plan was Trek plan was uh was designed

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.559 
plan was Trek plan was uh was designed
it<00:02:55.340> was<00:02:55.400> designed<00:02:55.879> with<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.030> lot<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.359> view

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
it was designed with a lot of view

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.020 
it was designed with a lot of view
blocks<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.799> give<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.129> appearance<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.730> it's

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
blocks to give the appearance that it's

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.729 
blocks to give the appearance that it's
a<00:02:59.120> larger<00:02:59.510> layout<00:02:59.900> than<00:03:00.170> what<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.410> really<00:03:00.440> is

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
a larger layout than what it really is

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.930 
a larger layout than what it really is
and<00:03:01.269> with<00:03:02.269> these<00:03:02.450> walls<00:03:03.790> basically<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:04.879> was

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
and with these walls basically I was

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.149 
and with these walls basically I was
supposed<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.480> have<00:03:05.599> a<00:03:05.659> seven-foot<00:03:06.319> high<00:03:06.590> view

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
supposed to have a seven-foot high view

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.539 
supposed to have a seven-foot high view
block<00:03:07.400> until<00:03:08.269> you<00:03:08.629> entered<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.739> layout

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
block until you entered the the layout

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.330 
block until you entered the the layout
so<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.500> figured<00:03:12.500> what<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.680> heck<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.069> might<00:03:13.250> as

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
so I figured what the heck I might as

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.710 
so I figured what the heck I might as
well<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.609> frame<00:03:13.849> up<00:03:14.060> walls<00:03:14.359> and<00:03:15.609> separate

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
well just frame up walls and separate

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.809 
well just frame up walls and separate
basically<00:03:17.720> from<00:03:17.959> from<00:03:18.500> my<00:03:18.680> entrance<00:03:18.859> there<00:03:19.370> to

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
basically from from my entrance there to

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.699 
basically from from my entrance there to
my<00:03:19.940> house<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:23.120> that's<00:03:23.599> that's<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.260> reason<00:03:24.560> for

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
my house so that's that's the reason for

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.490 
my house so that's that's the reason for
the<00:03:24.829> framed<00:03:25.549> up<00:03:25.760> walls<00:03:26.859> but<00:03:27.859> I<00:03:28.370> still<00:03:28.970> have<00:03:29.180> to

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
the framed up walls but I still have to

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.309 
the framed up walls but I still have to
start<00:03:30.500> along<00:03:30.680> here<00:03:31.069> and<00:03:31.790> we<00:03:32.750> will<00:03:32.959> come<00:03:33.200> across

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
start along here and we will come across

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.650 
start along here and we will come across
all<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.069> way<00:03:34.160> across<00:03:34.519> here<00:03:36.669> go<00:03:37.669> around<00:03:38.120> the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
all the way across here go around the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.770 
all the way across here go around the
corner<00:03:39.079> here<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.910> then<00:03:40.910> there'll<00:03:41.180> be<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.359> left

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
corner here and then there'll be a left

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.270 
corner here and then there'll be a left
out<00:03:42.019> right<00:03:42.400> across<00:03:43.400> here<00:03:44.859> it<00:03:45.859> connects<00:03:46.250> to

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
out right across here it connects to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.970 
out right across here it connects to
this<00:03:46.489> and<00:03:46.819> then<00:03:47.599> of<00:03:47.840> course<00:03:48.109> my<00:03:48.290> staving<00:03:48.769> yard

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
this and then of course my staving yard

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.110 
this and then of course my staving yard
will<00:03:49.280> be<00:03:50.109> coming<00:03:51.109> through<00:03:51.139> this<00:03:51.470> wall<00:03:51.910> all<00:03:52.910> the

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
will be coming through this wall all the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.800 
will be coming through this wall all the
way<00:03:53.269> across<00:03:53.989> here<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:55.010> that<00:03:55.160> wall<00:03:55.690> which<00:03:56.690> will

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
way across here to that wall which will

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.509 
way across here to that wall which will
also<00:03:57.049> be<00:03:57.199> lift<00:03:58.010> outs<00:03:58.220> in<00:03:58.489> there<00:04:01.510> but<00:04:03.519> that's

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
also be lift outs in there but that's

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.870 
also be lift outs in there but that's
where<00:04:04.819> I'm<00:04:04.910> at<00:04:05.030> right<00:04:05.090> now

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
where I'm at right now

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.070 
where I'm at right now
actually<00:04:07.880> I<00:04:07.910> feel<00:04:08.120> like<00:04:08.300> I've<00:04:08.480> gotten<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.900> lot

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
actually I feel like I've gotten a lot

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.720 
actually I feel like I've gotten a lot
on<00:04:10.300> this<00:04:11.300> on<00:04:11.630> this<00:04:11.840> video<00:04:12.220> so<00:04:13.480> as<00:04:14.480> we<00:04:14.690> looked<00:04:14.960> I

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
on this on this video so as we looked I

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.920 
on this on this video so as we looked I
had<00:04:17.200> right<00:04:18.200> here<00:04:18.590> is<00:04:19.310> my<00:04:19.610> framed<00:04:19.910> up<00:04:20.120> wall<00:04:20.360> and

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
had right here is my framed up wall and

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.500 
had right here is my framed up wall and
instead<00:04:21.530> of<00:04:21.590> going<00:04:21.890> catty<00:04:22.670> cornered<00:04:23.150> I<00:04:23.240> just

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
instead of going catty cornered I just

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.470 
instead of going catty cornered I just
brought<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:23.990> straight<00:04:24.260> across<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:25.010> then<00:04:25.480> my

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
brought it straight across and then my

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.940 
brought it straight across and then my
other<00:04:26.570> framed<00:04:26.930> up<00:04:27.050> walls<00:04:27.260> there<00:04:27.530> there's<00:04:27.800> the

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
other framed up walls there there's the

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.470 
other framed up walls there there's the
entrance<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.430> my<00:04:28.460> house<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:29.030> this<00:04:29.090> is<00:04:29.300> the

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
entrance to my house and this is the

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.870 
entrance to my house and this is the
staging<00:04:29.930> yard<00:04:30.290> so<00:04:31.100> now<00:04:31.220> you<00:04:31.280> kind<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.640> get<00:04:31.790> an

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
staging yard so now you kind of get an

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.400 
staging yard so now you kind of get an
idea<00:04:32.180> where<00:04:32.360> we're<00:04:32.510> at<00:04:32.600> you<00:04:32.870> know<00:04:32.900> I'm<00:04:33.140> all<00:04:33.320> the

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
idea where we're at you know I'm all the

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.230 
idea where we're at you know I'm all the
way<00:04:33.500> around<00:04:33.740> here<00:04:33.950> this<00:04:34.070> is<00:04:34.220> my<00:04:34.340> rock<00:04:34.610> wall<00:04:34.940> in

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
way around here this is my rock wall in

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.990 
way around here this is my rock wall in
the<00:04:35.330> rock<00:04:35.540> corner<00:04:36.310> coming<00:04:37.310> along<00:04:37.520> this<00:04:37.730> wall

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
the rock corner coming along this wall

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.450 
the rock corner coming along this wall
and<00:04:38.660> like<00:04:39.380> I<00:04:39.410> said<00:04:39.620> there's<00:04:39.770> my<00:04:39.920> peninsula

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
and like I said there's my peninsula

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.230 
and like I said there's my peninsula
which<00:04:40.640> will<00:04:40.820> be<00:04:40.970> coming<00:04:41.180> off<00:04:41.800> right<00:04:42.800> here<00:04:43.240> this

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
which will be coming off right here this

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.300 
which will be coming off right here this
peninsula<00:04:44.540> here<00:04:45.140> so<00:04:45.650> I<00:04:45.710> still<00:04:45.950> need<00:04:46.100> to<00:04:46.190> do

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
peninsula here so I still need to do

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.790 
peninsula here so I still need to do
this<00:04:46.490> peninsula<00:04:46.790> yet<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.480> this<00:04:48.380> section

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
this peninsula yet and this section
