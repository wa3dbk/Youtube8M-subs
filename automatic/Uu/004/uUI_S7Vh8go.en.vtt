00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.900 
and the light 209 in their 3.0 lineup if
you<00:00:19.020> recall<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.350> few<00:00:19.470> years<00:00:19.859> ago<00:00:20.010> they<00:00:20.550> launched

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
you recall a few years ago they launched

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.210 
you recall a few years ago they launched
the<00:00:21.029> form<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.420> dynamic<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:22.080> light<00:00:22.260> 209<00:00:22.740> to

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the form of dynamic in light 209 to

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.250 
the form of dynamic in light 209 to
cover<00:00:23.400> off<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.760> gap<00:00:23.939> between<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.660> glider<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
cover off the gap between the glider and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.640 
cover off the gap between the glider and
the<00:00:25.980> pro<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.490> former<00:00:27.300> was<00:00:27.420> unpadded<00:00:27.779> great

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the pro the former was unpadded great

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.560 
the pro the former was unpadded great
for<00:00:28.859> folks<00:00:29.099> who<00:00:29.519> liked<00:00:29.670> firm<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.390> light

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
for folks who liked firm and light

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.110 
for folks who liked firm and light
saddles<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.710> dynamic<00:00:32.130> offered<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.579> good

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
saddles the dynamic offered a good

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.030 
saddles the dynamic offered a good
amount<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.390> padding<00:00:33.600> very<00:00:34.260> similar<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.890> their

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
amount of padding very similar to their

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.830 
amount of padding very similar to their
evolution<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.149> wasn't<00:00:36.360> quite<00:00:36.420> soft

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
evolution but it wasn't quite soft

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.690 
evolution but it wasn't quite soft
enough<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.260> folks<00:00:37.649> who<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.070> tender<00:00:38.489> sit

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
enough for folks who have tender sit

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.389 
enough for folks who have tender sit
bones<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.809> light<00:00:39.960> 209<00:00:40.440> has<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> good<00:00:41.309> amount

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399

bones so the light 209 has a good amount
of<00:00:41.610> padding<00:00:41.840> but<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.680> may<00:00:43.920> find<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.430> the

you<00:02:21.030> have<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.480> limitation<00:02:22.319> on<00:02:22.470> saddlebags

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
you have a limitation on saddlebags

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.520 
you have a limitation on saddlebags
because<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.120> design<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.569> rails<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:25.049> lot

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
because of the design of the rails a lot

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.979 
because of the design of the rails a lot
of<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.769> hard<00:02:26.220> clamp<00:02:26.700> on<00:02:26.879> types<00:02:27.180> aren't

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.899 
of the hard clamp on types aren't
supported<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:28.799> recommend<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.430> use<00:02:29.519> a

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
supported so I recommend that you use a

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.009 
supported so I recommend that you use a
saddle<00:02:30.269> bag<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.540> has<00:02:30.659> a<00:02:30.690> velcro<00:02:31.379> strap<00:02:31.409> to<00:02:31.950> it

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
saddle bag that has a velcro strap to it

of<00:02:34.019> course<00:02:34.319> my<00:02:35.040> only<00:02:35.310> downside<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.970> these

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
of course my only downside to these

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.030 
of course my only downside to these
saddles<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.720> typically<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.260> weight<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.769> lot

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
saddles is typically the weight is a lot

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.940 
saddles is typically the weight is a lot
heavier<00:02:38.400> at<00:02:38.849> 310<00:02:39.599> grams<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:40.349> Drakon<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.829> on

heavier at 310 grams the Drakon is on

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.710 
heavier at 310 grams the Drakon is on
the<00:02:41.069> heavier<00:02:41.489> side<00:02:41.549> when<00:02:42.239> we<00:02:42.329> have<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> lot<00:02:42.690> of

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
the heavier side when we have a lot of

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.800 
the heavier side when we have a lot of
saddles<00:02:43.079> coming<00:02:43.319> in<00:02:43.440> between<00:02:43.560> 150<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.810> 220

saddles coming in between 150 and 220
grams<00:02:46.099> however<00:02:47.099> you're<00:02:47.549> not<00:02:47.730> going<00:02:47.879> to<00:02:47.940> find<00:02:48.120> a

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
grams however you're not going to find a

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.110 
grams however you're not going to find a
saddle<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.690> more<00:02:48.900> anatomically<00:02:49.799> correct

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
saddle that is more anatomically correct

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.690 
saddle that is more anatomically correct
so<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.239> weight<00:02:51.450> may<00:02:52.349> be<00:02:52.379> a<00:02:52.530> factor<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.160> I'd

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
so the weight may be a factor but I'd

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.099 
so the weight may be a factor but I'd
highly<00:02:53.970> suggest<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.540> talk<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.900> us<00:02:54.989> about

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
highly suggest that you talk to us about

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.530 
highly suggest that you talk to us about
