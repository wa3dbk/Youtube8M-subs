00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
like for a while it's kind of like in a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.230 
like for a while it's kind of like in a
nail<00:00:25.439> phase<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.039> guess<00:00:26.220> now<00:00:26.460> I'm<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:27.090> issue

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
phase which is kind of unfortunate

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.939 
phase which is kind of unfortunate

much cheaper in there's less competition

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.250 
much cheaper in there's less competition

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
guys can see it has like a little bit of

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.219 
guys can see it has like a little bit of
a<00:01:10.950> chunky<00:01:11.400> wedge<00:01:11.640> heel<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.020> like

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
a chunky wedge heel and like this like

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.530 
a chunky wedge heel and like this like
black<00:01:13.500> strappy<00:01:14.340> part<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.210> goes<00:01:15.360> around

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
black strappy part that like goes around

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.289 
black strappy part that like goes around
your<00:01:15.810> feet<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.320> ankle<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.850> they're<00:01:18.090> probably

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
your feet and ankle so they're probably

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
your feet and ankle so they're probably
not<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:18.810> cute<00:01:19.140> from<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> front<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.890> think

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
not as cute from the front I think

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.920 
not as cute from the front I think
they're<00:01:20.310> less<00:01:20.909> cute<00:01:21.270> from<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.450> front<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
they're less cute from the front but I

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.420 
they're less cute from the front but I
could<00:01:22.080> get<00:01:22.200> pretty<00:01:22.320> cute<00:01:22.650> from<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.890> side<00:01:23.130> from

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
could get pretty cute from the side from

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.890 
could get pretty cute from the side from
the<00:01:23.729> side<00:01:23.970> they<00:01:24.150> look<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the side they look just like the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.330 
the side they look just like the
