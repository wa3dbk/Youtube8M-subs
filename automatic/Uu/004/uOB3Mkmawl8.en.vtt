board I do find Borland's OOP is equal

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.970 
board I do find Borland's OOP is equal
overall<00:00:42.480> I'd<00:00:42.690> say<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> good<00:00:43.110> game<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.500> enjoy

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
I enjoy berlin's to I enjoyed this game

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.770 
I enjoy berlin's to I enjoyed this game
but<00:00:46.739> there<00:00:46.950> are<00:00:47.100> flaws<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> want<00:00:48.510> to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
but there are flaws in it that I want to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.979 
but there are flaws in it that I want to
mention<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.410> bring<00:00:50.039> out<00:00:50.480> these<00:00:51.480> flaws<00:00:51.750> are

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
mention and bring out these flaws are

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.110 
mention and bring out these flaws are
highlighted<00:00:52.710> significantly<00:00:53.610> by<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.879> fact

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
highlighted significantly by the fact

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.660 
highlighted significantly by the fact
that<00:00:54.239> Borderlands<00:00:54.960> 2<00:00:55.110> came<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:55.920> before<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that Borderlands 2 came out before and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.700 
that Borderlands 2 came out before and
it<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.030> very<00:00:57.329> similar<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.690> Borland's<00:00:58.170> 2<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.620> you

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it is very similar to Borland's 2 so you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.400 
it is very similar to Borland's 2 so you
can<00:00:58.949> compare<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.489> how<00:01:00.449> each<00:01:00.690> game<00:01:00.960> compact

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
can compare the how each game compact

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.260 
can compare the how each game compact
matches<00:01:02.309> up<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> each<00:01:02.640> other<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.909> first<00:01:05.909> things

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
matches up to each other so first things

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.380 
matches up to each other so first things
first<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:07.290> want<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> talk<00:01:07.890> about<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:09.030> well

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
first I want to talk about the well

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.060 
first I want to talk about the well
actually<00:01:09.450> yet<00:01:09.810> first<00:01:10.380> things<00:01:10.560> first<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.920> going

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
actually yet first things first is going

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.250 
actually yet first things first is going
to<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> endgame<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.850> main<00:01:12.479> thing<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.049> see

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
to be the endgame the main thing I see

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.990 
to be the endgame the main thing I see
as<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.619> problem<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.549> Borland's<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
as a problem with Borland's the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.440 
as a problem with Borland's the
pre-sequel

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
pre-sequel

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.410 
pre-sequel
is<00:01:15.600> its<00:01:15.900> end<00:01:16.200> game<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> variety<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.939> reasons

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
is its end game for a variety of reasons

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.020 
is its end game for a variety of reasons
now<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> story<00:01:19.320> most<00:01:20.070> people<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.460> think<00:01:20.490> like

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
now the story most people I think like

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.810 
now the story most people I think like
the<00:01:21.180> story<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:22.170> enjoyable<00:01:22.500> overall<00:01:23.430> some

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the story it's enjoyable overall some

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
the story it's enjoyable overall some
people<00:01:24.000> might<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.200> don't

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
people might not like it but I don't

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.740 
people might not like it but I don't
think<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.340> suffers<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:26.820> much<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.570> end

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
think that that suffers as much the end

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.170 
think that that suffers as much the end
games<00:01:27.960> where<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.860> game<00:01:29.610> doesn't

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
games where I think this game doesn't

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.080 
games where I think this game doesn't
hold<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.020> its<00:01:31.200> predecessor<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:31.950> where<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
hold up to its predecessor or where it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.760 
hold up to its predecessor or where it
should<00:01:33.360> address<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> standalone<00:01:34.439> game

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
should address as a standalone game

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
should address as a standalone game
since<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.340> gets<00:01:35.490> boring<00:01:36.799> now<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:39.119> end<00:01:39.540> game<00:01:39.750> of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
since it gets boring now the end game of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.469 
since it gets boring now the end game of

it's laziness that's what I like
laziness<00:06:34.810> to<00:06:34.960> me<00:06:35.050> that<00:06:35.259> the<00:06:35.440> developers<00:06:36.070> would

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250

just carry over so many legendary

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.580 
just carry over so many legendary
and<00:06:40.510> a<00:06:40.690> good<00:06:40.810> amount<00:06:41.020> of<00:06:41.050> those<00:06:41.200> legendary

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
and a good amount of those legendary

Zardoz<00:06:42.070> renamed<00:06:42.640> and<00:06:42.970> reskin<00:06:43.740> and<00:06:44.740> a<00:06:45.040> lot<00:06:45.310> of

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
Zardoz renamed and reskin and a lot of

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.850 
Zardoz renamed and reskin and a lot of
not<00:06:46.390> reskin<00:06:46.810> that<00:06:47.020> much<00:06:47.230> like<00:06:47.560> they<00:06:47.650> look

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
not reskin that much like they look

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.450 
not reskin that much like they look
really<00:06:48.310> close<00:06:48.490> to<00:06:48.610> the<00:06:48.700> same<00:06:48.850> so<00:06:49.780> the<00:06:50.160> I<00:06:51.160> guess

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
really close to the same so the I guess

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.960 
really close to the same so the I guess
that's<00:06:51.640> three<00:06:51.880> points<00:06:52.450> the<00:06:53.070> limit<00:06:54.070> of<00:06:54.220> bosses

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
that's three points the limit of bosses

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.020 
that's three points the limit of bosses
well<00:06:55.870> I<00:06:55.960> guess<00:06:56.170> again<00:06:56.710> correlation<00:06:57.370> and<00:06:57.580> the

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
well I guess again correlation and the

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.520 
well I guess again correlation and the
the<00:06:58.960> limit<00:06:59.200> of<00:06:59.260> bosses<00:07:00.000> with<00:07:01.000> the<00:07:01.530> grinding

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
the limit of bosses with the grinding

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.050 
the limit of bosses with the grinding
and<00:07:02.980> bought<00:07:04.200> and/or<00:07:05.200> JIRA<00:07:05.530> farming<00:07:06.340> because
