another mock video on
well<00:00:06.569> another<00:00:06.870> mock<00:00:07.280> this<00:00:08.280> time<00:00:08.580> it's<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.059> tour

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
well another mock this time it's a tour

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.890 
well another mock this time it's a tour
bus<00:00:09.990> as<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.500> can<00:00:10.620> see<00:00:11.509> I've<00:00:12.509> never<00:00:12.780> really

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
bus as you can see I've never really

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.189 
bus as you can see I've never really
made<00:00:13.320> any<00:00:13.349> buses<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.429> well<00:00:15.240> I've<00:00:15.690> never<00:00:15.839> really

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
made any buses in well I've never really

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.609 
made any buses in well I've never really
made<00:00:16.980> any<00:00:17.010> like<00:00:17.670> at<00:00:17.850> all<00:00:18.080> so<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.109> figured<00:00:19.500> this

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
made any like at all so I figured this

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.900 
made any like at all so I figured this
will<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.830> something<00:00:20.100> little<00:00:20.160> bit<00:00:20.490> different

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
will be something little bit different

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.269 
will be something little bit different
to<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.180> since<00:00:21.990> I'm<00:00:22.140> getting<00:00:22.260> into<00:00:22.590> vehicles

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
to do since I'm getting into vehicles

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.920 
to do since I'm getting into vehicles

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
more but yeah I just built this actually

more but yeah I just built this actually
yesterday<00:00:28.640> finished<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.789> today<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.960> just

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
yesterday finished it today so just

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.030 
yesterday finished it today so just
gonna<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:31.980> showing<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.489> guys<00:00:33.260> real<00:00:34.260> quick

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.860 

as<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.910> normal<00:00:39.329> tour

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870

bus<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.170> made<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.440> eight<00:00:40.620> studs<00:00:40.950> wide<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:42.440> think

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
bus I made it eight studs wide I think

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.069 
bus I made it eight studs wide I think
it<00:00:44.520> does<00:00:44.850> why<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.059> would<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.719> know<00:00:45.809> enough

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
it does why it would be you know enough

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.500 
it does why it would be you know enough
I<00:00:46.320> don't<00:00:46.649> really<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.309> many<00:00:48.270> pieces

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
I don't really have that many pieces

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.790 
I don't really have that many pieces

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
because I still have a whole bunch of

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
because I still have a whole bunch of
mocks<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.780> vehicle<00:00:52.440> mocks<00:00:52.649> still<00:00:53.370> bill<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820

weight<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.549> bus<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.909> so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
weight just because the bus is so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.219 
weight just because the bus is so
massive<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.659> has<00:01:28.619> eight<00:01:28.950> wheels<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.610> total<00:01:30.229> two

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
see inside the bus a little bit looks

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.120 
see inside the bus a little bit looks
pretty<00:01:47.460> cool<00:01:47.930> mirrors<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.350> didn't<00:01:49.979> make<00:01:50.070> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
pretty cool mirrors I didn't make it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.410 
pretty cool mirrors I didn't make it
tents<00:01:50.430> that's<00:01:50.640> why<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> thought<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.149> would<00:01:51.360> be

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
tents that's why I thought that would be

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.929 
tents that's why I thought that would be
just<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> little<00:01:51.810> bit<00:01:51.960> too<00:01:52.110> big<00:01:52.909> normally<00:01:53.909> I

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
just a little bit too big normally I

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.109 
just a little bit too big normally I
would<00:01:54.270> make<00:01:54.479> my<00:01:54.659> stuff<00:01:55.079> tends<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.470> divide<00:01:56.119> or

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
would make my stuff tends to divide or

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.480 
would make my stuff tends to divide or
eight<00:01:57.810> studs<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.439> ten<00:01:58.649> stilts<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.070> usually<00:01:59.399> make
