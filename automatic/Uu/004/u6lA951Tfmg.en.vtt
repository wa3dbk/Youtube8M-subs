 so today actually I'm talking to you 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.380
 a subject that may interest you 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.240
 especially since I have you 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.820
 will resume to stop a body aches 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.770
 muscular and you will see that he 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.520
 there are tips very very simple with 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.520
 essential oils 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.680
 so it's true he never 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.750
 suffered muscle aches 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.550
 was not only athletes 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.899
 I still remember there are two 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.550
 three years when I took over the sport and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.879
 there actually during my first 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.410
 sessions 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.780
 I felt a few 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.940
 muscle aches in the back there 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.840
 must also prepare to prepare to make a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.300
 warming up etc 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.010
 it's not the subject of today but 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.840
 also during a fatigue actually 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.770
 during an illness we can have 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.930
 muscle aches 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.420
 mega man during a pretty effort 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.680
 especially when you started 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.610
 feel pain at the level 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.560
 muscular 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.520
 so how exactly do this 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.350
 that we macho muscular 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.750
 appear after prolonged effort 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.250
 or quite unusual and 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.630
 unfortunately it can be felt 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.460
 a single day is very very good 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.720
 but unfortunately killer fights 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.939
 can the pains of stiffness 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.130
 can be felt over a period of 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.890
 five or even seven days 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.220
 and they can also result from a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.110
 number 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.490
 of diseases in fact like for example the 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.900
 influenza or hepatitis 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.730
 what is it actually a 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.070
 curvature to make very very fast 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.990
 it's just a micro trauma to 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.870
 level of the muscle fibers that are going 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.730
 slightly tear and once in 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.250
 actually does restore these fibers 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.680
 muscles as quickly as possible 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.690
 in particular one can bring in 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.520
 food and especially meals 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.780
 rich in protein we will see 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.490
 now what are the oils 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.280
 essential and vegetable oils that 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.250
 you will be able to use to say 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.200
 quickly relieve the pain associated with 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.520
 muscle aches a few 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.050
 advice of course to avoid 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.300
 muscle aches only what you 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.740
 be sporty that you have planned time 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.380
 to make a move to have to 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.570
 carry larger loads than 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.240
 usually where you are led to do 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.940
 unusual punctual gestures well 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.550
 always prepare yourself for a session 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.540
 warm up ten minutes per month 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.220
 month when I go to gym 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.660
 for ten minutes I put myself on a 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.250
 bike a rower no matter 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.410
 and then I really do movements 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.570
 slow for 10 minutes allowing me 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.250
 to start heating up the muscles and 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.930
 that's really something very 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.500
 very very important then the first 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.120
 recipe 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.590
 because you have to know that oils 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.980
 we can use them before and after 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.110
 effort 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.430
 we can do the preventive with a 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.380
 little recipe of a massage oil 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.180

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.890
 vegetable oil with 5 drops of rosemary 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.750

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.080

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.670
 muscular effort by massaging your 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.230

 it is by the essence of lemon 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.520

 and well actually I made him a 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:41.080
 massage with this massa lotion and that 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.450
