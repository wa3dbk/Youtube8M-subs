example another like a zune or whatever

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.700 
example another like a zune or whatever
maybe<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.240> kind<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.659> lot<00:01:07.259> of<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> general

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
maybe but kind of the lot of the general

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.380 
maybe but kind of the lot of the general
population<00:01:07.759> doesn't<00:01:08.759> believe<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.149> get<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
population doesn't believe you get the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.260 
population doesn't believe you get the
same<00:01:09.570> quality<00:01:10.170> songs<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.460> an<00:01:11.700> actual<00:01:11.880> device

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
same quality songs on an actual device

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.490 
same quality songs on an actual device
and<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:12.780> where<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:12.990> came<00:01:13.200> out<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.439> a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and that's where we came out with a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.380 
and that's where we came out with a
technology<00:01:14.070> called<00:01:14.189> clear<00:01:14.460> audio<00:01:14.700> clear

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
technology called clear audio clear

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.539 
technology called clear audio clear
audio<00:01:15.689> basically<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:16.829> it<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.219> can<00:01:17.369> see

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
audio basically what it is you can see

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.550 
audio basically what it is you can see
this<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.789> Sony<00:01:18.060> Walkman<00:01:18.479> devices<00:01:18.899> as<00:01:19.049> well<00:01:19.079> it

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
this on Sony Walkman devices as well it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.630 
this on Sony Walkman devices as well it
guarantees<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.939> best<00:01:21.320> sound<00:01:22.320> quality

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
guarantees the best sound quality

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.469 
guarantees the best sound quality
experience<00:01:23.640> from<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.909> consumer<00:01:24.270> standpoint

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
experience from the consumer standpoint

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.630 
experience from the consumer standpoint
so<00:01:24.780> basically<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.469> filters<00:01:26.130> out<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so basically it filters out the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.340 
so basically it filters out the
crosstalk<00:01:27.509> between<00:01:27.539> left<00:01:28.079> and<00:01:28.200> right

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
crosstalk between left and right

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.170 
crosstalk between left and right
channels<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.009> make<00:01:29.399> sure<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.700> frequency

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
channels and make sure your frequency

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.550 
channels and make sure your frequency
range<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.570> best<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.140> you're<00:01:31.289> listening

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
range is the best so if you're listening

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.679 
range is the best so if you're listening
to<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.859> high<00:01:32.189> bass<00:01:32.490> track<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> most

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
to a high bass track you get the most

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.359 
to a high bass track you get the most
out<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.899> it<00:01:34.049> right<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.799> that's<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.219> of<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
out of it right so that's kind of the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.770 
out of it right so that's kind of the
big<00:01:36.049> music<00:01:37.049> side<00:01:37.469> of<00:01:37.619> things<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:39.420> doesn't

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
big music side of things but it doesn't

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.230 
big music side of things but it doesn't
mix<00:01:39.899> stuff<00:01:40.109> so<00:01:40.320> flat<00:01:40.710> no<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> idea

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
mix stuff so flat no and that's the idea

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.999 
mix stuff so flat no and that's the idea
is<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.659> get<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.079> full<00:01:43.350> range<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
is you get that full range you have the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.520 
is you get that full range you have the
highest<00:01:44.219> frequency<00:01:44.880> range<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.929> a<00:01:46.049> device<00:01:46.289> so

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
highest frequency range in a device so

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.959 
highest frequency range in a device so
you're<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:47.039> getting<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.399> full

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
you're really getting that full

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.240 
you're really getting that full
experience<00:01:48.869> when<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.289> come<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.920> natural

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
it was a 3.5 all the time a lot of times

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.670 
it was a 3.5 all the time a lot of times
with<00:02:14.480> cell<00:02:14.720> phones<00:02:14.960> you<00:02:15.110> regulate<00:02:15.350> those

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
with cell phones you regulate those

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.650 
with cell phones you regulate those
weird<00:02:16.130> adapters<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.240> have<00:02:17.360> too<00:02:17.510> late

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
weird adapters and you have too late

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.170 
weird adapters and you have too late
yeah<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.260> that's<00:02:18.560> with<00:02:18.980> ours<00:02:19.370> yeah<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.940> way<00:02:20.090> it

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
yeah so that's with ours yeah the way it

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.400 
yeah so that's with ours yeah the way it
works<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.570> there's<00:02:20.840> actually<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.140> really<00:02:21.290> cool

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.560 
works and there's actually a really cool
reason<00:02:21.740> behind<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:23.060> plug<00:02:23.300> in<00:02:23.480> your

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570

ericssion<00:02:25.550> connector<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.510> then<00:02:26.810> it's<00:02:26.960> got<00:02:27.200> a

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
ericssion connector and then it's got a
