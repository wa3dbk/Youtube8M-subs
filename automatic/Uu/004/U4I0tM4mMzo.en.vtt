00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
2005 it was a venture for us because the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.090 
2005 it was a venture for us because the
format<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.940> new<00:00:36.290> but<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.500> market<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.949> the

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
rice and we were convinced that this

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.150 
rice and we were convinced that this
concept<00:00:42.000> will<00:00:42.420> pay<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:43.080> and<00:00:43.500> attract<00:00:43.949> many

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
investing right many ordinary people now

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.470 
investing right many ordinary people now
feel<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.180> something<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:26.090> wrong<00:02:27.090> with<00:02:27.330> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
feel that something is wrong with the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.060

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.450 
much and keep do not keep their words
and<00:02:36.060> they<00:02:36.240> know<00:02:36.420> they<00:02:36.630> will<00:02:36.780> sooner<00:02:37.200> or<00:02:37.260> later

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
and they know they will sooner or later

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.160 
and they know they will sooner or later
destroy<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.580> paper<00:02:38.760> currencies<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.020> they

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
destroy the paper currencies and so they

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.500 
destroy the paper currencies and so they
have<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> feeling<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.920> something<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.510> it's

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
have a feeling that something is it's

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.620 
have a feeling that something is it's
not<00:02:42.690> good<00:02:42.960> and<00:02:43.170> they<00:02:43.500> are<00:02:43.800> not<00:02:44.010> told<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.360> truth

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
not good and they are not told the truth

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.200 
not good and they are not told the truth
and<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.770> they<00:02:46.890> move<00:02:47.100> into<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.520> precious

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
and so they move into the precious

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.860 
and so they move into the precious
metals<00:02:48.620> this<00:02:49.620> market<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.220> moving<00:02:50.550> out<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.420> its

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
metals this market is moving out of its

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.100 
metals this market is moving out of its
own<00:02:52.170> it's<00:02:52.830> it's<00:02:53.510> started<00:02:54.510> moving<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:54.930> you

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
own it's it's started moving and you

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.190 
own it's it's started moving and you
don't<00:02:55.350> need<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:56.820> do<00:02:57.000> much<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:57.480> running<00:02:57.930> it's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
don't need to do much it's running it's

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.200 
don't need to do much it's running it's
like<00:02:58.290> it's<00:02:58.650> noble<00:02:59.010> running<00:02:59.430> down<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.030> hill

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
like it's noble running down the hill

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.200 
like it's noble running down the hill
and<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:00.930> becoming<00:03:01.380> bigger<00:03:01.650> every<00:03:01.920> year

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
and it's becoming bigger every year

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.140 
and it's becoming bigger every year
so<00:03:03.210> if<00:03:03.990> you<00:03:04.230> talk<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.800> people<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.340> give<00:03:05.640> him<00:03:05.880> a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
so if you talk to people and give him a

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.150 
so if you talk to people and give him a
little<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:07.910> little<00:03:08.910> idea<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.720> think<00:03:09.930> about<00:03:10.290> the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
little a little idea to think about the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.310 
little a little idea to think about the
financial<00:03:11.370> system<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.360> if<00:03:12.810> they<00:03:12.990> start

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
financial system and if they start

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.980 
financial system and if they start
thinking<00:03:13.590> about<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.280> then<00:03:14.850> many<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.840> them

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
thinking about that then many of them

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.070 
thinking about that then many of them
really<00:03:16.530> get<00:03:16.740> it<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.270> start<00:03:18.270> if<00:03:18.570> they<00:03:18.840> haven't

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
really get it and start if they haven't

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.140 
really get it and start if they haven't
done<00:03:19.200> yet<00:03:19.380> started<00:03:19.950> by<00:03:20.070> approach<00:03:20.430> metals<00:03:20.940> I

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
done yet started by approach metals I
