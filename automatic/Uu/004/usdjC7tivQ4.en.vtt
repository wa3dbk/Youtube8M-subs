all<00:00:37.240> the<00:00:37.330> people<00:00:37.720> clearly<00:00:38.350> they<00:00:38.590> thought<00:00:38.830> the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
all the people clearly they thought the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.220 
all the people clearly they thought the
introduction<00:00:39.520> of<00:00:39.610> that<00:00:39.850> into<00:00:40.270> black<00:00:40.870> ops<00:00:41.050> was

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
introduction of that into black ops was

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.890 
introduction of that into black ops was
a<00:00:41.320> good<00:00:41.470> idea<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:43.060> Allen<00:00:43.270> kept<00:00:43.510> all<00:00:43.750> the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
a good idea but the Allen kept all the

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.840 
a good idea but the Allen kept all the
ideas<00:00:44.260> from<00:00:44.410> black<00:00:44.650> ops<00:00:44.890> for<00:00:45.100> example<00:00:45.610> the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
ideas from black ops for example the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.120 
ideas from black ops for example the
currency<00:00:46.810> system<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.380> cod<00:00:47.560> points<00:00:47.980> they're

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
currency system the cod points they're

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.820 
currency system the cod points they're
not<00:00:48.280> keeping<00:00:48.520> in<00:00:48.970> modern<00:00:49.330> warfare<00:00:49.540> 3<00:00:49.750> and<00:00:50.290> so

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
not keeping in modern warfare 3 and so

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.230 
not keeping in modern warfare 3 and so
from<00:00:51.070> that<00:00:51.100> I<00:00:51.280> think<00:00:51.370> you<00:00:51.640> can<00:00:51.790> tell<00:00:52.060> that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
from that I think you can tell that

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.000 
from that I think you can tell that
they're<00:00:52.420> quite<00:00:52.660> keen<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.230> change<00:00:53.650> the<00:00:53.830> game

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
they're quite keen to change the game

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.470 
they're quite keen to change the game
quite<00:00:54.340> a<00:00:54.370> lot<00:00:54.640> because<00:00:54.940> quite<00:00:55.240> a<00:00:55.300> lot<00:00:55.450> of

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
quite a lot because quite a lot of

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.180 
quite a lot because quite a lot of
people<00:00:55.780> weren't<00:00:55.960> happy<00:00:56.230> with<00:00:56.440> black<00:00:56.710> ops<00:00:56.980> and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
people weren't happy with black ops and

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.069 
people weren't happy with black ops and
the<00:00:57.250> way<00:00:57.340> it<00:00:57.400> turned<00:00:57.490> out<00:00:57.910> so<00:00:58.540> split-screen

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
the way it turned out so split-screen

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.810 
the way it turned out so split-screen

apparently it's called bomb this is a

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.719 
apparently it's called bomb this is a
just<00:01:11.140> rumors<00:01:11.590> from<00:01:11.710> somebody<00:01:12.249> you<00:01:12.280> apparently

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
just rumors from somebody you apparently

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.800

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
broke into the car XP event early and

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.660 
broke into the car XP event early and
stole<00:01:16.810> some<00:01:17.020> well<00:01:17.560> took<00:01:17.859> some<00:01:18.100> pictures<00:01:18.310> of

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
stole some well took some pictures of

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.120

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
some of the game modes in the maps and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.910 
some of the game modes in the maps and
so<00:01:21.729> it's<00:01:21.999> not<00:01:22.149> being<00:01:22.329> confirmed<00:01:22.780> yet<00:01:23.139> but<00:01:23.170> a

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
so it's not being confirmed yet but a

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.800 
so it's not being confirmed yet but a
lot<00:01:24.219> of<00:01:24.249> people<00:01:24.670> are<00:01:24.819> saying<00:01:25.030> that<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:25.329> is<00:01:25.450> true

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
lot of people are saying that it is true

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.279 
lot of people are saying that it is true
so<00:01:26.049> maybe<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.649> 32<00:01:27.369> play<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.700> multiplayer<00:01:27.969> mode<00:01:28.600> so

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
so maybe a 32 play a multiplayer mode so

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.349 
so maybe a 32 play a multiplayer mode so
that's<00:01:30.039> something<00:01:30.429> we<00:01:30.639> aren't<00:01:30.850> really<00:01:30.939> seen

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
that's something we aren't really seen

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.660 
that's something we aren't really seen
it's<00:01:31.630> kind<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.139> like<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.409> battlefield<00:01:32.829> bringing

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
it's kind of like a battlefield bringing

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.669 
it's kind of like a battlefield bringing
in<00:01:33.789> more<00:01:34.119> of<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.329> players<00:01:34.689> it's<00:01:35.439> obviously

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
in more of the players it's obviously

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.559 
in more of the players it's obviously
going<00:01:35.889> to<00:01:35.950> allow<00:01:36.369> you<00:01:36.429> to<00:01:36.579> work<00:01:36.939> in<00:01:37.149> teams<00:01:37.359> a

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
going to allow you to work in teams a

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.029 
going to allow you to work in teams a
lot<00:01:37.719> better<00:01:37.869> so<00:01:38.289> it<00:01:38.350> will<00:01:38.439> be<00:01:38.469> interesting<00:01:38.530> to

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
lot better so it will be interesting to

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.219 
lot better so it will be interesting to
see<00:01:39.249> whether<00:01:39.429> that's<00:01:39.729> in<00:01:39.999> or<00:01:40.179> not<00:01:40.389> and<00:01:40.600> still
